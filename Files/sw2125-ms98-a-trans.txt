 okay uh you want to start by telling me what camping is to you do you backpack or hike or well uh a little bit uh nothing nothing overly strenuous no the majority of my camping experience is uh a tent by the lake type situation or uh maybe a canoe trip or something like that no i ve never done a canoe trip that sounds interesting oh it it s we ve had a lot of fun uh i i moved to Dallas about five years ago and we ve made three different trips since i ve been here the group of friends that i run around with of varying degrees uh of difficulty the the last one we did and we haven t had a chance to duplicate was uh was a canoe trip in Arkansas and the river was it was up about three feet so it was uh it was pretty it was pretty challenging i imagine but uh and then we uh as far as the camping part of that we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and uh find uh find a clearing in the woods and go for it so they ll actually fit in the canoe and then you go for days at a time well yeah yeah it s the that that particular one was a two day trip so what uh uh there s uh there s a outfitter and uh they haul you up to the headwaters come down about halfway and then you get to you spend the night and then uh the second day head on down to the to the pool at the end of the river God that sounds like fun yeah it it really is well the camping i grew up with was like tents and Coleman stove type and uh you know that just either out in the woods or actually i i grew up water skiing i was uh from California and so we would go up to the Sacramento uh river sloughs the delta there okay okay and you just pick a campground on the river if it got you know over a hundred and ten degrees you went over the levee and jumped in the water right right you know cooled off but uh when i got married my husband had always backpacked and so we did that uh okay i guess that we haven t done it since my kids were born so about three years ago and that was a new experience to me but i enjoyed it i like being able to go back up into the mountains or you know where the trail didn t necessarily lead and where you couldn t necessarily pitch a tent boy i bet yeah uh huh but uh that that was interesting i i have always wanted to do some white water rafting and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that yeah that s that was uh that s always been our next step our our our little group of friends here we ve we ve been kind of getting married off and what not but uh that s don t let that stop you yeah that well it it it just puts a damper on things for a little while but we re we re starting to get everybody back together yeah we d like to do a float trip down uh oh like Big Bend area or something like that i know yeah so you haven t done that before no no we haven t made that trip yet my parents uh were sailing uh this last year down off uh Costa Rica and they took about two weeks and went into i don t even know the name of the river there but they went white water rafting and Mom said it was absolutely just a wonderful experience she said it was truly incredible i ll bet yeah and you know i there s that sense of it you know you re kind of scared that risk of like gosh what could happen and then the thrill of you know the excitement of doing it uh huh yeah exactly so well do you have anything planned for this summer um not really just yet we ve uh well i i do have uh a little bit of property i grew up in South Dakota oh okay and i ve got a piece of property in Minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet there s uh there s a little lake up there and uh a group of friends that i i went to college with um got together and we basically own all the land around this little lake there it s divided up into ten lots oh so we ve got a private lake and it s completely undeveloped at this point so that s a possibility and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime it it s it s about two hours north of Minneapolis i imagine oh that doesn t that sounds good so uh yeah in fact uh uh well i got married last summer and uh that s that s we ended up there for a couple days uh on our honeymoon we kind of took uh a tour of the United States for about a week that sounds and uh up through that area but uh my wife s real excited about it so we re uh we re going to hope to get up there sometime early enough last year it was the end of July and it was a little too late for the fish but uh hopefully get up there early enough to to get into some of the some of the fish and uh the the good weather and what not we ve been wanting to start camping again this year too uh my oldest child is a girl was born three years ago three and a half and then i have a little one that just turned two and we are in the process of potty training i didn t want to go camping with diapers uh huh oh gosh yeah yeah you know i and and you know at a time when they re afraid of their shadow all they need is you know some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent they d be awake all night that s right so but i think with him almost potty trained and you know she s not afraid of her shadow anymore that i m i m hoping and crossing my fingers that we ll be able to go uh this summer you know even if it s like over to Rio Dosa for a couple of days or something to get them used to it and get them started uh sure with little back packs of their own and you know things like that right you bet yeah we ll that you know and there s a lot of places with uh like nature trails things like that where they could learn a lot too that s just uh huh well that s true you know it s like okay this this is this is what uh a pheasant looks like you know and okay now we ll go look for one and that kind of thing that ugh i would need that before i could teach them well yeah that s everybody everybody might learn something that way but uh but yeah that s there isn t there s an awful lot of things set up you know just any anything you want to do like like you say it can be uh a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing or there s a lot of different opportunities for things like that it s a lot of fun it really is hello
