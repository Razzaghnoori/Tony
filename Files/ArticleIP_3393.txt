 The Vine posted Wednesday Sept 24 To hear Robert Pinsky read The Vine click The term phallocentric finds one of its more ludicrously explicit instances in Robert Herrick s funny little poem about a wet dream In contrast to contemporary writing about sex however the 17 th century poet Herrick does not really put the male organ or any organ at the center of his poem for him imagination both erotic imagination and literary imagination is central He smiles a little mockingly but affectionately at his own body The helplessness of Lucia in this fantasy and the idea of Bacchus ravisht by his tree may make us uneasy on feminist grounds but the corrective reality of the last line the physical fact of the helpless erection corrects and undermines the imagination s unreal fantasy of domination The reality sunnily undermines the preposterous fantasy Herrick s poem is a loose translation of a piece by the ancient Greek poet Anacreon The quality of civilization and civilization accepting that it is made of and by the human body laughing at that body fondly putting it in its place is part of what makes the poem interesting and appealing Robert Pinsky I dream d this mortal part of mineWas Metamorphoz d to a Vine Which crawling one and every wayEnthralled my dainty Lucia Me thought her long small legs thighsI with my Tendrils did surprize Her Belly Buttocks and her WasteBy my soft Nerv lits were embrac d About her head I writhing hung And with rich clusters hid amongThe leaves her temples I behung So that my Lucia seem d to meYoung Bacchus ravisht by his tree My curles about her neck did craule And armes and hands they did enthrall So that she could not freely stir All parts there made one prisoner But when I crept with leaves to hideThose parts which maids keep unespy d Such fleeting pleasures there I took That with the fancie I awook And found Ah me this flesh of mineMore like a Stock than like a Vine
