 We re All One Worlders Now Back when I first joined the ranks of one worlders more than a decade ago we were an easy species to describe earnest well meaning and hopelessly naive We envisioned an eventual era of global peace a time when nationalism had lost its edge and nation states had surrendered some sovereignty to global forums like the United Nations or even a true World Parliament This fuzzy idealism earned us the moniker woolly minded one worlders as well as the often correct stereotype that we were raving lefties But then came the 1990s With the Cold War over and economic globalization accelerating the ideological map went topsy turvy Suddenly books giddily proclaiming The Twilight of Sovereignty were being written not by the beads and sandals crowd but by capitalists former Citibank head Walter Wriston in the case of that title Meanwhile less enthusiastic tracts with ominous titles like One World Ready or Not were being written by raving lefties William Greider who now saw the withering of the nation state as deeply problematic While this new debate rages though one worldism marches on We may never get to the World Parliament phase But the migration of governance from the national to the supranational level is proceeding apace in lots of little but ultimately momentous ways If this fact were more widely appreciated globalization might get a warmer reception on the left The reason left and right seem to have traded places over one worldism is that the term has more than one meaning Old school one worlders e g Woodrow Wilson were concerned mainly with peace The aspect of the nation state they most wanted to constrain was aggression What excites people like Wriston and Newt Gingrich is the constraint placed on a nation s domestic policies by worldwide capitalism Global bond markets punish national governments that splurge on safety nets Global labor markets punish nations with a high minimum wage or costly environmental standards One world now means a single planetary market that can sweep away national policies designed in a simpler era to blunt the market s sharp edges Hence the sudden provincialism of liberals Supranational bodies like the World Trade Organization and NAFTA are seen as mere lubricants of laissez faire And for now at least they indeed are little more than that Still even the new one worldism ought to hold some appeal for believers in the old version like me for three reasons First remember world peace You know the mushy ideal that got us laughed off the stage in the first place Supranational bodies are its friend In the recent book War Before Civilization Lawrence Keeley observes that trade by itself is not inherently pacifying Indeed the dependence it creates can be volatile Witness Japan s testy response on Dec 7 1941 to the United States cutting off oil exports But as Keeley also notes when international tribunals exist to resolve disputes trade is generally pacifying So the WTO should spell less bloodshed The European Union already does Second remember universal brotherhood You know concern for the world s poor and downtrodden As Paul Krugman recently noted in Slate free trade gives millions of poor people a step up the ladder Yes that may mean working in a sweatshop But these people manifestly prefer that to their prior condition It may come as a shock to some suburban American liberals but for children in Pakistan the alternative to stitching Reebok soccer balls is not being driven to soccer practice in a Volvo station wagon It s deeper poverty Third even leaving lofty universalism aside international trade organizations can help promote a liberal agenda domestically In Britain the left supports the European Union and the right doesn t One reason is that the EU meddles in national affairs with intrusive lefty regulation Maybe the Tories are right that some of the regulation is excessive but much of it isn t And anyway my point is just that a supranational trade body can in principle be supported by and thus be shaped by a center left coalition rather than a center right coalition Consider NAFTA It passed on a center right coalition and reflects that fact But it s not beyond change For negotiations to admit Chile President Clinton wants a reluctant Congress to authorize him to include labor and environmental accords So if Clinton sticks to his guns a big if and prevails we may have a new and improved NAFTA It could say impose stricter environmental standards on Mexico and Chile and give Mexican and Chilean workers the right to bargain collectively Both provisions would raise Latin American labor costs and thus dull NAFTA s adverse effect on some low wage American workers In essence this approach would use political globalization to to a slightly less jarring pace It is strange that so many of those most offended by globalization call themselves progressives Early this century the progressives were people who realized that communications and transportation technologies were pushing the scope of economic activity outward from individual states to the United States as a whole They responded by pushing economic regulation from the state to the federal level The analogous leap today is from national to supranational regulation Yet many of today s progressives are economic nationalists viewing unilateral tariffs as the policy tool of choice Evolutionary psychology tells us that economic intercourse is about as deeply ingrained in the human brain as any other form of intercourse If you doubt this read Matt Ridley s excellent new book The Origins of Virtue That s one reason the ever expanding scope of economic activity is essentially a force of nature it can be guided it can be slowed but it can t realistically be stopped The original progressives chose to swim with this basic current of history Many of today s progressives are swimming against it Still globalization is willy nilly turning even progressives into de facto one worlders Witness the new anti sweatshop consortium featuring Nike Liz Claiborne Kathie Lee Gifford et al It sets minimally humane working conditions that foreign factories must meet if their products are to sport a No Sweat label And it arose not out of the goodness of Nike CEO Phil Knight s heart but to keep left wing nongovernmental organizations especially progressive ones off his back The of supranational NGO lobbying in general is analyzed by Jessica Mathews in the January February Foreign Affairs Thus the old left intentionally or not is pushing us from national regulation to supranational regulation albeit in this case a kind of private sector supranational regulation In a way the one world battle is over Once you exclude fringe elements on both sides Ralph Nader and Pat Buchanan basically both Democrats and Republicans accept the reality of NAFTA and the WTO even as they argue about whether these bodies should include environmental and labor laws la the EU Thus the existence of supranational bodies with significant functions of governance is no longer the issue Mainstream conservatives sure aren t complaining about the WTO s power to penalize countries that fail to open their telecommunications to foreign investment The issue rather is the perennial issue whether governance will be to the right or the left In that sense we re all one worlders now In fact we re all one worlders even in the old beads and sandals sense Well almost all As this column is posted the Senate is poised to vote on the Chemical Weapons Convention CWC opponents may muster the 34 votes needed to prevent a two thirds ratification vote thanks to the earnest but clueless Jesse Helms and two of the most rabidly reactionary institutions in politics today the Wall Street Journal s editorial page and a reptilian Cold War vestige called the Center for Security Policy Even so the fact remains that this unprecedentedly strong form of global arms control the sort of thing peacenik hippies could only dream about a decade ago now commands mainstream support all Senate Democrats around half of all Senate Republicans Presidents Clinton Carter Ford and Bush and for all we know Reagan In the old days liberals wanted peace and conservatives wanted law and order a nice stable environment for commerce Many of the CWC s Republican supporters are people who realize that in the modern world where neither commerce nor terrorism knows national boundaries peace is order
