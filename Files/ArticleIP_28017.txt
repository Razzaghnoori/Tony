 Thinking Outside the Box Office Except in Japan the world economic crisis seems to have gone into at least temporary remission and those who have been obsessing about the subject are turning their attention back to other matters In my case that means making a big push on my introductory economics textbook in progress And so a little while ago I found myself redrafting the chapters on yes supply and demand Now my textbook is a labor of love but it is also a commercial venture or at least I and my publisher hope it is So the first draft was tested on a focus group people who are successful teachers of introductory economics at the sort of schools we hope will adopt the book I learned a lot from the focus group Among other things I learned that what a middle aged college professor thinks of as down to earth examples of economics in action might not always sound quite so down to earth to the ordinary college freshman and that I had to have more examples the clientele could relate to which means in particular sports One focus group member suggested that the market for scalped sports tickets was a good example of supply and demand in action So I did some background research and found some very interesting stuff But perhaps it is an indicator of my state of mind that what I saw during that research made me think once again about Ticket scalping is nothing new though it continues to pose something of an economic puzzle The fact is that there are a number of public events most notably sports but also concerts plays museum shows etc for which tickets are consistently sold below the price that would limit demand to the available supply Exactly why the owners of stadiums and theaters do this is a matter of some dispute One theory due to Chicago economist Gary Becker is that tickets are underpriced because those who sell them believe that it is crucial to their image to have sold out houses Beyond this many stadium and theater owners seem to believe that as an overall marketing strategy it is important that access to their most popular events be available to enthusiasts at moderate prices For example why doesn t George Lucas allow theaters to offer special preview showings of The Phantom Menace at astronomical galactic prices when surely they could find tens or even hundreds of thousands of people able and willing to pay Presumably because so blatant a statement that wealth hath its privileges would alienate the tens of millions of nonwealthy moviegoers he counts on to turn the film into a megahit Whatever the precise reasoning what is clear is that when it comes to big games and big shows private sector entrepreneurs themselves often feel that it is a bad idea to let market forces rule Enter the scalpers If they can scalpers will buy up large numbers of tickets directly from the box office and resell them at a profit If the box office refuses to sell in bulk they will offer to buy spare tickets from people who have come by them legitimately and perhaps hire people to stand in line What s wrong with that Well the people who run the box office are attempting to pursue social goals albeit in the ultimate name of profit which require that tickets go not only to those who can afford to pay a lot but also to those who really care and are willing to book early and or stand in line If tickets sell out long in advance not to enthusiasts but to speculators or if the long lines consist not of dedicated fans but of hired proxies this attempt to pursue a long term agenda is defeated And so there is a running conflict between the long run thinking represented by the box offices and the short run market forces represented by scalpers a conflict that seems increasingly to be running in the scalpers favor Why does scalping seem ever harder to control One reason is that because of the rising inequality of income and wealth there are more people out there able and willing to pay extraordinary sums This is above all true in New York where there are thousands of people who will not blanch at paying 10 000 to see and be seen at a Knicks game But scalping is also on the rise because of an interaction between technology and ideology It s clear that technology has made scalping much more efficient than in the past Once upon a time it was a hands on business Shady characters would hang around stadiums offering to buy tickets at a premium or to sell them at an even larger premium Those shady characters are still there but you can also look up big ticket brokers on the Web call their 800 numbers and comfortably conduct your transaction from home or office This makes it easy for the out of town visitor to line up tickets for that special evening or for the hard driving executive to impress his clients It also means that everyone who has bought a ticket at the box office knows that the true cost of going to the show is not the sum he actually paid but the much larger sum he could make by reselling that ticket Still the technology would not be as effective as it is were it not for a favorable ideological climate While there are anti scalping laws in many places such as New York City there are also a growing number of places such as New Jersey that believe in letting the market rip and therefore allow tickets to be freely resold at any price And given modern communications technology New Yorkers need not physically visit New Jersey to do an end run around the local regulations And so the pressure on box offices steadily intensifies Box offices do fight back A couple years ago Madison Square Garden discovering that many of its season ticket holders were reselling them to brokers revoked thousands of tickets in a stroke And the people spending weeks in line to see The Phantom Menace are as far as anyone knows genuine fanatics rather than hirelings Still it is hard to escape the feeling that these are rear guard actions We seem to be heading for a future in which the crowd at a Knicks game will consist mainly of businessmen on expense accounts and so the management of Madison Square Garden fears a longer term future in which serious Knicks fans finding that they can t afford tickets lose interest and therefore so do the businessmen Short run market pressures may eventually leave everyone worse off and yet they seem to be getting harder and harder to defy which brings me to global finance To my mind at least there is a sort of family resemblance between the phenomenon of ticket scalping and the problem of hot money flows in the world economy In both cases there is some efficiency case to be made in their favor Ticket scalping does allow some people who badly want to see a game or show to do so Short term capital flows do sometimes provide badly needed finance or liquidity In both cases however there are also costs whether to the social mix that sustains a team s fan base or to the macroeconomic stability that sustains long term economic growth Stadium owners have judged these costs to be large enough to warrant serious attempts to limit scalping and given the experience of the last two years you don t have to be an anti market fanatic to argue that some limits on hot money would also be a good thing if feasible But the trouble is that between technology that makes it easier for markets to run rings around local regulations and the reluctance of governments to agree on the sort of cross border enforcement that might let them keep up with that technology efforts to limit the market Oh mavericks such as George Lucas or Malaysia s Prime Minister Mahathir bin Muhammad may try to fight the trend and even achieve some limited success but they are swimming against the tide Indeed as this article was being written Lucas under intense pressure from theater owners gave in to the dark side of market forces Some tickets to The Phantom Menace will indeed be sold in advance and no doubt be snapped up by scalpers
