                 how do you uh manage your budget   well lets see we or i sit down at the        uh in a on a monthly or a biweekly i get paid every two weeks so i make out a budget for every two weeks and i sit down and see how much money i have to have for my bills going out and then i compare that to uh how much money we need to make and then just set it up that way and allot this much money for everything and if we have any left over well uh you know buy clothes or have fun go out to eat or something and were going to try to start saving as soon as we can we generally dont have a lot left over but as far as the long term our longterm goal is to to get out of debt   umhum   and uh most most of our debts are from before we were married and were trying to get rid of you know student loans those kinds of things   yeah well i in my younger years id always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford   umhum   uh because of the uh improvement in real estate prices and on the last move we bought ourselves a fairly large house and ive got some pretty stiff mortgage payments now   yeah   and uh the uh improvement in uh income and uh investments and so forth has not uh come at the rate ive expected so were still kind of hurting by the uh high mortgage payments and we havent gotten out from under them yet   yeah   but uh so far weve managed to hold our own by uh trying to set up a a monthly budget   yeah   uh i try to take out just so much cash for me and my uh give so much cash to my wife   umhum   to spend on groceries and clothing and fuel for the car and then the rest of its uh pretty much fixed expenses uh mortgage electricity uh water and uh and garbage collection and telephone bills and cable television bills and those are pretty much fixed   yeah yeah thats basically the kinds of bills we have are on our budget are you know the needs the have to haves and you know those kinds of things uh we dont have a lot of uh you know like JC Pennys in our  in our budget and uh maybe twice a year were to where i can let my wife go clothes shopping like that and   yeah   lets see my motherinlaw lives uh not too far from here so she helps with our sons clothes when she can   umhum   and thats real good and uh well at TI i have a real good benefits package for uh uh you know like for going to the doctor and that kind of thing so thats not something i really have to put in the budget that seriously so   yeah no my wifes pretty good about uh grocery shopping and   yeah   she pitches in and uh makes clothes for the kids   really well thats neat   uh which is a big help uh one of our big problems though is handling unexpected uh uh budget items   yeah   like this month the uh heat pump went out and uh   um yeah   they want pretty close to three thousand dollars just to replace that   wow so what do you do   well uh we have to cut into the savings uh at this point to uh to buffer that   oh wow   and   well thats good that you have the savings to get into      then maybe well go for a week or two and or a month or two and then the car breaks down       so its the unexpected things that make it awful hard to control the budget   wow yeah thats thats the way we are weve had a lot of unexpected things just in the last uh couple months   yeah   that uh really hit us hard but ive been able to work enough overtime to you know really help with the with covering the expenses so but weve never been weve been married for uh nearly four years and weve never been able to save any money and i think its just hit both of us uh just in the past few months that we need to start saving some money no matter what we do we need to put that in our budget and just start doing it   yeah   even if its you know ten dollars a week and so were going to start doing that or actually we started two paychecks ago and that was uh i think that was a really wise decision   well do you have some uh savings plans at work   no actually im im not involved in anything like that at work or uh anywhere uh i dont have anything to fall back on at all   yeah   and i i know thats not wise but thats just uh where were at right now my wife just went back to work parttime uh she can substitute teach at schools and uh theres so many school districts and schools here in the metroplex that uh by turning her name in if she wanted to she could work   yeah   you know everyday but were were just going to let her work one maybe two days a week and were just going to apply all the money that she makes to uh uh our debts and try to get as much out of debt as fast we can   yeah umhum   and theres and were were Christians and thats uh weve only been Christians for about five years but thats a a real a biblical truth in the Bible is to to not be in debt and were really starting to see the the the reasoning behind that   umhum   and uh because were you know were always well i cant be sick this week but one day   yeah   or you know this month but one day because you know our bills will catch up with us if i am or you know i cant we cant go on a two week vacation because uh i wouldnt make any overtime in two weeks so that would really hurt us financially and you know just things like that all time and you know we we really see how were   umhum   you know indebted or nearly underneath uh the debt that we have   yeah   you know and thats thats really hard but so far weve never really uh been behind on any bills uh i had to put our student loans on hold once for about i think three months   umhum   and we had a a cutback at work and uh this is this was a couple of years back but anyway but were doing really good were not saving but were staying right even   well weve been looking around at uh uh trying to develop some side activities that that might help out such as uh creating some craft objects that we can market in the uh local stores   oh yeah   or uh uh making uh some dresses for children or things l ike that or even writing childrens books   yeah thats neat oh thats neat yeah   and uh        i tried uh this past year writing uh journal articles but uh i found out it cost me more than the the honorariums i got for writing them   wow oh wow because of the time   uh well especially the first one because i wound up buying a lot of reprints for handouts and i ate up all my profits with uh   wow right   buying reprints   right wow yeah my my wife made uh a whole lot of crafts last year for Christmas presents   umhum   and we didnt uh you know have to allot any well hardly very very much money anyway for Christmas just for our uh personal family just me and her and our son and i think her mom and that was really you know about it we we made everything else that uh we gave for Christmas last year   umhum yeah   and she did really good with that   oh we thought we were going to be pretty tight with Christmas this past year   umhum   but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the childrens toys so coming up to Christmas time  the girls didnt have any toys so we had to go out and   oh wow wow oh no   and get them a whole new set of playthings   wow      now i dont know how the dog has fared eating all that plastic and uh and stuffed animal stuffing but  hes still here     wow wow thats pretty pretty bizarre  the dog ate the Christmas presents thats funny well anyway what uh is the economy doing pretty good there where youre at   so far its uh doing fairly well uh were in the metropolitan Washington area and uh i guess most of the area is still living off the federal government with uh beltway bandit type contracts uh our company is uh done fairly well   umhum   and uh   yeah what company is it   im with the Melpar division of ESystems   oh of ESystems okay   yeah   i see what do you all make   uh were primarily in the uh uh systems integrations business   oh   selling to the government
