 Wise Guys Annoying Gals Dear Biggie Wait a frigging second could you please explain to me the phallic symbolism of herring Herring in cream sauce maybe but regular old herring Again Judith too many thoughts I don t know where to begin with you Oh I know where by telling you I finally get your Judith De Man Shulevitz joke Like De Man the Nazi symp deconstructionist You re pretty funny for an intellectual Let me repeat that last part for an intellectual Dept of Mortifying Amplification I finally got the joke because someone explained it to me OK you explained it to me Let s never talk about this again I hate you comp lit people May I make one observation There is way too much hype now about this show Did you see the cover of TV Guide The cast is all there and they re on the cover of Entertainment Weekly and they re in Vanity Fair and the newsweeklies ad infinitum This is crazy already I feel the backlash beginning OK I don t like Richie Aprile the new thug on the block precisely because he s such a malevolent thug at least so far yeah he s a bit New Agey but his whole yoga shtick feels forced as if the writers decided that each and every character had to be a member of the sensitive slightly feminized postmodern mob I think it s dangerous for The Sopranos to introduce an ongoing character who s flat out bad Though I guess that Mikey Palmice Junior s now dead henchman filled that role last season All malevolence all the time as you put it is fine for Casino think Joe Pesci but in The Sopranos The joy of The Sopranos is that all these bad ass gangsters are possessed of some complicating goodness or at least some kind of benign dream of a better life But don t get me wrong I much prefer the addition of a flat out gangster to the cast than yet another annoying woman uh oh am I in trouble now By annoying I am referring to Tony s sister who is with us for the entire season apparently Talk about a drag on the show It s funny in advance of today s discussion I wanted to watch Episodes 2 and 3 again but I couldn t bring myself to do it They bored me and I realized that it was Tony s sister who bored me the most Man they should have killed off Livia when they had the chance and that way they wouldn t have to saddle us with her dreary daughter Don t get wrong I do enjoy the story lines that don t deal directly with people getting whacked and I could watch Edie Falco who plays Tony s wife spend 10 hours reading the phone book To herself I could even watch her in the execrable Oz in which she plays a prison guard How could HBO simultaneously make a show as good as The Sopranos and as bad as Oz Here s the thing Generally speaking I like my mob movies straight up male I still don t understand what Diane Keaton is doing in The Godfather not to mention Sofia Coppola in III I love Tony s crew and I love mob intrigue But David Chase has made Tony s relationship with his wife so interesting and at least in the first season made Tony s relationship with his mother so appalling that I don t generally fall asleep when the Soprano women are on screen I know you think I m some kind of misogynist now yes As for Melfi I ve always had mixed feelings about her She is at the center of the story of course without her Tony would be unredeemed and dead Maybe I don t like the character because Lorraine Bracco is a bit of a stiff I don t know I m a simple guy I d rather watch Silvo and Paulie Walnuts and Pussy and Tony shoot pool and gripe and plot to kill people and I d rather watch Hesh scheme and Christopher explode than watch Lorraine Bracco act On the subject of Italian Americans and their gripes about The Sopranos et al I m with you thought I must admit Merchant of Venice ain t my all time favorite Who wrote that piece of shit anyway Your friend de Man I grew up in a Spike Lee movie Italians needled the Irish who beat up the Jews who harassed the blacks well not really and so on I like ethnic humor Besides I have a theory about America s fascination with Italian criminals said fascination is merely an extension of the world s love for everything Italian culture opera food art architecture It s all of a piece At least this is what I tell Italian Americans who write me incredibly nasty letters when my mob stories appear By the way since when do I have Hasidic friends God what do you think of me Oh A mook is kind of like a gavone which is kind of like an Italian schmuck Jeff
