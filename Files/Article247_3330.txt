 Talk Party Talk If you stand directly in front of the Statue of Liberty at once shorter and kitschier yet at the same time somehow grander than you expect it to be there s a tree dotted sward to the right facing lower Manhattan of approximately football field dimensions but kidney shaped In front of the sward there s a promenade and a railing with a battery of those coin operated heavy metal binoculars looking like silver alien heads perched on metal stalks and doing the usual truly mediocre job of magnifying things Cataractic and tunnel visioned those things are always disappointing and last night with the brilliant megalithic skyline laid out before you in even greater and crisper grandeur than usual with planes blinking their bright lighted way toward JFK and LGA with private and commercial boats plying the dark sparkling waters of New York Harbor you didn t need any kind of visual aid to be impressed with the view And when you turned around to see the party The Party you must give it its due you were nearly as impressed in a different way At least I was and one of the main ways I being a meteorologically preoccupied fellow was impressed was with the party s climatological riskiness I ran into Jay Fielden an editor and a writer at The New Yorker and he told me he was doing a piece about the party s designer Robert Isabelle What would have happened if it had rained I asked him Catastrophe Jay said So she just rolled the dice She just rolled the dice She is Tina Brown of course and she rolled a 7 It was a fabulous Tina would say fabbelus night clear and warm with a pleasant breeze animating the multi colored Japanese lanterns depending from the trees Scantily dressed women most of them in black and black clad men lay about drinking wine on huge striped and solid color cushions scattered about in groupings of three or four on the grass or sat at the 30 or so tables beneath the trees In the middle of each the tables was a huge picnic basket in which under cloths folded over in a pastry looking manner were napkins plates silverware and plastic containers filled with corn salad and potato salad and strolling waiters supplemented these dishes with platters of lamb chops and fried chicken Some tables featured big galvanized tubs filled with ice and bottles of white wine columns of bottles of red wine stood in front of the tubs A few of the tubs had 20 or 30 small bottles of Evian nestled in ice The low slate topped wall of the promenade was covered by comfortable cushions and there were long bars in two or three places A stage and temporary dance floor had been constructed behind the statue Generally whatever concept Mr Isabelle had for this party seemed to be working The 1 500 partygoers arrived at South Ferry from about 7 30 p m on The statue was closed to the general public and only party guests were allowed on the two Statue of Liberty ferries that went to the island and came back continuously all night My wife and I boarded the ferry at about 8 30 It would be foolish to drop names they were as plentiful as the lights burning in the World Trade Center which presided over the proceedings like titanic parents When we got off the boat we were ushered along the pier by well ushers A lot of them had headsets on Some motioned us on our way with chartreuse chimneyed flashlights Made me feel like a 747 Tina Brown stood stunningly on the pier illuminated by camera lights in the gathering dusk in a white number and greeted some arrivees individually causing a traffic jam and throwing the headset flashlight crew into frenzied pleading This way please If you ll just step this way Oh well there s no way of avoiding the names In my small clot of people dislodged swardward from the pier were Margaret Carlson ICM agent Esther Newberg and her escort newsman artist John Johnson illustrator author director Lane Smith Buck Henry Tony Schwartz Lane Smith on rounding the bend in front of the statue and seeing the multi colored lanterns said That works for me I mean they could have gone with the fashionably neutral colors white gray maybe tan But this looks good And it really did People were chuckling about the Rome of the Decadence effect of the big lawn bolster recliners Numbers began wafting about on the breezes I d say at least five it has got to be five 750 min Over a mil no question Think of the one night payroll alone and renting the Statue of Liberty One point two I heard that as known fact These zephyr borne estimates went way up after the Grucci fireworks barge floated between Liberty Island and the skyline with an electric sign on it that said Talk did I forget to say that this was Tina Brown s party for her new magazine Talk and hurled into the black sky a literally earth shaking barrage of pyrotechnics The first few were dedicated rockets This one s for Harvey and Bob Weinstein George Plimpton said He knew the names of each of these single shot items A silver flanged fleur de lis he said or something like that A 12 inch golden dragon magnolia The one dedicated to what people throughout the night kept noisomely referring to as Lady Liberty a moniker on the same unacceptability level as The Big Apple came way down on the list She d been privatized for a night I guess Plimpton got lost in his list at one point but despite referring to one of the contributors to the display s soundtrack as Cecille Dion he brought to the event his patrician sonorities and his fabled familiarity with fireworks The finale left no one in the audience in any doubt as to the existence of his or her sternum and ribcage This fireworks 20 minutes was the only 20 minutes during which 25 to 35 percent of the audience was not talking to or hearing from someone who wasn t with them I mean there was the headset crowd coordinating whatever it was they had to coordinate the security crowd with their hearing aid like devices and the cell phone set talking to whom The mainland one guessed In Patton George C Scott as General Patton looks over an imminent battle scene and says something like God help me I do love it so Well PFC Menaker is here to tell you God help me I do love it so Jane Friedman Katrina van den Heuvel her dress had literally no back she looked fabbelus Salman you must say Salman I have heard and how many writers have achieved first name status in our time Maybe Norman but not Thomas or Philip or William or John as far as I can tell Sarah Jessica Parker Pierce Brosnan Todd Solondz Paul Newman Kevin Bacon Kyra Sedgewick etc I had a pen and a piece of paper ready to get Latrell for my son Better be careful not to get him angry Dad but if he was there I didn t see his first name sufficing self These ingredients swirled around each other in a dance of honest enjoyment and or self conscious shoulder rubbing for an hour or so before the toasts from the stage Then came the toasts Queen Latifah featured in Talk s first issue presided asking that we give it up for among others Lady Liberty She was accompanied by a Grucci worthy rap bass on World Trade Center tall woofers and she called to the stage Ron Galotti who made some OK but forgettable remarks and the Teenster herself who said among other things Queen Latifah is the only queen I ll ever have to curtsy to I mean the Statue of Liberty America this is what it s all about Tina says America oddly it s Ameriker or Amerrikeh or something like that She also said at nearly a shriek that the Statue of Liberty was awesome She also thanked Donna Karan for the dress which she said she had to pour herself into Her well crafted remarks also seemed ultimately dwarfed by the setting and by the event she herself had caused to happen One had to hand it to her it was really fun It was undeniably Something Tina s book is called Life s a Party For her I suspect The Party s a life I left at about 11 30 a little blotto On the dock Tina and her husband Harry Evans who was the person who hired me as an editor at Random House and who once demolished me in pingpong in between swimming laps at his health club and I m a pretty good ping pong player were spotted saying hello or goodbye to this luminary or that one I got five minutes face time with my ex boss Tina Brown If I had a hat it would be off to you I said Have you seen it yet she asked I like to think a little plaintively No not yet Putting it to press had its nightmare moments she said Yes people were telling me things about nervous breakdowns and hospitalizations I said But congratulations on the Hillary breakthrough Lucinda Franks worked very very hard to get that she said Well it s a real coup I felt a hand on my shoulder You ll have to swim over there young man my other ex boss Harry Evans said pointing toward the far shore Anyone under 50 has to swim Could you swim that on a bet do you suppose Never I said You re the swimmer I m about as good a swimmer as I am a ping pong player By the way congratulations On what I haven t done anything Um on your book I said Oh that Well yes thanks He hurried off to press a little more flesh Speaking of which It doesn t look to me like you had to pour yourself into that dress I said to Tina the cat just having left She gave her eyes a bat or two Thank you Dahn she said She can be a terrible flirt the good Tina The bad Tina doesn t really belong in this festive setting Even knowing that most of this whole function was all for buzz and hype and advertising and so on I said This was so generous of you Thank you for inviting me Thanks for coming Dahn It is fabbelus isn t it It was back onto the ferry heading toward Manhattan into a still warm breeze My wife and I stood on the foredeck or whatever you call it This is so romantic she said We smooched
