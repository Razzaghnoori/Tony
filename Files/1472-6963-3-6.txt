 Background Since the publication of the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial results demonstrating the efficacy of intense glycemic control using insulin therapy and frequent self monitoring of blood glucose SMBG in improving health outcomes 1 SMBG has become a principal component of diabetes management While the efficacy of self monitoring independent of other self management practices is still uncertain the practice is recommended for patients using either insulin or oral drug therapy 2 As a result managed care organizations MCOs are under increasing pressure to cover the cost of self monitoring equipment 3 and to improve rates of SMBG among their diabetes patients 4 In addition to logistic barriers to SMBG 5 some recent evidence suggests that adult diabetes patients who may be at greatest risk for poor outcomes e g minorities elderly lower SES may be least likely to self monitor 4 6 In a study of more than 44 000 managed care patients with type 1 2 818 and type 2 41 363 diabetes Karter et al 4 identified older age male gender non white race lower socioeconomic status English language difficulty higher out of pocket test strip costs intensity of insulin therapy greater alcohol consumption and smoking as independent predictors of less frequent self monitoring in diabetes patients This study was the first to move beyond simple reporting of descriptive statistics in order to assess predictors of SMBG in managed care settings Unfortunately the validity of the study findings is limited by the reliance on self reports of self monitoring an unreliable measure of actual behavior 7 The purpose of the current study was to examine the relationship between patient characteristics and SMBG in a large health maintenance organization HMO using objective measures of self monitoring practice Specifically we tested the hypothesis that controlling for type of drug therapy and severity of illness diabetes patients at greatest risk for poor health outcomes e g older age multiple chronic conditions non white race lower neighborhood SES are less likely to practice SMBG The study population included more than 4 500 adult managed care patients using insulin oral or a combination of the two drug therapies Our use of objective measures of SMBG distinguishes this study from previous attempts to identify predictors of SMBG in managed care This paper represents the first phase of a larger study to evaluate the effect of distributing free home glucose monitors to diabetes patients at this New England HMO Methods Study Setting and Data Sources Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates HVMA is a multi specialty group practice serving nearly 300 000 people in diverse ethnic and socioeconomic communities in and around Boston Massachusetts At the time of the study nearly all of the patients at HVMA s fourteen health centers were insured in Harvard Pilgrim Health Care HPHC one of the largest HMOs in New England Home glucose monitoring test strips were covered by HPHC and all members had coverage for prescription medications The automated medical records system AMRS at HVMA HPHC captured data from all ambulatory and inpatient encounters between plan members and providers in a combination of both coded and narrative fields The AMRS has been previously used for research purposes 8 9 In addition to AMRS data we mapped patients addresses to census tract information to control for the socioeconomic characteristics of the patient s neighborhood of residence Study Cohort In order to be eligible for inclusion in the study patients had to be at least 18 years old and to have been diagnosed with diabetes or to have received at least one prescription for insulin or an oral sulfonylurea at some time between December 1 1991 and November 30 1993 This study represents the first phase in an evaluation of the implementation of a policy to provide free home glucose monitors to HPHC patients All data for this study were collected from medical records covering the year preceding the policy change 10 1 92 9 30 93 For continuity of the study cohort we included only those patients with no more than 45 days disenrollment between 01 01 92 and 09 30 95 Patients with gestational diabetes were excluded Dependent Variables Our outcomes of interest were the likelihood of any SMBG and regularity of SMBG once initiated Patients were classified as having ever self monitored if they filled at least one prescription for self monitoring test strips during the study period Test strip use has been employed in previous studies as a reliable indicator of actual SMBG in diabetes patients 10 11 12 As only a very small number of patients were using urine test strips to monitor glycemic levels 1 5 we did not include urine testing as a measure of self monitoring Regular SMBG among patients with any test strip use was defined as filling prescriptions for 90 or more test strips per quarter i e testing an average of at least once per day for those using insulin or combination therapy and 45 or more per quarter i e testing an average of at least once every other day for those using oral sulfonylureas only Cut points for regular use were based on dispensing patterns and recent guidelines recommending testing three to four times per day for insulin users and less frequent testing for non insulin users 2 We assumed that test strips were used evenly over the period between test strip dispensings Test strips were prorated over a minimum of 30 days if the next dispensing occurred sooner than that and over a maximum of 60 days if there was no subsequent dispensing during that period Multivariate analyses were limited to patients using drug therapy and stratified by type of drug therapy i e insulin alone or with sulfonylureas sulfonylureas only Independent Variables We identified variables in the AMRS that represented factors that may influence preventive health behavior 13 as well as those identified in the literature as being predictive of SMBG 4 6 Available demographic information included gender age race and Medicare or Medicaid insurance status as recorded by the provider or health plan Given the small numbers of other minority groups at HVMA we combined all racial groups other than white or black into a single category labeled other We then created two dichotomous variables black and other with white race as the reference group Census tract level data were used to represent the socioeconomic status of the patient and their neighborhood of residence We created an index composed of the sum of four weighted census tract measures i e percent with a college education median household income percent of households in which English was the primary language and percent home ownership The variables included in the index were standardized for summation by centering them around a mean of zero Their relative weightings in the index were determined using factor analysis Among several measures created from census tract variables to measure neighborhood SES the index created using the factor analysis approach proved to be the strongest predictor of SMBG in univariate analyses Clinical assessments of health status as measures of susceptibility or potential for the threat of poor health outcomes included two dichotomous measures of body mass index 14 i e overweight 25 kg m 2 BMI 30 kg m 2 obese BMI 30 kg m 2 and an age and gender weighted chronic disease score CDS 15 based on the presence or absence of 29 specific comorbidities determined from pharmacy dispensing data In several HMO settings the CDS has performed as well or better than Ambulatory Disease Groups as a measure of illness severity explaining 50 60 of variation in health care utilization costs and mortality 16 We included deciles of the CDS in multivariate regression analyses We categorized the last recorded HbA1c test value for each individual into two dichotomous measures representing poor and very poor glycemic control i e poor HbA1c 8 0 very poor HbA1c 10 with HbA1c 8 0 as the reference group Average standard monthly dose of oral diabetes medication used was also included as an indicator of severity of illness These standardized measures were constructed by first calculating median monthly dose of each drug type received in the entire study cohort during the study period The actual dose received in a month divided by this median dose yielded a standardized monthly amount for each patient We then calculated the median of these patient level standardized measures for the year and included it as a covariate in the multivariate analyses Dichotomous variables representing the number of HbA1c lab tests 1 if tests 2 and the number of physician visits 1 if visits 4 were included as measures of predisposition to use health services The HVMA primary care site defined as the health center where at least 75 of outpatient visits occurred defined for 78 of patients was included as a fixed effect to control for variations in practice patterns As the vast majority of patients 96 paid a 5 copayment for test strips during the study period cost to the patient was not included as a covariate of interest Statistical Analysis Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS V8 04 17 All analyses were stratified by type of drug therapy none insulin alone or in combination with oral sulfonylureas and oral sulfonylureas only in accordance with the literature which suggests greater rates of monitoring among those using insulin therapy 18 19 20 We used chi square tests to compare baseline differences in demographic status and health care utilization by type of drug therapy and in glycemic control by level of SMBG e g none any regular use For patients using either form of drug therapy we used logistic regression to estimate the factors associated with the likelihood of initiating SMBG and regularity of SMBG for those with some test strip use We first examined the univariate relationships between each candidate predictor and our two SMBG outcomes Age gender chronic disease score the number of HbA1c tests and primary care location were controlled for in all models Other variables were included in the multivariate models if univariate p values fell below 0 20 We used backward selection to remove variables not significant at the 05 level Overall model fit including the necessity for interaction terms was ascertained using likelihood ratio statistics 21 Tests of mixed i e hierarchical or random effects models 22 where census tract was defined as a higher level random effect produced no evidence of clustering at the census tract level indicating that the fixed effects approach was adequate Results Characteristics of the Sample The total study sample consisted of 4 565 patients among whom 30 used no drug therapy 31 used insulin therapy alone or in combination with oral agents and 39 were taking only oral sulfonylureas The study cohorts defined by type of therapy varied considerably with respect to several important demographic and clinical characteristics Compared to those using drug therapy the non drug therapy group was more likely to be female 55 vs 47 p 0 001 white 76 vs 67 p 0 001 and to have no comorbidities 33 vs 2 p 0 001 As shown in Table 1 insulin managed patients were more likely to be female 51 vs 44 p 0 001 of younger average age 51 vs 56 p 0 001 and Black 31 vs 25 p 0 001 compared to those using sulfonylureas They were also less likely to be enrolled in Medicare 17 vs 24 p 0 001 which was consistent with the differences in age While sulfonylurea managed patients were more likely to be obese 55 vs 46 p 0 001 insulin patients had a higher number of comorbidities on average than either the sulfonylurea only or the no drug group 3 1 vs 2 8 vs 1 6 respectively p 0 001 in both group comparisons There were no significant p 0 05 differences in neighborhood SES by type of drug therapy As shown in Table 2 insulin managed patients had more health center visits on average 14 2 11 9 than those using either oral 10 7 8 5 or no drug therapy 10 1 8 8 this difference was statistically significant p 0 001 Compared to sulfonylurea managed patients insulin managed were more likely to have been hospitalized during the study period 20 vs 13 p 0 001 and to have had an emergency room visit 25 vs 17 p 0 001 SMBG Lab Testing and Glycemic Control SMBG frequency was well below recommended guidelines for both insulin and sulfonylurea patients Table 2 Insulin managed patients were more likely to self monitor compared to those using oral medications 66 vs 24 p 0 001 However regular SMBG was far less prevalent among insulin managed and sulfonylurea managed patients 22 vs 7 respectively p 0 001 Only 7 of patients managed without drugs used any test strips during the year Approximately 77 of drug therapy patients had at least one HbA1c lab test per year In contrast fewer than half of patients managed without drugs were tested 48 p 0 001 Among patients with at least one lab test insulin managed patients had higher average HbA1c levels 8 9 test value 1 7 compared to sulfonylurea managed 8 3 1 7 and non drug managed 7 1 1 3 patients p 0 001 for both comparisons Over half 58 of all patients on drug therapy who were tested had at least one HbA1c value greater than 8 0 during the study period and 17 of those not on drug therapy who were tested had similarly elevated glycemic levels p 0 01 There were no significant differences in glycemic level by level of SMBG for those without any drug therapy and for patients using sulfonylureas However for the insulin managed group patients who monitored regularly were much less likely to be in very poor control 14 with HbA1c 10 compared to patients with no test strip use 31 or with irregular test strip use 32 p 0 001 for both comparisons Predictors of SMBG Results of the multivariate analyses examining the likelihood of any SMBG are presented in Table 3 For insulin managed patients higher SES of the census tract was significantly associated with greater odds of SMBG Odds Ratio 1 41 95 Confidence Interval 1 18 1 70 as hypothesized Further older age OR 0 80 CI 0 70 0 91 male gender OR 0 69 CI 0 52 0 90 and obesity OR 0 64 CI 0 44 0 95 were significantly associated with lower odds of SMBG However higher level of comorbidity was associated with greater odds of SMBG an effect that ran counter to our hypothesis OR 1 63 CI 1 21 2 20 Two or more laboratory HbA1c tests OR 1 60 CI 1 19 2 14 and four or more physician visits OR 1 80 CI 1 16 2 81 were also significant correlates of SMBG As in the insulin managed group higher SES of the census tract was significantly associated with greater odds of any SMBG among patients using oral sulfonylureas OR 1 26 CI 1 07 1 47 Older age OR 0 85 CI 0 76 0 96 was associated with lower odds of SMBG Two or more HbA1c tests OR 1 45 CI 1 14 1 86 four or more physician visits OR 2 06 CI 1 40 3 01 and the standard monthly dose of diabetes medications OR 1 13 CI 1 04 1 23 were associated with greater odds of SMBG in the oral managed group Predictors of Regularity of SMBG The only factors significantly associated with regular SMBG for the insulin managed group were black race OR 0 46 CI 0 26 0 81 and very poor glycemic control OR 0 38 CI 0 21 0 69 The only covariate identified as a significant predictor of regular SMBG in the sulfonylurea managed group was having two or more HbA1c tests OR 1 89 CI 1 18 3 04 The lack of significant predictors of regular SMBG for patients managed with sulfonylureas may be due to the small proportion 7 of regular users in this group Discussion Our findings suggest that managed care patients who may benefit the most from intensive diabetes management may be least likely to self monitor blood glucose Among insulin users older age and lower neighborhood SES were associated with lower odds of any SMBG Further black race and lack of glycemic control were significantly associated with less frequent SMBG suggesting that these characteristics may represent significant barriers to adherence For patients using oral medications older age and lower neighborhood SES were also associated with lower odds of initiating SMBG Our findings for lower SES older age and black race were consistent with those of other studies 4 5 6 In contrast to our hypothesis having multiple comorbidities was associated with higher odds of any SMBG for the insulin group However this result may be consistent with sicker patients being urged to monitor more frequently There was no evidence to suggest that glycemic level was associated with SMBG except for patients using insulin Among this group lack of glycemic control e g HbA1c 10 0 was associated with less than half the odds of frequent SMBG In a recent study using data from the third National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 1988 1994 Harris 18 found no association between glycemic levels and SMBG controlling for type of drug therapy There are several limitations to this study which merit discussion Most importantly the cross sectional nature of the study design prevents us from drawing causal inferences about the relationship between the chosen covariates and SMBG behavior For example the association between glycemic control and SMBG could suggest either that sicker patients are less likely to practice SMBG or that patients who practice SMBG are more likely to be in glycemic control Furthermore as most states now mandate coverage of home monitoring equipment the impact of variations in coverage of test strips which may cost the patient more than the monitor in the long run may be a more relevant topic for future studies Also more evidence of the efficacy of SMBG for patients with Type 2 diabetes is needed especially given the potential importance of belief in the efficacy of SMBG on patient behavior 13 The policy to cover the cost of home glucose monitors at this HMO was implemented in anticipation of the DCCT results In further analyses of the policy we found that the barriers to SMBG identified in this study did not change over time Further the rate of SMBG changed very little pre and post release of the DCCT findings and the policy change at HPHC Lastly similarities between our results and those from more recent studies of diabetes self management would lend additional support to our conclusions regarding SMBG Test strip dispensings are not a perfect measure of actual use but are likely to be more objective than self reports Also failure to control for individual SES may have caused us to overestimate the effect of neighborhood SES 24 25 26 Still other studies have found a significant effect of neighborhood SES on individual health and mortality even when individual level SES was controlled for in the analyses 27 28 29 30 31 32 Using an index similar to our own Diez Roux et al 32 recently found that living in a relatively disadvantaged neighborhood was associated with greater incidence of coronary heart disease among whites even after adjusting for individual level SES Hazard Ratio 1 6 95 CI 1 1 1 2 Missing data may have introduced bias into our results In particular we only included patients who were continuously enrolled thereby limiting the generalizability of our study to continuously enrolled managed care patients with diabetes Further approximately 22 of the study population did not receive an HbA1c test during the study period and we anticipate that patients with lower average HbA1c levels were less likely to have had a lab test Race data were unavailable for 31 of the study population However in a comparison of race data from the AMRS to member self reports it was found that blacks were only slightly more likely to be incorrectly categorized 2 of blacks vs 0 of whites or counted as missing 38 of blacks vs 32 of whites relative to whites unpublished data Choo P Platt R Data on duration of diabetes and type of diabetes which Karter et al 4 identified as predictors of SMBG adherence were not consistently available in the AMRS Therefore we controlled for severity of illness using type and intensity of drug therapy the number of comorbidities glycemic level and health service use Still it is possible that the association of younger age with higher likelihood of SMBG may in part reflect differences in type or duration of diabetes among insulin users The greatest strength of our study is the use of more objective measures of SMBG Data on test strips are less vulnerable to response biases that may hinder the detection of important relationships Furthermore the structure of the pharmacy benefit at the time of our study makes it very likely that all test strip dispensings would occur in health plan pharmacies While our data were gathered from one HMO the large and diverse patient population at HPHC increases the generalizability of our results to other managed care settings Conclusions While the efficacy of SMBG has yet to be demonstrated MCOs are under increasing pressure to cover the cost of SMBG equipment for their patients and to improve rates of SMBG Our findings provide troubling evidence that MCOs may face the greatest challenges in changing the self monitoring behavior of the patients at greatest risk for poor health outcomes Concern over health disparities has drawn increased attention toward community based interventions for diabetes Results of ongoing interventions may provide managed care organizations with useful strategies for reaching the groups most at risk for poor diabetes outcomes In addition well controlled longitudinal studies of the relationship between the factors identified in this study and patterns of SMBG and self management more generally can inform future interventions Competing Interests None declared Authors Contributions ASA participated in the design and analysis of the study and drafted the manuscript CM and FZ
