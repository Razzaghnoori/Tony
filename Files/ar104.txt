 Synopsis Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by joint inflammation and progressive cartilage and bone erosion Recent research has identified certain biologic agents that appear more able than conventional therapies to halt effectively the progression of disease as well as ameliorate disease symptoms One potential problem with the use of biologic agents for arthritis therapy is the need for daily or weekly repeat dosing The transfer of genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce potential systemic side effects 1 2 However although many genes have been effective in treating murine CIA if administrated at a time before disease onset local intra articular or periarticular gene transfer has not been highly effective in halting the progression of established disease IL 4 similar to tumor necrosis factor TNF and IL 1 inhibitors has been shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine CIA when administered intravenously as a recombinant protein either alone or in combination with IL 10 IL 4 can downregulate the production of proinflammatory and T helper Th 1 type cytokines by inducing mRNA degradation and upregulating the expression of inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL 1 receptor antagonist IL 1Ra 3 4 IL 4 is able to inhibit IL 2 and IFN production by Th1 cells resulting in suppression of macrophage activation and the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 and TNF by monocytes and macrophages 4 5 6 7 8 9 Objective In order to examine the therapeutic effects of local and systemic IL 4 expression in established CIA an adenoviral vector carrying the gene for murine IL 4 Ad mIL 4 was generated The ability of Ad mIL 4 to treat established CIA was evaluated by local periarticular and systemic intravenous injection of Ad mIL 4 into mice at various times after disease onset Materials and methods Male DBA 1 lacJ H 2 q mice aged 7 8 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME USA The mice were immunized intradermally at the base of tail with 100 g bovine type II collagen On day 21 after priming mice received a boost injection intradermally with 100 g type II collagen in incomplete adjuvant For the synchronous onset of arthritis 40 g lipopolysaccharide Sigma St Louis MO USA was injected intraperitoneally on day 28 Ad mIL 4 was injected periarticularly into the hind ankle joints of mice on day 32 or intravenously by tail vein injection on day 29 Disease severity was monitored every other day using an established macroscopic scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 0 normal 1 detectable arthritis with erythma 2 significant swelling and redness 3 severe swelling and redness from joint to digit and 4 maximal swelling with ankylosis The average of macroscopic score was expressed as a cumulative value for all paws with a maximum possible score of 16 per mouse Cytokine production by joint tissue or serum were assessed using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA R D Systems Minneapolis MN USA Results To examine the therapeutic effects of IL 4 gene transfer in a murine model of arthritis 5 10 8particles of Ad mIL 4 and enhanced green fluorescent protein Ad eGFP were administered by periarticular injection into the ankle joints of mice with established disease 4 days after lipopolysaccharide injection All mice had established disease at time of injection As shown in Figure 1 the severity of arthritis Fig 1a paw thickness Fig 1b and the number of arthritic paws Fig 1c were all significantly reduced in the Ad mIL 4 group compared with the saline and Ad eGFP treated groups Analysis of the bones in the ankle joints of control arthritic mice showed evidence of erosion with an associated monocytic infiltrate around the joint space compared with the Ad mIL 4 treated and nonarthritic control joints In addition injection of the ankle joints in the hind legs resulted in a therapeutic effect in the front paws A similar contralateral effect has been observed with adenoviral mediated delivery of viral v IL 10 Interestingly a high level of murine IL 10 also was detected from the joint lysates of Ad mIL 4 treated na ve and arthritic mice with the production of endogenous IL 10 correlating with the dose of Ad mIL 4 The administration of recombinant IL 4 protein systemically has been shown to be therapeutic in murine CIA models if given before disease onset To examine the effect of systemic IL 4 delivered by gene transfer 1 10 9particles of Ad mIL 4 were injected via the tail vein of collagen immunized mice the day after lipopolysaccharide injection Whereas the immunized control mice injected with Ad eGFP showed disease onset on day 3 after lipopolysaccharide injection Ad mIL 4 treated mice showed a delay in disease onset and as a reduction in the total number of arthritic paws Also systemic injection of Ad mIL 4 suppressed the severity of arthritis in CIA mice according to arthritis index Discussion Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery of therapeutic agents to joints in order to treat the pathologies associated with RA and osteoarthritis as well as other disorders of the joints In the present study we examined the ability of local periarticular and systemic gene transfer of IL 4 to treat established and early stage murine CIA respectively We have demonstrated that both local and systemic administration of Ad mIL 4 resulted in a reduction in the severity of arthritis as well as in the number of arthritic paws In addition the local gene transfer of IL 4 reduced histologic signs of inflammation and of bone erosion Interestingly local delivery of Ad mIL 4 was able to confer a therapeutic effect to the untreated front paws through a currently unknown mechanism In addition both local and systemic expression of IL 4 resulted in an increase in the level of endogenous IL 10 as well as of IL 1Ra data not shown Previous experiments have shown that gene transfer of IL 10 and IL 1 and TNF inhibitors at the time of disease initiation day 28 is therapeutic However delivery of these agents after disease onset appeared to have only limited therapeutic effect In contrast the present results demonstrate that IL 4 resulting from local periarticular and systemic injection of Ad mIL 4 was able partially to reverse progression of established and early stage disease respectively These results as well as those of others support the potential application of IL 4 gene therapy for the clinical treatment of RA Introduction RA is a chronic systemic autoimmune disease that is characterized by joint inflammation and progressive cartilage and bone erosion Currently the symptoms of arthritis are managed using pharmacologic agents including both steroidal and nonsteroidal drugs and disease modifying drugs such as methotrexate No pharmacologic agents have yet proven effective in halting the progression of disease however Recent research has identified certain biologic agents that appear more able than conventional therapies to halt effectively the progression of disease as well as ameliorate disease symptoms In particular inhibitors of TNF and IL 1 have proven effective in clinical trials and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of soluble TNF receptor for treatment of human RA One potential problem with the use of biologic agents for arthritis therapy is the need for daily or weekly repeat dosing The transfer of genes directly to the synovial lining can theoretically circumvent the need for repeat dosing and reduce potential systemic side effects 1 2 Ex vivo and in vivo methods have been used to deliver therapeutic genes such as those that encode IL 10 v IL 10 soluble TNF and IL 1 receptors and IL 1Ra to arthritic mouse 10 rat 11 dog 12 and rabbit joints 13 Although many genes have been effective in treating murine CIA if they are administered before disease onset local periarticular gene transfer has not been highly effective in halting the progression of established disease IL 4 similar to TNF and IL 1 inhibitors has been shown be therapeutic for the treatment of murine CIA when administered intravenously as a recombinant protein either alone or in combination with IL 10 IL 4 can down regulate the production of proinflammatory and Th1 type cytokines by inducing mRNA degradation and upregulating the expression of inhibitors of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL 1Ra 3 4 IL 4 is able to inhibit IL 2 and IFN production by Th1 cells resulting in suppression of macrophage activation and the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 and TNF by monocytes and macrophages 5 6 7 8 9 In addition IL 4 inhibits growth factor induced RA synoviocyte proliferation and expression of prostaglandin E and matrix metalloproteinase 3 in RA synovial fibroblast 14 15 16 and reduces bone resorption Given that IL 4 is able to inhibit the production of both IL 1 and TNF block synovial cell proliferation and bone loss and promote the formation of Th2 lymphocytes it represents an attractive cytokine for treating arthritis by gene transfer To examine the therapeutic effects of local and systemic IL 4 expression in established CIA we have generated an adenoviral vector carrying the gene for murine IL 4 Ad mIL 4 The ability of Ad mIL 4 to treat established CIA was evaluated by local periarticular and systemic intravenous injections of Ad mIL 4 into mice at various times after disease onset Local injection of Ad mIL 4 resulted in a reduction in the severity of arthritis and joint swelling and reduced macroscopic signs of joint inflammation and bone erosion Injection of the ankle joints in the hind legs also resulted in a therapeutic effect in the untreated front paws A high level of endogenous murine IL 10 was detected in the joint tissues of mice injected locally with Ad mIL 4 Systemic delivery of murine IL 4 by intravenous injection of Ad mIL 4 also resulted in a slight delay in the onset of disease with a significant reduction in the number of arthritic paws These results demonstrate that local and systemic gene transfer of IL 4 is able to treat established and early stage disease respectively in a mouse model of arthritis and thus may be useful for clinical applications for the treatment of RA Materials and methods Mice Male DBA 1 lacJ H 2 q mice aged 7 8 weeks were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory They were maintained in a specific pathogen free animal facility of the University of Pittsburgh Biotechnology Center For local periarticular injection mice were anesthetized with inhalation of 2 5 isoflurane gas A maximum of 5 l diluted adenovirus was injected into joint articular space under the ankle joint bone in each hind paw with a 26 gauge Hamilton syringe For systemic delivery of adenovirus 500 l diluted adenovirus was injected intravenously via the tail vein Vector construction and adenovirus generation Ad mIL 4 was constructed and propagated according to standard protocols as previously described 17 Briefly recombinant adenoviruses were generated by homologous recombination in CRE8 cells a 293 cell line that expresses Cre recombinase between psi 5 an Ad5 derived E1 and E3 deleted adenovirus and pAd lox the adenoviral shuttle vector that expresses IL 4 The inserted cDNA sequences are expressed under the transcriptional control of human cytomegalovirus promoter Vectors were purified using two consecutive CsCl gradient ultracentrifugation dialyzed at 4 C against sterile virus buffer aliquoted and stored at 80 C until use The titers of the adenoviral stocks were determined by incubating serial dilutions of the stocks at 37 C for 60 min with sub confluent 293 cells Viral titers were calculated by determining the highest dilution that produced 100 viral cytopathic effect which was then multiplied by the number of cells per well and by the dilution factor CRE8 and 293 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco s modified eagle medium GIBCO BRL Rockville MD USA supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum Induction of arthritis Bovine typeII collagen Chondrex Seattle WA USA was dissolved in 0 05mol l acetic acid at a concentration of 2mg ml by stirring overnight at 4 C and emulsified in equal volumes of FCA containing 2mg ml heat killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain H37Ra The mice were immunized intradermally at the base of tail with 100 g collagen On day 21 after priming the mice were boosted with 100 g type II collagen in incomplete adjuvant In order to synchronize the onset of arthritis 40 g lipopolysaccharide Sigma was injected intraperitoneally on day 28 Disease evaluation Disease severity was assessed every other day using an established macroscopic scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 0 normal 1 detectable arthritis with erythma 2 significant swelling and redness 3 severe swelling and redness from joint to digit and 4 maximal swelling with ankylosis The macroscopic score mean standard deviation was expressed as a cumulative value for all paws with a maximum possible score of 16 The thickness of each paw was also measured using a spring load caliper The paw swelling for each mouse was calculated by adding the four thicknesses of the individual paws In addition the number of arthritic paws of individual mice were counted and added to represent the number of arthritic paws in a group The in vivo experiments were performed with 10 mice group and repeated three times to ensure reproducibility Histologic examination Joint tissues from freshly dissected mice were immersion fixed in 10 neutral buffered formalin and decalcified in 15 ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid 30 glycerol for 2 weeks Tissues were then dehydrated in graded alcohols embedded in paraplast sectioned at 5 m on a microtome and stained with hematoxylin and eosin Sections were evaluated in a blinded manner for histologic signs of arthritis and scored as follows 1 synovial cell proliferation synovial hypertrophy with villus formation and or fibrin deposition 2 inflammation synovitis and or generalized inflammation 3 cartilage disruption chondrocyte degeneration and or ruffling of cartilage surface and or dystrophic cartilage and 4 joint destruction cartilage erosion with abundant inflammation and pannus formation with bone erosion Type II collagen antibody titration Serum level of antibody against type II collagen was measured using a standard ELISA assay Briefly a 96 well Immuno Maxisorp Plate Nunc Naperville IL USA was coated with bovine type II collagen 10 g ml overnight at 4 C and blocked with 10 fetal bovine serum in phosphate buffered saline Sample sera were diluted to 1 100000 vol vol and incubated for 2h at 37 C After washing bound antibody isotope was detected with biotin conjugated antimouse whole IgG heavy and light chain antibody Pharmingen San Diego CA USA Thereafter plates were washed incubated with 100 l 2 2 azino di 3 ethyl benzthiazolinesulfonate substrate ABTS Boeringer Mannheim Indianapolis IN USA at 1mg ml and read at 405nm Cytokine production Cytokine production in the joint tissue or serum was assessed by ELISA R D systems For measuring the cytokine production peeled joint tissues from the upper portion of ankle to the middle of the paw were ground by homogenizer in the equal volume of the lysis buffer 100mmol l potassuim phosphate pH 7 8 and 0 2 Triton X 100 Cytokine production was standardized as amount of cytokine per gram of tissue Statistical analysis Results were compared using the Student s t test and by analysis of variance P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results Local delivery of Ad mIL 4 in established CIA mouse model To establish CIA 8 week old aged DBA1 lacJ male mice were immunized with 100 g bovine type II collagen emulsified in complete adjuvant After 21 days the mice were boosted with the same amount of collagen in incomplete adjuvant with disease pathology observed starting 28 days after immunization In order to synchronize the onset of arthritis lipopolysaccharide was injected intraperitoneally on day 28 excluding the mice that had already showed signs of disease pathology All of the collagen immunized mice had swollen and red paws and ankle joints within 3 days after lipopolysaccharide injection In order to examine the therapeutic effects of IL 4 gene transfer in a murine model of arthritis increasing doses of an Ad mIL 4 recombinant virus were administered by periarticular injection into the hind ankle joints of mice with established disease 4 days after lipopolysaccharide injection As shown in Figure 1 all mice had established disease at time of injection However the severity of arthritis Fig 1a paw thickness Fig 1b and the number of arthritic paws Fig 1c were all significantly reduced in the Ad mIL 4 group compared with the saline and Ad eGFP treated groups Analysis of the bones in the ankle joints of control arthritic mice showed evidence of erosion with an associated monocytic infiltrate around the joint space Fig 2a compared with the nonarthritic control joints In contrast the joints from Ad mIL 4 treated mice showed less inflammatory joint tissue reduction in bone erosion and reduction in the number of inflammatory cells The changes in histology of the ankle joints from sections from five mice per group were also scored in a blinded manner As shown in Figure 2b significant inhibition of disease progression as assessed by joint histology was observed in the Ad mIL 4 treated group These results suggest that local expression of IL 4 after gene transfer to joints with established disease could effectively protect tissue from inflammation as well as block bone erosion It is important to note that the possible inflammatory responses to adenoviral injection were examined by injection of the same number of particles of Ad mIL 4 and Ad eGFP into na ve joints of DBA mice At the doses of virus used however no inflammation was observed data not shown Reduction in disease severity in noninjected front paws by local injection of IL 4 Previously we have noted a contralateral effect in which treatment of a diseased joint by adenovirus mediated transfer of the gene that encodes v IL 10 resulted in a therapeutic effect in noninjected joints To determine whether Ad mIL 4 was able to confer a contralateral effect the severity of disease in the hind and front paws of the mice injected only in the hind ankle joints was evaluated As shown in Figure 3a a reduction in the arthritis index was observed in the Ad mIL 4 injected hind leg ankle joints of the CIA mice Interestingly the noninjected front paws also showed a statistically significant reduction in the severity of arthritis Fig 3b Taken together these results suggest that local periarticular injection of Ad mIL 4 resulted in a therapeutic effect in both injected and noninjected joints However unlike v IL 10 IL 4 is able to confer a contralateral therapeutic effect in mice with established disease Stimulation of endogenous IL 10 expression by local IL 4 gene delivery To test the level and duration of gene expression 5 10 8particles of Ad mIL 4 Ad mIL 10 and Ad eGFP were injected periarticularly into the ankle joints of na ve DBA1 mice Joint tissues were isolated at indicated time points homogenized in lysis buffer and the lysates analyzed for cytokine production by ELISA Maximal IL 4 expression was detected on day 7 with the level gradually decreasing over time Fig 4a However it is important to note that it is unclear whether the level of IL 4 detected in the joints at the different time points is partially due to induction of endogenous IL 4 Interestingly a high level of murine IL 10 also was detected from the joint lysates of Ad mIL 4 injected animals Fig 4b that directly correlated with the dose of Ad mIL 4 data not shown An increase in the level of IL 10 expression could even be detected 3 weeks after injection of a high dose of Ad mIL 4 The levels of IL 4 and IL 10 expression also were examined in arthritic mice treated with Ad mIL 4 at day 35 after injection As shown in Figure 5a a slight increase in IL 4 expression was observed in that correlated with the dose of Ad mIL 4 Fig 5a A similar increase at day 35 was also observed in na ve mice data not shown In addition a significant dose dependent increase in the level of endogenous IL 10 35 days after Ad mIL 4 administration was observed in the CIA treated animals Fig 5b These results demonstrated that IL 4 transgene expression was detectable for up to 5 weeks after Ad mIL 4 delivery and that IL 4 was able to induce the production of endogenous IL 10 in the joints of both na ve and immunized mice In addition expression of IL 4 resulted in a twofold increase in the level of endogenous IL 1Ra data not shown In contrast periarticular injection of Ad mIL 10 did not affect the level of expression of endogenous levels of IL 4 Fig 4a and IL 1Ra data not shown Taken together these results suggest that the therapeutic effects of exogenous IL 4 could be mediated in part through the induction of endogenous IL 4 and IL 1Ra Delay of disease onset by systemic Ad mIL 4 administration The administration of recombinant IL 4 protein systemically has been shown to be therapeutic in murine CIA models if given before onset of disease onset To examine the effect of systemic IL 4 delivered by gene transfer 10 9particles of Ad mIL 4 were administered intravenously by tail vein injection of the collagen immunized mice on the day after lipopolysaccharide injection Whereas the immunized mice injected with Ad eGFP showed disease onset on day 3 after lipopolysaccharide injection IL 4 treated mice showed a delay in disease onset Fig 6a as well as a reduction in the total number of arthritic paws Fig 6c In addition seven out of the 15 Ad mIL 4 treated mice were disease free for up to 10 days after lipopolysaccharide injection and two mice were disease free at the end of the experiment on day 65 In addition systemic injection of Ad mIL 4 suppressed the severity of arthritis in the CIA mice according to arthritis index Fig 6b Thus systemic delivery of IL 4 by adenovirus mediated gene transfer is able to reduce the onset and severity of early stage disease IL 4 and IL 10 expression in sera of CIA mice administered Ad mIL 4 systemically To examine the duration of IL 4 expression as well as induction of endogenous IL 10 expression serum was collected from the mice and tested for levels of IL 4 and IL 10 Fig 7 An elevated level of IL 4 was detected in on day 7 Fig 7a and on day 30 Fig 7c after IL 4 injection In addition although there was no observed increase in the expression of IL 10 in the sera at day 7 after systemic delivery of IL 4 Fig 7b IL 10 was elevated in the sera at day 35 Fig 7d In contrast the levels of IL 4 and IL 10 in the saline or Ad eGFP treated control groups were not significantly above background after either or local Ad mIL 4 delivery Thus the early therapeutic effects of IL 4 after systemic delivery most likely are not mediated by IL 10 In contrast it is possible that the therapeutic effects of IL 4 after local injection are conferred in part by IL 10 Discussion Gene therapy represents a novel approach for delivery of therapeutic agents to joints in order to treat the pathologies associated with RA and osteoarthritis as well as other disorders of the joints Previously we and others have shown that local ex vivo and in vivo gene transfer of v IL 10 IL 1Ra IFN soluble IL 1 receptor and soluble TNF receptor are able to block certain intra articular pathologies in rabbit rat and murine models of arthritis IL 4 like IL 10 is a Th2 cytokine that has been demonstrated to be therapeutic for the treatment of arthritis after systemic administration of recombinant protein In the present study we examined the ability of local periarticular gene transfer of IL 4 to treat established murine CIA We demonstrated that both local and systemic administration of Ad mIL 4 resulted in a reduction in the severity of established and early stage arthritis respectively as well as in the number of arthritic paws In addition the local gene transfer of Ad mIL 4 reduced histologic signs of inflammation as well as bone erosion Previous experiments have shown that gene transfer of IL 10 and IL 1 and TNF inhibitors at the time of disease initiation day 28 was therapeutic However delivery of these agents after disease onset appeared to have only limited therapeutic effect In contrast the present results demonstrate that local IL 4 delivery was able partially to reverse progression of established disease after local periarticular injection Interestingly local and systemic expression of IL 4 resulted in an increase in the level of endogenous IL 10 as well as IL 1Ra Previous reports have shown that an additive or possible synergistic therapeutic effect can be achieved in animal models of arthritis with combined treatment with recombinant IL 4 and IL 10 Treatment of mice with IL 4 and IL 10 results in reduction in TNF and IL 1 production with a concomitant shift in the IL 1Ra IL 1 ratio 18 19 The fact that the therapeutic effects of IL 4 and IL 10 are potentially synergistic is possibly due to the fact that they suppress proinflammatory mediator production through different mechanisms IL 4 is able to block transcription of TNF and IL 1 genes whereas IL 10 stimulates degradation of TNF and IL 1 mRNAs 20 Thus it is likely that the therapeutic effects we observed after local injection of Ad mIL 4 are due to both exogenous IL 4 and endogenous IL 10 production However the delayed induction of IL 10 after systemic administration of Ad mIL 4 suggests that the initial therapeutic effects are not conferred by IL 10 A mechanism whereby IL 4 may alter IL 10 and IL 1Ra levels could involve the regulation of transcription factors that regulate the respective genes for these cytokines In particular nuclear factor B and signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 are important for conferring transcriptional regulation by IL 4 Signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 after tyrosine phosphorylation can bind directly to nuclear factor B 21 resulting in synergic activation in certain cell types The present results suggest that gene transfer of IL 4 can stimulate expression of endogenous cytokines such as IL 10 and IL 1Ra as well as possibly endogenous IL 4 expression Endogenous IL 10 which can be induced by IL 4 is a natural suppressor of a number of inflammatory responses Inhibition of endogenous IL 10 with neutralizing antibodies enhanced endotoxic shock IgG immune complex induced lung injury and the severity of CIA 22 23 24 25 Periarticular delivery of murine or viral IL 10 by gene transfer resulted in the inhibition of CIA in mouse models 10 26 if delivered before or at the time of disease onset The present results are also consistent with the observation that IL 4 but not IL 10 has been shown to enhance the production of IL 1Ra by RA synovial cells 14 27 IL 4 is a potent mediator in shifting the balance of Th1 Th2 cells and skewing the production of antibody subtypes 28 Th2 effector cell differentiation also is dependent on the presence of IL 4 during priming 29 Blocking endogenous IL 4 using neutralizing antibodies has been shown 30 to result not only in the absence of T cells with a Th2 like phenotype but also in the appearance of T cells producing IL 2 and IFN after restimulation IL 4 is also able to skew the production of antibody subtype 28 However we have shown that anticollagen antibody levels are already very high at day 30 after immunization and that IL 4 treatment did not significantly change these elevated levels data not shown In addition we did not observe significant differences between IgG isotypes in the control and Ad mIL 4 treated mice data not shown Thus the mechanisms through which local and systemic IL 4 administration are able to suppress CIA are still unclear We have demonstrated previously that periarticular injection of adenovirus mediated gene transfer of v IL 10 into the hind paws of mice with early stage arthritis was able to confer a therapeutic effect in the untreated front paws Similarly administration of v IL 10 into one knee of rabbits with antigen induced arthritis was able to confer a therapeutic effect in the contralateral untreated knee This observed contralateral effect was not limited to v IL 10 in that coadministration of adenoviral vectors expressing soluble IL 1 and soluble TNF receptors also conferred a similar protective effect to untreated knees Although the mechanism of the contralateral effect is unclear we have demonstrated that adoptive transfer of dendritic cells from animals treated with adenovirus mediated gene transfer of v IL 10 to untreated immunized animals is able to confer a therapeutic effect unpublished data Thus it is possible that local expression of v IL 10 or IL 1 and TNF inhibitors modulates the activity of dendritic cells However although v IL 10 is able to block early stage disease it is ineffective in reversing established disease In contrast periarticular injection of Ad mIL 4 was able to reverse pathology in established disease not only in the treated hind paws but also in the untreated front paws Interestingly we have observed that intravenous injection of na ve dendritic cells genetically modified to express IL 4 is able to effectively treat established arthritis by inhibiting the Th1 response unpublished data During the preparation of this manuscript a similar study using a recombinant Ad mIL 4 vector for treatment of murine CIA was reported 31 However the vector was administered before onset of disease into knee joints whereas the vector in the present study was injected after disease onset into ankle joints Similar to the present results in that study local injection of the recombinant Ad mIL 4 vector resulted in a reduction in bone erosion and a reduction in cartilage degradation However unlike the present results no effect on joint inflammation was observed Moreover in the present report we demonstrated that both local and systemic injection resulted in induction of endogenous IL 10 Given the ability of IL 4 to reverse established disease partially our studies as well as those of others support the potential application of IL 4 gene therapy for the clinical treatment of RA
