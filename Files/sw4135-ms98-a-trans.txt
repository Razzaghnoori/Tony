                um so what is your what why do you people dont vote in the elections   well first of all i think they understated the turnout Its i dont i dont think that in a national election its ever been under fifty three percent well its its its almost half but its been you know its somewhere in the fifties for sure so it it it understates it a little bit   uhhuh   why do people not vote um well its  the analysts usually say they dont think it will effect anything theyre certainly wrong about that   yeah   um i think that that its easy if you if if you think things are going bad enough to just turn off to the news and just not pay any attention Its the less you pay attention the less you know about whats going to effect you   yeah yeah i i think i think apathy is is real big thing i mean just in the fact that you dont think youre going to have anything done i to me its really hard to find um   uhhuh   any information on the candidates i mean i i voted yesterday and and uh   uhhuh   half half the people you know you really have to hunt to get information on them and you know as far as the local things go and if you know if you dont know them then   yeah oh yeah thats right yeah and i i i agree uh i have made calls to various organizations the night before elections well one thing i do  i usually do is go to the library and study for an election  before it   really   yeah and and try to get voter guides from newspapers and things and that helps a little bit   yeah thats a good idea   they dont ask their they dont ask enough questions they ask on one or two issues and and many people can respond with platitudes   yeah   what you really need to do  excuse me is find interest groups that that you know whos interest whose issues you are interested in and then find how the if they have done a candidate survey and lots of times they have and then you have something to base it on there was a back when i was living in Pittsburgh there was a group called the association for public justice i dont know if youve ever heard of them perhaps   huhuh huhuh   perhaps not i its its it they they really didnt you know it it sounds like theyre some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too   uhhuh   and they put out this this  uh survey of candidates where they asked them like uh eight questions uh all the candidates for all the offices now it wasnt that great in that they didnt tailor the the question for you know for the particular office so they asked people on the local level things that only come up at the national level and vice versa   yeah   but uh other than that it was a very good way to to see who you sympathized with and you could vote on the basis of that   yeah i thats um i dont know what it was that we had that i had yesterday got it from someone in our church that uh it it asked uh   uhhuh   it went all the way down well it went to some of our constables but mainly it was in the Dallas area not in the Plano area   uhhuh   but um it asked it had all sorts of questions about uh economics uh education and and uh       uh family and   things things things like abortion presumably   yeah yeah but it had other things like um do you would you support um   huh   i know one that kind of stuck out in my mind was was would you support uh a a two thousand dollar uh tax credit for women that stay you know at home and and so it had kind of a variety of of um   yeah right right   of questions and it it probably had twenty or thirty questions on it it was really you know that was really good and helpful and it you know it had them you know support if they could support oppose oppose or or you know be undecided about it   uhhuh i do do do you know what group did it   yeah it was it was it was uh i thought it was really good but you know it course it doesnt go through all the candidates and some of them you know you think well this guys this guy wont have any wont have any um   uhhuh yup uhhuh   say so about any of this anyway but its kind of good to know their opinions anyway they you know run for a different kind of office once youre in politics you probably stay in politics i would think   uhhuh thats right because yeah yeah i mean once they yeah thats right thats thats one point that was made that that you know uh i read one article saying even if you dont that abortion makes any difference at uh you know at a at a really local level like City Council or something like that        these people will in the end they might get elected to something bigger and the way that they get known is by getting elected these little to these to little offices   yeah   so you got to look at their views and and that was a point that i hadnt considered the reason i ask about the organization is i just got uh started working last year in an organization called Christian Coalition which does just what you were suggesting and i was wondering if it was   uhhuh and that may have been who had done it im i dont remember um   if it was theirs yeah   i had like three or four different things i was looking at uh and that was that that was probably the most helpful i wish it had been more detailed i know that um   uhhuh see the candidates dont like to respond to all these questions   i you
