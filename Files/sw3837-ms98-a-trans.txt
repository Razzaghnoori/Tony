        well have you taken any vacations that you enjoyed lately     yes took one in October and uh drove flew into Los Angeles and drove up the coast to uh through Monterey and San Francisco and over to Lake Tahoe and flew out of Reno   okay so you went up like the Coast Highway for a way and then then went inland there   yeah uhhuh was really great   is is that was that a new area for you to visit   most of it was because i had uh seen parts of northern California and id been to San Francisco but never along the Coast Road   yeah   it was quite exciting   yeah   my husband said he didnt know whether he wanted to ever drive it again though     its the   have you been   its scenic i guess i ive ive been to a part of that on a trip to San Francisco i i went up just a short ways up the coast to i believe it was Point Raid uh National Seashore i think it was   um i dont remember that   and i only had about a day so it was just a short drive up from San Francisco and back when i was out out for business   oh well we went uh we liked Monterey very much and uh it was just kind of a relaxed pleasant town with a lot of things to see and do and and then uh the Muir Woods on the other side of San Francisco um thats another really bad drive but its its worth going to   uh the the Redwood forest there   yes   what part of the country are you from   originally from Texas i was raised up in Dalhart so uh anything that doesnt look like flat plains is uh like i told someone once i always thought Dallas was real green       because it was the greenest place id ever been   are you currently living in Texas   oh yes live in Dallas   okay see im in Texas too but   where are you from where do you live   in Richardson   okay well youre just a  a suburb of Dallas   thats right       well we uh my family and i moved here about three years ago we lived in Colorado and   oh oh my   uh and thats a good vacation spot too  but it was nice living there   yes yes well we uh when our children were young we used to go to Estes Park   yes i i didnt live too far from there in fact i bicycled from my house to there a time or two uh   oh how fortunate you were   uh from Boulder i lived in Boulder Colorado   yeah uhhuh thats that is one beautiful place   uh i i uh didnt probably take advantage of it as much as i probably would if i moved back  you kind of take it for granted when you live there but   no yeah   i did enjoy the skiing and and the and the winter sports that that was available there   um well ive never skied my husband keeps saying we need to go but uh we have never done it yet but uh everyone who does says its great   yeah its enjoyable if you do it more than once or twice so you get past the learning stage so you can start enjoying it its a little bit frustrating when youre falling a lot but after  after you get past that its a lot of fun   uhhuh   you have to enjoy the cold snow in your face huh   well it sometimes can be yeah it it uh you can get some nice days skiing as well though if if youre not falling you can stay pretty dry and   uhhuh yeah   and uh it can be pretty nice the dry climate doesnt feel near as cold as as it does here in the winter time to me   yeah well i think that uh no the dampness course our humidity is sort of medium compared uh well where i was raised is extremely dry   yeah   but my brother lives in Houston and   its the the other extreme   yeah so were kind of inbetween but uh my mother always said that Dallas was extremely humid to her   yeah its i i agree with you its sort of in between yeah after having lived in Colorado a lot that was a little dryer than was probably comfortable its a bit little too dry and   uhhuh   and this is actually a pretty good climate humidity wise in in the Dallas area   uhhuh have you gone on any vacations lately   last uh uh summer we uh we went uh and took the family to Cancun in Mexico and uh we really enjoyed that trip   oh yeah have they uh we were we were there when it one of the first times it was open they were just building the hotels and   well its pretty built up now   i was afraid it had become so commercialized   yeah it probably was more enjoyable when you went before it was too too built its its a real strip hotel strip now out out on that island   uhhuh did you go over to the Isle Mujeres   uh yes we we took a sailboat uh catamaran ride over to Isle Mujeres and they took us around let us shop a little while and then took us to some snorkeling uh   um yeah oh did you get to go out to that reef   spot
