 Background Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated through a cap dependent mechanism of initiation In this process eIF4E which functions by binding the 7 methylguanosine cap is the rate limiting factor due to its low abundance 1 2 In normal cells elevated eIF4E activity is associated with proliferation and is regulated by multiple mechanisms eIF4E gene transcription is enhanced in response to mitogenic stimulation and may be mediated by c myc 3 Phosphorylation of eIF4E by the protein kinase Mnk1 increases its affinity for the cap and thus increases cap dependent initiation of translation 4 5 6 An inhibitor of eIF4E 4E binding protein 4EBP is also regulated by phosphorylation Phosphorylation of 4EBP disrupts its ability to bind eIF4E freeing eIF4E to bind eIF4G which functions to recruit additional components of the initiation complex 7 8 The net result is that phosphorylation of 4EBP enhances cap dependent translation initiation 4EBP phosphorylation is thought to be mediated by mammalian target of rapamycin mTOR in mitogen stimulated cells 9 10 11 Numerous studies have implicated eIF4E in formation and progression of tumors Overexpression of eIF4E leads to deregulated growth and malignant transformation of a variety of cultured cell lines 12 13 14 Moreover elevated levels of eIF4E are commonly found in solid tumors especially in breast colon and head and neck tumors 15 Clinical studies indicate that eIF4E gene amplification and protein overexpression is associated with malignant progression in these tumors 16 High eIF4E levels are also associated with a higher rate of cancer recurrence and cancer related death 17 In contrast to eIF4E overexpression of 4EBP inhibits cell proliferation 18 and 4EBP 1 expression levels are inversely correlated with the progression of certain types of tumors 19 The findings summarized above indicate that elevated eIF4E activity plays a fundamental role in cancer formation and progression and suggest the possibility that eIF4E could be exploited as a therapeutic target This is supported by several recent investigations Inhibiting the expression of eIF4E by expressing antisense RNA reverses ras mediated transformation of cultured cells as indicated by decreased efficiency of growth in soft agar and tumor formation in nude mice 20 Similarly antisense mediated reduction of eIF4E in breast cancer cells inhibits both their tumorigenic and angiogenic properties 21 On the other hand overexpression of 4EBP reverses transformation mediated by v src 18 Rapamycin and its analogs are potent inhibitors of mTOR and lead to cell cycle arrest Thus there is interest in using this class of inhibitors for chemotherapeutic treatment of cancer and several phase I trials have been carried out 22 Treatment of mammalian cells with rapamycin leads to dephosphorylation and activation of 4EBP which in turn binds to and inhibits eIF4E However several other targets downstream of mTOR are also affected by rapamycin These include effects on other translational control proteins including p70 S6 kinase p70S6K eIF4G eIF4B and eEF2 reviewed in 23 At present neither the targets that are essential for inhibition of cell proliferation by rapamycin nor the mechanism by which these targets mediate cell cycle arrest are completely understood In the present study an MCF7 breast cancer cell line was developed which can be induced to express a mutant form of 4EBP 1 in which five amino acids that are targets for phosphorylation have been changed to alanines 24 Since the protein cannot be inactivated by phosphorylation it constitutively binds to and inhibits eIF4E Thus expression of the mutant mimics the effects of rapamycin on 4EBP but does not affect the other targets of mTOR Induction of the constitutively active 4EBP 1 leads to cell cycle arrest which correlates with loss of cyclin D1 expression and increased levels of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1 The increase in p27 Kip1is mediated at least in part by enhanced synthesis of the protein and corresponds to activation of the p27 Kip1mRNA 5 untranslated region UTR and its ability to mediate cap independent initiation of translation Results Expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 inhibits the proliferation of MCF7 cells To test the effect of 4EBP 1 on the proliferation of human breast cancer cells an expression vector encoding the constitutively active 4EBP 1 mutant 4EBP 1 5A was stably transfected into MCF7 cells The 4EBP 1 5A cDNA was placed under the control of a promoter that is responsive to the insect hormone ponasterone A pon A an ecdysone analog In the absence of pon A an ecdysone receptor VP16 fusion protein actively represses the promoter leading to very low basal levels of expression In the presence of pon A the ecdysone receptor recruits coactivators that lead to elevated expression The stably transfected MCF7 line MCF7 4EBP 1 5A was treated with pon A and at various times cells were harvested for analysis of 4EBP 1 expression by Western blotting Fig 1A Several forms of 4EBP 1 are present in the stably transfected MCF7 cells The slower migrating bands represent endogenous 4EBP 1 that is phosphorylated at various sites The fastest migrating band corresponds to hypophosphorylated 4EBP 1 Treatment with pon A leads to a rapid increase in the intensity of the fastest migrating band which corresponds to the 4EBP 1 5A mutated form of the protein which cannot be phosphorylated In cells treated with pon A the fastest migrating form of 4EBP 1 is the predominant band at all time points Expression of this form of 4EBP 1 continues to increase for at least five days after treatment with pon A In the control cells which were not treated with pon A phosphorylated inactive 4EBP 1 is the predominant form of the protein Fig 1A Treatment of untransfected MCF7 cells with pon A had no effect on expression or phosphorylation status of 4EBP 1 data not shown The expressed 4EBP 1 5A protein is active as determined by a large increase in the amount of 4EBP 1 bound to eIF4E in pon A treated MCF7 4EBP 1 5A cells Fig 1B Expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 through inhibition of eIF4E activity would be expected to slow the rate of proliferation of MCF7 cells To test this the growth of MCF7 4EBP 1 5A breast cancer cells was determined by counting cell number in cultures treated with or without pon A Fig 1C In the absence of pon A the cells continued to proliferate for at least five days However induction of 4EBP 1 5A by the addition of pon A almost completely blocked cell proliferation There was no indication of cell death in the pon A treated cultures and pon A had no effect on the untransfected parental MCF7 cell line Fig 1C These results indicate that expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 leads to cell cycle arrest of MCF7 cells Expression of 4EBP 1 5A results in enhanced p27 Kip1expression and downregulation of cyclin D1 Elevated levels of eIF4E are associated with tumorigenic transformation and enhanced expression of specific cell cycle regulatory proteins such as cyclin D1 Expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 should lead to a global decrease in cap dependent translation which could lead to cell cycle arrest However it is also possible that constitutively active 4EBP 1 inhibits proliferation through specific effects on cell cycle regulatory proteins Therefore a number of G1 cell cycle regulatory molecules were examined in MCF7 4EBP 1 5A cells that had been treated with or without pon A Addition of pon A altered the levels of two critical G1 regulatory proteins There was a significant increase in the level of p27 Kip1observed at every time point up to three days after addition of pon A Fig 2Aand 2B At the same time there was a substantial decrease in the level of cyclin D1 No difference was observed in the protein levels of CDK4 or CDK2 between pon A treated and untreated cells Treatment of MCF7 pERV3 cells which express the ecdysone receptor VP16 fusion protein but not the inducible constitutively active 4EBP 1 see Methods with pon A had no effect on the expression of any of these proteins Fig 2B Constitutively active 4EBP 1 does not alter p27 Kip1and cyclin D1 turnover rates The results above suggest that cell cycle arrest of MCF7 cells in response to 4EBP 1 5A expression involves specific effects on expression of cyclin D1 and p27 Kip1 The most plausible explanation is that the observed changes are mediated by altered rates of translation However others have shown that eIF4E overexpression enhances cyclin D1 mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytosol 25 and it is possible that 4EBP 1 affects this process Also p27 Kip1expression is actually enhanced while 4EBP 1 would be expected to inhibit translation rates Therefore it was of interest to examine the mechanism by which 4EBP 1 5A expression modulates p27 Kip1and cyclin D1 levels First to determine if 4EBP 1 led to a change in degradation of either p27 Kip1or cyclin D1 turnover rates were estimated in MCF7 4EBP 1 5A cells that had been treated with or without pon A for 24 hours Cycloheximide was added for various times and p27 Kip1and cyclin D1 levels were estimated by western blotting Fig 3 Neither the rate of p27 Kip1turnover nor that of cyclin D1 was significantly altered by pon A induced expression of 4EBP 1 5A Thus modulation of p27 Kip1and cyclin D1 levels in response to expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 does not appear to be mediated by changes in protein degradation Expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 does not alter p27 Kip1mRNA levels but decreases cyclin D1 mRNA levels To examine whether 4EBP 1 could regulate p27 Kip1or cyclin D1 at the transcriptional level or through changes in message stability the levels of p27 Kip1and cyclin D1 mRNA levels were examined by Northern blotting Fig 4Aand 4B There was no difference in mRNA levels encoding p27 Kip1after treatment with pon A However pon A treatment led to an approximately 50 decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA Fig 4B This may contribute to the downregulation of cyclin D1 protein and is consistent with a previous report showing an increase in cyclin D1 mRNA in cells overexpressing eIF4E 26 Expression of 4EBP 1 5A enhances de novop27 Kip1protein synthesis The observation that expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 leads to increased p27 Kip1 but does not significantly affect protein turnover or mRNA levels suggests that synthesis of p27 Kip1is affected Therefore the effect of 4EBP 1 5A on the de novo synthesis of p27 Kip1was tested by metabolic labeling with 35S labeled amino acids After treatment of MCF7 4EBP 1 5A cells with or without pon A for 48 hours the cells were pulse labeled for 1 5 hours Half of the cellular extract was used to immunoprecipitate cyclin D1 and the other half to immunoprecipitate p27 Kip1 Fig 5Aand 5B The results demonstrate an increase in p27 Kip1protein synthesis of approximately two fold in cells expressing 4EBP 1 5A Since no changes in p27 Kip1mRNA levels or protein turnover were observed the increased synthesis of p27 Kipmost likely reflects increased rates of translation In the same experiment a substantial decrease in de novo synthesis of cyclin D1 was observed which could be due in part to lower cyclin D1 mRNA levels see Fig 4 Interestingly total protein synthesis as determined by trichloroacetic acid TCA precipitation of total cellular proteins following pulse labeling was decreased only about 15 by expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 Fig 5B This is consistent with reports that changes in the levels of active eIF4E have a much greater effect on the translation of specific classes of mRNA than on general translation rates 15 27 Expression of 4EBP 1 5A leads to inhibition of CDK2 activity A critical factor in p27 Kip1 mediated cell cycle arrest is inhibition of CDK2 4EBP 1 5A expression did not significantly change CDK2 protein levels see Fig 2A However there was a substantial loss of CDK2 activity as determined by an immunoprecipitation kinase assay Fig 6 This loss of CDK2 activity correlated with an increase in the amount of p27 Kip1that co immunoprecipitated with CDK2 Fig 6 At the same time the association of p27 Kip1with CDK4 was dramatically decreased Fig 6 These results suggest that 4EBP dependent cell cycle arrest involves p27 Kip1 mediated inhibition of CDK2 kinase activity Expression of constitutively active 4EBP 1 5A enhances cap independent translation through the p27 Kip15 UTR A novel finding of the experiments above is that synthesis of endogenous p27 Kip1is enhanced under conditions that are expected to reduce cap dependent translation One possibility is that the p27 Kip1mRNA is translated through a cap independent mechanism that does not require eIF4E It was recently demonstrated that elements within a 217 nucleotide sequence from the 5 UTR of the mouse p27 Kip1mRNA is able to mediate cap independent translation of a reporter gene in NIH3T3 and D6P2T cells 28 There is a high level of sequence homology between the mouse and human 5 UTRs and the major transcriptional start site is also conserved 29 Therefore it is likely the 5 UTR of the human p27 Kip1message is also able to mediate cap independent translation initiation To test this a 472 nucleotide fragment representing the full length human p27 Kip15 UTR derived from transcription initiation at the major start site was inserted into the bicistronic expression vector pGL2CAT Luc 30 In this vector the first cistron encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT is proximal to the mRNA s cap structure and therefore expected to be translated by the conventional cap dependent translation mode The second cistron encoding luciferase is downstream of the CAT stop codon and therefore must be translated by a cap independent mechanism mediated by sequence elements inserted between the two cistrons Bicistronic constructs without an insert or with the human p27 Kip15 UTR inserted in either the correct or reverse orientation were transiently expressed in MCF7 cells The cells were harvested after one day and both CAT and luciferase activities were analyzed Fig 7Aand 7B Expression of CAT was nearly identical with all three constructs and was therefore independent of an insert between the two coding regions In contrast only the construct carrying the p27 Kip15 UTR insert in the correct orientation expressed a significant level of luciferase The ratio of luciferase CAT was enhanced approximately 12 fold by the human 5 UTR Fig 7B Thus the full length human p27 Kip15 UTR is able to mediate cap independent translation in a manner similar to that previously shown for the 217 nucleotide sequence of the mouse 5 UTR 28 The effect of constitutively active 4EBP 1 on the activity of the p27 Kip15 UTR was determined by cotransfecting the bicistronic construct together with an expression vector encoding 4EBP 1 5A into MCF7 cells Expression of 4EBP 1 5A led to a two fold increase in the luciferase CAT ratio Fig 7C Interestingly this is approximately the same level of increase that is observed in synthesis of endogenous p27 Kip1protein see Fig 5B Discussion In normal mitogen activated cells eIF4E activity is enhanced due to elevated transcription of the eIF4E gene a phosphorylation dependent increase in affinity for the 7 methylguanosine cap and phosphorylation dependent inactivation of the inhibitor protein 4EBP In many tumor cells eIF4E levels are elevated and overexpression of the protein in normal cultured cells causes transformation Elevated eIF4E levels enhance translation of specific mRNAs Many of these mRNAs are involved in cell cycle progression They have long GC rich 5 UTRs that can form extensive secondary structure and have been classified as weak mRNAs because they are translated inefficiently when eIF4E levels are limiting reviewed in 15 It has been proposed that when eIF4E levels are elevated these mRNAs can more effectively recruit eIF4E and its associated factors including eIF4G a scaffold protein essential in recruiting the small ribosomal subunit and eIF4A a helicase essential for scanning through secondary structures in the 5 UTR 15 27 In the experiments described here we have inducibly expressed a constitutively active form of 4EBP 1 in the human breast cancer cell line MCF7 This leads to nearly complete inhibition of cell proliferation which is associated with an increase in binding of 4EBP 1 to eIF4E This does not lead to a major drop in total protein synthesis as indicated by metabolic labeling with 35S amino acids However there are major changes in expression of two cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and p27 Kip1 Cyclin D1 levels decline to about 30 of that observed in uninduced cells and this appears to be due to a reduction in cyclin D1 mRNA levels and protein synthesis since there was no evidence for changes in cyclin D1 turnover The observed decline in cyclin D1 is expected since constitutively active 4EBP should reverse cyclin D1 expression mediated by eIF4E overexpression Interestingly others have demonstrated that eIF4E has an additional role in the nucleus A portion of the cellular eIF4E is imported into the nucleus through a mechanism that requires the protein 4E T 31 In the nucleus eIF4E is localized to specific nuclear bodies and associates with promyelocytic leukemia protein PML 32 Nuclear eIF4E appears to be involved in export of cyclin D1 mRNA to the cytosol 25 Both 4E T and PML interact with the same domain of eIF4E that binds 4EBP 32 Thus expression of constitutively active 4EBP may block nuclear functions of eIF4E one consequence being a reduction in cyclin D1 mRNA that can be translated in the cytoplasm In contrast to cyclin D1 p27 Kip1levels increase when 4EBP 1 5A is expressed An interesting note is that the p27 Kip1mRNA has a long 5 UTR that is 65 GC and is predicted to form stable secondary structures 29 Thus even though it shares these characteristics with the putative weak mRNAs that require elevated eIF4E activity for efficient translation p27 Kip1responds in an opposite manner Part of this can be explained by the fact that the p27 Kip15 UTR is able to promote cap independent translation When placed between the CAT and luciferase coding regions in a bicistronic mRNA the 5 UTR stimulates high level expression of the downstream coding region luciferase This property is shared by the highly homologous mouse p27 Kip15 UTR 28 Coexpression of 4EBP 1 5A with the bicistronic construct containing the p27 Kip15 UTR leads to an approximately two fold increase in cap independent expression This increase is similar to that observed for endogenous p27 Kip1in cells induced to express 4EBP 1 5A The mechanism by which 4EBP 1 5A could mediate enhanced translation through the p27 Kip15 UTR is not presently known One possibility is that binding of 4EBP 1 to eIF4E releases other initiation factors that are in limited supply but also required for cap independent initiation Inhibition of cell proliferation by 4EBP 1 5A correlates with a large decrease in CDK2 activity This is not due to a decline in CDK2 or cyclin E protein levels Rather it corresponds to enhanced binding of p27 Kip1to the cyclin E CDK2 complex This is probably mediated by two separate mechanisms First downregulation of cyclin D1 leads to release of p27 Kip1sequestered by the cyclin D1 CDK4 complex This is indicated by a large decrease in co immunoprecipitation of p27 Kip1with CDK4 upon induction of 4EBP 1 5A Second de novo synthesis contributes to the pool of cellular p27 Kip1that is available to bind the cyclin E CDK2 complex Given its role in control of cell proliferation and in tumorigenesis there is interest in targeting the pathways that control eIF4E activity for cancer chemotherapy Clinical trials using the rapamycin analog CCI 779 show promise for this strategy 22 Rapamycin and its synthetic analogs block mTOR kinase activity leading to dephosphorylation of 4EBP and other mTOR substrates MCF7 cells are sensitive to rapamycin analogs in the low nM range 33 A potential problem with the use of rapamycin and its analogs is that some tumors are intrinsically resistant to its effects 33 34 Resistance in mammalian cells has been associated with decreased expression of 4EBP 1 35 mutations in the ATM protein 36 and low level expression of p27 Kip1due to enhanced turnover of the protein 37 In addition it has been demonstrated that fibroblasts from p27 Kip1knockout mice are more resistant to the effects of rapamycin than normal cells 37 Thus p27 Kip1is an important mediator of cell growth inhibition in response to rapamycin Many tumor cells express very low levels of p27 Kip1and this is correlated with poor prognosis If rapamycin and its analogs are to be developed as useful antitumor agents it will be important to determine how p27 Kip1levels affect responsiveness to these compounds Rapamycin and its analogs affect all of the downstream targets of mTOR including p70 S6 kinase and other components of the translation machinery The data presented here indicate that direct inhibition of eIF4E may be more effective and a more specific means of targeting tumor cells than treatment with rapamycin It will be important to determine if direct inhibition of eIF4E is able to arrest the cell cycle in rapamycin resistant tumors If so it may be possible to develop reagents that target eIF4E activity thereby bypassing the upstream signaling events in the pathway Methods Cell culture MCF7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum FCS 100 U
