 Background The Sec dependent protein export pathway of Escherichia coli is responsible for translocation of secretory proteins across the inner membrane to final destinations in the periplasm or outer membrane Secretory proteins also called preproteins are synthesized with a cleavable amino terminal signal sequence that functions both to slow folding of the preprotein and to aid in recognition of the secretory protein by export factors Export of many but not all secretory proteins is dependent on interaction with SecB a cytoplasmic chaperone that maintains the preprotein in a loosely folded conformation competent for translocation Both SecB and the preprotein provide binding sites for SecA a peripheral membrane ATPase SecA targets the preprotein to the membranous translocase complex composed of SecY SecE SecG SecD SecF and YajC Formation of the complete translocase complex promotes an ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle by SecA that results in segmental translocation of the secretory protein across the membrane 1 2 3 4 The signal sequence is crucial for efficient translocation mutations in the signal sequence significantly reduce export of the preprotein and complete deletions of the signal sequence eliminate essentially all export 5 6 7 8 Selection for extragenic suppressors of such export defective preproteins led to the identification of the prl alleles of secY prlA secE prlG secA prlD and more recently secG prlH 6 9 10 11 Early hypotheses predicted that the Prl suppressors function by expanded or altered interactions with signal sequences facilitating recognition of mutant as well as wild type signal sequences 6 More recent observations support an alternative mechanism of action for the PrlA SecY and PrlG SecE suppressors 8 12 First PrlA G mediated suppression does not exhibit allele specificity all prlA and all prlG alleles that have been examined suppress all signal sequence mutations implying that suppression is not due to a specific altered interaction that allows recognition of a mutant signal sequence 8 12 Furthermore all of the prlA and prlG alleles suppress complete deletions of the signal sequence suggesting that an interaction between the signal sequence and the Prl suppressor is not necessary for suppression or even for export 5 8 13 Based on these observations it was proposed that the PrlA and PrlG suppressors do not function through altered interactions with signal sequences but rather by loss of recognition 8 12 The wild type SecE and SecY proteins are thought to function in concert to proofread the signal sequence of secretory proteins rejecting defective precursors from the export pathway The PrlA SecY and PrlG SecE suppressors are compromised in their ability to proofread allowing export of proteins with mutations or even complete deletions of the signal sequence This proofreading model predicts that the critical step for translocation of a signal sequence defective secretory protein is recognition by SecB and subsequent presentation to SecE Y SecB binds portions of the mature secretory protein 14 15 16 17 18 and SecA would bind to the SecB precursor complex by virtue of its ability to bind SecB 19 20 as well as the preprotein 21 22 23 Thus SecA mediated targeting of the preprotein to translocase would occur In a wild type cell the mutant precursor would be rejected at this point by SecY E but in a PrlA or PrlG suppressor strain rejection would not occur and the mutant secretory protein would be exported In fact all of the PrlA and PrlG suppressors are completely dependent on functional SecB for manifestation of suppressor activity 5 8 Even certain proteins that are not normally SecB dependent for translocation become SecB dependent when they contain a signal sequence mutation and are exported via the suppressor pathway For example PhoA is normally exported independent of SecB Deletion of the signal sequence from phoA severely compromises export export is restored in a prlA suppressor strain However this suppression is dependent on SecB 5 Therefore there are characteristics of the mature portion of PhoA that promote recognition by SecB and this recognition is essential for PrlA mediated suppression Although prlA and prlG strains export secretory proteins that completely lack a signal sequence there is no evidence of export of any cytoplasmic proteins in a prl suppressor strain 13 That is proteins that are supposed to remain in the cytoplasm are not mislocalized to the periplasm It has been suggested that perhaps cytoplasmic proteins are not exported in prl suppressor strains because they fold rapidly and escape recognition by SecB while secretory proteins even those lacking a signal sequence fold more slowly allowing time for SecB recognition and binding 5 13 SecB binds to a variety of unfolded proteins in vitro 24 25 although binding appears to be more selective in vivo 26 This selectivity may be based on the slower folding characteristics of secretory proteins Therefore we proposed previously that if a cytoplasmic protein contains a mutation that slows its rate of folding SecB will recognize and bind to that mutant protein Binding of SecB would result in targeting of the unfolded protein to the translocation apparatus According to the proofreading model in a wild type strain SecE and SecY would reject the unfolded protein due to lack of a signal sequence In a Prl suppressor strain however the proofreading function would be compromised and the mutant protein would be exported 8 In the experiments described here we tested this hypothesis by examining the export of such a cytoplasmic protein with a folding mutation The results indicate that slow folding is not sufficient for SecB binding and subsequent targeting to translocase and further that secretory proteins contain targeting information in addition to the signal sequence and the folding kinetics Results and Discussion Localization of N 102LTand LA57 N 102LT Plasmids pKL106 and pKL107 encoding LA57 N 102LT FLAG or N 102LT FLAG respectively were transformed into strains IM104 wild type secY or IM105 prlA4 These strains contained deletion mutations in the lon and degP genes to limit proteolysis in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic spaces Following induction of the repressor fragment whole cell lysates spheroplasts and periplasmic fractions were prepared from each strain Samples were analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies directed against the FLAG epitope present at the carboxyl terminus of the repressor fragments According to our hypothesis the largely unfolded nature of LA57 N 102LTshould allow SecB to bind resulting in targeting of LA57 N 102LTto translocase In the secY wild type strain proofreading by SecE Y would block export of LA57 N 102LT while in the prlA4 strain the PrlA4 suppressor would allow export of a portion of LA57 N 102LTto the periplasm This was not the result we observed Fig 1 No LA57 N 102LTwas detected in the periplasm even in the prlA4 strain indicating that export did not occur to any significant extent To ensure that all periplasmic contents were released during the spheroplast preparation the blots were stripped of FLAG antibody and reprobed with antibody directed against MalE a periplasmic binding protein All detectable MalE was present in the periplasmic fractions data not shown demonstrating that complete release of the periplasmic contents had been attained Therefore there was no detectable export of LA57 N 102LTin the prlA4 strain There were two reasonable explanations for this unexpected finding 1 an unfolded state is not sufficient for SecB binding or 2 SecB binding is not sufficient to promote export in a prl suppressor strain To distinguish between these possibilities we examined whether SecB was able to bind LA57 N 102LTusing two different methods to identify interactions The first approach was co immunoprecipitation of LA57 N 102LT SecB complexes the second was an in vitro protease protection assay Co immunoprecipitation of SecB complexes Co immunoprecipitations were performed using whole cell lysates of strains induced for expression of repressor Immunoprecipitations were performed as described using antibodies directed either against SecB or against the His tag on the repressor Following the immunoprecipitation reaction samples were analyzed by Western blotting using the opposite antibody that is samples that had been immunoprecipitated with anti SecB were examined with anti His while those that had been precipitated with anti His were probed with anti SecB In addition as a positive control the interaction of SecB with the secretory protein LamB was examined using anti LamB antibodies While an interaction between LamB and SecB was clearly seen Fig 2c no interaction was observed between SecB and either N 102LTor LA57 N 102LT Fig 2aand 2b This was true regardless of whether the precipitating antibody was directed against SecB or the His tag The wild type N 102LTwas not expected to interact with SecB as it would fold very rapidly and stably it was more surprising that no interaction was detected between SecB and the destabilized LA57 N 102LT This result implied that the unfolded nature of LA57 N 102LTwas not sufficient for SecB binding Protease protection assays To substantiate the results observed by co immunoprecipitation an in vitro protease protection assay was employed SecB has a proteolytic sensitive domain that is cleaved by proteinase K in a limited proteolysis reaction When substrate is bound to SecB the conformation is altered such that the site is no longer protease accessible rendering SecB protease resistant 28 Thus this assay can be used to detect binding of SecB to a substrate Poly L lysine and small peptides are routinely used as substrates for this analysis as demonstrated in Fig 3 lanes 3 and 4 To determine whether a larger protein was also able to protect SecB we used purified urea denatured proOmpA as a substrate The proOmpA also was able to bind to and protect SecB Fig 3 lanes 9 and 10 although a much higher concentration of substrate was required to achieve 50 protection To ensure that the observed protection was not due simply to the high protein concentration in the reaction a non secretory protein was used as a negative control BSA was added to the same concentration or higher as proOmpA with no resultant protection of SecB data not shown Therefore this assay reliably serves as an additional method to observe SecB substrate interactions The repressor proteins were purified on a nickel affinity chromatography column by virtue of the His tag at the carboxyl terminus of the proteins Each was assayed for protection of SecB at concentrations up to and exceeding that used for proOmpA Neither N 102LTnor LA57 N 102LTprotected SecB from proteolysis indicating that no binding occurred Fig 3 lanes 5 8 Although the mutant LA57 N 102LTis predicted to be in an unfolded conformation in the bacterial cell the protease protection assay was performed at 4 C To verify that refolding of LA57 N 102LTat this temperature was not interfering with interpretation of the results we further tested the SecB binding activity by incubating LA57 N 102LTin 8 M urea then diluting it into the protection reaction similar to the conditions used for proOmpA Again no protection was detected data not shown These results demonstrated that even when fully unfolded LA57 N 102LTwas not a substrate for SecB binding Conclusions The hypothesis driving the present studies was premised on the observation that prl suppressor strains are able to correctly identify secretory proteins even in the absence of a signal sequence It has been widely thought that this recognition was due to slow folding of secretory proteins in the cytoplasm resulting in binding by SecB and subsequent targeting to translocase While slow folding may be a necessary criterion for export the data presented here indicate that an unfolded nature is not sufficient for SecB binding and targeting This conclusion is based on failure of the LA57 N 102LTprotein to bind SecB either in vivo or in vitro The in vivo results are founded both on the co immunoprecipitation experiments and on the fact that no export of the protein was detected in a prlA4 strain while the in vitro results are based on the protease protection assays Therefore we conclude that secretory proteins must contain information in addition to the signal sequence and slow folding characteristics that targets them to the secretory pathway or that cytoplasmic proteins contain information that prevents export even if the folding parameters are altered Further studies are underway to identify such targeting sequences Methods Bacterial strains and plasmids All bacterial strains used were derivatives of E coli K12 strain MC4100 29 IM104 is MC4100
