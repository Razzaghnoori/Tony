 so what do you think about it how are we doing in recycling are we well i think we need to do more i i mean i know i need to do more they have programs around where you can reach they uh they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up um hum but i have a hard time of being able of separating you know having a place separating my trash and get all the cans from the paper and you know i just haven t gotten that dedicated yet so yeah yeah and see i do a lot of work with the boy scouts and we try to do a lot uh huh but there s still a lot more we can do you know i don t recycle my newspapers myself but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a yeah like a a clothes hamper kind of thing that you know you lay your string in then you put your papers in there and tie them all up and bundle them up so i figured i might get me one of those uh huh uh huh because we don t always read the newspaper sometimes it just sits around for a while and then we just chuck it yeah well i don t i don t get the paper every day but i you know i get it on i try to buy you know the early edition for the coupons you know the Sunday edition so yeah but then i just you know bundle it up and put it on the front you know the front walk every you know every Monday or every other Monday and yeah have them pick that up but that s the extent of what i ve done i d like to be able to do more the problem is with a lot of it is you have to go you know it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it you know it s not always convenient to do it yeah see and yeah see and here in Lubbock everything s so close i can imagine what it s like up there yeah i m not exactly sure where the you know the can thing is but you know sometimes it s just so seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash and have them pick it up than it is to smash the cans and drive it some place to have them yeah yeah see i went out to Payless Cashways here a couple of days ago as a matter of fact and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall uh huh and then i put me a little five gallon bucket and it s just outside the garage door so every time we drink a Coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket uh huh do those can crushers work good yeah i got one from Payless Cashways and it s actually metal uh huh it s not plastic i didn t want to buy a plastic one yeah because those things i think would just snap you know yeah but Payless Cashways has them and they re metal and i don t know what affiliate of Payless Cashways you have up there but it was only like seven dollars not too bad oh so i d have to check into something like that because i mean we don t drink a whole lot of soda around here you know but um yeah you know occasionally we have some around but you know for other kind of cans just to it d probably only take aluminum cans like that don t they yeah i don t yeah i don t think it would crush steel cans it s pretty tough yeah so i don t know i don t think you have to to crush the other ones for them to get to take that but no you could probably just you know i need to look into it more you know it s you know it sometimes even with the newspaper they say they ll only take certain types of paper you know they won t take paper that s shiny yeah they won t yeah they won t take any lint free paper or see i work at TI yeah so does my husband yeah and we do a lot of recycling out there now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard but that s just now come on board uh huh uh huh you know we ve been throwing paper out there away for years and we re just now getting on board to recycling ever since this big Earth Day thing came out you know uh huh yeah i don t know what you know i haven t i m sure they re probably doing that here some yeah i m sure they are TI is doing it pretty well nationwide i m sure uh huh i think it s necessary i i like it you know it makes i think it s good that you see these you know like boxes cereal they re now starting to make them you know the packages out of recycled paper and oh yeah and i ve bought you know i ve bought greeting cards that are made out of recycled paper and i think they re just fine yeah yeah i bought a i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work it s his birthday we re pretty good friends and what it is is a recycled paper bag uh huh and it s just got Happy Birthday printing on it and a cute little phrase inside and it s just a paper bag uh huh you know and it s really cute yeah but i think we re doing better and better all the time i still don t yeah i think we re getting becoming more conscious because we just can t stick everything in landfills any more so no there s not going to be any room shortly no no you know i don t know what New York does about theirs i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere yeah it s probably sitting out on the barge somewhere yeah so but i think we re getting better at it i think there s quite a bit more we could do yeah yeah girls put that away now but you re right sometimes it does seem like it s more trouble than what it would be worth but yeah i just wish it was a little more convenient convenient to do you know yeah seems like you re so busy anyway and then that s just one more thing to have to worry about so yeah it sure is i think if you know the cities locally you know they d get more programs going so that you could do that it d make it a lot easier so yeah yeah well they ll get at it sooner i guess the schools will get into it too sooner or later they yeah yeah get the kids interested in it too so you know they have we tried to have a aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have and we just don t have any place to store those kind of cans yeah you know if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people sure they ll save them for us there s no problem there but what do you do with them in the meantime now i don t want a can a garage full of cans uh huh that s right that s right who does that you know people don t have room for that kind of stuff you know no they re just not they re not prepared for it no and in Texas they re just get things like that they just get bugs in them so yeah yeah they do and you know the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get that s for sure so you don t that s right so so i m pretty lazy about it right now everything goes into one thing and goes out to the you know pick it up so yeah yeah myself about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans uh huh s o yeah well i need to get better get better at it so well if we all try a little bit a little bit goes a long way you know yeah that s right that s right if everybody tries to do just a little bit and a little bit more then that s true we ll get there that s right well thank you for talking to me yeah well thank you for calling i sure no problem okay take care all righty bye bye bye bye
