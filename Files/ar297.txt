 Introduction AS is an inflammatory rheumatic disease mainly involving the axial skeleton Forty percent of AS patients develop periphery mono oligoarthritis 1 The SM of inflamed peripheral joints in AS Fig 1 in certain cases resembles RA with intense mononuclear cell infiltration forming foci similar to germinal centers GC that contain B and T lymphocytes as well as plasma cells 2 3 Recent immunohistologic analysis of five AS SMs demonstrated B cell rich infiltrates in two cases whereas no B cells were detected in the three others 4 The VH germline repertoire consists of 123 44 functional VH segments subdivided into seven VH families see supplementary material Antibodies are encoded by one VH segment rearranged to one or several of 25 heavy chain diversity segments DHs and one of six JHs 5 The locus of rearrangement individual for each B lymphocyte clone is the CDR3 6 Only rearrangements with translatable nucleotide triplets lead to antibody formation others are nonfunctional There is a biased use of particular germline VH genes in the VH repertoire An over representation of VH4 genes in the autoimmune repertoire has been described 7 8 A negative selection of VH4 takes place in the peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy individuals as a means of avoiding autoimmunity 9 An antigen driven immune response characterized by a ratio of mutations leading to amino acid replacement to silent mutations R S ratio 3 10 within the complementarity determining region CDR takes place within the GC of lymphatic organs Similar clonal development of antibody VH genes has been demonstrated in the SM in RA patients 11 12 13 14 15 and in reactive arthritis ReA patients 16 The B cell subset in AS joints has not yet been characterized We analyzed the repertoire and distribution of rearranged VH genes to elucidate B lymphocyte involvement in AS and to investigate similarities to and differences from RA Materials and methods Tissue preparation and staining A SM of the right hip was obtained from a 57 year old man who had suffered from AS for 30 years requiring total endoprothetic joint replacement Frozen sections 8 m of the immediately snap frozen tissue sample were screened for B and T cells by double immunohistological staining with anti CD20 and anti CD3 monoclonal antibodies using the alkaline phosphatase anti alkaline phosphatase and streptavidin biotin horseradish peroxidase technique 17 18 The stained B lymphocytes from serial sections taken at 50 m intervals were isolated by microdissection and DNA preparation followed see supplementary material VH PCR DNA was subjected to a semi nested PCR for VH genes see supplementary material Thirty five cycles of PCR using a mix of six oligonucleotides specific for the different VH families as primers at the 5 end and a mix of oligonucleotides corresponding to the known JH overlapping to a part of the intron sequence as primers at the 3 end were followed by 35 cycles with 1 l of the first PCR products and individual VH and JH primers at a more 5 position Table 1 A similar PCR without DNA was run as a negative control Template generation and sequence analysis PCR products of the expected 350 base pair bp length were detected by standard agarose gel electrophoresis and purified The purified DNA template was bacterially subcloned followed by plasmid isolation and sequencing Sequences were analyzed by homology comparison with the EMBL and GenBank gene databases see supplementary material Results The VH gene usage Except for the negative control all VH PCRs led to a product of the expected length 350 bp All sequences reported in the present paper are accessible on the EMBL database Seventy individually rearranged VH genes were characterized by sequence analysis Table 2 14 20 belonged to the VH1 family 3 4 to VH2 38 54 to VH3 7 10 to VH4 and 8 11 belonged to the VH5 family No sequences corresponded to VH6 Fig 2 Twelve genes in all were nonfunctionally rearranged with the highest proportion in VH3 18 about 14 in VH1 VH4 and VH5 and none in VH2 VH1 genes Fourteen individual rearrangements represented VH1 genes The most often represented VH1 gene was DP75 four products followed by DP10 DP14 DP21 and DP25 two products each Out of 14 distinct VH1 DH JH sequences 2 were nonfunctional 14 CDR3 lengths varied between 18 and 39 bp mean 28 5 bp Four of the VH1 products F5 2c4 F5 3a4 F5 3b4 and 5c 4m6 deriving from different slides had an identically rearranged CDR3 and consecutively represent members of an expanding B lymphocyte clone Fig 3a With 99 homology to DP21 they shared three mutations within the framework region FR Five productively rearranged genes were highly mutated with a range of 12 F5 3a3 to 29 mutations to their respective germline gl gene The R S ratio for the CDR was 3 and lower for the FR indicating antigen driven mutation 10 VH2 genes Three different VH2 rearrangements were determined All were potentially functional and 95 homologous to the respective gl gene The number of mutations ranged from 2 5c VH22s to 10 5c VH26s R S ratios were quite low with a maximum of 2 0 in the CDR 5c VH26s CDR3 lengths varied between 15 and 45 bp mean 32 bp VH3 genes Thirty eight different VH3 rearrangements were characterized eight were most homologous to DP47 V3 23 21 five to DP50 13 four each to DP54 and DP31 11 respectively and three each to DP49 DP35 DP51 and DP77 8 respectively Seven 18 4 VH3 genes were nonfunctionally rearranged CDR3 lengths varied from 6 to 35 bp mean 27 2 bp One case of clonal expansion within the VH3 genes was observed represented by the VH3 JH4 rearrangements 3a 19m6 and 2c 19m8 Fig 3b These genes with 95 5 homology to DP54 shared four replacement mutations and six mutations each were localized at different positions Twenty three of the VH3 sequences were highly mutated 10 27 mutations Except for one case most of the mutations were localized in the CDR with R S ratio 3 Three of seven nonfunctionally rearranged genes also revealed a pattern of antigen induced mutation VH4 genes Seven different VH4 rearrangements could be characterized six were potentially functional CDR3 lengths ranged from 12 to 45 bp mean 28 bp The gl genes HUMIGHCAK HUMIGHCAG and DP63 were represented twice each and DP71 once No homology to DP64 VH4 34 VH4 21 was seen Five of the sequences had few mutations one to eight with a R S ratio higher in the FR than in the CDR Two VH4 rearrangements had a R S ratio 3 in the CDR 5c VH44a and 3b VH45a VH5 genes Eight distinct VH5 rearrangements could be determined seven were potentially functional CDR3 lengths ranged from 12 to 66 bp mean 39 8 bp The 3a VH54s gene was unmutated There were 7 35 mutations in all other sequences For five sequences four were potentially functional the mutational pattern revealed antigen induction Discussion VH PCR Analysis of rearranged VH genes from B lymphocyte DNA by PCR and sequencing enabled characterization of the clonal expansion and mutational patterns without bias due to cell isolation procedures By semi nested PCR otherwise used for single cell analysis 19 one sole VH DH JH rearrangement might be identified Besides the extreme sensitivity there is a high risk of artificial amplifications because of contamination A negative control without DNA was run with each PCR as a precaution no contamination was detected We cannot exclude the fact that highly mutated genes are amplified less efficiently 20 However since the respective data concerning RA and ReA have been established by similar PCR approaches 11 12 13 14 15 16 a comparison is possible The VH gene usage Within 70 VH DH JH rearrangements characterized in this study all known human VH families except VH6 were represented The descending order of representation was VH3 54 VH1 20 VH5 11 VH4 10 VH2 4 Compared with the germline representation 5 an over representation of VH5 and an under representation of VH4 genes were remarkable The representation of VH1 VH2 and VH3 genes corresponded to their respective germline representation Our previous studies of the VH gene repertoire in RA SM 13 and studies using a hybridoma approach 8 revealed an over representation of VH4 and a biased set of represented VH4 genes A positive selection of VH4 genes particularly within the plasma cell subset was recently demonstrated in RA and ReA 16 The DP64 VH4 34 VH4 21 gene encoding anti I and anti i specificity of cold agglutinins 21 22 as well as anti DNA antibodies in lupus erythmatosus 23 was not detected within the VH4 genes from AS SM Another autoimmunity prone gene the DP47 V3 23 gene was also predominant in AS All of eight V3 23 derived genes were potentially functional rearrangements with 3 mutations to the gl sequence and four reveal a R S ratio 3 within the CDR that indicates a selection by antigen V3 23 was also predominant in RA SM 24 A comparison of the peripheral repertoire revealed that V3 23 was more often somatically mutated in RA than in healthy controls 9 25 26 Except for VH4 VH5 and VH6 the representation of VH genes was similar to results from the peripheral VH repertoire from healthy donors 27 9 as well as from a RA patient 28 Clonal expansion Only two cases of clonal expansion characterized by identically rearranged segments were detected on different slides An accumulation of further point mutations in the course of intraclonal diversification was seen in two offspring of a VH3 clone both share four mutations and differ in six point mutations Studies on plasma cells in ReA and RA SMs 16 reveal clonal expansion In RA SMs clonal B lymphocyte expansion in different areas of the tissue samples 11 15 and recirculation within different joints and blood were reported 14 The CDR3 The CDR3 lengths of genes from the AS samples were short with a median of 27 2 nucleotides A high variability particularly in the productively rearranged subset and in the VH5 family was noted A similarly high variability was shown for polyreactive antibodies and rheumatic factors in RA 29 Our data from RA SM revealed almost homogeneous CDR3 lengths of intermediate size 13 CDR3 were much longer in the healthy peripheral repertoire particularly within nonfunctional rearrangements mean 54 nucleotides 9 Mutational pattern Only nine rearrangements were not mutated R S ratios 3 within the CDR were observed in 30 genes two were nonfunctional Members of the VH1 VH3 VH4 and VH5 families carried more somatic mutations than the VH2 genes Mutational pattern and frequency determine about one half of the characterized genes as memory B cells that probably stay in contact with persistent antigens in the micro environment of the synovial foci 30 A similar accumulation of memory cells in RA SM has been reported 12 31 Besides the highly mutated genes already described one half of the characterized genes showed no evidence of antigen induced mutations with low R S ratios within the CDR There was a bias to silent mutations in four highly mutated genes 2c 3m4b 2c 21m3 3a 19m8 and 2c 17m9 This pattern of mutations has been described for cold agglutinins 32 as well as for rheumatic factors as a mechanism of selection against amino acid replacement to prevent the generation of high affinity autoantibodies 33 Nonfunctional rearrangements Except for VH2 none and VH3 18 nonfunctional rearrangements had an equal proportion of 13 14 in each family within the genes characterized in the present paper Except for a bias to VH4 a similar overall proportion of nonfunctional rearrangements was seen in the peripheral blood of healthy donors using single cell PCR of genomic DNA 9 In contrast no bias to elevated CDR3 lengths was seen Conclusion An active immune reaction with GC formation occurs in the inflamed SM in AS B cell affinity maturation with generation of somatically mutated antibody coding genes characteristic for memory cells occurs in these GC formations indicating an antigen driven response Comparable with RA and ReA there is a biased repertoire of selected VH genes whereas the panel of represented genes is different and clonal expansion was observed less frequently Supplementary material Introduction By sequence homology of at least 80 the VH gene segments are classified into seven families The VH1
