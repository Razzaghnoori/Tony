 Background Escherichia coli like many enteric and soil bacteria can respire anaerobically by using a variety of amine N oxides and methyl sulfoxides as electron acceptors This ability depends on the regulated synthesis of a membrane bound DMSO dimethylsulfoxide and or TMAO trimethylamine N oxide reductase enzyme Use of these compounds in E coli occurs by a broad substrate enzyme encoded by the dmsABC operon located at 20 minutes on the chromosome 1 2 3 The 100 fold activation of dmsABC gene expression in response to anaerobiosis is controlled by the Fnr regulatory protein 4 Following a re examination the dmsABC P1 transcription start site was located 223 nucleotides upstream of the translational start of dmsA 5 6 This centers the Fnr binding site TTGATnnnnAACAA at 41 5 bp from the dmsABC P1 promoter as also established by DNase I footprinting analyses 7 8 The presence of nitrate a preferred alternative electron acceptor elicits a 10 fold repression of dmsABC expression via the NarXLQP two component regulatory system 4 9 10 Nitrate is detected by either of the two sensor transmitter proteins NarX or NarQ which then activate the DNA binding response regulatory protein NarL by phosphorylating an aspartate residue located at position 59 NarL phosphate then negatively regulates dmsABC operon expression 4 Additional regulators of dmsABC expression have also been described that involve molybdenum dependent gene expression via the ModE transcription factor and integration host factor IHF that interacts with DNA at a downstream site called P2 4 6 11 12 Neither the presence of TMAO nor DMSO substrates for the DMSO reductase further modulate dmsABC gene expression 4 6 In this study the control of dmsABC gene expression by Fnr and NarL was investigated Mutagenesis of the Fnr recognition sequence at the dmsA promoter region confirmed the contribution of Fnr in the 100 fold activation of dmsABC expression and explored the DNA sequence and spacing requirements for the Fnr recognition site at the P1 promoter The region of dmsA promoter DNA protected by the NarL regulatory protein was identified by DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments These studies define the molecular interactions of Fnr and NarL at the dmsABC P1 promoter that together provide for the oxygen and nitrate regulated expression of this respiratory pathway operon Results and Discussion Effect of cis acting mutations in the Fnr binding site on anaerobic induction of dmsA lacZexpression To investigate the effects of sequence changes in the dmsA Fnr recognition site on the anaerobic activation of dmsA lacZ expression site directed mutagenesis and galactosidase assays were performed Figure 1 Since the native Fnr binding site at the dmsA P1 promoter differs from the Fnr consensus recognition sequence TTGATnnnnATCAA 13 by one base pair bp in the right half site e g A A CAA vs ATCAA the Fnr site was converted to the consensus sequence and analyzed for galactosidase activity under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions A 3 fold increase in anaerobic activation of dmsA lacZ expression was observed for the consensus Fnr site 300 fold relative to the 114 fold anaerobic activation by Fnr seen for the native dmsA sequence Figure 1 JA303 and JA250 respectively The JA303 consensus mutant fnr strain exhibited a 1000 fold anaerobic increase in galactosidase expression relative to the corresponding fnr strain i e 22 200 vs 19 units To our knowledge this consensus Fnr dependent dmsA promoter exhibits the highest anaerobic induction of any Fnr regulated E coli promoter examined The enhanced ability of Fnr to activate dmsABC gene expression is possibly by analogy to Crp due to increased affinity of Fnr at the consensus versus the native non consensus Fnr recognition sequence at dmsA Likewise the poor match of the Fnr site at the promoter for the fumarate reductase gene frdA to the consensus Fnr sequence may account for the relatively weak anaerobic induction for this respiratory operon 14 Several additional DNA sequence changes were introduced into the dmsA promoter region to alter the Fnr recognition sequence as well as to alter the spacing between the Fnr site and the RNA polymerase recognition sequences Figure 1 A single base substitution in the left half site when combined with the Fnr consensus sequence at the right half site exhibited a 138 fold activation of dmsA lacZ expression Figure 1 JA450 an induction equivalent to the wild type dmsA promoter that has the symmetrical deviation in the right half site ca 114 fold Thus the left and right half sites are equivalent in their ability to confer Fnr dependent activation of dmsA gene expression by RNA polymerase This is in contrast to the requirement for the left half site of the Fnr1 regulatory site needed for Fnr dependent repression at the cydA P1 promoter 15 When a two base pair change was introduced into the left Fnr half site e g TTGAT to TT AG T of the native dmsA sequence it nearly abolished the anaerobic induction of dmsA lacZ expression Figure 1 JA257 The deletion of the entire left half site Fnr sequence while preserving the right half site as consensus exhibited similar results JA304 Hence a single Fnr half site is not sufficient to allow Fnr dependent activation of the E coli DMSO reductase genes To evaluate how the spacing between the Fnr binding site and the start of dmsA transcription alters the anaerobic activation of dmsA lacZ expression single basepair insertions were introduced at position 35 JA448 and JA449 The 114 fold anaerobic activation seen for the wild type dmsA promoter was reduced to about 35 fold in each of the two mutants Figure 1 indicating that the position of the Fnr site at the wild type dmsA promoter is important for controlling optimal dmsA gene expression Thus the dmsA promoter exhibits a preference for 41 5 target sites like other Fnr regulated class II promoters 16 By analogy to the CAP transcription regulator 17 18 the proposed mechanism for Fnr activation of gene expression involves its ability to promote open complex formation by RNA polymerase 13 16 19 As suggested by the appearance of DNase I hypersensitive cleavage sites a change in the DNA conformation occurs upon Fnr binding at the dmsA promoter 7 8 The presence of hypersensitive DNase I cleavage sites at other FNR regulated promoters as well as DNA bending experiments support this conclusion 8 20 Furthermore recent studies propose the protein protein interaction of 70and Fnr at the narG and dmsA promoters 7 21 22 23 Finally for each of the site directed mutations of the Fnr binding site in this study the level of dmsA lacZ expression was not significantly altered in an fnr deletion strain either aerobically or anaerobically indicating that the Fnr independent expression from the dmsA promoter was not affected by the sequence alterations Figure 1 Location of NarL binding sites at the dmsApromoter Under anaerobic conditions dmsA expression is repressed approximately 10 fold by NarL when nitrate is present 4 Although three putative NarL sites have been proposed based on their similarity to a NarL consensus recognition sequence TACYYMT Y C or T M A or C 24 25 26 no in vivo or in vitro information is available regarding the location of the NarL site s within the dmsA regulatory region To evaluate where NarL binds DNase I footprinting experiments were performed using a dmsA promoter fragment corresponding to 127 to 62 relative to the start of transcription at P1 When NarL phosphate was incubated with the coding strand of DNA a 76 bp region was protected that extends from position 48 to 28 relative to the start of dmsA transcription Figure 2 open rectangle DNase I hypersensitive cutting sites were seen at positions 32 31 30 18 4 18 19 41 and 53 relative to the start of transcription The DNase I footprint of the non coding strand of dmsA with phosphorylated NarL revealed an 83 bp protected region that extends from 51 to 32 relative to the start of transcription Figure 3 DNase I hypersensitive cutting was observed at positions 27 4 3 10 20 21 22 and 32 For the non coding DNA strand the size of the DNase I footprint pattern appears to increase when higher levels of NarL phosphate are present DNase I protection first occurs within the 10 to 15 region followed by an extension to the 25 to 50 region and then finally the 20 region The size of the protected region did not change further when up to five fold higher amounts of NarL phosphate were used 10 M data not shown Thus the sizes of the protected regions on each strand concur Furthermore non phosphorylated NarL gave no DNase I protections in the dmsA promoter region under the same conditions for either strand up to 10 M suggesting that NarL phosphate but not NarL can act as a transcriptional repressor for dmsA expression The protections for both strands are consistent with the binding of multiple molecules of NarL to the DNA Hydroxyl radical footprinting of the NarL interactions with dmsA promoter DNA was also performed for both strands of DNA Figure 2and 3 In hydroxyl radical footprinting the small highly reactive hydroxyl radical OH attacks the deoxyribose sugars along the DNA backbone with no sequence or base specificity thereby providing a high resolution of structural information 27 28 A total of eight to nine distinct hydroxyl radical protected regions were observed of three to five basepairs in size for each DNA strand that extended over a 97 bp region Figure 4 These NarL phosphate protections extended from position 59 to 38 consistent with the results of the DNase I footprinting experiments described above The hydroxyl radical protected regions for the dmsA strands of DNA were offset by 3 bp in the 3 direction Figure 4 This offset suggests that the NarL protein either occludes the minor groove of DNA or that the DNA conformation is distorted upon NarL binding In the former case the DNA backbone sites located closest to one another are across the minor groove and separated in sequence by 3 bp 28 29 30 The second proposal is supported by a recent 2 2 angstrom NarL DNA structure for NarL C terminal domain complexed to a synthetic 7 2 7 NarL consensus binding site where the protein causes a conformational change of B DNA to A DNA Ann Maris personal communication Furthermore the hydroxyl radical protected regions occur at ten bp intervals a regular phasing of the helix repeat This signifies that NarL phosphate binds to only one side of the DNA molecule dmsA promoter region 27 28 29 30 The hydroxyl radical data are also consistent with the binding of multiple molecules of NarL phosphate to the dmsA promoter region as suggested by the DNase I data Therefore a simple model that accounts for the footprint data is the assembly of multiple NarL phosphate molecules onto one face of the DNA that somehow protect the minor groove from hydroxyl radical attack 28 29 30 In an alternative model NarL binds only at the three proposed NarL heptamer consensus sites spaced at 20 bp intervals within the dmsA regulatory region Figure 4 However this model is difficult to envision since the DNase I and hydroxyl radical cleavage patterns extend over seven to nine turns of DNA By either of the above models the location of the NarL phosphate protected regions suggests that NarL may compete with Fnr and or RNA polymerase for occupancy on the DNA but only when the bacteria are grown anaerobically in the presence of nitrate conditions where NarL is in the activated form No hydroxyl radical or DNase I protected regions of DNA were observed when non phosphorylated NarL protein was used at a concentration of 10 M data not shown In addition galactosidase assays revealed that the 10 fold nitrate dependent repression of dmsA lacZ expression was unaffected by the deletion of upstream DNA sequence to 71 relative to the start of dmsA transcription further pinpointing the location of the 5 end of the NarL recognition site for dmsA data not shown Furthermore the NarL footprint pattern does not extend into the dmsA P2 promoter region Therefore NarL does not appear to directly affect regulation at the P2 site unless a large DNA protein complex that involves multiple transcriptional regulators is involved i e Fnr NarL ModE and IHF in addition to RNAP Future investigation of this complex regulatory region will be needed to ascertain such a matter Finally a similar hydroxyl radical footprint pattern of 8 9 protected regions of 3 4 bp spaced 10 nucleotides apart was also observed for NarL phosphate at the promoter region of the frdA gene another anaerobically induced gene that is repressed by NarL in the presence of nitrate data not shown To establish if the entire NarL protected region is required for NarL phosphate to bind DNA a DNA fragment designated Fragment B Figure 5 containing a truncated region of the dmsA regulatory sequence was constructed The fragment extends from position 127 to 13 relative to the start of dmsA transcription at P1 Figure 4 In Fragment B two of the three consensus heptamer sites have been replaced by the multi cloning region of pGEM 11Zf Methods When examined by DNase I footprinting analysis the altered dmsA Fragment B Figure 5 lanes 6 to 9 revealed a 38 bp NarL phosphate protected region extending from position 51 to 13 This protected region spans only the wild type dmsA DNA sequences but not the adjacent foreign DNA sequences In contrast the full length dmsA fragment Fragment A 127 to 62 showed a larger protected region from 51 to 32 lanes 2 5 These findings demonstrate that the smaller dmsA region containing only one of the three consensus heptamer sites Figure 4 is sufficient for NarL binding However a somewhat weaker binding of NarL phosphate to the DNA fragment containing the truncated dmsA region relative to the full length region may suggest that NarL binds at the promoter in a weakly cooperative fashion The protections are consistent with the proposal that NarL phosphate recognizes and binds at multiple heptamer recognition sites within the dmsA P1 promoter region Three putative NarL binding sites with the consensus heptameric sequence TACYYMT have been proposed for dmsA 26 These sites previously assigned at positions 8 14 and 34 are now centered at positions 15 7 and 27 Figure 4 due to the reassignment of the dmsA P1 start site 5 6 Since the size of the DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprints in this study show DNA protections between and beyond these three consensus sites other NarL binding sites may be present in this region As the three consensus NarL boxes flank the dmsA promoter and are spaced 20 bp apart Figure 4 the spacing and orientation of the NarL protected regions make it tempting to speculate that NarL phosphate binds at each site Additional NarL phosphate monomers then assemble on the DNA to form a stable DNA protein complex Alternatively molecules of NarL phosphate may bind at both the consensus and at related NarL box sequences that contain one or two mismatches from consensus Figure 4 Inspection of the DNA reveals an additional NarL box within the protected region that has one mismatch from consensus Figure 4 dashed arrows and nineteen NarL like boxes with two mismatches dotted arrows not all shown We note that none of the three consensus heptamers solid arrows Figure 4 are arranged in a 7 2 7 sequence nor are any of the consensus heptamers paired with any of the mismatch heptamers in such an arrangement This is noteworthy since a 7 2 7 sequence has been speculated for nucleating NarL interactions at other promoters 31 Stoichiometry experiments are planned to ascertain the number of NarL molecules that bind the dmsA promoter region as are studies to mutagenize one or more of the NarL binding sites to determine the importance of the NarL consensus binding sites at the dmsA promoter Conclusions This study investigated the effects of sequence changes in the Fnr recognition site on the anaerobic activation of dmsA lacZ expression as well as examined the NarL recognition sites within the dmsABC regulatory region The data illustrates that Fnr is responsible for the 100 fold anaerobic activation of dmsA expression Also both half sites of the Fnr recognition sequence at dmsA are required for Fnr dependent expression and are similar in their ability to activate dmsA transcription Furthermore the spacing between the Fnr and RNA polymerase recognition sequences is critical at dmsA In vitro interactions of the nitrate responsive regulatory protein NarL with the promoter region of dmsABC were examined using DNase I and hydroxyl radical footprinting techniques The location of the NarL phosphate protected regions within a 97 bp segment of the dmsA promoter is consistent with the model for dmsABC expression whereby multiple molecules of NarL phosphate recognize and bind to the DNA in a weak and cooperative fashion The NarL interactions with the dmsA promoter region occurred at ten bp intervals and were offset by 3 bp in the 3 direction suggesting the assembly of multiple NarL phosphate molecules onto one face of the DNA that protect the minor groove Furthermore nonphosphorylated NarL was unable to protect the NarL binding sequences at the dmsA promoter region suggesting that phosphorylation of NarL is required for repression of dmsABC expression Materials and Methods Bacterial strains bacteriophages and plasmids The genotypes of the E coli K 12 strains plasmids and the bacteriophage used in this study are listed in Table 1and Figure 1 Strains were maintained on Luria broth or solid LB medium 32 Ampicillin was added as needed at 100 mg L

introduce mutations within or nearby the proposed Fnr recognition site at the dmsA promoter site directed mutagenesis was performed using the method of Kunkel 33 The template for mutagenesis was m13mp19 100 which contained a 676 bp Bam HI fragment containing 587 bp of DNA upstream of the dmsA translational start site and the associated 89 bp of the dmsA coding region Each intended mutation was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis 34 A Hinc II Bam HI fragment containing the regulatory region was excised from the M13 template and inserted into the plasmid pRS1274 to give the JA250 wild type
