 Reformulated I don t totally agree with you Sarah there are some formulas in sight What diminished Three Kings for me was that at heart it was a conversion melodrama in which a cynical amoral Bogartish hero finally can t live with himself in the face of injustice and opts to do the right thing at considerable personal cost That s one of the great movie plots but it doesn t feel as fresh as the rest of what s on screen Elsewhere however it s the way that screenwriters and directors bend and twist formulas that accounts for the anything goes quality that we ve all been responding to The beauty of The Limey is that it takes a pretty standard pulp formula wronged gangster turned vigilante avenger and creates what amounts to an essay on the idea of distance from other people from the effects of our own actions in the past and from ourselves The villain turns out not to be a person but a concept You see that not just at the end but in the middle when Peter Fonda a superb non star performance that supports your thesis Sarah about the subordination of ego in many of today s most interesting actors registers terror at the thought that it s all getting too close to him It s the hero s willful blindness to the fact that his behavior in the past had rippling consequences that has brought about his daughter s death Meanwhile there are a zillion formulas in the wonderful Dogma but they re all rearranged and then held in place by Kevin Smith s passion Election is a reworking of What Makes Sammy Run the replacement of Sammy Glick with Tracy Flick gives the game away but told in a way that makes more or more modern sense Its hero unlike Budd Schulberg s doesn t remain the voice of moral authority his envy self hatred and displaced lust makes him self destruct in spectacular fashion My larger point is that it s doubtful we ll escape formulas especially with executives and would be screenwriters flocking to courses by Robert McKee and others The more realistic hope is that filmmakers will use the technology to deconstruct those formulas before our eyes in ways that remind us what was vital about them to begin with I d like to follow up Sarah on your question about the decade s big themes In June Daniel Menaker wrote a fascinating article here in Slate on what has shaped up as a Hollywood trend of the 90s Using The Truman Show The Matrix Notting Hill and a score of other films he cited scenarios in which the heroes whose lives are swamped by technology and media must break through into the real Truman must leave the studio world Julia Roberts must escape the cameras ditto Ed in EDTV the kids in Pleasantville are stuck in a TV artifice of life and must break through it in order to get back to their real existences Menaker goes on What may be new is the role that technology and the media play in these productions as existential villains depriving people of their real lives Consider The Insider mysteriously named the year s best movie by the L A Film Critics in this light I don t think that theme is going to go away As our culture becomes more and more private as video replaces movies the way movies replaced theater as e exchanges replace phone calls the way phone calls replaced talking over the back fence we might find that our most powerful relationships are with figures in movies and television and our own fantasy lives Breaking through into the real might not be so simple P S Oh one other thing I strongly dispute the comparison to 1974 I don t have a video guide handy but wasn t that the year of Godfather II Mean Streets and one or another great Altman picture The Long Goodbye I don t see the same kind of ambitions in this year s films and I don t see any outright masterpieces Let s just say that this has been a great year a reversal of so much that happened in movies in the 80s But we re not back to 1974 yet
