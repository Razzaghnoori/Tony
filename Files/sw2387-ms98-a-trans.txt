 okay what types of music do you like to listen to well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i don t know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but it s the the music i enjoy the most how about you i like classical music also i uh like you i don t know a whole lot about it and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but i m not sure which composers or which i really like so i kind of hesitate to buy something There are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i don t right uh huh i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot there s uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but there s one in particular that is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying it s cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else because naturally that isn t their taste yeah at this point in time anyway yeah i understand that are are you involved in music uh no not really My husband is but not i do uh the world a favor and i don t sing aloud to anybody but myself well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and my daughter s quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe she ll get involved in classical music too because that s usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isn t her voice style so yeah i yeah i i don t care for rock at all i guess i m real old fashioned in my musical tastes no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious yes it s loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around right but um but the more popular music i don t care for usually yeah um even when i was a teenager i didn t really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular rock and roll kind of thing yeah i agree with that too although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think i m young again yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff isn t that the truth it s funny in fact it s interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back uh huh and you you don t hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but it s the same stuff right um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister who s sixteen years older and at the time that i was a teenager late teenager i guess i can t remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something uh huh then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a version of you know a song then and she said it s very similar but they ve changed a little bit she said i like the original version better well they did it again about two or three years ago and i laughed again i said oh no here we are crops up every so often i listen to um the Christian radio station when i m in the car K L T Y right right it does indeed uh huh i like to listen to some of that music yes now that there there s some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the problem problem that i found um in this area is that the yeah there there is inconsistency in the quality uh huh here if you get someone who s very good at selecting it s okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality yeah where do you live uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland i thought maybe you lived in Dallas because that s the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh they re playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over yeah and it uh huh and i i you know there s so much available that i don t understand why they do that but um yeah yeah now my children have have sometimes um well they ve gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and uh huh they when they buy a tape or something sometimes that s fun because it s different and something i ve not always heard and you know i enjoy that right my husband likes uh Sandy Patty songs he likes to sing those in church he d buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on if he had the money to oh wow yeah that s nice so is your husband a singer well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church right yeah well that s a good thing to do yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job that s nice uh well do you have children no not yet we re expecting a baby in July well wonderful that ll be a musician i guess we ll start listening yeah maybe so we ll start listening to children s music oh there s some wonderful Christian uh children s tapes yeah there are you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy uh huh oh uh uh huh um there s one that s um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect uh huh and uh she s playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and it s really cute oh yeah that sounds really cute yeah uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they re still in the womb and i said then when when it s born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe it ll comfort her you know when she s fussy and stuff yeah right yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music what uh or classical style it s not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too uh huh when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale huh someone else noticed it and i said well i guess that s true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasn t just you know it was really funny how strange uh huh babbly i ll say that is well we ll have to keep up with that then right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um uh huh this same child um really listened to to more um ballady or um pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to huh and i i never i didn t want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn t do it anymore right yeah have something to rebel against right but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that yeah that s good yeah variety is good yeah well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby um well thanks bye bye bye
