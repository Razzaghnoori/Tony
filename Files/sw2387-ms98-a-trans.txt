        okay what types of music do you like to listen to     well i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers partly because i find it more soothing i dont know a lot about classical music so far as uh any background in music but its the  the music i enjoy the most how about you   i like classical music also i uh like you i dont know a whole lot about it and i i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff but im not sure which composers or which i really like so i kind of hesitate to buy something There are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i dont   right uhhuh i tend to listen to the classical music uh on the radio a lot theres uh one particular well there several stations in this area that play uh classical music all the time but theres one in particular that is on both AM and FM so i can listen to it without uh worrying its cute though because my children when they get in the car and i have uh the button pushed for that they always switch it to something else       because naturally that isnt their taste   yeah   at this point in time anyway   yeah i understand that   are are you involved in music   uh no not really My husband is but not i do uh the world a favor and i dont sing aloud to anybody but myself     well my whole family uh is somewhat musical um and not from training but just because we sing in our choir and my daughters quite involved and all that sort of thing so um i think that one of these days maybe shell get involved in classical music too because thats usually what happens if you unless you get into rock which isnt her voice style so   yeah i yeah i i dont care for rock at all i guess im real old fashioned       in my musical tastes   no i well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious   yes   its loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning now i do like folk song um and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that you know kind of still hang around   right   but um but the more popular music i dont care for usually   yeah   um even when i was a teenager i didnt really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked um a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular rock and roll kind of thing   yeah i agree with that too   although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll i guess it makes me think im young again   yeah now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the New Age and all that stuff   isnt that the truth its funny in fact its interesting to me that so many of the songs now i grew up in the late fifties and early sixties and so much of the music that was popular at that time has come back   uhhuh   and you you dont hear everything all the time but you hear much of the same music perhaps a new version of it but its the same stuff   right   um which is always kind of funny um and i remember my older sister i have a sister whos sixteen years older and at the time that i was       a teenager late teenager i guess i cant remember the year Smoke Gets In Your Eyes became popular i think it was done by maybe the Platters or something   uhhuh   then and she laughed and she said well you know when i was a teenager that had been you know some years before she said that was a version of you know a song then and she said its very similar but theyve changed a little bit she said i like the original version better well they did it again about  two or three years ago and i laughed again i said oh no here we are     crops up every so often i listen to um the Christian radio station when im in the car K L T Y   right right it does indeed uhhuh   i like to listen to some of that music   yes now that there theres some wonderful Christian music when you can find good stations uh the problem problem that i found um in this area is that the   yeah   there there is inconsistency in the quality   uhhuh   here if you get someone whos very good at selecting its okay but sometimes they kind of get on a a a binge and they play the same sort of thing over and over again without really necessarily quality   yeah where do you live   uh i live in the uh Washington DC area Rockville Maryland   i thought maybe you lived in Dallas because thats the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too i said oh theyre playing one of their ten songs it seems like every week they pick ten and they just play them over and over   yeah  and it uhhuh and i i you know theres so much available that i dont understand why they do that but um   yeah yeah   now my children have have sometimes um well theyve gone to a few of the concerts and so on of Christian musicians that come for our youth group at our church and um and   uhhuh   they when they buy a tape or something sometimes thats fun because its different and something ive not always heard and you know i enjoy that   right my husband likes uh Sandy Patty songs he likes to sing those in church hed buy all the sound tracks he could get his hands on if he had the money to   oh wow yeah thats nice so is your husband a singer   well just an amateur singer He sings in the choir and he likes to do special music and stuff at church   right yeah well thats a good thing to do   yeah yeah i like to hear him sing he does a good job   thats nice uh well do you have children   no not yet were expecting a baby in July   well wonderful thatll be a musician   i guess well start listening yeah maybe so well start listening to childrens music   oh theres some wonderful Christian uh childrens tapes   yeah there are   you can uh you can get and i know when my children were younger um we found a lot of really nice tapes that they that they liked um there was an Agape music group and um i some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really um very memorable even though my children are now my youngest is almost sixteen but i still find some of the same tapes i uh some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy   uhhuh oh uh uhhuh   um theres one thats um a little girl singing Practice Makes Perfect   uhhuh   and uh shes playing the piano and so she she gets the wrong note every now and then but then she keeps repeating it practice makes perfect and then you know talking about that so far as Christian life too and its really cute   oh   yeah that sounds really cute   yeah   uh i tell my husband to sing to my stomach because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while theyre still in the womb and i said then when when its born you can hold it and sing that again and maybe itll comfort her you know when shes fussy and stuff   yeah right yeah well do you know something because i have always played classical music   what   uh or classical style its not always classical as you know the official uh word might go but um even when i was pregnant of course i listened to that and when our first child was you know an infant um of course i when i was around the house i played that music too   uhhuh   when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the scale the music scale   huh   someone else noticed it and i said well i guess thats true and it was somewhat melodio us in other words it wasnt just you know it was really funny   how strange uhhuh babbly ill say that is  well well have to keep up with that then   right right i do think there is probably an influence there because i noticed that even though popular music the the wilder stuff was around when my uh older children were were you know adolescents early adolescents when they first start listening to music on their own they first get ask for a radio of their own and so on um   uhhuh   this same child um really listened to to more um ballady or um pleasant sort of songs rather than and even classical rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to   huh   and i i never i didnt want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldnt do it anymore   right yeah have something to rebel against   right  but uh but i must say they all kind of like a variety of music which is nice i like that   yeah thats good yeah variety is good   yeah   well i guess that covers it It was real good talking to you   well it was nice talking to you and good luck with the baby   um well thanks bye   byebye
