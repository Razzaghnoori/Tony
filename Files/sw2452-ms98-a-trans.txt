 okay um let s talk talk about the Middle East situation the US involvement in i guess even though now that it s all over with you know it s well it is over but i don t think we re out of there by any means and uh and i wonder are we going to set up uh you know peace keeping type forces for long term and you know is that something we should do or shouldn t do i don t know i don t know uh i understand that the US talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there uh i guess they uh they were anti US in that region and now they re you know like Syria and uh um Egypt you know had some had some pressure against the US but now they now and they wouldn t allow us to have a base in the region but now i think they re rethinking that i think that s true because i think they saw the support that came through that s right the other thing that i think is good for like American businesses are to be involved is the the reports that i hear back and of course on the news i i try to listen and and also read between the lines you know uh huh but uh they said that because the Americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement involvement in the war that like so much of the building business and rebuilding Kuwait and things like that will go to American businesses where as before they may be dealt with Japanese firms or other people they said even though the Japanese um hum were involved monetarily uh they fill like the first first priority ought to go to American businesses which i guess will be good you know which will be good for our economy right right but i you know when since they have get so much of our money for from oil anyway boy don t you know i mean we don t seem to slow down even when there s a crisis no no um yeah i think that s that s a nice gesture on the Kuwaiti government part to do that and uh but i yeah and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth i imagine your oil companies they may see a probably the first big rise in business they ve seen in years i m right go over there and rebuild all those um hum i think it s such a shame that Iraqis had to just go destroy everything everything i was just i do too i mean what s what good is that i mean if i can t have it you can t have it you know that sounds like something a little kid would do you know yeah but look at their war that was his whole war is is i m not satisfied with what Iraq has i want what everybody has that s right and and you re right it s like you you you see two little pre school kids fighting over a toy you know um hum um hum so i i m a little concerned about you know i know they re putting President Bush right now in uh awkward position concerning the the the uh the treaty over there right now you know what the what am i trying to say the uh deal with the uh supporting the uh Kurds well supporting the Kurds but um you know where the the cease fire i m trying i forgot yeah you know because he right right the cease fire he wants he wants them to uh uphold their end of the deal as far as the cease fire but at the same time he s not wanting to go in and say okay i m gonna fight your war for you which which i think is is right right you know if it s an internal thing i don t think we can walk in and say gee i think you re right you re wrong you know we re not the judge and jury um hum uh but i know that that s causing him a little bit of unpopularity with the people over there because they feel like geez you you told us to stand up against him but you re not helping and so i think he s in a pretty awkward position now and i i i think we ought to help got to help us right you know maybe supply some arms or something yeah supply arms support them if they need help but i don t think we ought to be over there fighting it for them and and so i think he s done good on that stance yeah i think Bush handled has handled this uh whole situation quite well he stood up to to the bully and uh yeah didn t back down and uh and uh uh Saddam Hussein miscalculated all along boy i would say thinking that it he wouldn t commit US lives and and forces and and monies to just to liberate a little country that s right and uh and uh then then he underestimated underestimated his ability to uh to uh wage a war with us i mean uh it s one thing when we all came over there and said okay here we are get out and he said no i m i i can i can win a war with you guys yeah yeah and that and that was a a horrible miscalculation i mean i agree you know they had advertised and and said news that he had the fifth largest army well he may have but you have to well not anymore but you have to have loyalty you have to have people who believe in your cause uh not anymore right you know if i i i i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what s honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they re smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know um right yeah right yeah he he is not a Saddam Hussein is not a religious person but he uses it sure when it when he sees it to his advantage sure and uh and i think the people were smart enough to realize that you know Hussein that that i think they re afraid of him is what they are the population is is afraid to speak out against him and uh and uh and i don t think he s going to be there too much longer well i hope that s true uh someone s going to assassinate him you know i mean yeah i would think so i would think that you know it i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the Israeli Israeli Massad probably has ideas of going in and you know basically i i thought they uh yeah yeah showed a a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything and but i don t believe for a minute that that means that they don t have ideas and plans of their own um hum that s right right uh but i do agree with you i think President Bush handled it all politically very smart you know getting the support of of the other Arabs and other nations in the world and and i think that s how you have to go into something like that yeah right right i ve heard reports that uh President Bush was staking his future on this uh this war and that uh setting a precedent saying that um this League of Nations uh will will always combine against bullies and and to stop this kind of stuff in the world any any would be bully would think twice if he knew that you know there s this United Nations or world government or whatever they keeps talking about with that that will that the whole world will deal with you well and don t you feel and you can t get away you just can t do it and get away with it and you know hoping that you know because it s a it s a world thing and and and and nations will combine against you that s right a nd uh you can t you know can t just do this and don t you think that long term that s been a big boost for the United Nations i mean the United Nations has been there for years but all of a sudden uh oh yeah had no had no teeth yeah there re some teeth behind it and some fact that when they have sanctions and and we support things like this it means something right and i think that s good for the strength of the United Nations yeah people i uh i guess i feel sorry for just the average you you know Iraqi Iraqi who s had to go through all this and and suffering i m sure with with no water you know yeah and rebuild from nothing no electricity you know sanitation must be terrible living conditions must be terrible and yes yeah and it s not getting any better the sanctions are still on that s true you know except for a few medical supplies they re allowing through now and uh powdered milk i guess for babies and things and until they i guess yesterday they came out with this uh these these rules i guess or whatever and they for a permanent permanent cease fire and the Kuwaitis right they supported it um hum Kuwaitis said we don t want to have to go repay Israel for all the bombing we did that was in there you know but that s only fair that s right yeah they did ask that they build up uh Israel and Kuwait and i think they should have to yeah yeah they lost yeah the it s going to be really tough for them to swallow but but we don t want a Kuwait there that s also you know just has no power at all and and and that you know because Iran still isn t too friendly with them well that s true and and we don t want you know it d be be stabilized to the point where Iran will say now is our chance you know go in and wipe them out and well i don t think Iran s under the same type of madman type leadership yeah yeah but there s always the possibility i guess yeah yeah since Khomeini died over there things have got a little more normalized normalized not quite as radical a stance more moderates are in power now i think so i think i think the person who really maybe at this time has a hard road to tow is uh Jordan s King Hussein because he really yeah kind of tried to straddle the fence you know he he wasn t necessarily for Iraq at the same time he didn t feel like everybody else ought to be going against Iraq was put in the middle yeah well yet so many of the his citizens are the uh the what what Lebanese yeah who who were hoping this would get evolve into a war against Israel right and uh trying to connect with Israel all that time and there really was no connection at all none and uh but boy those Lebanese in in Jordan they were saying you know this whole war is Israel s fault because Israel told the United States to attack Iran it was all you know like like Israel controls our government i know and isn t that amazing the way that they ll find their cause and and and no matter what situation they see they re going to find their cause whether it s truly exists or not uh you know right well one thing i i did learn is is how deep yeah and the the hatred runs toward Israel by a lot of countries i know they just hate i mean anyway anyway they can you know they can see to to to to connect them to something and hate them more i mean just they just i understand most of the land is now Israel they bought that s true actually purchased it and and and then moved in and started a country but but see you re also getting back to the the ages old problem of Arab Israel conflict as far as personalties and who s the selected one of God and it theirs ties in so much to their religion and oh right oh yeah right right and they both have holy holy sanctions so it s very different things than what we face
