 Background Carcinoma of cervix uteri cervical cancer CC is a leading cause of cancer related mortality in women worldwide 1 2 CC arises by distinct morphologic changes from normal epithelium and progresses to carcinoma through a series of well defined preinvasive lesions Histologically CC presents as either squamous cell carcinoma SCC or adenocarcinoma AC 3 with SCC predominating Converging evidence from epidemiological and molecular studies suggests that infection of genital human papillomavirus HPV is causally linked to the development of CC 4 Since only a small fraction of HPV infected cervical intra epithelial neoplastic CIN lesions progress to invasive cancer these studies further suggest that in addition to HPV other host genetic factors play a role in cervical carcinogenesis 5 A number of molecular studies have identified genetic alterations in these two histologic types of CC and at various stages of precursor lesions 6 7 8 Despite this molecular characterization the genetic basis of CC initiation and progression is still very poorly understood Therefore identification of the underlying genetic changes may provide further insight into the molecular basis of CC Epigenetic hypermethylation in the promoter regions of a number of genes has been recognized as an important change in the development of human cancer 9 A growing number of cancer related genes have been identified to harbor methylation of cytosine residues in CpG rich promoter sequences The pattern of such promoter methylation has been noted to be non random in various tumor types while certain genes are commonly methylated in diverse tumor types 10 11 The extent of aberrant promoter hypermethylation and its association with loss of gene function in cancer suggests that CpG island methylation is an important mechanism in inactivating tumor suppressor genes TSGs The role of epigenetic gene inactivation in cervical tumorigenesis is poorly understood A few previously published reports on CC and its precursor lesions showed promoter methylation of specific genes 12 13 However these studies were limited by the small number of genes and tumors examined To investigate the role of promoter methylation in detail in cervical tumorigenesis we evaluated CpG methylation of 16 genes in 90 CC specimens and cell lines We found 86 6 of CC patients exhibiting promoter methylation The CDH1 DAPK RARB and HIC1 gene promoters were frequently methylated Methylation status was correlated with clinical and histologic characteristics and microsatellite instability MSI We also found evidence that promoter methylation inactivates gene expression in CC and exposure to methylation and or histone deacetylase HDAC inhibiting agents reactivate the gene expression Results CDH1 DAPK RARB and HIC1 gene promoters are frequently methylated in CC We examined the status of promoter hypermethylation of 16 genes CDH1 DAPK RARB HIC1 FHIT RASSF1A APC CDKN2A MGMT BRCA1 TP73 TIMP3 GSTP1 MLH1 p14 ARF and RB1 in eight specimens of normal cervical squamous epithelia and 90 CC specimens Promoter hypermethylation was not found in the DNA isolated from normal cervical smears for any of the tested genes However hypermethylation was detected in one or more genes in 79 of 90 87 8 CC specimens The frequency of promoter hypermethylation for individual genes was CDH1 51 1 DAPK 43 3 RARB 33 3 HIC1 22 2 FHIT 11 1 RASSF1A 10 APC 10 CDKN2A 8 9 MGMT 6 7 BRCA1 5 6 TP73 2 2 TIMP3 1 1 GSTP1 1 1 and MLH1 1 1 Table 1 The remaining two genes p14 ARF and RB1 did not show promoter methylation Seventy one of 82 86 6 primary tumors and 8 of 8 100 cell lines exhibited methylation Although the patterns are similar primary tumors had a higher frequency of methylation of CDH1 and DAPK genes as compared to cell lines while RARB HIC1 RASSF1A MGMT and TP73 genes had higher prevalence in cell lines as compared to primary tumors Table 1 A high frequency of promoter methylation was detected in primary tumors for CDH1 54 9 45 of 82 tumors and DAPK 45 1 37 of 82 tumors RARB 29 3 and HIC1 18 3 genes were less frequently methylated in primary tumors Other genes FHIT 11 APC 11 CDKN2A 8 5 RASSF1A 7 3 BRCA1 6 1 MGMT 4 9 and TIMP3 1 2 were rarely methylated in primary CC Table 1 Fig 1 Analyses of HPV and microsatellite instability Eighty six of 90 95 6 tumors were positive for HPV DNA The remaining four tumors were HPV negative HPV 16 alone or in combination with other HPV types was found in 55 61 1 HPV 18 was found in eight 8 9 tumors while other HPV types 20 different types in 23 25 6 tumors Of the 82 primary tumors studied for promoter methylation 48 tumors were also examined for microsatellite instability MSI using 49 di or tetra nucleotide markers 14 15 16 17 We found 9 of 48 18 8 tumors had MSI H and 9 of 48 18 8 tumors exhibited MSI L phenotype The remaining tumors did not show MSI Table 2 Promoter hypermethylation in relation to histological clinical and genetic characteristics To evaluate the relationship between promoter hypermethylation and clinico pathologic features as well as other genetic changes methylation status was correlated with histology age stage and size of the tumor clinical outcome HPV type and microsatellite instability Table 2shows the results of univariate analyses examining the associations between methylation and these characteristics Although both squamous cell carcinoma SCC 85 7 and adenocarcinoma AC 100 exhibited an overall high rate of promoter methylation we found statistically significant differences in various genes in these two histologic subsets Table 2 Promoter methylation of the CDH1 RARB FHIT and MGMT genes was noted only in SCC whereas the AC exhibited significantly higher frequency of promoter methylation of HIC1 60 in AC vs 15 6 in SCC APC 80 in AC vs 6 5 in SCC and BRCA1 40 in AC vs 3 9 in SCC Table 2 A significant correlation was observed between the overall frequency of methylation and the tumor stage P 0 001 Higher stage stages II IV tumors exhibited an increased overall frequency of promoter methylation Table 2 However the differences were not statistically significant when individual genes examined On the other hand RASSF1A methylation was associated with low grade tumors P 0 003 Tumor size has no effect on the overall frequency of methylation Age also has no influence on overall frequency of promoter methylation However RARB gene was more frequently methylated in younger patients 34 7 in below 50 years and 21 2 in above 50 years age P 0 02 Promoter methylation of APC 2 0 in patients below 50 years vs 24 2 in patients above 50 years age P 0 001 and BRCA1 4 1 in below 50 years and 9 1 in patients above 50 years P 0 05 genes were significantly higher in older patients In order to assess the prognostic role we also correlated treatment response and clinical outcome with promoter methylation The overall frequency of methylation was higher in patients who died of cancer DOC 95 3 as compared to those who were alive with recurring disease or complete remission 76 9 Table 2 P 0 015 Although statistically not significant all the patients whose tumors showed promoter methylation of MGMT 4 tumors and BRCA1 5 tumors genes DOC within 1 21 months of follow up after the initial diagnosis Promoter methylation of the remaining genes did not show such differences in relation to the outcome To assess the role of radiation and or chemotherapy treatment on outcome we correlated methylation with response in patients with at least 5 months follow up after treatment No significant differences in the overall promoter methylation were found in patients with complete remission CR compared to patients who DOC or had only partial response PR In this group all the patients that showed methylation of MGMT and BRCA1 genes failed to respond to the treatment suggesting promoter methylation of these genes may be a bad prognostic indicator Table 2 Promoter methylation of RARB gene was also predicted a worse prognosis as 80 of the patients with methylation were either DOC or only partial responders compared to only 20 patients with CR exhibited methylation of this gene Table 2 Table 3summarizes the results from multivariate Cox Survival models Overall after adjusting for age treatment tumor size stage and HPV type neither total number of methylated genes nor presence of methylation of each specific gene were statistically significantly related to survival However methylation of 3 genes did suggest a doubling RASSF1A and MGMT or tripling BRCA1 of risk compared to those who did not have these genes methylated These differences were not statistically significant due to small number of tumors analyzed and need to be confirmed using a larger sample size Type of HPV infection had no association with the status of promoter methylation Table 2 Although the MSI phenotype also had no significant correlation with overall promoter methylation the HIC1 P 0 02 and APC P 0 08 genes were frequently methylated in patients exhibiting MSI H phenotype Table 2 CDH1 and RARB expression in CIN To examine the role of CDH1 and RARB genes in CC progression we carried out immunohistochemical analysis in 39 CIN specimens Nine low grade and 30 high grade None of the low grade CINs showed down regulated expression while only 2 of 30 6 7 showed absent or reduced expression suggesting that CDH1 inactivation is a later event in CC development The expression pattern of RARB in normal epithelium is complex since the staining intensities are highly variable between nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments There was no normal epithelium to evaluate the expression in most CIN cases studied However all the cases that we evaluated for RARB immunoreactivity showed some positive mesenchymal cells We evaluated the intensity of nuclear staining in 34 cases of paraffin embedded tissues One 11 1 of the nine low grade CINs showed decreased nuclear expression whereas 15 60 of 25 evaluable high grade CIN lesions showed complete lack of nuclear expression Fig 2 If confirmed the down regulated RARB expression in high grade CINs suggests that this occurs early in progression and plays a role in the development of CC Gene expression is down regulated by promoter hypermethylation and reactivated by demethylation To examine the biological role of promoter methylation in CC we assessed the levels of mRNA by semi quantitative RT PCR in eight cell lines and compared with the respective control values obtained from the averages calculated from 2 normal cervix after normalization against ACTB This analysis was performed on 7 genes CDH1 DAPK RARB HIC1 MGMT RASSF1A and MLH1 that exhibited methylation in one or more cell lines and primary tumors Fig 3 RARB gene showed either complete absence of or down regulated expression in all cell lines 6 methylated and 2 unmethylated Of the six cell lines with RARB gene methylated three HT 3 MS751 and ME 180 exhibited reactivation upon treatment with 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine or n butyrate alone or the combination of the two Three cell lines C4 I CaSki and SW756 that had promoter methylation of RARB did not reactivate expression after treatment with these drugs Fig 4 One of the two unmethylated cell lines also reactivated the expression of RARB The CDH gene exhibited a complete absence of expression in one cell line SW756 that showed promoter hypermethylation and two other cell lines C 33A and SiHa without evidence of methylation Fig 3 The SW756 cell line with methylation and one of the two unmethylated cell lines showed reactivated expression upon treatment with 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine or in combination with n butyrate but not with n butyrate alone The remaining five cell lines neither showed evidence of decreased mRNA nor any effect of demethylating or HDAC inhibiting agents on expression levels The DAPK gene showed a complete absence of expression in five and down regulated expression in one of the 8 CC cell lines studied Fig 3 Of the six cell lines with down regulated expression 2 had promoter methylation and 4 had unmethylated promoter of the DAPK gene Both methylated cell lines HT 3 and SiHa and three C 33A MS751 and ME 180 of the four unmethylated cell lines showed reactivation upon exposure to 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine or in combination with n butyrate One of the unmethylated cell lines SW756 that showed a complete absence of expression did not reactivate after treatment The HIC1 gene was methylated in 5 of 8 cell lines Three of the methylated cell lines C 4I SiHa and ME 180 and one of the three unmethylated cell lines MS751 showed down regulated expression Treatment of 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine or n butyrate alone or the combination of both activated gene expression in all the cell lines whether or not promoter had detectable methylation Fig 4 The RASSF1A gene was methylated in 3 cell lines and all three showed a complete lack of expression None of the unmethylated cell lines showed evidence of down regulated expression of RASSF1A mRNA Two of three cell lines with RASSF1A methylation and complete lack of expression reactivated upon treatment with 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine alone or in combination with n butyrate One of the methylated cell lines HT 3 however did not reactivate gene expression after treatment The unmethylated cell lines showed normal expression and the treatment had no effect on expression MGMT was methylated in two cell lines One of the two methylated cell lines CaSki showed a complete absence of expression while the other methylated cell line SW756 showed normal levels of expression Treatment with demethylating and deacetylating inhibitor did not activate the expression in any cell line regardless of promoter methylation MLH1 gene was methylated in one cell line SW756 but we found no evidence of down regulated expression in this cell line data not shown Discussion Genetic alterations play an important role in the development of CC 4 7 8 Our extensive molecular analyses identified a number of specific genetic changes in invasive CC and its precursor lesions 6 14 15 16 17 18 19 However epigenetic alteration in cervical tumorigenesis is not well characterized 12 13 In the present study we identified an overall methylation in 87 8 CC cases Previous studies by Dong et al 79 and Virmani et al 72 4 have also reported a similar overall high frequency of promoter methylation 12 13 We identified promoter methylation in 25 cases in CDH1 DAPK and RARB genes while it was less frequent 10 25 cases in HIC1 FHIT RASSF1A and APC genes in CC patients The promoters of CDKN2A MGMT BRCA1 TP73 TIMP3 GSTP1 and MLH1 genes were rarely 10 cases methylated CDH1 is the most commonly methylated gene in the present study showing promoter methylation in 51 1 of CC cases Dong and co workers have shown earlier that the CDH1 promoter is methylated in 28 of invasive CC 13 E cadherin CDH1 is a major adhesion component of epithelial cells which plays an important role as an invasion suppressor gene Loss of function of CDH1 gene has been shown to occur in widespread of epithelial tumor types by mutational or promoter hypermethylation mechanisms 11 20 We have also identified loss of expression of CDH1 gene in 37 5 of CC cell lines analyzed Thus these data suggest that inactivation of the CDH1 gene by promoter methylation plays a major role in CC tumorigenesis However our immunohistochemical analysis of E cadherin protein showed no evidence of decreased expression in precursor CIN lesions Therefore these data indicate that the methylation of CDH1 gene is a late event in the development of CC DAPK gene is methylated in 43 3 cases in the present study Dong and co workers also previously showed promoter methylation in 51 of CC 13 DAPK is a positive mediator of the programmed cell death induced by gamma interferon 21 Loss of DAPK expression has been shown to occur in a number of human malignancies primarily by promoter hypermethylation 11 It has also been shown that loss of DAPK gene expression was associated with aggressive and metastatic phenotype in many tumor types 22 In the present study in addition to showing high frequency of promoter methylation of DAPK gene we found a complete lack of expression in two of the methylated cell lines and four of 6 unmethylated cell lines Thus our results suggest that loss of expression occurs in CC cell lines by mechanism other than complete promoter methylation Therefore our data further suggest a role for DAPK in CC tumorigenesis The third most commonly methylated gene in the present study is RARB A previous study also has reported promoter methylation in 33 3 of invasive CC and 11 and 29 of low and high grade CIN lesions respectively 12 These authors suggest that RARB methylation is an early event in multistage cervical carcinogenesis Our semi quantitative analysis of RARB gene expression by RT PCR showed down regulated expression in all the eight cell lines analyzed whether or not the promoter methylated Fig 3 In addition our immunohistochemical analysis of RARB showed lack of expression in 60 of high grade CINs It has been reported that RARB mRNA is down regulated in a number of tumor types 23 including cervical cancer 24 Taken together these data support the concept that RARB play an important role early in cervical cancer progression The direct role of RARB in regulating gene expression and its retinoid mediated antiproliferative differentiative immuno modulatory and apoptotic inducing properties may offer a therapeutic target in the future for CC treatment 25 As reported in a previous study we also found promoter methylation of HIC1 in 22 2 of CC 13 HIC1 is a zinc finger transcription factor that is transcriptionally silenced by promoter methylation in several types of human cancer 26 Heterozygous Hic1 mouse with promoter methylation of wild type allele develop carcinomas sarcomas and lymphomas suggesting that this gene acts as a tumor suppressor gene 27 HIC1 gene was down regulated in majority of the CC cell lines examined by us and this down regulated expression was reactivated upon treatment with demethylating and HDAC inhibiting agents These results support the tumor suppressor role of HIC1 and its inactivation by promoter methylation in CC may be a critical epigenetic change in tumor development The present methylation profile of CC identified significant differences in the methylated genes between SCC and AC We found that methylation of HIC1 APC and BRACA1 genes was more common in AC while CDH1 promoter methylation was seen only in SCC Such differences in the two major histologies have also been reported previously for DAPK HIC1 and APC genes 13 However we found CDH1 promoter methylation restricted to SCC in the present study while Dong et al found methylation in both histological types 13 This difference may be due to small number of AC patients we studied Distinct patterns of promoter methylation between SCC and AC however suggest that epigenetic pathways of tumor suppression may be different in these histologic subtypes Contrary to the previous reports we found a low frequency of p16 CDKN2A gene promoter methylation 12 13 28 29 The reason for these differences is currently unclear Our statistical correlative analysis of promoter methylation with clinicopathologic parameters HPV type and microsatellite instability identified significant associations A most significant finding was that overall promoter hypermethylation is associated with the progression and predicts significantly poor disease free survival This was most evident in BRCA1 and MGMT genes where all the patients with promoter methylation were dead Table 2 The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that promoter methylation is an independent predictor of outcome for BRCA1 3 fold risk and MGMT 2 3 fold risk genes Promoter methylation of cancer related genes has been reported to predict patient prognosis for a number of genes 30 31 BRCA1 plays a critical role in DNA repair and recombination cell cycle checkpoint control and transcription This gene has been shown to be hypermethylated in tumors arising from breast ovarian cancer syndrome 32 Although we detected complete promoter methylation of BRCA1 gene in only 6 of primary tumors other mechanisms that inactivate this gene might exist The present MSP data and its relation to poor clinical outcome warrants a further study of BRCA1 role in CC MGMT gene encodes O 6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase and this enzyme effectively removes DNA adducts formed by alkylating agents 33 Epigenetic gene silencing of MGMT confers enhanced sensitivity to alkylating based chemotherapy and lack of methylation associates with failure to respond to chemotherapy 34 35 On the contrary all patients that had MGMT promoter methylation were dead within 21 months of initial diagnosis which predicts a poor prognosis A possible explanation for this failure to respond may be that all the four patients in the present study were treated only with radiotherapy with or without combination of surgery The standard treatment for advanced stage cervix cancer has been the combination of radical surgery and radiotherapy 36 The utility of cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with advanced CC has been recognized recently 37 Thus the epigenetic gene silencing of MGMT although in a small proportion may serve as indicator of responsiveness to treatment with chemotherapeutic drugs that cause DNA adducts in CC Most patients in the present study population were treated with traditional radiation and surgery treatment protocols To assess the impact of promoter methylation on treatment we compared the patients followed for more than 5 months after treatment This analysis suggests that RARB methylation predict a worse prognosis P 0 02 Twelve of the 15 80 patients with RARB methylation were DOC or did not respond to the current treatment while only 3 of the 15 20 patients with RARB methylation exhibited complete response Since RARB functions as a tumor suppressor gene and its chemopreventive effects are purely based on retinoid induced reactivation the patients that received radiation therapy will have no effect on these tumors Our data therefore suggest that the CC patients showing RARB promoter methylation may benefit from targeted chemopreventive treatment of combination of retinoic acid demethylating and chromatin modifying agents that reactivate the gene expression An understanding of the exact mechanisms of RARB loss of function in CC is essential for such a strategy Microsatellite instability MSI is hallmark of mismatch repair deficient cancers which has been observed in all cancers arising from Hereditary Non polyposis Colorectal Cancer HNPCC syndrome some sporadic colorectal and other cancers 38 MSI is generally associated with germ line mutations in one of two MMR genes hMLH1 and hMSH2 Epigenetic inactivation of promoter hypermethylation of APC and HIC1 also results in MSI phenotype in sporadic colorectal cancers 39 40 Accumulating evidence supports the view that promoter methylation of mismatch repair genes may be related to MSI phenotype 41 42 A number of previous studies have shown the existence of MSI phenotype in CC 43 44 In the present study we found that MSI H occurs at an increased frequency in tumors with HIC1 and APC promoter hypermethylation Association of APC promoter methylation with MSI phonotype has been previously reported in endometrial cancer 45 Although the significance of these results is currently unclear we believe that inactivation of these genes by promoter methylation causes microsatellite instability and may contribute to the development of CC Aberrant promoter methylation changes that occur in cancer are associated with transcriptional repression and loss of function of the methylated gene 9 Since we found evidence of down regulated expression of several methylated genes in CC cell lines we tested to see if this down regulation could be reactivated by methylation and HDAC inhibiting agents Transcriptional silencing of genes resulting from DNA hypermethylation of CpG islands is reversed by treatment with the hypo methylating agent 5 aza 2 deoxycytidine and HDAC inhibiting agent n butyrate in a dose and duration dependent manner We found that 5 Aza 2 deoxycytidine treatment alone or in combination with n butyrate resulted in reactivation of gene expression in most cell lines that showed promoter methylation In some cell lines exposure to n butyrate alone has resulted in reactivation of the gene expression for example in HIC1 gene Fig 4 These data therefore suggest that other epigenetic mechanisms involving defects in chromatin modification factors such as acetylation and methylation of histone proteins may also play role in gene silencing Thus our data also suggest that epigenetic changes that accompany methylation are common in CC and play critical role in CC development Conclusions The present study identified promoter methylation in a number of genes in CC The most frequently methylated genes were CDH1 DAPK RARB and HIC1 We have also shown that promoter methylation of these genes result in transcriptional repression Furthermore RARB gene expression is down regulated in high grade CINs These data suggest that some of the methylated genes may play a role early in the progression of cancer Here we showed that promoter methylation is associated with advanced stage of the disease RARB and BRCA1 promoter methylation predict a worse prognosis and the HIC1 and APC promoter methylation is frequently associated with MSI This knowledge of epigenetic changes in CC may have implications in our understanding of the role they play in CC development Particularly if the present results are replicated and identified in precancerous lesions this may be useful in predicting the high risk lesions to progression and serve as targets of treatment Methods Patients Tumor tissues and cell lines A total of 82 tumor biopsies derived from previously untreated primary invasive CCs and eight cell lines were used The tumor biopsies were ascertained from patients evaluated at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia Santa Fe de Bogota
