 If Ego Then I Go Very frustrating to read Anna Husarska s Diary Obviously an experienced foreign reporter Husarska has chosen to dedicate the first two days of her diary to the technical frustrations of being an Internet reporter in Bosnia and the impact or nonimpact of her piece Such self absorption seems very selfish when what I want to hear about is Bosnia and its condition on the eve of the elections If Husarska keeps this up her diary might as well have been written from a shopping mall in Dayton Love your mag but can you do something to restrain the egomania of your diarists Brian Ewing Light in Bosnia Slate s editors must be credited for a journalistic coup The international community is whistling in the dark about Bosnia Anna Husarska s Diary counters the hype and myopic optimism surrounding the elections there Bravo Ned Fagan Mustang Sally Edward Abbey had a proposal that I think would be much more effective than the 1 000 one suggested by Stuart Taylor Jr in The Norplant Option Abbey suggested we offer every 15 year old female in the United States a new Mustang convertible in exchange for sterilization He did offer a few stipulations but the important part was sterilization not removable contraceptive devices Of course he was after more than a reduction in welfare costs While I agree postponing childbearing is a laudable goal we have larger problems to solve regarding children having children Shelley Stallings Publish or Perish Perhaps because I work in the newspaper industry where we publish daily regardless I find your seemingly frequent vacations troubling But OK magazines are different I had been prepared all along to pony up the 19 95 or whatever it is to subscribe to Slate when you begin charging But now I m worried because I don t know what I ll be getting for my 19 95 Jane Hadley The Origin of Specious John Horgan s review of Richard Dawkins Climbing Mount Impossible The Mystery of Life is interesting However he makes some specious claims He argues After decades of searching scientists have found no conclusive evidence that life exists elsewhere in the universe But scientists wouldn t be able to find such evidence in the nearby star systems that we have searched thus far and the tools we use for detection have limited capabilities Horgan also writes In spite of the immensely powerful tools of modern biotechnology scientists still cannot make matter animate in the laboratory Surely few biotechnologists are so arrogant as to claim life creating power Besides a decade or two of laboratory research falls somewhat short of the millions of years natural processes need Chris Irving Living Single Bravo Wendy Wasserstein Party of One for telling it like it is Why haven t political pundits picked up on the fact that singles are discriminated against by both parties Republicans have long denigrated alternative lifestyles Now politicians talk about singleness as if it is an alternative lifestyle Mary Ann Costello
