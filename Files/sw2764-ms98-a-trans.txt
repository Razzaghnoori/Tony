            okay credit cards they leave a bad taste in my mouth   uh yeah theyve sort of left a bad taste in my mouth too ive been sort of irresponsible a couple of years ago and im still paying for the the my own stupidity   yeah yeah well the thing i hate about them i went through a divorce   uhhuh   and i will never own another joint credit card   oh youre   because uh even if in the divorce decree one is agrees to pay it   uhhuh   if youre a cosigner on it theyll still come after you   if the other person doesnt   if the other person doesnt   yeah   and boy that thats thats a rotten deal   oh id id say so and isnt it isnt it now on those those cards was it um mostly her that that ran up the bills yeah   yeah yeah about twenty thousand dollars worth   twenty thousand   i cant imagine any anybody letting somebody charge that much on a credit card   wholly smokes   but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it   yeah thats got to be like   and   close to what a thousand bucks a month   yeah and they said well im sorry even though the card is in her name you youre a cosigner on it and i i threatened you know legal action and everything i i dont know ive sent them a letter and i said i want this removed from from my credit   uhhuh   rating and uh havent heard anything back but i havent run a credit check either   right yeah you might be worth your while to run one of them thirty dollar uh   yeah   credit checks just to find out what it says   yeah but uh thats uh ill never own another joint   yeah   credit card   i need to find i need my credit card mostly for uh just government travel you know um   yeah   uh program manager for the Air Force and uh i uh i have to go on uh travel quite a bit to contractors facilities and when i do i have to have the hotel and all that kind of stuff but ive been trying to curtail my use of it to to nothing except with the exception of uh of them those type things   yeah   yeah   and i also found out something else uh for your information and i dont know if youre married or not   no im not   but uh one of the credit cards the uh the account was paid off   uhhuh   oh it was paid off for a couple of years never even used it and then all of a sudden i got a phone call from them saying uh uh shes behind in her payments and i said well i dont care shes my exwife   yeah   and uh they said well your name is still on file as cosigner   oh gee   so even dormant credit cards you have uh you you have to go and send them a copy and tell them youre not responsible for any bills   right   but uh it it can turn into a mess   sounds like it so the the credit card was inactive   yeah it was inactive and i never sent them a copy of the divorce decree or anything because they wasnt even mentioned in the divorce decree as to which party would pay what what   when you right right oh my gosh   because the the credit card was zero it was you know dont and it was dormant   yeah guess the the bottom line is uh you got to be darn sure youre marrying the right person when you   thats right   when you do that too but uh i guess a divorce in any   yeah   circumstance doesnt normally theyre sir   either that or make or each each party have their own own uh credit card not a joint   yeah thats for sure i know i happen to know of a different guy who um a girl i used to date her brother and his his wife ran up thousands of dollars in credit well i guess theyre they are both responsible for the stupid things but um   yeah   had a similar situation and then it was almost like he couldnt get a divorce because uh uh i guess she didnt even work or anything and then he wouldve been   yeah   strapped with everything   yeah he would have been stuck with everything yeah   i   yeah   i remember   about the only credit cards i have now are are gas cards   uhhuh   but theyre in my name only   yeah well i know im about uh thinking about doing a getting a consolidation loan just to lump everything together so that and its down to one payment and then just get rid of all these old accounts and just work on a cash only   yeah little yeah   system because uh im just i am very sort of irked at this at these credit card companies and you know they got you   yeah and uh youll get letters in the mail where they want to increase your credit line   and right   and uh and it also makes it bad because you cant deduct that interest now   no no   you know at least you used to get some relief by being able to deduct deduct all that interest and finance charges   right right   cant even do that anymore   yeah yeah i remember uh was it two years ago or they did away with it last year right   yeah   yeah   well you uh this last year was ten percent   uhhuh   this next time its zero   yeah well remember my refund on my income tax was a lot bigger uh two years ago than it was this year   yeah   thats for sure   yeah about only the only interest you can deduct now are is a house payment mortgage interest and uh   right right   and taxes but uh   i   credit cards you can   i cant even declare that here because uh in my situation because its uh uh not until i sell it the the way it works for me because i own it as   uhhuh   jointly with my father and uh   yeah   the theyve changed those or its a ends up getting classified as a rental property and its not classified as a regular family dwelling so theres some reason we cant   right right   declare any mortgage interest     do you do you or your father either one have it homesteaded   um do you mean do we do i live in it or   no no homesteaded   what what does that mean   uh in Texas uh you get a uh a big tax break if you if you call what they homestead it you have to sign a piece of paper that says this is my primary residence and and i live here   oh oh and well that would be an interesting situation because im a resident of Pennsylvania and uh because im in the Air Force and um im living here in New York so i can i cant even vote here   oh yeah   a property owner but i cant vote   huh yeah   so   thats crazy   yeah well thats only fair because the reason im a resident resident of Pennsylvania is because they dont charge military income tax   oh thats so   so and so its like Texas Texas doesnt either   yeah   uh   at least now   yeah or   theyre theyre talking about instituting a uh state income tax   yeah   everything else that that would bring in money the uh the the people want it but the uh the congress or Texas State Congress and so forth wont pass a bill to do it like a uh lottery   uhhuh   theyve been trying to get a lottery  i think the last poll they had here seventy percent of the population voted wanted a lottery   right   and yet the uh the House voted it down the Texas House voted it down   huh   they all they want to do is increase property taxes and   sure   put a income tax in   well i dont know just getting back to the subject of credit cards i think the best uh thing maybe is that even though the American Express charges the annual fee is the American Express card is it makes you pay it every month   it makes you right it makes you pay it   yeah   i i do have an American Express but i got it through uh TI   yeah ive got a Diners Club through the government as well yeah they   its a its a yeah its a yeah its a corporate   they force us to have yeah       uh government Diners Club and i had an American Express of my own i probably if i was smart id get rid of the American Express and get   yeah   stop paying that annual fee on it but   yeah and if youre late on this on my American Express they write TI   ooh   since its a corporate corporate American   yeah that thats not good   and if you dont pay it you get a call from your supervisor saying why hasnt this been paid   yeah oh jeez   so you dont dare run up anything on it that you cant you know that you cant pay thats thats the problem with credit cards it its   really   people dont think of it as cash   no   they think of it like uh monopoly money that hey i can just charge this   right   and pay it wherever i feel like it   yeah its like going oh ill have that money by the end of the month and then end of the month comes around and you get your insurance bill comes and   yeah   a few other things and then youre like oh jeez hey   right yeah   yeah i know that feeling     huh   so i guess the the secrets not to have credit cards   yeah oh well im getting to just about to that point myself so   well i guess weve been im surprised they hadnt beeped in and said your ten minutes is up   yeah really theyve been   theyve been uh even before ten minutes here lately theyve been saying you should cut it off   oh really i havent i it i actually havent timed any of them i just kind of go into conversation ends on its own or uh or that uh that they do come in with that so well anyway it was nice   well listen ive enjoyed talking with you   yeah its nice talking to you Jerry and uh
