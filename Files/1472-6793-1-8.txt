 Background In skeletal muscle the dihydropyridine receptor DHPR consists of 1S 2 1a and 1 subunits 1 This complex is responsible for the L type Ca 2 current and serves as the voltage sensor for excitation contraction EC coupling In the latter process the movement of electrical charges in the 1S subunit promotes a conformational change that opens the ryanodine receptor type 1 RyR1 in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane SR leading to an increase in cytosolic Ca 2 2 3 The functional interactions between the DHPR subunits necessary for opening the Ca 2 channel are only partially known Further the interactions between DHPR subunits and RyR1 also are incompletely understood The 1 subunit is a large protein that contains the basic functional elements of the L type Ca 2 channel including the Ca 2 selectivity voltage dependent gating and sensitivity to dihydropyridines The cytoplasmic loop between repeats II and III of the 1S subunit interacts closely with RyR1 and is an important determinant of skeletal type EC coupling 4 5 A region in the cytoplasmic loop between repeats I and II of the 1 subunit referred to as the AID 6 binds tightly with a 30 amino acid region on the 1 subunit referred to as the BID 7 subunits are 55 to 65 kDa proteins essential for channel assembly and or membrane targeting as well as for modulation of channel kinetics 8 The 2 subunit is a highly glycosylated 175 kDa protein formed by two disulfide linked peptides encoded by the same gene Transmembrane topology and functional analyses suggest the 2 subunit is composed of a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail of only five residues 9 10 Given this topology the 2 subunit is most likely to interact with the 1 and or the 1 subunits The 1 subunit is a 32 kDa skeletal muscle specific protein with four presumptive transmembrane domains 11 12 13 The transmembrane topology of the 1 subunit and the critical binding domains are unknown at this time EC coupling is initiated by voltage dependent charge movements in the S4 segments of the DHPR 1S subunit whose expression is dependent on the presence of the 1a subunit 14 The C terminus of the 1a subunit has also been shown to be important in EC coupling presumably by interaction with RyR1 15 The role of the 2 subunit on skeletal EC coupling is unknown but in heterologous expression systems it has been demonstrated to increase the amount of charge movement 16 The role of the 1 subunit in Ca 2 channel function is of particular interest given the discovery of a second subunit 2 or stargazin which is expressed in neurons and is responsible for the stargazer mutation in mice 17 Subsequently several other subunit genes have been identified and shown to be expressed in brain and peripheral tissues 18 19 In the present study we examined the role of the 1 subunit in L type Ca 2 current and EC coupling in skeletal myotubes Absence of the 1 subunit slows inactivation and produces a depolarizing shift in the Ca 2 current inactivation vs voltage curve in agreement with results from an independently produced 1 knockout mouse 20 However absence of 1 does not affect the voltage dependence or the magnitude of charge movements and Ca 2 transients Overall the 1 subunit appears to promote inhibition of the Ca 2 channel function of the skeletal DHPR While this subunit is clearly non essential for activation of the L type Ca 2 channel and for triggering skeletal type EC coupling 1 appears to specifically modulate the Ca 2 channel function of the skeletal DHPR Results and Discussion Inactivation of the DHPR 1subunit by gene targeting Gene targeting was used to replace the entire coding region of the 1 gene with the neo gene as described in Materials and Methods Fig 1 Targeted ES cell clones were injected into C57Bl 6J blastocysts and chimeras obtained After additional breeding a line containing the 1 targeted allele was obtained Fig 1Ashows Southern blots from DNA of control 1 het and 1 null mice after digestion with Eco RI and hybridization to probe 1 The 1 het and 1 null mice show the predicted 12 5 kb restriction fragment indicative of the targeted allele Fig 1B Similarly for the Southern blot of DNA digested with Hind III and hybridized to probe 2 the 1 het and 1 null mice show the predicted 3 5 kb restriction fragment indicative of the targeted allele Fig 1C The 1 het and 1 null mice have no visible abnormalities and are fertile Western blots showing the expression of the DHPR subunits are shown in Fig 1D The amount of the 1 subunit present in control 1 het and 1 null samples as a function of total membrane protein was determined in two independent membrane preparations These data indicate that the amount of 1 expression in membranes from 1 null muscle was not detectable above background no primary antibody as expected from the fact that the entire gene was deleted In membranes isolated from the 1 het mice the level of expression of the 1 subunit was 64 of control values for each of the two independent determinations consistent with what might be expected from the loss of one allele Whether there is compensation by increased expression of other subunits such as the 6 and 7 subunits which were shown recently to be present in skeletal muscle by RT PCR 19 or alteration of the amount of the other subunits remains to be determined in the future Increase in Ca 2 current density and decrease in inactivation in 1null and 1het myotubes We examined the impact of the 1 null mutation on DHPR properties using electrophysiological techniques in primary cultures of skeletal myotubes derived from mouse embryos Fig 2Ashows whole cell Ca 2 currents in control 1 het and 1 null myotubes in response to 500 ms depolarizing voltage steps from a holding potential of 40 mV Current traces for only three voltage steps are shown for clarity All three cell types displayed the slow high voltage activated L type Ca 2 current typical of skeletal myotubes When the holding potential was 80 mV we also observed a T type Ca 2 current which was seen in approximately half of the cells tested data not shown Ca 2 conductance vs voltage curves were computed in Fig 2Bfor the three cell types The sigmoidal lines correspond to a Boltzmann fit to the population mean while parameters fitted to each cell are shown in Table 1 These data show that the maximum conductance G max for both the 1 het and 1 null cells are significantly larger p 0 05 than the values for control cells However the half activation potential V 1 2 and the steepness of the curve factor k were not significantly different see Table 1 Thus full or partial elimination of the 1 subunit produced a significant increase in the Ca 2 current density without a change in the voltage dependence of the Ca 2 conductance At intermediate potentials such as 30 mV Fig 2A the Ca 2 current of 1 het and 1 null cells inactivated more slowly than that of control cells To examine changes in inactivation we used the paired pulse protocol shown in Fig 3A which measured the Ca 2 current not inactivated by the pre pulse It has been shown that inactivation of skeletal L type Ca 2 channels approaches steady state extremely slowly on the time scale of tens of seconds 21 However for comparative purposes and to be consistent with previous measurements in Ca 2 channels lacking 1 20 22 we chose a much shorter protocol Cells were held at 80 mV then stepped to a series of depolarizing pre pulse voltages for 2 5 s to promote inactivation then stepped to 50 mV for 100 ms to close non inactivated channels The non inactivated Ca 2 current was measured during a 200 ms test pulse to 20 mV In control cells there was almost complete inactivation of the Ca 2 current when the pre pulse potential was in the positive range This can be seen by comparing the amplitude of the Ca 2 current during the test pulse in traces 1 2 and 3 corresponding to pre pulse potentials to 70 mV 30 mV and 60 mV respectively In contrast 1 het and 1 null cells showed less inactivation during the pre pulse and thus a significantly larger Ca 2 current during the test pulse Furthermore pre pulse potentials larger than 30 mV did not promote additional inactivation which can be seen by comparing traces 2 and 3 in the 1 het and 1 null cells Fig 3Bshows the maximum Ca 2 current during the test pulse plotted as a function of the pre pulse potential In control cells inactivation was complete when the pre pulse potential was above 30 mV 6 9 0 8 pA pF at 70 mV vs 0 2 0 2 pA pF at 70 mV n 6 cells In 1 null cells inactivation reached a plateau when the pre pulse potential was more positive than 20 mV 8 5 0 9 pA pF at 70 mV vs 3 2 0 7 pA pF at 70 mV n 8 cells Incomplete inactivation was also seen in 1 het cells although this was less pronounced than in 1 null cells Since the pre pulse was not sufficiently long for inactivation to reach steady state we are not certain whether the observed incomplete inactivation reflects a component of the 1 null Ca 2 current that inactivates extremely slowly or a truly non inactivating component To compare the voltage dependence of the inactivation produced by the 2 5 second pre pulse the Ca 2 current during the test pulse was normalized and fit to the Boltzmann equation Fig 3C The curves for 1 het and 1 null cells showed a significant p 0 05 shift to more positive potentials compared to control cells The same conclusion was reached by comparing the Boltzmann parameters of individual cells in Table 1 Since control cells had a more negative half inactivation potential the higher Ca 2 conductance of 1 het and 1 null cells reported in Fig 2could be explained by a larger steady state inactivation of the control Ca 2 current at the 40 mV holding potential To determine if this was the case we measured the Ca 2 conductance during the pre pulse for the same cells analyzed in Fig 3B C The pre pulse was delivered from a holding potential of 80 mV and therefore the pre pulse current should be less contaminated by steady state inactivation G max at the peak of the Ca 2 current during the pre pulse was 146 12 pS pF for controls 172 18 pS pF 1 het and 186 13 pS pF for 1 null cells with t test statistical significance for controls vs 1 null cells of p 0 034 and for controls vs 1 het cells of p 0 064 Thus the higher Ca 2 conductance of 1 het and 1 null cells persisted at the more negative holding potential These Ca 2 conductances were approximately 10 higher than those at the 40 mV holding potential reported in Table 1 The additional current could have been contributed by T type Ca 2 channels not shown which are available at the 80 mV holding potential but are inactivated at the more positive holding potential Also since the T type Ca 2 current density was highly variable see above this could explain the higher p values compared to those reported in Table 1 In summary decreasing the amount of the 1 subunit protein or eliminating it completely resulted in myotubes with a higher Ca 2 current density a similar voltage dependence of activation and a reduced rate of inactivation These results with the exception of the change in Ca 2 current density are in remarkable agreement with those obtained when L type Ca 2 channel subunits are coexpressed without the 1 subunit in heterologous cells see below They also are similar to results obtained elsewhere in 1 null myotubes using a 5 second pre pulse 20 Furthermore the incomplete inactivation of the 1 null Ca 2 current resembles that observed in ts A201 cells expressing DHPRs specifically lacking 1 and using a 3 second inactivation protocol 22 The effect of the 1 subunit on Ca 2 current kinetics has been somewhat confusing until now because it has not been possible to examine its role using homologous subunits and a homologous expression system In amphibian oocytes 1 was assayed in a complex with 1C 1a and 2 23 24 These investigators found 1 produced a slight decrease in Ca 2 current density no change in activation kinetics and a positive shift in the peak Ca 2 current vs voltage curve In HEK293 cells using the same subunit composition the 1 subunit did not alter the kinetics or density of Ca 2 currents 25 However in both oocytes and HEK293 cells the 1 subunit increased the rate of Ca 2 channel inactivation and produced a large hyperpolarizing shift in steady state inactivation 23 25 26 The results obtained here in skeletal muscle demonstrate that absence of the 1 subunit increases Ca 2 current density decreases the inactivation rate and shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation in the depolarizing direction Freise et al 20 showed that the increase in Ca 2 current was not a result of changes in single channel conductance and suggested the effects were due to changes in channel open probability However this remains to be tested directly Expression of the 2 subunit in BHK cells expressing 1A 2 and 1a also shifts the voltage dependence of inactivation 7 mV in the hyperpolarizing direction 17 In summary the two subunits that have been characterized to date namely 1 in the homologous skeletal myotube system described here and 2 described above in heterologous BHK cells 17 appear to be inhibitory In each case the presence of results in fewer Ca 2 channels available for activation Absence of changes in the EC coupling voltage sensor of 1nullmyotubes The impact of the 1 null mutation on myotube EC coupling was inferred from intramembrane charge movements the bulk of which have been shown to originate from the DHPR voltage sensor 27 28 Additionally we measured Ca 2 transients evoked by voltage i e by the movement of the voltage sensor and compared these two sets of data To measure DHPR charge movements and to separate these charge movements from those produced by other voltage gated channels a ionic currents were blocked b the linear component of the cell capacity was subtracted using a P 4 procedure and by analog compensation and c we used a pulse protocol that eliminated the immobilization sensitive charge movements from voltage gated Na channels and presumably also from T type Ca 2 channels Previous studies in dysgenic 1S null myotubes transfected with 1S showed that the pulse protocol and the internal and external solutions used here see Materials and Methods detected charge movements of a magnitude 5 to 8 fold larger than those present in non transfected dysgenic myotubes 28 Thus we are confident that the technique adequately measures intramembrane charge movements in DHPR voltage sensors present in the plasma membrane Fig 4Ashows gating type currents produced by charge movements in response to 3 of 14 step voltages delivered to each cell 40 10 and 70 mV Charge movements did not occur at 40 mV in any of the cell types Traces at 10 mV and 70 mV show a transient current at the onset of the voltage step the ON charge and an equal inverted current at the end of the voltage step the OFF charge The voltage dependence of the OFF charge estimated by integration is shown in Fig 4B The OFF transient was usually less contaminated by ionic current than the ON transient and for that reason it provides a better estimate of the total DHPR charge The main contaminant of the ON transient was a non linear outward current presumably a K channel that was not always completely blocked by the pipette solution The OFF charge increased in a sigmoidal fashion and saturated at potentials more positive than 60 mV in all cases These data were adequately fit by a Boltzmann equation shown by the lines We found that the fitted maximum charge Q max expressed by the 3 cell types was 5 fC pF in agreement with previous determinations in normal myotubes 29 Furthermore Boltzmann parameters determined for each cell and then averaged were not significantly different in any of two by two comparisons between control 1 het or 1 null cells Table 1 In summary the magnitude of intramembrane charge movements and its voltage dependence were unaltered by partial or complete removal of the 1 subunit Furthermore in agreement with previous data 29 no additional charges moved when pulses were delivered from a holding potential of 120 mV data not shown Thus failure to detect changes in the charge vs voltage characteristics of 1 null myotubes compared to controls cannot be explained by charge movements in the 1 null myotubes occurring at potentials more negative than the chosen 80 mV holding potential Absence of alterations in the voltage dependence of charge movement in the 1 null cells should also be reflected in the voltage dependence of Ca 2 transients Changes in intracellular Ca 2 were measured using confocal line scan imaging of fluo 4 fluorescence Fig 5Ashows a line scan image of a Ca 2 transient stimulated by a 50 ms depolarization to 90 mV from a holding potential of 40 mV in each cell type The scan direction was perpendicular to the long axis of the myotube in a region selected on the basis of a low resting fluorescence and a high stimulated fluorescence red yellow color The two traces on top of each image correspond to the time course of the fluo 4 fluorescence averaged across the entire line scan at 10 mV which is close to the threshold and at 90 mV which produced the maximum Ca 2 transient Increase in cytosolic Ca 2 started at the onset of the depolarization and peaked 100 ms later in the three cell types For all cells the peak fluorescence change for the depolarization to 90 mV was 3 F Fo units which is equivalent to 4 times the resting fluorescence The relatively long recovery time following the depolarization is due to the low Ca 2 buffering power of the internal recording solution and is in agreement with previous studies 27 30 The voltage dependence of F Fo measured at the peak of the transient is shown in Fig 5B All curves had the same profile which consisted of a threshold for peak Ca 2 release at 10 mV an increase in peak Ca 2 with pulse potential from 10 mV to 30 mV and a plateau at more positive potentials Furthermore two by two comparisons of Boltzmann parameters fitted to each cell did not reveal statistically significant differences see Table 1 In summary the voltage dependence of Ca 2 transients and the maximum cytosolic Ca 2 concentration during the transient were not significantly affected by partial or total absence of the 1 subunit However we cannot rule out changes in the rate of SR Ca 2 release since this measurement requires an entirely different internal solution 31 A recent report indicates that the SR Ca 2 release rate is slightly higher in 1 null myotubes 32 Involvement of DHPR subunits in voltage sensing and EC coupling The 1S pore subunit of the skeletal DHPR is the main determinant of charge movements and EC coupling 4 27 28 However other subunits of the DHPR are critical modulators of both functions In heterologous expression systems the 2 subunit was shown to affect the rate of Ca 2 current inactivation and charge movement immobilization 33 Studies investigating the role of the subunit on charge movement vary with the expression system used In amphibian oocytes subunits increase the coupling between charge movements and channel opening 34 35 We have shown in skeletal muscle cells lacking the 1 subunit that reintroduction of variants of 1 has little effect on either charge movement or the kinetics of activation of the expressed Ca 2 current 15 However the carboxyl terminus of 1a is an important determinant of the efficiency of the coupling between charge movement and Ca 2 release 15 In contrast to these results earlier studies in which similar subunits were co expressed with 1 subunits in oocytes indicated subunits had major effects on Ca 2 current density and gating kinetics 36 37 While the reason for these discrepancies is unknown they highlight the fact that in skeletal muscle the gating characteristics of the L type Ca 2 channel might be controlled by interactions beyond those taking place among subunits of the DHPR For example a region of RyR1 has been shown to be essential for L type Ca 2 current expression 38 Such interaction is critical for skeletal DHPR function and is unlikely to occur in heterologous expression systems Conclusions The ability of the 1 subunit to selectively modulate the pore function of the DHPR without modulation of charge movements or the voltage dependence of Ca 2 transients is unique especially since other DHPR subunits participate in both functions In all likelihood the charge movement protocol failed to detect gating currents responsible for opening the Ca 2 channel which are quite small and are only resolved for depolarizations 200 ms 39 compared to the 25 ms used here Fig 4 A possible shift in the voltage dependence of these charges recruited by long depolarizations would be consistent with the shift in Ca 2 current inactivation and remains to be resolved in 1 null myotubes However the protocol accurately measures the immobilization resistant charge movements that are known to be required for skeletal type EC coupling 31 40 Therefore the 1 subunit is unlikely to play a critical role in the activation of SR Ca 2 release in agreement with a recent report 32 However shifts in voltage dependence below the limit of resolution see Materials and Methods and effects on charge movement and Ca 2 release inactivation cannot be completely ruled out The 1 knockout mice provide a unique resource to understand the function of this protein in myotubes in molecular detail Materials and Methods Gene targeting Bacteriophage clones containing portions of the 1 gene were isolated from a mouse 129Sv genomic library Stratagene La Jolla CA 946305 To inactivate the 1 gene a 4 4 kb Bam HI Xho I fragment upstream of exon 1 was subcloned into a multiple cloning site 5 of the neo and Herpes virus TK gene that was in pBluescript Stratagene A second 2 6 kb EcoR I BamH I fragment 3 of exon 4 of the 1 gene was cloned into a site between the neo and TK genes Fig 1Aii Thus the targeting vector contains 4 4 kb of identity with the native 1 gene 5 and 2 6 kb of identity 3 of the neo cassette respectively The targeting vector also contains the HSV TK gene to allow for negative selection of non recombinants A unique Bam HI restriction site was used to linearize the plasmid prior to its introduction into mouse ES cells by electroporation The 1 gene contains 4 exons and correct targeting results in the deletion of all 4 exons which will inactivate the gene Fig 1Aiii Probe 2 was used for identification of targeted clones 41 5 g of the targeting vector was electroporated into 5 10 6AB1 ES cells G418 and FIAU 1 2 deoxy 2 fluoro D arabinofuranosyl 5 iodouracil resistant clones were analyzed by Southern blotting after digestion with either Eco RI and hybridization to probe 1 or digestion with Hind III and hybridization to probe 2 Fig 1 Of three clones targeted on the 5 end two also were targeted on the 3 end These were expanded and used to produce germline chimeras Mice homozygous for the targeted allele were viable with no apparent abnormalities Mice heterozygous and homozygous for the targeted mutation are referred to as 1 het and 1 null respectively Western blots Total microsomes were prepared from the forelimb and hind limb muscles of control 1 het and 1 null adult mice as previously described 42 Total microsomes were washed twice with 0 6 M KCl buffer and 100 g of total membrane protein was applied to a 5 15 SDS polyacrylamide gel Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and analyzed with either anti 1S mAb IIC12 antibody 43 or anti 2 protein G purified guinea pig antibody 1 13 or anti 1a affinity purified sheep 6 antibody 44 or with anti 1 affinity purified guinea pig 16 antibody and the appropriate secondary antibodies 11 The subunits were visualized using SuperSignal ECL reagent Pierce Rockford IL The images were captured on a Chemi Imager Alpha Innotech San Leandro CA set to a level just below saturation Primary cultures of mouse myotubes Primary cultures were prepared from hind limbs of day 18 embryos E18 as described

During this time the maximal current density did not change 45 Electrophysiological measurements Whole cell recordings were performed as described previously 29 using an Axopatch 200B amplifier Axon Instruments Foster City CA Linear capacity and leak currents were compensated with the circuit provided by the manufacturer Series resistance Rs was compensated up to the point of amplifier oscillation with the Axopatch circuit Considering all cells in the present study the linear capacitance mean SE of control 1 null and 1 het myotubes was 256 25 pF 38 cells 246 16 pF 34 cells and 223 24 23 cells respectively Rs of the same cells before analog compensation was 7 0 5 M 7 2 0 4 M and 6 3 0 5 M respectively Following compensation the effective Rs was 2 M in all cases measured although this was not measured systematically Considering a mean cell capacitance of 240 pF a typical maximum current density of 5 to 10 pA pF see Fig 3B and Rs effective 2 M the voltage error was 2 4 to 4 8 mV All experiments were performed at room temperature Patch pipettes had an open tip resistance of 1 2 M when filled with the pipette solution Ca 2 currents were measured from a holding potential of 40 mV Test pulses of 500 ms in 5 mV increments ranged from 40 mV to 60 mV Ca 2 conductance vs voltage curves were obtained by extrapolation of the Ca 2 current to the reversal potential of the cell To measure inactivation cells were held at 80 mV then stepped to a series of depolarizing pre pulse voltages from 70 mV to 70 mV in 10 mV increments for 2 5 seconds to promote inactivation then stepped to 50 mV for 100 ms to close non inactivated channels then stepped for 200 ms to the test potential of 20 mV to measure Ca 2 currents then stepped to the 80 mV holding potential for 5 seconds to permit recovery from inactivation Charge movement was measured using a protocol that eliminated immobilization sensitive components 15 28 29 Voltage was stepped from a holding potential of 80 mV to 35 mV for 750 ms then to 50 mV for 5 ms then to test potential for 25 ms then to 50 mV for 30 ms and finally to the 80 mV holding potential Subtraction of the linear component was assisted by a P 4 procedure following the pulse paradigm listed above P 4 pulses were separated by 500 ms and had a duration of 25 ms Previous studies showed this choice of pulse protocol and internal and external solutions resulted in nifedipine sensitive charge movements of a magnitude 5 fold larger than those detected in dysgenic myotubes lacking 1S 29 Solutions The external solution in all cases was in mM 130 TEA methanesulfonate 10 CaCl 2 1 MgCl 2 10 HEPES titrated with TEA OH to pH 7 4 For Ca 2 transients and Ca 2 currents the pipette solution was in mM 140 Ca 2 Aspartate 5 MgCl 2 0 1 EGTA Ca 2 transients or 5 mM EGTA Ca 2 currents and 10 MOPS CsOH pH 7 2 For charge movements the pipette solution was in mM 120 NMG N methyl glucamine Glutamate 10 HEPES NMG 10 EGTA NMG pH 7 3 For charge movements the external solution was supplemented with 0 5 mM CdCl 2 and 0 5 mM LaCl 3 to block the Ca 2 current and 0 05 mM TTX to block residual Na current Ca 2 transient measurements Ca 2 transients were measured using a confocal microscope in line scan mode as described previously 46 47 48 Cells were loaded with 4 mM fluo 4 fluo 4 acetoxymethyl AM ester Molecular Probes Eugene OR for 20 to 40 min at room temperature Stocks of fluo 4 1 mg ml were made in DMSO and stored frozen All experiments were performed at room temperature Cells were viewed with an inverted Olympus microscope with a 20X objective N A 0 4 and a Fluoview confocal attachment Olympus Melville NY The 488 nm spectrum line necessary for fluo 4 excitation was provided by a 5 mW argon laser attenuated to 20 with neutral density filters The fluorescence intensity F was calculated by densitometric scanning of line scan images and was averaged over the entire width of the cell The background fluorescence intensity Fo was averaged in the same manner from areas of the same image prior to the voltage pulse The fluorescence unit F Fo corresponds to F Fo Fo The limit of fluorescence detection based on microscope settings and the average resting fluo 4 fluorescence was 0 1 F Fo units That is we could detect a 10 change above the cell resting fluorescence Using a pseudo ratiometric equation for estimating the cytosolic free Ca 2 48 and assuming a resting free Ca 2 of 100 nM 48 the nominal limit of resolution of free Ca 2 change was 200 nM Data and error analysis For each cell or for the population average the voltage dependence of charge movements Q Ca 2 conductance G and peak intracellular Ca 2 F Fo were fitted according to a Boltzmann equation A A max 1 exp V V 1 2 k where A max was either Q max G max or F Fo max V 1 2 is the potential at which A A max 2 and k is the slope factor For a fit of steady state inactivation the term V V 1 2 in the equation above was replaced by V 1 2 V Ca 2 conductance for each cell was computed from the extrapolated reversal potential and the maximal Ca 2 current at each voltage In all figures the symbols and error bars correspond to the population mean 1 SEM The curves correspond to a Boltzmann fit of the mean In addition to Student t tests reported in Table 1 one way ANOVA tests were conducted among the 11 sets of Boltzmann parameters of control 1 het and 1 null cells of Table 1 The null hypothesis equality of means was not rejected at a level of significance p 0 05 except in the two cases also identified by t tests namely G max and V 1 2 inactivation An F test which formally tests for the difference between the variances of independent populations was used to determine which of the fitted Boltzmann parameters A max V 1 2 k had the largest variance and thus the largest experimental error The ranking order in variance error was V 1 2 A max k Furthermore the error in V 1 2 was the largest for the fluorescence measurement and the smallest for the conductance measurement This result was expected since the size of the voltage step used in the V 1 2 determination was 5 mV for conductance 10 mV for charge movements and 20 mV for fluorescence The number of voltage steps in fluorescence measurements was kept to a minimum to avoid rundown of the Ca 2 transient due to photobleaching The limit of resolution of V 1 2 the parameter with the largest error was estimated with a z test which formally tests for the difference between the mean of a population and a hypothetical mean We determined the smallest difference between a experimental and a hypothesized V 1 2 resolvable at a level of statistical confidence p 0 05 In the calculations we used the data with the largest V 1 2 variance for each measurement conductance charge movement and fluorescence Also we assumed a hypothetical S D equal to the experimental S D The estimated limits of statistical resolution were 3 9 mV for conductance 6 5 mV for charge movements and 8 5 mV for fluorescence measurements Thus a difference in population mean V 1 2 of less than the indicated limit would not be statistically significant given the variance and the number of determinations of the present study Statistical analyses were performed with Analyse it software Leeds UK List of Abbreviations AID subunit interaction domain BID subunit interaction domain DMSO
