 Background In the United States about four million people have active peptic ulcers and about 350 000 new cases are diagnosed each year and approximately 3000 deaths per year in the U S are due to gastric ulcer 1 The primary therapeutic approach to gastric ulcer remains the inhibition of gastric acid secretion to produce symptom relief acceleration of crater healing and the prevention of relapse or recurrence 2 3 since gastric ulcer can lead to hemorrhage perforation obstruction and death 4 5 It is established that the H K ATPase or proton pump participates in the final step of acid secretion 6 7 and all the peripheral parietal cell stimuli converge to activate it 7 Therefore blocking the final process in hydrogen ion secretion reduces acid secretion and this is the mechanism of action of the substituted benzimidazole agents known as proton pump inhibitors PPI Currently five PPIs are marketed rabeprazole omeprazole esomeprazole lansoprazole and pantoprazole each with a different pharmacokinetic profile tissue selectivity binding specificity and potential to interact with the cytochrome P450 enzyme system 8 9 10 For example rabeprazole and esomeprazole achieve more rapid and profound inhibition of acid secretion than do older agents 10 It is unclear however if these pharmacologic differences lead to distinctions in the clinical efficacy of healing gastric ulcers and controlling ulcer symptoms To address this question we undertook a meta analysis of all randomized clinical trials that compared at least one of the newer PPI with either ranitidine or placebo Methods Statistical analysis The healing rate ratio RR was calculated for each trial by dividing the healing rate of the PPI by the rate with the comparator at the specified time point Chi squares and 95 confidence intervals CI were calculated using the exact method described by Miettinen 11 The appropriateness of combining results from individual studies was examined using the Wald 2for statistical homogeneity We considered a p value less than 0 05 to be significant for all statistical tests There were no adjustments for multiple comparisons As there was no statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity the healing rates for each treatment were pooled across trials by time point Overall healing rates of PPIs at four and eight weeks were estimated by pooling the rates for the recommended daily doses 30 mg d for lansoprazole 20 mg d for omeprazole 40 mg d for pantoprazole Rabeprazole was pooled using dose of 20 mg d at three and six weeks Individual trial results were weighted using the inverse of the variance of the RR estimated for each trial The overall RR was then estimated by dividing the weighted average healing rates for each treatment with the estimates for placebo ranitidine or omeprazole These overall RR were assessed using the Mantel Haenszel 2test and 95 CI were calculated using the exact method 11 To assess the possibility of publication bias the RR point estimates were plotted against year of publication and sample size To identify any studies that exerted a disproportionate influence on the summary treatment effect we deleted individual studies one at a time To investigate the possible consequences of including abstracts for which we could not obtain full reports we excluded these data in secondary analyses Results Clinical symptoms It was not possible to pool these results because different symptoms were reported in each study at different time points and also the method used to collect data varied Table 2 However individual trials showed more improvement or resolution of pain day pain and night pain was found with the new PPIs rabeprazole pantoprazole and lansoprazole compared to omeprazole For example 82 of patients with pain improved with rabeprazole compared to 65 with omeprazole at 6 weeks 26 Table 2 Healing rates Healing data are presented for the intention to treat analyses as similar results were obtained with the per protocol analysis For lansoprazole pantoprazole and omeprazole the results were reported at four and eight weeks and the rabeprazole studies did so at three and six weeks Therefore the overall healing rate was obtained at three four six and eight weeks Healing rates varied between the studies but were consistently lower with placebo treatment For the majority of patients receiving placebo treatment the ulcer did not heal during the course of the trial and the maximum recorded as healed was just over a third of the patients 39 in any of the trials Whilst higher healing rates were observed after treatment with ranitidine by the end of the trials the ulcers remained for at least half the patients 52 In contrast by the end of the trial the ulcers were healed in at least two thirds of the patients receiving proton pump inhibitors 67 As would be expected when compared with placebo treatment the PPIs lansoprazole and omeprazole improved the pooled healing RR at each time point In relation to ranitidine the pooled healing RR of PPIs lansoprazole omeprazole and pantoprazole was also increased at both four and eight weeks There were no studies versus rabeprazole The healing RR in each trial of the newer PPIs was found to be comparable or better than omeprazole at each time point Figure 1 Publication bias The healing RR was plotted against sample size but there was no trend with increasing size small studies had healing RR similar to large studies with the same comparator Figure 2 There was one abstract 27 with data obtained at 3 and 6 weeks which is not included Discussion In the absence of active treatment the majority of patients continued to have a gastric ulcer at the end of the trial A much higher healing rate was observed when patients received treatment with a PPI when compared to either a placebo or ranitidine This is consistent with the results obtained for treatment with PPIs when compared to ranitidine for both duodenal ulcers and gastro esophageal reflux disease 2 28 We also found that there is some evidence of an advantage to prescribing two of the newer PPIs lansoprazole or pantoprazole compared to omeprazole for gastric ulcer since there was a 15 increase in healing rates at 4 weeks In addition the newer PPIs rabeprazole lansoprazole and pantoprazole have all been show to produce superior improvement in clinical symptoms compared to omeprazole at both 2 and 4 weeks 24 25 26 Relatively few randomized controlled clinical trials have been published on the efficacy of PPI for treating gastric ulcers when compared with gastro esophageal reflux disease or with duodenal ulcers 29 30 This could be due to gastric ulcers being less frequently diagnosed than duodenal ulcer 31 or the importance of clinicians confirming a differential diagnosis between gastric ulcer and gastric cancer Some authors have also argued that the classification of gastric and duodenal ulcers is artificial since ulcers could be driven distally or drawn proximally across the arbitrary boundary of the pylorus 32 Furthermore some clinical assessments may be complicated as 10 20 of patients with gastric ulcers also have duodenal ulcers However given the severity of the symptoms generally associated with a gastric ulcer there no longer appears to be a clear justification for continuing to conduct placebo controlled trials in these patients Recent observations have suggested that the duration of treatment with acid secretory inhibitors is more important than the degree of acid inhibition per 24 hours 33 We could not test the long term effect of PPIs on ulcer relapse rates since there was not enough information published More research into maintenance therapy is clearly required because the relative long term efficacy of different treatments particularly the combination of PPIs with antibiotics and the effect of dose variation on the relapse and complications from gastric ulcers is not well studied Other factors known to have an impact on gastric ulcer healing are smoking alcohol and ulcer size but the papers did not report the healing results for these subgroups of patients or by those variables Unfortunately the researchers reported different clinical symptoms and methods to collect the data and so we could not pool these results Conclusions This study suggests that the first line drug therapy for patients diagnosed with gastric ulcer should be a PPI in preference to an H2 antagonist This study indicated that compared with ranitidine the PPIs provide faster onset of action greater relief of symptoms and increased healing rates However there is also clearly a need for additional studies to determine the appropriate maintenance doses and understand the factors influencing healing
