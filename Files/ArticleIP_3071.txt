 Cheater s Poker About two thirds of the way into Burn Rate Michael Wolff s sardonic tell all about his failed attempt to become an Internet multimillionaire the author pauses to ask himself a set of questions I had been wanting him to address for 150 pages How many fairly grievous lies had I told How many moral lapses had I committed How many ethical breaches had I fallen into Alas it only sounds like soul searching Wolff relishes the many deceits and indiscretions he commits in his pursuit of Internet riches and after this brief hiatus he redoubles his efforts to hoodwink the financier partners he believes are out to swindle him Burn Rate currently all the rage in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street and excerpted in the June Wired to wide acclaim deserves our attention for its panoramic treatment of the Internet s boom years and its pus ugly picture of the get rich psyche But Burn Rate will attract the majority of its readers because its message The Internet Has Failed Us panders to the current consensus Didn t the last round of Internet initial public offerings bomb Aren t the existing Internet stocks depressed Isn t the Internet really about technology and not content Isn t the Internet like cable TV all those Web sites and nothing on The Burn Rate saga begins in 1994 as Wolff a respected journalist and publishing entrepreneur in his 40s attracts the interest of several heavyweight New York investors and 5 million in financing The money men want to transform his little successes a Yahoo like home page for the Internet masses Your Personal Net and the NetGuide series of books about what s on the Internet into the next Yahoo As the investors and the investment banker prepare the foundation for an IPO There is no valuation There s only orchestration intones the investment banker Wolff imagines a public company worth several hundred million dollars Meanwhile his company s burn rate the amount it spends in excess of income soars By 1997 many meetings industry conventions threatening phone calls and transcontinental flights later Wolff flees from his creditors and the crocodile swamp of deals and venture capital and legal disputes as competitors overtake his flimsy concept He decides he isn t a craven CEO a Netrepreneur or a deal maker He s a writer with this book in him And the Internet is a big joke Iowe Burn Rate a better synopsis if only to excavate the psychopathology that runs through it like a sewer But beware of comparisons with Liar s Poker 1989 Michael Lewis first person account of his wild ride on the Salomon Bros money go round and his eventual escape In fact beware of the flattering blurb by Lewis on Burn Rate s dust jacket Charm not malice guides Lewis odyssey through a business gone similarly bonkers Listen to Wolff s treacherous heartbeat as he daydreams on his way to a business meeting with CMP Media the multibillion dollar computer magazine publisher Would I get rich for being a visionary Or would I get rich for being a charlatan CMP wants to buy Wolff s Web sites database and license his NetGuide name for a magazine about the Web Alison Anthoine Wolff s wife and attorney sizes up the deal with the acumen of a confidence man They know nothing about this And you know next to nothing Anthoine says It does appear however that we can sell them the next to nothing we know for a lot of money Wolff gloats like a hyena when CMP makes the purchase I genuinely believe they thought that they were buying the Internet from us he writes Just think how many stupid people there are in this world we can take advantage of To Wolff s all knowing smirk CMP pulls the plug on the NetGuide concept a couple of years later after having dropped tens of millions on it This sort of candor and cold bloodedness abounds on every page Wolff gratuitously singles out by name one of his employees as having extreme body odor He calls America Online executive Ted Leonsis a fat man an ugly man sweating like crazy He labels his most dependable source of investment capital a wire thin almost feminized JFK Jr look alike and quotes the look alike describing their investment banker as a fat fuck Of an old colleague Wolff writes I admired him at the same time I made fun of him behind his back he goes on to dismiss him as a gay Sammy Glick He ridicules Wired founder Louis Rosetto as a lost soul who wears sneakers Full disclosure I m acquainted with Rosetto and the gay Sammy Glick Wolff heaps analogous abuse on the Internet industry In the cyber business it seemed that no one ever told the truth Sometimes it seemed that there was no truth It was all bullshit He calls AOL the most dysfunctional company in America adding that every business AOL had ever tried had failed The moronic Baby Bells are 18 months behind the curve Microsoft hasn t a clue More full disclosure Microsoft publishes Slate The Washington Post Ready for fleecing when it invests in NetGuide Wolff admits only one person into his circle of virtue Former Time Warner new media chief Walter Isaacson who has since ascended to the editorship of Time Isaacson s genius was that he understood the Web s potential but was smart enough to leave the new media division early Delicious dish but watch out for the aftertaste Wolff exploits the human tendency to confuse frankness and cruelty with truth telling And by repeatedly reminding the reader of what a dishonest scheming little shit he is he seeks to inflate his credibility A real liar wouldn t tell you that he s a liar as Wolff does would he The wealth of verbatim quotations constituting a good third of this book also enhances Burn Rate s verisimilitude But should it Wolff writes that he jotted down bits of dialogue on his legal pads during meetings while others composed to do lists Not to accuse anyone of Stephen Glassism but I d love to see Wolff post those copious notes on his promotional Web site www burnrate com As Wolff s dreams of undeserved riches fade into a mirage Burn Rate becomes the journal of a loser And like most losers he fails to give the winners their due No Web startup except for Yahoo appears to be making much money yet scores of insurgent companies Excite AOL Amazon com Virtual Vineyards Auto by Tel TheStreet com and eBay to name a few continue to massage the medium attract serious investors and lay the substructure for the inevitable an Internet economy What s more these companies believe in their products unlike Wolff and back them with serious managers who whatever their other weaknesses are fleet footed and care about their customers Given Wolff s transparent contempt for his industry his business partners his end users and his colleagues actually everybody but his wife and Isaacson it s a miracle he got as far in the Internet business as he did Has the World Wide Web which only appeared in 1993 failed us Can any 5 year old fail us Compare the breakneck growth of the Web with that of any new medium of the past 150 years the telegraph the telephone the motion picture radio television cable TV and the VCR Blithe investors toss millions at the Web out of the conviction that it will subsume the other media change the face of capitalism and generate billion dollar payouts They re right But consider yourself fortunate if you ve never invested a penny in this market Any sure thing attracts too many hackneyed ideas like Wolff s and too much foolish money For all his bluntness Wolff never concedes that the product he was selling essentially another set of Web directories wasn t that appealing Nor judging from this book was its primary salesman
