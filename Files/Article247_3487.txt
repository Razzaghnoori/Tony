                                 What the Net Hath Wrought                        Dear Joe            Well I guess we probably will not ever agree But I only need to use yourexamples as proof that what the Internet has wrought in an unbelievably shorttime has been profoundthe entire computer industry as evidenced by MichaelDells success has been turned on its ear the retail industry is reeling didyou see the many news stories today about Nordstroms striking a deal with awellknown Silicon Valley venture firm to jumpstart its Web efforts andtraditional media companies are in fullscale alert            Consider the daily impact of AOL which has risen from obscurity to disdainto prominence in only five years I think you dont even have to take a poll ofAmericas top execs to get them to agree that they think this company is animportant one these days Consider its rivals as the best indicatorright nowboth Microsoft and ATT have painted a big red target on AOL and are takingaim on multiple fronts            And why is this Because finally after all those years of promises theinteractive age is upon us I used to joke that the idea of interactivetelevision has been around since I had been a fetus but that it never seemedto work Now pretty much every major communications company is formulatingplans to shove a fully loaded digital settop box into Americas living roomsto move interactive services from the computer to the televisionor any devicein the house really Did you hear about the Internet refrigerator that linksto grocery sites Of course I am probably the only one who thinks this is agood idea Its clear to me that either via a plethora of wires or satellite orwireless means we are all going to be plugged in more than ever before in thecoming years I myself am a cell phone freak who cannot imagine being withoutmy little Nokia  Relying on cell phones completely I had even abandonedlandline phones from the local telephone provider until I was recently forcedto link up again to get highspeed Internet access over telephones I used tobe mocked for my cell addiction but now I am regularly sought after for adviceon just which plan to get            But to a bigger point we should all think about what this means to societyand its citizens on a more personal level For this I turn to an article inthe New York Times today about an outbreak of syphilis in San Franciscobeing linked to one chat room on AOL Apparently six men who have contractedthe disease have said they met those partners offline after meeting incyberspace first To say nothing of the idea that the Internet is replacing thebar as the best place to hook up the Times asked the more pertinentquestion When does the right to online privacy yield to public healthissues The big problem is that most of the men knew their infected partnersonly by their AOL screen names And AOL which can identify these customerswas not giving out the real names            I would be curious what you think of this and perhaps about the broaderissues of so much personal information sloshing around about Internet usersThe medium is really a marketers dream giving them the ability to glean a lotof highly specific information about people and their habits A dozen companiesand more to come are focused solely on recording and interpreting userpatterns            It also cuts both ways Several missives ago you did hit on a good pointabout the Internets being important in giving consumers perfect knowledgeabout products and most important prices This is another big idea to me andone that I have been waiting to happen for a long time I was a retail reporterfor seven years before I started covering the Internet and my one majorconclusion from the job was that retailers hate customers Any new system thatallows a consumer to take back some of the power that is rightfully theirs tobegin withit is their money after allis one I will backimmediately I am particularly taken with the new sites called demanddrivenretail In this system people ask for what they want and the retailers respondrather than being told what they like and dont like But is there some problemwith this Will for example there eventually be a site dedicated solely toJoe Nocera and his needs And dare I ask what would be on it            CheersKara
