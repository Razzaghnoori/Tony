 Mad as Hell Antonin Artaud suffered his first depressive breakdown at 16 at 21 he was diagnosed with hereditary syphilis his parents in addition were first cousins He was treated with laudanum which initiated a lifelong drug addiction Although in nearly constant physical pain he had contracted meningitis when he was five and the headaches continued for the rest of his life and mental anguish he functioned reasonably well until the age of 41 when a number of psychotic incidents caused him to be confined in a psychiatric hospital He suffered from what was described as incurable paranoid delirium and left that asylum only to enter another In all he spent roughly 15 of his 52 years in institutions of one sort or another For all that he was extraordinarily productive His collected writings fill 26 volumes in the French edition He was trained as an actor and went on to direct found his own theater and write a set of visionary theoretical essays collected as The Theater of Cruelty that have continued to influence theatrical practitioners to this day He also acted in films his performances are few but indelible from his matinee idol turn as the empathetic monk in Carl Theodor Dreyer s The Passion of Joan of Arc 1928 to his part as Marat in Abel Gance s Napoleon 1927 in which at one point he breaks off a discussion by getting down on all fours and barking like a dog He was an early member of the surrealists and director of the group s Central Research Bureau He was drummed out by Andr Breton after two years nearly all members were expelled sooner or later but Breton eventually repented calling him a man of prodigies and perhaps the truest surrealist of all Artaud s work in his many fields is consistent and interwoven but it is not easy to define It is above all a monument to frustration one long scream of protest at the inadequacy of language of human society of the body and the mind Artaud was a revolutionary who was fighting for the overthrow of the constraints that define consciousness It is as if he could just make out the penumbra of some spiritual essence on the far edge of his perception and was maddened by his inability to seize it He described all his work as documents that is not the poems essays polemics they seem to be and certainly not art but mere records of his flailing attempts to reach the elusive substance of Truth The drawings currently on exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art he likewise qualified as documents These drawings there are roughly 70 items are products of the last decade or so of his life he died in 1948 are not well known and have never before been shown in this country They are singular and powerful works gathered together they possess a clobbering force They seem to come out of nowhere while prefiguring all sorts of later tendencies in art It seems absurd to think that the evolution they present covers only 10 or 11 years rather than an entire career but then Artaud hardly thought in terms of a career The earliest works are described as spells These are blessings and curses he wrote on charred or otherwise manipulated bits of paper and sent to friends enemies and a few public figures Hitler for one in the late 1930s in the wake of a disastrous trip he took to Ireland wielding a cane that he believed was the staff of Saint Patrick from which he returned in a straitjacket These spells are nowhere translated or transcribed and the handwriting is often indecipherable One of the few I could make out addressed to the actor Roger Blin reads in part All those who have acted to prevent me from taking HEROIN all those who have laid a finger on Anne Manson a friend on account of that Sunday illegible May 1939 I will illegible them alive on a square in PARIS and I will cause them to be perforated and burn their marrow Artaud began drawing in earnest around 1944 By 1945 he was making large tableaux of what he called hieroglyphics fields of human figures symbolic objects and words many of them in invented languages Some of these drawings in precise pencil with hints of color have a diagrammatic quality that seems oddly evocative of Saul Steinberg s work indeed divorced from context some might at first be mistaken as whimsical There are multiple breasts various penile objects including cousins of Dal s penis on crutch and details that might derive from alchemical symbology In 1946 the pencil work became heavier and more insistent the colors more assertive the nightmare aspects harder to miss A work entitled The Theater of Cruelty for example shows a number of women apparently encased in glass coffins an exceedingly cryptic stew of geometric and biomorphic elements is called The Sexual Awkwardness of God In May 1946 he produced his first self portrait It is so heavily scored that it looks nearly sculptural and it is covered with dots that look like smallpox an essay in the catalogue cites Freud by way of Gilles Deleuze on the schizophrenic aptitude for perceiving the surface and skin as if it were pierced with an infinite number of little holes A Blue Head made around the same time is even scarier caught in midscream all covered with those diseased dots with occluded eyes and a banana neck It is convincingly a face from hell In 1947 Artaud moved from the psychiatric hospital at Rodez to a sort of halfway house at Ivry sur Seine where he had more mobility and was able to receive visitors These he drew in a series of penetrating and quite varied portraits Rolande Prevel for example is given almost a Matisse treatment Colette Thomas is rendered with a delicacy that amounts to tenderness while Jacques Prevel seems to have been sawn in two and restitched any old way Mania O fer turned into an owl Arthur Adamov fashioned from flung mud with a penis for a nose Adamov was the author of Ping Pong and other plays the other portrait subjects are mostly unknown to me Artaud was clearly an excellent draftsman but as he notes you must look at the drawings and see what s inside He also writes that the human face is an empty force a field of death and that the alignment of form and content has never been farther off than in the contrast between facial features and what lies beneath them His portraits are so uncompromising they make Picasso s or Giacometti s look polite By the end just before his death from rectal cancer a grimly appropriate fate for the author of The Search for Fecality in which he asks Is god a being If he is he is one of shit shit being in Artaud s view of human essence and the sole alternative to the void he was beginning to draw complex heavily laden constructions that look like architecture made from heads in the very last drawing they are stacked as in so many totem poles They are anything but morbid though they possess a vivid throbbing life These drawings appear to synthesize all the preoccupations of the phases of his previous three years they fluidly combine the diagrammatic the near lyrical and the excruciating Here again Artaud s ferocity anguish and hallucinatory paranoia are matched and joined by his intelligence and paradoxical control Artaud may have been mad but his art is hardly confined to madness The portraits in which he used calm observation and academic skill to depict external reality while representing the interior through distortion and paper tearing physical force are more troubling than many of the interestingly science fictional renderings of his visions for example His work can no more be dispatched into some rubric like outsider art than that of Blake or H lderlin Artaud s art is insidious its penetration of what we know is so acute its lucidity so much the equal of its delusion that deciding where the one leaves off and the other begins can seem merely a measure of our own delusions
