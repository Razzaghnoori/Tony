 so what kind of benefits do do you have in your job that you think is uh very important health care health care like dental number one dental and medical yes yes i m fortunate in that i was able to take early retirement from my company last year and being able to do that i was able to keep my uh health insurance that the company pays for which and i had to pick up my own life insurance uh huh and my wife who works at the same company was able to add me to to the uh dental insurance right so i was really fortunate i really was so just this so you think that the uh a good company will provide good health i think they will as long as they can but the problem obviously is the cost of health care as you know it s just going completely out of sight right i hear that s like one of the major uh the major costs to companies to corporations nowadays it is very much so it s a billion dollar problem you know every year uh our company had it doesn t apply to me thank goodness it applies to you know to the younger employees that they re having to pick up you know more of the uh health insurance cost you know themselves the deductibles are going up and the co payments are going up um hum right and i m concerned that s just you know the beginning of it see the problem i have with it is that i don t have a job oh yeah so i don t have and i m still in in school i m still in college that s a problem too yeah um hum right and so i don t i don t know firsthand of these benefits um hum right but i i do agree with you that health health insurance is one of the major ones i don t know about dental i mean oh i dental is is kind of like uh you know you re asking for uh too much um hum to for me i think it s like uh you know uh you re you re expecting too much from a company if something happens it happens and they ll pay you for it but um hum um hum to actually have you know big coverage for something like that um hum well actually excuse me our dental insurance you know it s it s good it s certainly better than nothing it s not you know it s not super you for unfortunately in my case and you sound like a younger guy so you probably don t have it you know i do have some dental problems and it s very very expensive right i m only twenty one and if your blessed with you know good dental uh situation you are extremely lucky you really are i ve had a lot of problems i still have some ongoing problems mainly because back when i was growing up um hum you know we didn t know about fluoride i was raised in a small rural town in Oklahoma you only went to the dentist when your tooth actually began to hurt you know there was no such thing as preventive dentistry back then right exactly yeah so the younger people you know uh are are really uh really better shaped than than people of my generation or for the most part um hum but uh dental insurance is important to me it is not as important as uh as health insurance you know if i had to rank them as health right so uh for a health insurance what do you think would be a uh a good health insurance with a a low deductible and a high premium or do you prefer the lower premiums with a higher deductible oh gosh that s that s the general you know you you know you almost need to know the family situation you know and you know number of kids fortunately i have two children and they re both grown and are covered you know under their own plans so i don t i don t have medical you know expenses for them per say uh i guess if i had to choose i would be willing to pay more you know to get to get better coverage uh huh i guess it also depends on how many how many times you re going to use it now we that s right that s right and also we i say we uh i m retired from Texas Instruments and they re just they re like most everybody else you can t just you don t drop into a hospital and demand you know a thousand dollars worth of tests you know or you think you need to be hospitalized but there s only a certain i mean you can go anywhere you want to go but there s only approved uh health care centers you know that uh that they will pay you know the maximum amount right if you choose to go you know you pick up the difference according to the emergency it doesn t make any difference you can you know you can go wherever you need to go right so also they were doing for a long time they were doing the company was paying for second opinions uh huh to doctors but they have since dropped that i guess it got to be you know not cost effective too expensive more expensive for them to do that then right so they have dropped the uh second opinion type thing but before you uh allow yourself to be admitted to the hospital you really there s a telephone number that you have to call you know and they will tell you exactly you know what they will pay for it um hum so that that s pretty good and if you yeah if you want to so at least you you know you wouldn t have any surprises you can order any type of you know service you want but you stand a good chance you know having to pick up at least part of the bill yourself um hum so the so i guess that if when i get a job and i and i look into the health insurance that they re going to pay for then i should really look really really deep into the policy um hum absolutely you need about even probably the very first thing i i should look at huh absolutely do you have a family no not yet i see well it will become even more important you know when and if you do um hum but i would really check that out because i m concerned in coming years it s going to be you know just a horrendous burden to especially the younger folks what i m really scared about and you know i m i don t know firsthand but i it seems to me that like you were saying earlier that the deductibles are getting bigger and bigger um hum right and that s scary because you know in the end you re getting insurance for basically nothing that s right i mean something really really really serious has happened for you you know to to make it worthwhile and then that that that that that defeats the purpose of insurance um hum right yeah absolutely absolutely um you know some companies can t can t even afford any longer you know to carry the insurance they re just dropping it you know they don t have any choice it s bankrupting them yeah but i m i am and very fortunate in that i was able to retire you know with with health benefits yeah that sounds like a big big asset to do that oh absolutely absolutely same to you well it s been nice talking to you i guess i ll uh maybe see you again sometime okay you take care of yourself good luck to you thank you bye bye you too bye
