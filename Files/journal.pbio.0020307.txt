                            The ongoing battle between hosts and pathogens has long been of interest to evolutionary        biologists Because hosts and pathogens act as environments for each other their        intertwined struggle for existence is both continual and rapid At the molecular level        this cycle of environmental change and evolutionary response means that mutations are        continually being tried out by natural selection It is therefore little wonder that the        host and pathogen genes that control infection and immunity frequently show high levels of        genetic diversity and present some of the best examples of positive selection adaptive        evolution reported to date Yang and Bielawski  In particular rates of        nonsynonymous substitution per site resulting in an amino acid change d        N  often greatly exceed those of synonymous substitution per site        silent change d        S  as expected if most mutations are fixed because they increase        fitness Figure         At the host level most studies of the selection pressures acting on immune system genes        have concentrated on genes implicated in the adaptive immune response against microbial        pathogens particularly those producing antibodies Sitnikova and Nei  Sumiyama et al         or genes encoding reconnaissance molecules known as the major histocompatibility        complex MHC which control the action of Tcells Hughes and Nei  Yeager and Hughes         Box  As its name suggests the role of the adaptive immune response is to        stimulate and memorise immunity to specific pathogens As microbial pathogens such as        viruses are both abundant and rapidly evolving positive selection on components of the        adaptive immune response is often very strong Yeager and Hughes  Far less attention        has been directed toward the less specific innate nonadaptive immune response even        though this response requires a wide array of genes and acts as the front line of immune        defence Box  Would we expect the same strength of positive selection on a generalized        pathogen control system This is a question of fundamental importance because the luxury of        adaptive immunity is not available to most organisms having probably evolved along with        the vertebrates Bartl et al  whereas the more widespread innate immune system is        often depicted as a primitive characteristic                    Molecular Evolution of the Innate Immune System        The genes involved in innate immunity have recently come under the molecular        evolutionists gaze One important group are the defensins a large class of short        antimicrobial peptides that constitute an effective immune response team in organisms as        diverse as plants and primates Boman  Because defensins are cationic positively        charged they are able to interact with negatively charged molecules on the surface of        microbes and permeate their membranes Sequence analyses of defensins and similar        antimicrobial peptides have revealed the telltale signatures of positive selection with d        N greater than d        S in many comparisons Hughes  Duda et al  Maxwell et al         Other genes of the innate immune system also seem to be subject to powerful positive        selection One dramatic example described in this issue of         PLoS Biology is the APOBECG gene of primates Sawyer et al  This        case is especially striking because rather than killing pathogens through protein or        cellular interactions like most immune genes APOBECG works by manipulating the genome        sequence of the invading microbe        The genomes of primates contain a family of nine APOBEC genes that encode enzymes        involved in the editing of RNA andor DNA through the deamination of cytosine C so that        this nucleotide mutates to uracil U This is essential for various aspects of cellular        function APOBEC for example is involved in the CU editing of apolipoprotein B mRNA        therein christening the family while another family member the activationinduced        deaminase has a vital role in adaptive immunity in that it assists in the diversification        of antibodies Two more enzymes APOBECG and APOBECF form part of the innate immune        system they function as antiviral agents and are being intensively studied in the context        of infection with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV the cause of AIDS In particular        APOBECG targets the reverse transcription step of the HIV life cycle in which the viral        genomic RNA is converted into proviral DNA which is then integrated into the host genome        Mangeat et al  APOBECGinduced deamination at this stage results in monotonous        guaninetoadenine GA nucleotide changes a phenomenon called GA hypermutation that had        long been noted by HIV researchers without a clear understanding of its cause We now know        that GA hypermutation is part of the innate immune response to retroviral infections        Although there is still some debate over exactly how APOBECG leads to viral        eradication the most likely scenario is that GA hypermutation results in the generation        and incorporation of a multitude of deleterious mutations that fatally disrupt viral        functions This strategy is likely to work well for retroviruses like HIV because their        genomes are so compact that individual sequence regions often perform multiple functions        Under these cramped conditions most mutations are likely to severely disrupt some aspect        of viral function and thereby reduce fitness Holmes  Indeed it has been estimated        that the deleterious mutation rate in viruses that replicate using RNA polymerases either        reverse transcriptase in the case of retroviruses or RNAdependent RNA polymerase for other        RNA viruses is on the order of one error per replication cycle so that many of the viral        progeny produced by replication are defective Elena and Moya  HIV is normally able        to overcome this burden of deleterious mutation because of its remarkable reproductive        power each day on the order of          virions are produced in a single infected individual Perelson et al         so that enough fit and able recruits will make it through to the next        generation                    Treating RNA Virus Infections Through Lethal Mutagenesis        The high mutation rates of RNA viruses mean that adaptively useful genetic variation is        produced frequently The rub however is that fitnessenhancing mutations are a small        minority and the preponderance of deleterious mutations means that RNA viruses live on the        edge of survival Domingo  By increasing the rate at which deleterious mutations        appear APOBECG pushes viruses over this edge causing a form of lethal mutagenesis that        results in their destruction the rate of mutation becomes so high that no genome can        reproduce itself faithfully and the population crashes Intriguingly researchers        designing new antiviral drugs have also begun to realise that forcing viruses into this        sort of error catastrophe might be an effective way to treat them Figure  There are a        growing number of studies in which mutagens such as ribavirin and fluorouracil are        applied to viral infections in vitro and in vivo including HIV in the hope that these        will induce so many deleterious mutations that the virus suffers an error catastrophe and        is cleared Loeb et al  Sierra et al  Crotty et al  RuizJarabo et al         The results produced to date are highly encouraging particularly when these        errorinducing drugs are combined with more conventional treatment strategies that aim to        reduce the rate of viral replication Pariente et al  The discovery that a natural        antiviral agent APOBECG probably works in much the same way should provide even more        encouragement        Sadly however the pathogens have fought back The antiHIV properties of APOBECG were        discovered because most viral strains escape its neutralising properties Lentiviruses like        HIV possess a gene that encodes an protein called Vif viral infectivity factor that        counters APOBECG Sheehy et al  Hence it is probably only in naturally occurring        Vifdefective mutants that APOBECG is effective against HIV Furthermore because positive        selection on APOBECG has operated for at least  million years and lentiviruses in        general and HIV in particular are likely to be more recently evolved than this it is        clear that a broad range of retroviral pathogens have been responsible for the adaptive        evolution of this particular immune gene Sawyer et al  Given the frequency with        which the remnants of past retroviral infections are found in the mammalian genome Smit         in the form of usually defunct endogenous retroviruses Box  it is likely that        our genomes are continually bombarded with retroviruses like HIV but that the majority are        cleared by innate immune mechanisms like APOBECG It is possible that the retroviruses        that successfully infect us are those like HIV that have managed to evolve strategies to        avoid the destructive capacities of APOBECG        The intense selective pressure on the defensins and APOBECG illustrates that although        the innate immune response is generalist in its action it is as highly and intricately        evolved as its betterstudied ally the adaptive immune system Rather than being an        evolutionary remnant it is a dynamic and continually adapting system Less clear is        whether other host proteins act in the same manner as APOBECG In particular the most        common and destructive pathogens faced by humans and other mammals are RNA viruses such as        influenza A yellow fever and hepatitis C In most cases our ability to survive these        viral infections is simply a combination of good luck and good breeding with the right        combination of MHC alleles itself a function of population history and what we by chance        inherit from our parents some individuals may be more able to fight off viral infections        than others The ubiquity of RNA viruses hints that our genomes might also contain an        innate yet highly adapted defence system that targets this abundant class of pathogens by        manipulating their mutation rate Although utilizing lethal mutagenesis might one day be an        important way to design new drugs against a variety of viral pathogens it would come as no        surprise if nature got there first
