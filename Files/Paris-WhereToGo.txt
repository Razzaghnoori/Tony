 Where To Go Getting Around The first thing you should get is a carnet or book of ten m tro tickets good for buses too Or better still if you re staying a week or more one of the special passes which give even greater savings see page 118 Then buy a Museum Pass see page 74 to save money and avoid waiting at ticket counters To get your bearings picture Paris as a circle with the river Seine threading across the center flanked by famous landmarks Notre Dame the Louvre place de la Concorde Arc de Triomphe the Tour Eiffel Bridges link the Right north and Left Banks via the two islands in the middle Ile de la Cit and Ile St Louis This is one of the easiest of large cities to travel around The modernized m tro system is smooth regular and fast with low flat rate fares RER commuter trains can also take you rapidly to the outskirts where two major attractions Versailles and the Disneyland Paris Resort are located Buses give you a sightseeing tour at a bargain price respecting schedules as far as traffic allows rush hours can create terrible jams Taxis provide a lazy alternative but are not always faster than the m tro especially on longer rides across town Bus tours take you to the big attractions but inevitably at times when they are busiest Some tour buses that take you around the highlights let you hop on and off wherever and as often as you like all on one ticket for a period of up to 48 hours Tourist information offices see page 121 have details Bicycle rental companies see page 103 also run tours If you want to sightsee in style and expensively you can even see Paris from a helicopter plane or hot air balloon In line skates have become very popular for touring the town and can also be rented see page 103 Parisians themselves often use the Batobus river bus for traveling east or west and avoiding traffic snarls It runs from May to September stops are at the Tour Eiffel Mus e d Orsay Louvre Notre Dame and H tel de Ville It s relatively expensive but you may prefer the absence of commentary A boat cruise on the Seine is one of the best introductions to the city While you glide along multilingual commentaries tell you about the sights Boats run from about 10am to 10 30pm Most tour boats provide a choice of open air and glassed in seating some offer lunch and dinner Trips last 60 to 75 minutes Canal tours reveal a less grand but more intimate face of Paris on the way from the center to Parc de la Villette see page 72 in the northeastern outskirts The leisurely trip takes three hours with a tunnel and several locks to be negotiated Central Paris is surprisingly compact and most hotels are close to many of the sights So if time isn t a major factor the best way of getting the feel of the place is to walk All you need is a pair of comfortable shoes and a map The big department stores and hotels give away millions of street maps each year M tro stations display good maps of their local district as well as the m tro itself and give out pocket plans of the m tro and bus routes At street level bus stop shelters have an excellent detailed map of the neighborhood More and more streets and entire areas like Les Halles and Beaubourg have been pedestrianized adding to the profusion of parks squares and gardens The Islands Ile de la Cit This is where Paris s story began Like the emblem on its coat of arms the Ile de la Cit takes the form of a boat with the romantic tree shaded place du Vert Galant as its prow pointing downstream From the first settlement built by the original Parisii until the middle of the 19th century the pocket sized island lay at the heart of the city The earliest rulers held court here The cathedral clergy and artisans made it their home Then ruthless urban planner Baron Haussmann swept away almost all the medieval and 17th century structures leaving just place Dauphine and rue Chanoinesse ancient home of the cathedral canons as signs of the island s once rich residential life The baron was also toying with the idea of replacing the gracious red brick houses of the triangular place Dauphine with a neo Grecian colonnaded square when thankfully he was forced out of office for juggling the books Near the lively Pont Neuf the place was built in 1607 by Henri IV in honor of his son the dauphin or future king Louis XIII Sadly only numbers 14 and 26 are still in their original state Number 10 was the home of film stars Simone Signoret and Yves Montand The huge Palais de Justice heart of the centralized French legal system stands on the site of the Roman palace where the Emperor Julian was crowned in 360 Together with the Conciergerie see page 30 it sprawls right across the Ile de la Cit Concealed in the courtyard between them is a Gothic masterpiece the Sainte Chapelle whose fine proportions stand in sharp contrast to the ponderous palace The chapel was constructed in 1248 to house holy relics fragments of what were believed to be Jesus s Crown of Thorns and the True Cross which pious Louis IX later canonized as St Louis had bought from the Byzantine emperor Try to arrive as the chapel opens or at sunset see page 39 and make your way to the upper level where light blazes in through 15 stained glass windows separated by buttresses so slim that there seems to be no wall at all Miraculously of the 1 134 individual pieces of glass 720 are 13th century originals The chapel provides an exquisite setting for chamber music concerts Between 1789 and 1815 the chapel assumed various guises a flour warehouse during the Revolution and a club for high ranking dandies then an archive for Napol on s Consulate It was this latter role that saved the chapel from projected destruction since the bureaucrats could not think of another site in which to put their mountains of paper These days they find room for their papers in the Palais de Justice and the nearby Pr fecture de Police haunt of those fictional detectives Inspectors Maigret and Clouseau The great lobby of the Palais the Salle des Pas Perdus is worth a visit for a glimpse of the many lawyers plaintiffs witnesses court reporters and assorted hangers on waiting nervously for the wheels of French justice to grind into action Their anxiety is nothing compared with that of the prisoners once held in the forbidding Conciergerie entrance on the quai de l Horloge It was originally the residence of the king s concierge as part of the 14th century royal palace In 1793 at the height of the Terror it literally became the antechamber of the guillotine Queen Marie Antoinette Robespierre Danton and Saint Just all spent their last nights in the Galerie des Prisonniers The Salle des Girondins displays a guillotine blade the crucifix to which Marie Antoinette prayed and the lock used on Robespierre s cell Look out on the Cour des Femmes where husbands lovers wives and mistresses were allowed one final tryst before the tumbrels came to carry off the condemned About 2 500 victims of the Revolutionary guillotine spent their last hours in the Conciergerie Notre Dame The site of the cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris has had a religious role for at least 2 000 years In Roman times a temple to Jupiter stood here some stone fragments unearthed in 1711 can be seen in the Mus e du Moyen Age see page 55 In the fourth century the first Christian church St Etienne was built joined two centuries later by a second church dedicated to Notre Dame Norman raids left both in a sorry state and Bishop Maurice de Sully decided a cathedral should be built to replace them Begun in 1163 the main part of Notre Dame took 167 years to finish Its transition from Romanesque to Gothic has been called a perfect representation of medieval architecture an opinion that has ancient and modern dissenters Cistercian monks protested that such a sumptuous structure was an insult to the godly virtue of poverty and today architectural purists still find Notre Dame a bit too much It was however built to inspire awe Over its long history the cathedral has witnessed many momentous occasions In 1239 there was the procession of Louis IX barefoot carrying his holy treasure Jesus s Crown of Thorns now in the Sainte Chapelle in 1430 it saw the humiliation of Henry VI of England he was crowned King of France here see page 15 And in 1594 it was where Henri IV made his cynical conversion to Catholicism a move that reinforced his hold on the French throne Napol on chose it as the setting for crowning himself emperor upstaging the Pope who had come to Paris expecting to do it In modern times it has been a place for celebrating victory and mourning the passing of France s leaders General de Gaulle marked the 1944 Liberation of Paris with a mass here and in 1970 his death was similarly commemorated In 1996 a funeral service was held for de Gaulle s archrival Fran ois Mitterrand here Across the three doorways of the west front the 28 statues of the Galerie des Rois represent the kings of Judah These are 19th century restorations The originals were torn down during the Revolution because they were thought to depict kings of France 21 of them were recently discovered and preserved in the Mus e du Moyen Age see page 55 The superb central rose window depicts the Redemption after the Fall Two more outsized rose windows illuminate the transept the northern window retains most of its 13th century glass A lovely 14th century Virgin and Child emblematic of the cathedral s name Notre Dame de Paris Our Lady of Paris is to the right of the choir entrance The cathedral s original architect is unknown but Pierre de Montreuil who was involved in the building of Sainte Chapelle was responsible for a large part of the 13th century work The present state of the cathedral owes much to Eug ne Viollet le Duc who from 1845 to 1863 painstakingly restored it following the ravages of the 18th century caused more by pre Revolutionary meddlers than by revolutionaries who stripped it of religious symbols Popular support for the costly restoration was inspired by Victor Hugo s novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame The 255 step climb up the north tower is rewarded with wonderful views of Paris and close ups of the roof and gargoyles Entrance is free the first Sunday of the month Cross over to the south tower and another 122 steps to see the 13 ton bell the only one remaining the Revolutionaries melted down the others to make cannon The bell was re cast in the 1680s A further 124 steps lead to the top of the south tower for other spectacular views Baron Haussmann greatly enlarged the parvis the cathedral forecourt diminishing the impact of the towering west front The crypt beneath the square contains walls and foundations from the Gallic Roman and medieval eras and a well designed exhibition on early Paris Ile St Louis The bridge across to Ile St Louis leads to a blessed sanctuary of gracious living its quiet streets lined by elegant houses and mansions long popular with the city s affluent gentry President Pompidou had a house on the quai de B thune and used to escape there from the Elys e Palace as frequently as he could At 17 quai d Anjou is the grand H tel Lauzun built in the 1650s by Le Vau who worked on the riverfront fa ade of the Louvre and the Versailles ch teau In the H tel Lambert on the corner of the rue St Louis en l Ile Voltaire once enjoyed a tempestuous love affair with the lady of the house the Marquise du Ch telet The airy bright Baroque church of St Louis en l Ile illuminates with a golden light its fine collection of Dutch Flemish and Italian 16th and 17th century art From the western end of the shady quai d Orl ans you ll have a splendid view of the apse of Notre Dame Other pilgrims to this spot are more intent on a visit to Berthillon a hallowed maker of astonishing ice creams and sorbets Right Bank The sprawling Right Bank rive droite covers the whole range of Paris s social life from ultra chic to downright sleazy It claims the most luxurious shopping areas the presidential Elys e Palace the grands boulevards and financial district but also farther north seamy Clichy and Pigalle as well as hilly Montmartre where modern art could be said to have begun Back in the middle of it all the huge Louvre museum makes its own magnificent statement Just to the east Les Halles Beaubourg around the Centre Georges Pompidou and place de la Bastille have each been transformed by controversial projects The variety and energy of the nightlife here has overtaken that of the Left Bank Even the charming old Marais and its Jewish quarter representing the old Paris of the 17th century have taken on a new fashionable appearance with the influx of trendy boutiques Place Charles de Gaulle l Etoile Officially renamed place Charles de Gaulle after the death of the great man in 1969 it is still known to Parisians as l Etoile the star for the twelve avenues branching out from the center like a star The circular space with its whirling traffic is dominated by the Arc de Triomphe 50 m 164 ft high and 45 m 148 ft wide A trip to the top by elevator affords spectacular views It is here that you can best appreciate the tour de force of geometric planning the avenues represent The Arc de Triomphe was conceived by Napol on I as a tribute to his armies and bears the names of hundreds of his marshals and generals and dozens of victories No defeats are recorded naturally although a few of the victories are debatable Napol on himself only ever saw a wood and canvas model the arch was completed during the 1830s It soon became the focus for state occasions such as the return of the ex emperor s own remains from St Helena in 1840 and the funeral of Victor Hugo in 1885 In 1920 the Unknown Soldier of World War I was buried at the arch three years later the eternal flame was lit When Adolf Hitler arrived in Paris as a conqueror in 1940 the Arc de Triomphe was the first place he wanted to see And at the Liberation this was the spot where General de Gaulle commenced his triumphal march down the Champs Elys es Avenue Foch leading away from l Etoile to the Bois de Boulogne is one of the most majestic of the city s residential avenues It is one of the most exclusive too though somewhat democratized these days by the groups of boules players on its graveled side paths Avenue de la Grande Arm e points straight to Neuilly and the towers of La D fense with the Grande Arche behind Avenue des Champs Elys es In recent years it was fashionable to look down on the Champs Elys es many Parisians claimed they never set foot there but it is returning to favor Tastefully refurbished it can once again claim to be one of the finest avenues in the world Straight as a rod it slopes down to the place de la Concorde through a lovely parade of chestnut trees the object of careful replanting to ensure that the avenue retains its elegant beauty The top two thirds of the avenue are filled with cinemas airline offices and car showrooms the excellent tourist information office number 127 and caf terraces that make perfect if slightly expensive vantage points for people watching Below the Rond Point the mood changes and a pleasant park leads you past two landmarks the Petit Palais all steel and glass and the Grand Palais Both were constructed for the Universal Exhibition of 1900 and are today used for a variety of exhibitions though the Petit Palais houses several permanent collections of 19th century French paintings The Grand Palais shares its colossal building with the Palais de la D couverte see page 75 and includes among its displays a hands on exhibition of the sciences with a planetarium as centerpiece Jacques Ange Gabriel designed the gigantic place de la Concorde as place Louis XV in 1753 but the Revolution dispensed with all royal connotations A guillotine replaced the king s statue and was used to behead Louis XVI and more than 1 000 other victims In 1934 it was the scene of bloody anti government rioting by French fascists Topped by a newly gilded pyramidal tip the 23 m 75 ft pink granite Obelisk of Luxor from the temple of Ramses II dates back to 1300 b c and was erected here in 1836 For a change it s not something that Napol on looted during a campaign but was a gift from Mohammed Ali viceroy of Egypt The two imposing horses guarding the entrance to the Champs Elys es are replicas of the handsome 18th century Chevaux de Marly sculpted by Guillaume Coustou The marble originals now grace the Cour Marly of the Louvre Jardin des Tuileries Take time off from the city bustle for a stroll through the Jardin des Tuileries named after a 13th century tile works and now beautifully re landscaped as part of a renovation plan for the Mus e du Louvre to the east Walk around the chestnut and lime trees and admire Aristide Maillol s 18 sensual statues of nymphs and languorous maidens a few of which are coquettishly half concealed behind a miniature maze The gardens 28 hectares 11 acres extend across the site of the royal Palais des Tuileries burnt down during the 1871 Commune see page 21 A few fragments of the palace can be seen by the Jeu de Paume exhibition building in the northwest corner Children can enjoy donkey rides puppet shows in spring and summer and model boats on the circular ponds Adults go for the giant Ferris wheel installed at the holiday season In the corner near the Seine facing place de la Concorde the Orangerie is known for its two oval rooms with Monet s beautiful Nymph as Water Lilies murals but see too the fine collection of Impressionist and post Impressionist paintings upstairs see page 71 At the eastern entrance to the Tuileries the pink Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel was built at roughly the same time as its bigger brother at l Etoile The latter is visible from here in a straight line beyond the Obelisk on place de la Concorde The same axis continues into the distant haze to the skyscrapers of La D fense and the Grande Arche Palais du Louvre This is truly one of the world s treasure houses see page 67 for a description of its art collection Despite its eight centuries in the making it has preserved a wonderful harmony First built as a fortress by Philippe Auguste in 1190 it has been added to and altered by his successors When Louis XIV moved his court to Versailles he abandoned the Louvre to artists sculptors and other squatters The Revolutionaries made it a public museum in 1793 As the home of the V nus de Milo and Mona Lisa the Louvre drew almost unmanageable crowds until President Mitterrand ordered its re organization in the 1980s An enormous new reception area was excavated revealing parts of the original fort topped by the superb glass Pyramid designed by I M Pei in the Cour Napol on which now marks the museum s main entrance The palace s royal chapel St Germain l Auxerrois dates back to 1200 but has preserved little of its Romanesque and Gothic beginnings Its bell tolled the signal in 1572 for Catholics to start the St Bartholomew Day massacre of Protestants see page 16 Palais Royal The Palais Royal across the rue de Rivoli from the Louvre was built as Cardinal Richelieu s residence in 1639 it became royal when Anne of Austria moved in with young Louis XIV This serene arcaded palace with its garden of lime trees and beeches and the pond where Louis XIV nearly drowned has had a past as colorful as its spectacular new flower beds In the days of Philippe d Orl ans Prince Regent while Louis XV was a child the Palais Royal was the scene of notorious orgies A later duke another Philippe added apartments above the arcades along with two theaters one now the venerable Com die Fran aise shops gambling houses and fashionable caf s In the ferment that led up to the Revolution it was a scene of furious debate On 13 July 1789 a young firebrand orator Camille Desmoulins stood on a table at the Palais Royal s Caf de Foy to sound a call to arms The Bastille was stormed the next day Despite efforts to curry favor with the revolutionaries like calling himself Philippe Egalit equality the duke ended up on the guillotine with the rest of the family After the Revolution the palace became a gambling den again and narrowly escaped destruction in the 1871 uprising Once it was restored between 1872 and 1876 the palace became respectable Today it houses the Ministry of Culture Council of State and the Constitutional Council Some of the shops still exist and the sumptuously decorated Grand V four restaurant looks just the way it did 200 years ago In 1986 rows of black and white striped stone columns were added to the main quadrangle the Cour d Honneur Some are short some are tall but a few are just the right height for sitting on Next to the Palais Royal stands the Banque de France east of the garden and landlord of most of its apartments and the Biblioth que Nationale National Library just to the north This began as a royal library in 1368 when Charles V placed 973 manuscripts in the Louvre Most of the millions of books engravings and ancient manuscripts it has accumulated over the centuries have been transferred to the new national library on the Left Bank see page 58 The old building with its splendid Salle de Travail reading room 1863 is being transformed into a research library of specialist collections for scholars Les Halles East of the Palais Royal Les Halles was for centuries the site of the capital s central food markets now in a more spacious if less colorful location at Rungis near Orly To widespread regret Victor Baltard s great cast iron and glass pavilions were torn down in the 1970s Eventually gardens children s playgrounds and the maze like partly below ground shopping mall Forum des Halles transformed the site Saturdays bring throngs of teenagers from the suburbs to shop watch films roller skate munch fast food and just hang out The liveliest meeting place is around the monumental Renaissance Fontaine des Innocents once part of a cemetery Bars restaurants and late night brasseries line the adjoining rue Berger and the streets leading off it Clubs and discos come alive at midnight and stay open to dawn especially on weekends Away from the gardens and playgrounds the quarter has its seedy side drink and drugs pickpockets and prostitutes Rue St Denis once primarily a red light district is now pedestrianized but still has its share of sex shops The remarkable church of St Eustache dominates the north side of Les Halles Built from 1532 to 1637 the main structure is late Gothic with a somewhat incongruous but imposing Renaissance colonnade on its western fa ade The church is renowned for its choral concerts and recitals on the grand organ designed by Baltard architect of Les Halles Beaubourg East of the Forum des Halles streets closed to traffic and lined with caf s brasseries art galleries and boutiques link up with the startling Centre Georges Pompidou This avant garde multimedia cultural center which also houses the Mus e National d Art Moderne see page 74 reopened 1 January 2000 after lengthy renovation Controversy raged for years after the 1977 opening of this colorful oil refinery The comparison came as no surprise to the architects Italy s Renzo Piano and Britain s Richard Rogers who deliberately left the building s service systems visible and color coded Now as with the Tour Eiffel and the Louvre s Pyramid people have learned to live with it and even love it and it averages 23 000 visitors every day Besides its permanent art collections and popular library open to all ingenious exhibits cover every aspect of contemporary life artistic and technological and the aesthetics of consumer culture There is a particular emphasis on young people The place also offers a terrific view Pay the museum admission then take the escalators running in transparent tubes from the bottom left to the top right hand corner and see Paris unfold before your eyes The sloping plaza outside is one of Paris most popular locations for street performers Place Vend me Louis XIV wanted this most elegant of Paris squares to provide an imposing setting for a monument to him After it was laid out in 1699 only Louis financiers could afford the rent Now the Ministry of Justice shares the square with banks famous jewelers and the Ritz Hotel Like all royal statues that of Louis XIV was overthrown during the Revolution Its replacement the Vend me column commemorates in bronze relief the victories of Napol on cast from 1 250 Austrian cannons captured at Austerlitz and topped by a statue of the emperor It too was toppled during the 1871 Commune at the instigation of painter Gustave Courbet who had to pay the crippling cost of having it re erected two years later Op ra Garnier and the Grands Boulevards Window shop your way past the goldsmiths and furriers of the rue de la Paix to the ornate opera house now named after its architect Charles Garnier to distinguish it from the new Op ra Bastille see page 52 Begun at the height of Napol on III s Second Empire it was completed only in 1875 after the Commune It is the epitome of the exuberance of a city regarding itself as Europe s most glamorous capital an impression that is underscored by the grand foyer and staircase The five tiered auditorium with its incongruous modern ceiling painted by Chagall in 1964 holds a mere 2 000 spectators Underneath the building is a small lake which provided the inspiration for the phantom s hiding place in Paul Leroux s Phantom of the Opera Now the home of the national ballet company the house was renovated in 1995 A stock exchange the bank of France a theater These were among the uses proposed for the huge neo classical church La Madeleine also recently renovated Napol on wanted it as a temple of glory for his army but his architect suggested the Arc de Triomphe instead The restored monarchy opted for a church as originally intended when building started under Louis XV It was finally consecrated in 1842 Climb the steps for a great view down the rue Royale to the place de la Concorde and National Assembly beyond The renovated Mus e Jacqemart Andr reopened in 1997 at 158 boulevard Haussmann not far from the Madeleine Housed in the splendid mansion of 19th century art collector Edouard Andr the museum contains a fine collection of Italian Renaissance Flemish and 18th century French paintings The Grands Boulevards running from the Madeleine past the Op ra Garnier and all the way to place de la Bastille comprised the fashionable heart of Paris from the 1860s until well into the 20th century They are less chic now but their majestic sweep can still evoke former glories On boulevard des Capucines retrace the footsteps of Renoir Manet and Pissarro as they took their paintings to Nadar s house signposted at number 35 for the historic 1874 exhibition of Impressionism Nowadays popular cinemas have found an appropriate home on the boulevards for it was at the H tel Scribe near the Op ra that the Lumi re brothers staged the first public moving picture show in 1895 Montmartre Montmartre is really a hilltop village La Butte to its residents with narrow winding streets and dead ends For the last 200 years it has been associated with artists and bohemians The Montmartrobus spares you the walk and shows you some of the area in a single tour but the best way to discover Montmartre at your own pace is to start early at the top Take the m tro to Abbesses and the elevator to the street the stairs here are endless and notice the handsome Art Nouveau entrance as you leave Rue Yvonne le Tac leads to the base station of a funicular railway It was here that St Denis was martyred see page 13 and where St Ignatius Loyola launched the Jesuit movement in 1534 The funicular it takes m tro and bus tickets climbs to the terrace in front of the Byzantine style basilica of Sacr C ur Standing at the highest point in Paris it s one of the city s principal landmarks and one of the few to remain perennially controversial Artists still scorn it as a vulgar pastiche and the working class residents of the area resented its being erected as a symbol of penitence for the insurrection of the 1871 Commune they didn t feel penitent in the least The Sacr C ur s conspicuous whiteness comes from the local Ch teau Landon limestone which bleaches on contact with carbon dioxide in the air and hardens with age For many the best reason for visiting the basilica is the view of the city from the dome or the terrace below Just a few steps west of Sacr C ur is St Pierre de Montmartre one of the city s oldest churches Consecrated in 1147 16 years before the church of St Germain des Pr s see page 58 it is a significant work of early Gothic belied by its 18th century fa ade The Sacr C ur s architect Paul Abadie wanted to demolish St Pierre but he was overruled and it was restored as a riposte to the Sacr C ur Nearby place du Tertre was once the center of village life Try to visit during the early morning before the mass production artists set up their easels and the crowds take over In place Emile Goudeau just downhill but artistically on an altogether much higher level number 13 was the site of the studio known as the Bateau Lavoir so called because the building resembled the Seine s laundry boats before it was destroyed by fire Here if in any one place modern art was born Picasso Braque and Juan Gris developed Cubism Modigliani painted in a style all his own and Apollinaire wrote his first surrealistic verses Some of their predecessors Renoir van Gogh and Gauguin once lived and worked just north of place du Tertre in rue Cortot rue de l Abreuvoir and rue St Rustique On the rue St Vincent at the corner of rue des Saules look out for Paris last surviving vineyard the tiny Clos de Montmartre producing a wine that reputedly makes you jump like a goat At the far end of rue Lepic a market street renowned for its food shops is place Blanche where everything suddenly changes You hit boulevard Clichy or it hits you Right on the corner is the Moulin Rouge still staging its nightly cabarets mostly to package tourists All the way east to place Pigalle and beyond runs a ribbon of tawdry nightlife with sex shops peep shows and other dubious attractions punctuated by a few conventional restaurants and bars By evening tour buses from all over Europe are parked bumper to bumper Avoid the late night m tro here unless you want to share it with reeling drunks The principal cemetery of Montmartre where luminaries of the arts such as the composers Berlioz and Offenbach lie buried may seem a world away but it s only a short walk west from the Moulin Rouge to the entrance west past the Moulin Rouge then right at avenue Rachel Le Marais The district to the north of Ile de la Cit and Ile Saint Louis has bravely withstood the onslaught of modern construction It provides a remarkably authentic record of the development of the city from the reign of Henri IV at the end of the 16th century to the advent of the Revolution Built on reclaimed marshland as its name suggests the Marais contains some of Europe s most elegant Renaissance mansions h tels many of which now serve as museums and libraries The one major change is the recent influx of trendy boutiques Take the m tro to Rambuteau and start at the corner of the rue des Archives and the rue des Francs Bourgeois named after the poor not bourgeois at all allowed to live here tax free in the 14th century The national archives are stored in an 18th century mansion H tel de Soubise Across a vast horseshoe shaped courtyard you come across the exquisite Rococo style of Louis XV s time in the apartments of the Prince and Princess of Soubise Up on the first floor is the Mus e de l Histoire de France with gems such as the only known portrait of Joan of Arc painted in her lifetime and the diary kept by Louis XVI His entry for 14 July 1789 the day the Bastille was stormed reads Rien Nothing A garden not always open to the public connects the H tel de Soubise with its twin H tel de Rohan on the rue Vieille du Temple Look out for Robert le Lorrain s fine Les Chevaux d Apollon over the old stables in the second courtyard admired as one of France s most beautiful 18th century sculptures Also on the rue des Francs Bourgeois H

see page 71 The rue des Francs Bourgeois ends at what most agree is the loveliest residential square in Paris place des Vosges Henri IV had it laid out in 1605 on the site of an old horse market his idea borrowed from Catherine de Medici being to have all the houses in the same symmetry After the wedding festivities of his son Louis XIII the gardens became the fashionable place to promenade and later a spot for aristocratic duels Today there s a children s playground and it is perfect for just sitting around on the grass too On of the best times to see the square s architecture is in the winter when the chestnut trees are bare and don t obscure the pink brick and honey colored stone fa ades Victor Hugo author of Les Mis rables lived at number 6 now a museum housing many of his manuscripts artifacts and wonderful drawings While in the Marais take a wander around the old Jewish quarter or shtetl as Parisian Jews call it especially if you are looking for somewhere unusual to eat Jews have lived around the rue des Rosiers for centuries and the rue Ferdinand Duval was known until 1900 as the rue des Juifs The other main street rue des Ecouffes medieval slang for moneylenders completes the lively shopping area with delicatessens kosher butchers and even kosher pizza shops More recent arrivals from the Jewish communities of North Africa have largely replaced the Ashkenazim of Eastern Europe who themselves took the place of the Sephardim who first settled in Paris from Spain in the 13th century Bastille The large circular place de la Bastille is enjoying a new lease on life No trace remains of the prison stormed in 1789 even the column in the center commemorates a later revolution that of 1830 Long a run down area it was given a shot in the arm by the construction of the Op ra Bastille one of President Mitterrand s great projects This opened in 1990 to a chorus of hostile comment Critics attacked Carlos Ott s building as an unimaginative misfit At least the acoustics are rated a success and the new home of the National Opera is now an accepted part of the cultural life of Paris In the adjacent streets such as rue de la Couronne traditional old shops alternate with art galleries artists studios and restaurants Just to the northeast of the Op ra in rue de la Main d Or rue de Lappe and their offshoots clubs and discos have revived an old nightlife tradition Left Bank Despite the concerted efforts of the fashion and media worlds to move in on it the bohemians and intellectuals hang on to their time honored stronghold on the Left Bank rive gauche There is much more to the Left Bank than the student life of the Latin Quarter but so many schools and colleges are packed into a small area that it s the young who set the pace Writers and painters who used to meet regularly in the caf s of St Germain des Pr s often find themselves squeezed out by film directors TV performers advertising people and more and more tourists Montparnasse took over from Montmartre as the haunt of the avant garde in the 1920s and still stakes a claim The Left Bank has its share of monuments and museums and Les Jardins du Luxembourg remain an evergreen favorite Latin Quarter As far back as the 13th century when Paris s first university moved from the cloisters of Notre Dame to the Left Bank the young came to the quartier to learn Latin Here the tradition of scholastic inquiry has often evolved into a spirit of protest and outright revolt before subsiding into a lifelong skepticism In ancient days the university simply meant a collection of scholars who met on a street corner or in a public square or courtyard to listen to a lecture given from a bench or balcony Now the tradition of open air discussion continues over coffee or a glass of wine on some caf terrace on the boulevard St Michel or in the streets around the faculty buildings The quarter also includes France s two most prestigious high schools the Lyc es Henri IV and Louis le Grand training grounds for France s future lite Begin your visit to the Latin Quarter at the place St Michel where students buy their books and stationery or gather around the bombastic 1860s fountain by Davioud Plunge into the narrow streets of the St S verin quarter to the east rue St S verin rue de la Harpe and rue Galande You will discover a medieval world updated by the varied exotica of smoky Greek barbecues Tunisian pastry shops and art house cinemas Little St Julien le Pauvre a jewel of early Gothic architecture dating from between 1165 and 1220 hosts recitals of chamber and religious music With its wafting incense and masses said in Greek or Arabic the church belongs to the Melchite sect of the Greek Orthodox Church St Julien is not out of place in an area packed with Middle Eastern restaurants Just across rue St Jacques stands the exquisite 13th to 15th century Flamboyant Gothic church of St S verin in which Dante is said to have prayed and Saint Sa ns asked to be made honorary organist The Sorbonne Named after the 13th century college established by Robert de Sorbon for poor theological students the university was later taken in hand by Cardinal Richelieu who financed its reconstruction 1624 1642 Few of the somewhat forbidding buildings are open to the public but you can go inside the 17th century courtyard with its ornate sundial and see the outside of the Baroque library and domed church Protest against overcrowding antiquated teaching bureaucracy and the very basis of the social system made the Sorbonne a focal point for unrest in 1968 a year of ferment throughout Europe Over on the quiet tree shaded place de la Sorbonne it s hard to imagine the police invading such a peaceful sanctuary one that for centuries guaranteed student immunity But invade they did and revolt exploded onto the streets Students and workers made common cause and there followed widespread national strikes that threatened the survival of the government In the aftermath of the revolts the Sorbonne was absorbed into the huge Paris Universities monolith and lost its independence Standing virtually opposite the Sorbonne s rue des Ecoles entrance at 6 place Paul Painlev are the massive brick ruins of the ancient Roman public baths They survived as part of an abbey now the Mus e National du Moyen Age still often called by its former name Mus e de Cluny see page 72 Its most famous exhibits are the wonderful 15th century tapestries including the Lady with the Unicorn Panth on A stroll up the rue St Jacques past the highly reputed Lyc e Louis le Grand leads to the gigantic neo classical Panth on Designed for Louis XV as the church of Ste Genevi ve 1755 it was secularized during the Revolution to serve as a mausoleum For most of the 19th century the Panth on oscillated between secular and consecrated status according to the current r gime s political persuasion Finally Victor Hugo s gigantic funeral in 1885 settled the issue in favor of a secular mausoleum Novelist Emile Zola socialist leader Jean Jaur s L on Gambetta leader during the 1870 siege of Paris Louis Braille inventor of the blind alphabet Pierre and Marie Curie discoverers of radium honored only in 1995 she being the Panth on s first woman and many other national heroes are interred here The bare interior is bleak its windows covered up by the monumental 19th century murals painted by Puvis de Chavannes The crypt is a grim maze of corridors lined with cells containing the tombs of the famous as well as the not so famous A good display on the history of the Panth on is the best part of the visit Come back to life on the old streets behind the Panth on where the bustling rue Mouffetard and its offshoots are a village within the city The stalls of the morning market see page 85 are piled with appetizing produce Here and in the tiny place de la Contrescarpe you will find a large choice of ethnic restaurants especially Thai Vietnamese and Chinese A block to the east signs to Ar nes de Lut ce lead you to a little park site of a Roman amphitheater restored after its remains were found during the 19th century Jardins du Luxembourg Bright with flowers and statues of historical figures peeping out from among the bushes the Jardins du Luxembourg are the prettiest green space on the Left Bank Students find quiet corners to read relax or play tennis and children sail their boats on the octagonal pond or ride a merry go round designed by none other than Charles Garnier architect of the Op ra see page 45 Old men meet under the chestnut trees to play chess or a game of boules At the north end of the gardens the Palais du Luxembourg built for Marie de Medici early in the 17th century now houses the French Senate East along the Seine Back down by the Seine but heading east stroll past the Jussieu University complex that stands on the site of the Halles aux Vins wine market The Institut du Monde Arabe Arab World Institute at 23 quai St Bernard was built with the help of 16 Arab nations to foster cultural links between Europe and the Islamic world The fine museum inside traces the cultures of the Arab world both the pre Islamic and Islamic periods with first rate temporary exhibits The best way to see them is to start on the seventh floor and work down A library of over 40 000 volumes covers all aspects of Arab culture The view from the rooftop cafeteria is better than the food for anyone hoping to sample the joys of Arab cuisine however The Jardin des Plantes next door created by Louis XIII as a royal garden of medicinal plants is still an excellent botanical and decorative garden with exotic plants in the hothouses The adjoining Museum National d Histoire Naturelle has done a fine job of renovating its venerable exhibits of fossils skeletons butterflies and mineral samples Outstanding is the superbly designed new Grande Galerie de l Evolution entrance at 36 rue Geoffroy St Hilaire devoted to the origins of all life on earth not just centered on homo sapiens With its four glass towers in the shape of open books the new national library Biblioth que Fran ois Mitterand is the flagship building of the redeveloped Tolbiac district east of the Gare d Austerlitz The vast riverfront complex surrounding a sunken garden of some 250 exotic trees is popularly known as the TGB Tr s Grand Biblioth que Very Big Library More formally it also bears the name of Fran ois Mitterrand for whom it was the ultimate but posthumous achievement of his ambitious building program for Paris Opened in late 1996 it houses over 12 000 000 books and has a state of the art electronic retrieval system that s open to the general public and research scholars St Germain des Pr s This Left Bank area is one of the town s most attractive neighborhoods Not part of the Latin Quarter but an extension of it this is the home of numerous publishing houses the Acad mie Fran aise expensive interior design and fashion shops bookshops and caf terraces ideal for people watching It used to be the headquarters of Jean Paul Sartre and his existentialist acolytes wearing winter or summer black corduroys and long woolen scarves In place St Germain des Pr s the Caf Bonaparte on the north side and the Deux Magots on the west provide ringside seats for a street theater of mimes musicians and neighborhood eccentrics The Caf de Flore round the corner has hung on to its intellectual tradition more than the others perhaps because of its rather ideologically confused history It s been a home away from home for the extreme right Action Fran aise group under Charles Maurras in 1899 the poet and surrealist precursor Apollinaire in 1914 who with his friends liked to provoke brawls and during the 1950s Sartre s existentialists a peaceful bunch who never got enough sleep to have the energy to fight Also on the place St Germain stands the church of St Germain des Pr s the oldest church in Paris It is a mixture of Romanesque and Gothic with a clock tower dating from about the year 1000 and a 17th century porch sheltering 12th century doorposts Restored after being used in the Revolution as a gunpowder factory the church is a popular venue for concerts North of the square rue Bonaparte leads past the Ecole Nationale Sup rieure des Beaux Arts Fine Arts School This structure incorporates fragments of medieval and Renaissance architecture and sculpture that make it a living museum During the events of May 1968 students used it as a factory for militant posters The august Palais de l Institut de France home of the Acad mie Fran aise is on the quai de Conti by the Pont des Arts Designed by Louis le Vau in 1668 to harmonize with the Louvre across the river the Institut began as a school for the sons of provincial gentry financed by a legacy of Cardinal Mazarin Then in 1805 the building was turned over to the Institut which comprises the Acad mie Fran aise supreme arbiter of the French language founded by Cardinal Richelieu in 1635 and the Acad mies des Belles Lettres Sciences Beaux Arts and Sciences Morales et Politiques Guides to the Institut like to point out the east pavilion site of the old 14th century Tour de Nesle They say that Queen Jeanne de Bourgogne used the tower to watch out for likely young lovers whom she summoned for the night and then had thrown into the Seine Montparnasse Named after the mountain home of antiquity s Muses Paris s Mount Parnassus was a mound left after quarrying long gone but remaining an inspiration to artists They invented the cancan here in 1845 in a local dance hall and in the 1920s the quarter took over from Montmartre as the stamping ground of the city s artistic colony led by Picasso American expatriates such as Hemingway Gertrude Stein F Scott Fitzgerald and John dos Passos liked the free living atmosphere and added to the mystique themselves see opposite page The attraction isn t immediately evident The wide straight boulevard du Montparnasse is plain by Paris standards Nowadays the majority of the haunts where the Lost Generation found itself have been polished and painted or even entirely rebuilt but people still pay elevated prices for the privilege of sitting in a seat that might once have been warmed by Modigliani Lenin or Sartre The 59 story black Tour Montparnasse may be an egregious eyesore but the view from the top is marvelous 33 avenue du Maine open daily 9 30am 10pm East of the station the cemetery see page 50 entrance on boulevard Edgar Quinet is the resting place of some famous and controversial figures in French history Invalides Geographically if not temperamentally part of the Left Bank the Palais Bourbon is the seat of the Assembl e Nationale parliament Designed for a daughter of Louis XIV in 1722 it makes a stately riverside fa ade for the 7th arrondissement with its 18th century embassies ministries and private mansions h tels particuliers Napol on added the Grecian columns facing the Pont de la Concorde but the palace is more graceful seen from its entrance on the south side Access is available only on written request or invitation by a deputy A privileged few get to see the great D lacroix paintings in the library illustrating the history of civilization The Prime Minister s splendid residence H tel Matignon at 57 rue de Varenne is a short walk from the National Assembly Its private park has a music pavilion favored for secret strategy sessions On the same elegant 18th century street the Mus e Rodin at number 77 houses the sculptor s works in the delightful H tel Biron see page 75 Most important sight in the neighborhood is the monumental H tel des Invalides established by Louis XIV as the first national hospital and retirement home for soldiers wounded in action At one time it housed approximately 6 000 veterans but Napol on took over a large part of it for the Mus e de l Arm e Army Museum Then the Invalides came to symbolize the glory of Napol on himself when his remains were finally brought back from St Helena in 1840 for burial in the chapel under the golden D me His son who died in Vienna is buried in the crypt his remains transferred here by Adolf Hitler in 1940 The main courtyard allows access to the adjoining church of St Louis des Invalides decorated with flags taken by French armies in battle The courtyard itself contains the 18 cannons including eight taken from Vienna which Napol on ordered fired on great occasions including the birth of his son in 1811 The cannon sounded again for the 1918 Armistice and the funeral of Marshal Foch in 1929 Southwest of the Invalides is the Ecole Militaire where officers have trained since the middle of the 18th century Their former parade ground the vast Champ de Mars is now a green park stretching all the way to the Tour Eiffel Horse races were held here in the 1780s and also five World Fairs between 1867 and 1937 In the 20th century it has become the front lawn of the Left Bank s most luxurious residences It s also popular with American expatriates who often can be seen playing touch football or softball games Tour Eiffel Eiffel Tower What remains for most people the ultimate monument was a resounding success right from the start In 1889 two million visitors paid 5 francs a head to climb to the top and it has bewitched the world ever since Some monuments celebrate heroes commemorate victories honor kings or saints This is a monument for its own sake Its construction for the 1889 World s Fair was an astounding engineering achievement some 15 000 pieces of metal joined by 2 500 000 rivets soaring 320 m 984 ft into the sky on a base only 130 m 430 ft across At the time it was the tallest structure in the world It also provided the perfect perch for transmitters when radio and TV came along On the tower s inauguration the lifts were not yet in operation and Prime Minister Tirard aged 62 stopped at the first platform 57 m 187 ft up letting his younger Minister of Commerce continue to the top to present Gustave Eiffel with the Legion of Honor medal Conceived as a temporary structure just for the Fair the tower was slated for destruction in 1910 but nobody had the heart to take it down New illumination was installed in 1985 to light up the tower from within and it was the obvious main focus of France s celebrations for the change of the millennium in 1999 An audio visual show about the tower is screened on the first platform there are restaurants on the first and second and a bar on the third On clear days the view from the top extends about 65 km 40 miles but more often the second platform offers the best view Try to get there an hour before sunset for the best light Western Outskirts Bois de Boulogne The capital s biggest park runs along the west side of the chic 16th arrondissement It covers 900 hectares 2 200 acres of grassland lakes and woods Napol on III had Baron Haussmann transform this remnant of an old hunting forest along the lines of a London park The Bagatelle once a royal retreat has a very lovely English garden bursting with flowers during spring and early summer The Jardin d Acclimatation is an amusement park with plenty of attractions for children shows rides and a small zoo There are bikes for rent outside its entrance for exploring the rest of the park The Mus e des Arts et Traditions Populaires has excellent displays of folk art and crafts through the ages Also within the park are a boating lake and two fine racecourses Longchamp for flat races and Auteuil for steeplechases But beware In spite of police patrols after dark parts of the Bois de Boulogne are reckoned to be the most dangerous places in Paris La D fense Follow the long avenue de la Grande Arm e down from l Etoile and the battery of towers looms bigger and bigger beyond the elegant leafy suburb of Neuilly Cross the river and you are in a mini Manhattan that has sprouted since 1969 to become a city in its own right In the process it has somehow managed to get a soul in spite of the inhuman scale of some of its windswept spaces The Grande Arche is farther away than most of the towers and only when you get close do you realize just how big it is A hollow cube 110 m 360 ft high and 106 m 347 ft wide it could straddle the Champs Elys es and tuck Notre Dame underneath it Built with remarkable speed Danish architect Johann Otto von Sprekelsen won the contest in 1983 and it was ready for the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989 the Grande Arche stands on an axis with the Arc de Triomphe and the Cour Carr e of the Louvre Its white gables are clothed in Carrara marble the outer fa ades with a combination of grey marble and glass the inside walls are covered with aluminum The two legs contain offices while the roof houses conference rooms and exhibition space Bubble lifts whisk you up through a fiberglass and Teflon cloud held by steel cables that stretch from one wall to the other but the ride to the top is expensive and the view not much more striking than from the terrace Increasing numbers of visitors and office workers have given rise to more and more shops cinemas hotels and restaurants One of the cinemas near the Grande Arche has a big wrap around IMAX screen and in the same building the Mus e de l Automobile displays over 100 classic cars restored to mint condition Across the main concourse a 12 m 39 ft bronze thumb by C sar sticks out like well a sore thumb Stroll down the tiers of terraces and you ll find many more statues fountains and murals by Mir Calder and other modern artists all detailed on street plans given out at information desks Major Museums Mus e du Louvre Revamping the Mus e du Louvre since the 1980s has made this formidable palace of art far more accessible in all senses In 1793 when the leaders of the Revolution declared the palace a national museum the Louvre held 630 works of art a recent inventory listed 250 000 Don t be put off it s an exhilarating experience just attempting to come to grips with such vast collections of painting sculpture and artifacts from 5000 b c to 1848 from which date the Mus e d Orsay s French collections continue the story to 1914 The magnificent glass Pyramid designed by American architect I M Pei has gained acceptance as a harmonious entrance to this most venerable of French museums An escalator descends to the reception area which comprises shops caf s and the ticket office At the information counter collect a copy of the free handbook with color coded floor plans Admission too is free on the first Sunday of every month Broad corridors lead to the various parts of the museum The museum authorities have made heroic efforts to help you find your way through the labyrinth Each of the three main wings is named after one of France s great figures the Richelieu wing the Sully wing in the east and the Denon wing beside the Seine Each wing is then divided into numbered areas which are shown on the floor plans in color The locations of some of the most famous exhibits are pinpointed You will get lost at times but in so doing you may discover marvels you weren t even looking for On a first visit you may like to spend a half day just seeing the highlights with time off for postcard shopping and a caf break For the collections the acoustiguide recorded tour available in English can be useful Some

looks like a Fine Arts Museum and since the Fine Arts Museum resembles a station I suggest we make the change while we still can said painter Edouard Detaille in 1900 In 1986 his joke became a reality Linked to the Right Bank Jardins des Tuileries by the new Passerelle Solf rino footbridge the converted 19th century hotel cum railway station was transformed into the Mus e d Orsay devoted to French art from 1848 to 1914 Keeping the exterior much as it was Italian architect Gae Aulenti adapted the interior to house many of the previously scattered works of that period including the superb Impressionist collections formerly held in the Jeu de Paume Sculpture is well represented and photography is present from its inception 1839 Orsay is one of the easiest of great museums to navigate The free floor plan and signs are both crystal clear Newcomers may prefer to start at the top with the Impressionists and Post Impressionists Renoir C zanne Manet Monet Toulouse Lautrec Degas and Van Gogh this is the best collection of his work outside Amsterdam with several works from the frenzied months of activity before he died in 1890 Outstanding in the ground floor collections are the vast canvases of Gustave Courbet Every part of the old terminus has been used in a highly imaginative way and frequent lectures guided tours and concerts are scheduled When you need a break there is a caf high up behind a huge clock and on the middle level the station hotel s beautifully restored restaurant is back in use Orsay is also one of the few Paris museums that is air conditioned and is thus a refreshing retreat on a hot day Centre Georges Pompidou That ll get them screaming said then President Georges Pompidou as he approved the plans chosen from 681 competing designs for the cultural center formally bearing his name but more popularly known as simply Beaubourg after its 13th century neighborhood It was re opened in January 2000 after extensive renovation The combination of public library 1st 3rd floors children s and adult workshops ground floor cin math que industrial design center and music laboratory has made the complex a constant hive of activity The plaza outside is a popular rendezvous point for its free shows The excellent National Museum of Modern Art on the 5th floor 1905 1960 and 4th floor contemporary provides a rewarding education in all the disparate art movements of the 20th century The collections regularly rotated from the 45 000 works in reserve range from the Fauves and Cubism to Abstract Expressionism Dadaism Surrealism and all the breakaway factions and reactions which followed them The great innovators are all here Matisse Picasso Kandinsky Duchamps Pollock Rauschenberg and Francis Bacon as well as the sculptors Brancusi Arp Tinguely Giacometti and Claes Oldenburg The 5th floor also attracts crowds to its rooftop restaurant with superb views over Paris Mus e de l Orangerie A pavilion in the corner of the Jardins des Tuileries is home to the outstanding Walther Guillaume Collection and Monet s renowned Nymph as Water Lilies Masterpieces by C zanne Renoir Utrillo Rousseau Modigliani Picasso Derain and Soutine hang in the upstairs rooms For his great Nymph as murals Monet himself chose the two ground level oval rooms as those most likely to recapture the experience of coming across the water lily ponds at his home in Giverny see page 76 Mus e Picasso Evoking superbly an artistic and personal biography of the 20th century master the museum displays over 200 paintings 158 sculptures and hundreds of drawings engravings ceramics and models for stage sets and costumes drawn from the artist s personal collection The museum also includes works by fellow painters Braque Matisse Mir Degas Renoir and Rousseau collected by Picasso during his lifetime Not the least of the attractions are the artist s letters photo albums bullfight tickets and holiday postcards Mus e National du Moyen Age Mus e de Cluny The

temptations she vows to overcome Parc de la Villette Cit des Sciences If there s one thing this institution dislikes it s being called a museum First the Parc de la Villette offers a range of activities and second it puts the accent firmly on participation But as with any good museum you can learn a lot and enjoy yourself too There s something for all ages and for anyone ready to be excited by the world of science The main building has a lot in common with Beaubourg although this one is four times bigger A variety of themes are explored space health communications agriculture etc Some of the hands on displays are fun but sometimes French is needed to follow all the information presented The sizeable stainless steel G ode sphere made of 6 433 reflecting triangles houses a

Versailles Louis XIV the Sun King was quite simply a megalomaniac but he also had extraordinary vision He was wary of Paris and its rabble all too easily roused and rising aristocracy ever demanding
