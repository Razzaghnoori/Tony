 okay i don t know about you but i hate to do yard work and i pay somebody to do all of my yard work really i like it yeah do you i i like um um um working with flowers and stuff like that oh well i i i don t mind doing like gardening or just stuff like that but i m just regular cutting the grass and oh just mowing the mowing the yard i always told my dad when i was a kid and he made me do it i said i can t wait until i m old enough so i don t have to do this anymore that s probably why you hate it so much because i always had to do it and so i just pay someone else to do it and they do the they do the cutting they fertilize they um edge and um i think this year i m going to have some landscaping put in uh huh so i don t know i don t i i m single and and and and so i don t know i don t if i had a a man around to do it it might be different i don t know i kind of enjoy working out in the yard i i enjoy working out in the yard i mean in the summertime it s hard here because it gets so hot pardon me do you um hum you have to like get up at six o clock in the morning if you re going to mow the yard and not faint while your doing it do you cut the grass and stuff yeah you do you live by yourself no no i m married but you still do it anyway well we both do sometimes you both do it that s nice do you have um a lot of flowers and stuff well we re we re moving to a new house and so we ll we ll have to get started over there oh decide what we re going to plant and everything at the at the old house we had a lot of roses um those are pretty i i used to have a house that had a really it was really well landscaped and i i enjoyed the flowers and the and the trees the things this um hum house doesn t have very much it has some trees but um who lived here before didn t put in anything in the way of shrubs or flowers but i think i am going to have that done yeah have that done this year because i do enjoy looking at it i just i m not i don t tolerate the heat well it does get really hot here i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it although i have i did try one year um out here in Dallas but i lived i used to live in San Antonio and i did try growing having a garden where i grew tomatoes and vegetables different vegetables and that was kind of fun uh huh yeah to get out and work and that we tried that last year and but we hadn t lived here in Dallas for you know long enough to to remember that you have to do like um i have this sister who lives in Florida and she plants her garden in January harvest in May uh huh uh huh plant again in um late September ooh and then harvest like in December yeah that s right because the summertime you just can t grow anything and we tried to plant in like end of March or April and everything just toasted i mean it just isn t that when when are you i thought that was when you were supposed to plant oh here it gets so hot i mean this stuff just burns to a crisp what when when are you supposed to plant it when when are you supposed to plant then probably late January really right when it just as soon as it stops freezing um i didn t realize that because you know i mean last summer the only way you could keep something keep a keep a garden growing last summer was to water it all day long every day and because it would just it would just burn to a crisp yeah yeah it does eat up the water eats up your water bill i know that oh yeah but um i don t know i ve i i just prefer having someone else do it to me um you know i d rather spend my time doing other things um hum yeah and i know my dad always enjoyed it he loved to work in the yard why did he make you do it uh he made us do the grunt work well so okay you need to get married and have kids and then when they re big enough you can have them go do the yard and you can do what you want to do that s what he i can t tell you how many times i heard that that s what he yeah i i can t tell you how many times i heard that and my son only my son only five so he s not old enough yet to send out to to the do the yard work no but he will be about five more years maybe but um i don t know i don t know really it s interesting i don t i don t know part of the reason i think is that i don t know anything about it when i had my other house and it was already landscaped and i you know i didn t know what to do and how to take care of the things and you know i learned a little bit but um yeah i heard roses i heard that roses are really difficult to grow and they really take a lot of well i i didn t seem to have that experience i mean they were already there but we just fed them and watered them you did you have any problem with bugs or anything like that no well that s good have you have you ever grown any vegetables oh well like i said we tried last year but we didn t do it right um tomatoes tomatoes and it s going to be too late this year by the time we get moved so we ll probably wait and maybe in the fall we might plant a fall garden this year yeah um hum but we re not going to try to do anything during the summertime because it is just too hot it s an interesting i think it s an interesting you know it s an interesting hobby if um you know to have i just have never taken the time to learn to learn very much about it and um hum you know but like i said i don t tolerate the heat and the yeah some of it s fun but the cutting of grass and i just don t enjoy that yeah that s what i said you know summer during the summertime you ve got to get up at six o clock in the morning oh i see to do it before you know before it gets hot and one time last year i remember we were planning on doing that and it was eighty degrees even then at six o clock yeah yeah i know oh it was just awful and so humid have you had to start your work on your yard this year yet cutting it and stuff oh no because were fixing to move i just had mine done for the first time last week yeah really so it s getting to be i i usually have it done about every other week yeah and i don t know now it s not growing real fast it will pick up yeah oh yeah it s just getting green i prefer to see green than brown um hum but well it was nice talking to you nice talking to you too and good luck on your moving and your garden thanks thanks oh thanks bye bye bye bye
