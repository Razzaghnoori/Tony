 An Appeal to Your Expertise Dear Andrew Happy Monday to you The paper s pretty boring today isn t it But it strikes me that I have in you a tremendous resource instead of wondering what it is conservatives can possibly be thinking when they say or do something I don t understand at all I can ask you So here is my question Why do conservatives hate President Clinton so much Many observers have noted how far to the right he is on many issues he loves corporate capitalism NAFTA for example his judicial appointments have been very centrist he favors the death penalty the anti drug war balanced budgets welfare reform and many other causes dear to the right It s true he s not a homophobe like so many right wingers but it s not as though he s actually done anything for gays except as you ve noted get more of them than ever kicked out of the armed forces Ditto on minorities he s not opposed to affirmative action but he expended no political capital defending it as in fighting California s Prop 209 Women he s done a bit more for but even there more for show than in reality For a person of materialist turn of mind like me it is hard to understand the vitriolic hatred of Clinton on the American Spectator Scaife Rutherford Institute side of the spectrum And not just there either Conservatives should love this man who accomplishes so much of their agenda while bewitching so many liberals A Republican could never have pushed through welfare reform or the crime bill without raising a major storm of protest Is it all really about sex drugs and rock and roll after all Cheers Katha
