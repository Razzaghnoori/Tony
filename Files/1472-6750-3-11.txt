 Background The advent of the polymerase chain reaction PCR played an important role in revolutionizing research in the field of molecular biology 1 A recent adaptation of this technology known as polymerase colonies or polonies holds tremendous promise as well Polony technology is a form of PCR in which the reaction is immobilized in a thin polyacrylamide gel attached to a microscope slide 2 3 As the PCR proceeds the PCR products diffuse radially within the gel from its immobilized template e g genomic DNA giving rise to a circular PCR product or polymerase colony When the gel is stained with SybrGreen I and scanned with a microarray scanner the polymerase colony resembles a colony on an agar plate hence its name Herein we describe the applications of polony technology to cancer research with the goal of screening for 1 mutations in key tumor suppressor and oncogenes as well as 2 loss of heterozygosity One of the hallmarks of cancer includes the accumulation of mutations in key genes namely DNA repair genes 4 tumor suppressor genes 5 6 and proto oncogenes 5 6 accompanied by the loss of the wildtype allele resulting in loss of heterozygosity LOH see reviews by 7 8 9 Pancreatic cancer which results in the death of approximately 30 000 Americans annually and is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortalities in the United States exhibits this hallmark 10 For example in pancreatic cancer there is a high incidence of mutations 50 in the tumor suppressor genes p16 p53 and DPC4 and approximately 90 of cases coincide with a mutation in the oncogene K ras 2 see review by 11 Furthermore a significant percentage of tumors harboring a mutated copy of DPC4 or p53 also lose the corresponding wildtype allele resulting in LOH see reviews by 11 12 Of particular importance to this study are the genes p53 and K ras 2 since a significant proportion of the mutations are localized to a relatively small number of mutational hotspots 13 14 15 16 In this paper we introduce a screen to detect the presence of pancreatic cancer by looking for somatic mutations in p53 and K ras 2 using polony technology to microsequence mutational hotspots within these two genes In addition polonies are used to diagnose LOH in these same genes Results Previous work has shown that a significant percentage of mutations in p53 and K ras 2 are localized to mutational hotspots namely codons 175 245 248 249 273 and 282 in p53 and codons 12 13 and 61 in K ras 2 reviewed in 14 17 18 Each of these mutational hotspots was sequenced in the genomic DNA of various pancreatic cell lines using polony technology as follows Initially each exon bearing a mutational hotspot was individually PCR amplified in a polyacrylamide gel giving rise to one polymerase colony or polony per copy of genomic p53 or K ras 2 DNA The non acrydited strand of the polony was then stripped away after formamide treatment and electrophoresis A sequencing primer was hybridized to the single stranded copy of the PCR amplified p53 K ras 2 fragment and a single base extension with either a Cy 3 or Cy 5 labeled dNTP was performed prior to scanning on a microarray scanner The process of formamide denaturation hybridization and extension was repeated 3 additional times in order to perform an extension with each of the four dNTPs and completely sequence each position When all the mutational hotspots were sequenced in the Panc 1 cell line results of sequencing in Table 3 it was determined that K ras 2 was heterozygous i e one mutant and one wild type allele at the second position of codon 12 Figure 1 and p53 harbored a mutation at the second position of codon 273 Figure 2 In addition to the cell line Panc 1 K ras 2 mutations in the second position of codon 12 were also shown to be present in the cell lines AsPC 1 G A data not shown and CAPAN 1 G T data not shown These results are in agreement with previously published data concerning the genotype of these cell lines 19 20 21 One hallmark of cancer that can be readily observed using polonies is loss of heterozygosity LOH Polony technology provides this capability due to its digital nature where one DNA molecule gives rise to one polony As a result polonies can be used to detect changes in gene copy number that arise due to either deletions or multiplications For example previous studies have shown that Panc 1 has two copies of K ras 2 but only one copy of p53 due to LOH 20 When equivalent quantities of Panc 1 genomic DNA were polony amplified there were approximately twice as many K ras 2 polonies as there were p53 polonies Figure 3 These results taken in conjunction with the in situ genotyping shown previously in Figures 2and 3 clearly demonstrate the ability of polonies to detect LOH It should be noted that polony amplification of genomic DNA from strains with equal p53 and K ras 2 copy numbers such as CAPAN 1 yielded equivalent numbers of p53 and K RAS 2 polonies data not shown This eliminates the role of primer bias contributing to the distinct number of p53 and K ras 2 polonies amplified in Panc 1 genomic DNA Discussion We have shown that polony technology is an improved method to study and potentially diagnosis cancer 22 Specifically polony technology was successfully applied to both detect intragenic mutations in well defined mutational hotspots in key cancer genes as well as determine if loss of heterozygosity of these same genes had occurred For example Panc 1 was determined to possess only one copy of p53 which possessed an intragenic mutation in codon 273 and two copies of K ras 2 one wildtype and one with an intragenic mutation in codon 12 These results are consistent with findings from previous work 20 21 The approach described herein was applied to a clonal cell line However this approach could be used to detect rare somatic mutations and to diagnosis cancer with genomic DNA collected from patient samples or biopsies 23 24 25 26 27 in a manner similar to Digital PCR developed by Vogelstein and Kinzler 22 In the case of analyzing pancreatic juice for p53 and K ras 2 mutations it seems likely that only a small percentage of DNA harbors mutant DNA However polonies seem well suited for this type of analysis since several hundred to several million 2 polonies for a particular gene can be analyzed on a single slide thereby increasing the likelihood of detecting a rare event 22 Additionally the frequency of mutations can be readily determined using this approach due to the digital nature of polonies Finally it should be noted that this approach is not without limitations For example sequencing each mutational hotspot is laborious and detecting mutations outside the hotspots is not feasible Adherence to mutational hotspots was directly responsible for the inability to detect the p53 mutations in the CAPAN and AsPc 1 cell lines 19 21 The best approach for detecting mutations outside the hotspots will involve direct sequencing of the polony PCR products 2 13 14 Conclusions We have shown that polony technology is an improved method to study and potentially diagnosis cancer 22 Specifically polony technology was successfully applied to both detect intragenic mutations in well defined mutational hotspots in key cancer genes as well as determine if loss of heterozygosity of these same genes had occurred These results are consistent with findings from previous work 20 21 Methods Preparation of Pancreatic Cell Line Genomic DNA The pancreatic cell lines AsPc 1 CAPAN 1 and Panc 1 were purchased from the American Type Culture
