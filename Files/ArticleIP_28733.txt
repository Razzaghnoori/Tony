 Who s the Wimp European reporting of the NATO war against Yugoslavia reflected mounting confusion Wednesday over the way ahead The Italian and German newspapers prominently reported their countries firm opposition to the use of ground troops following a meeting in Italy between the German and Italian heads of government The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and Die Welt also reported on their front pages that German Chancellor Gerhard Schr der did not rule out an Italian proposed bombing pause in the event of a U N Security Council resolution supporting the G 8 peace conditions La Repubblica of Rome and Corriere della Sera of Milan both gave front page treatment to new peace feelers from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic Each said the Serbs are now ready to accept the G 8 conditions In London the liberal Guardian led on stark differences among the NATO allies on war strategy It said a rift was opening between the more hawkish governments in London and Washington and anxious European allies desperate for domestic political reasons for a diplomatic and political breakthrough But the consistently hawkish Times of London led on popular protests in southern Serbia against Milosevic s prosecution of the war This was clearly intended to strengthen the case for intensified military action The Times said in an editorial that the growing demoralisation of Serb troops should be ammunition reinforcing the case for the immediate use in combat of America s Apache attack helicopters as part of a more precise and sophisticated military strategy to drive Serb forces out of Kosovo Despite President Clinton s widely reported refusal to rule out the use of ground troops the Times continued to portray him as a wimp Leadership for the moment lies with London it said In the Daily Telegraph another hawkish conservative newspaper political commentator Boris Johnson wrote Wednesday on the op ed page that all the talk of British Prime Minister Tony Blair as Blair the hawk was a gigantic candyfloss illusion created by his Downing Street spin doctors We are now in the blame game he wrote and Mr Blair is simply positioning himself Blair has never publicly spoken out in favor of an invasion of Kosovo but thanks to media manipulation he is now in a win win situation If NATO does prevail and every single Serb soldier is driven from Kosovo and every last refugee is repatriated then Blair s brows will be crowned with the laurels owed to the man who urged the Alliance on Johnson wrote A nd if NATO fails Blair will be able to blame the flaccidity of the Americans and of the Draft Dodger in particular According to a report from Washington Wednesday in the Jerusalem Post the Clinton administration is quietly euphoric about the election of Labor Party leader Ehud Barak as the new prime minister of Israel There was some euphoria in Europe too The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung splashed the headline Barak Promises Rapid Progress in the Middle East Peace Process and Die Welt said that his election arouses new hope worldwide for peace In France Le Monde s headline was Israel A Massive Vote for Peace and Le Figaro s said Barak Wants To Relaunch the Peace Le Monde in an editorial titled Israel The Good News said there are now grounds for hope But in Britain there was more skepticism The Daily Telegraph for example said in an editorial that the election was not a referendum on peace It was a personal bare knuckled contest fought and lost on the banalities of local politics The Times said there can now be progress toward peace but only if all sides are willing to subordinate rhetoric to realism The Guardian said that if Barak can t deliver peace who can If he can t the prospects are grim Benjamin Netanyahu got bad press practically everywhere Ha aretz said in its editorial Wednesday that he and the recalcitrant political fringes to which he was captive had effectively frozen the Oslo agreements but that Barak now has a renewed opportunity to make peace with the Palestinians and to attain a real peace with all our neighbors with Syria at the head The Jerusalem Post s editorial said however that Barak s landslide was not only a function of his opponent s failures but of Netanyahu s success The paper said Netanyahu came into office as leader of the opposition to the Oslo Accords he is leaving having brought the Likud solidly and irreversibly into the Oslo camp By resolving the peace and security debate in Oslo s favor Netanyahu made himself obsolete and broke the historic deadlock over the peace process The Arab world s reaction to Barak s victory was generally suspicious An editorial in the Syrian state controlled newspaper Tashrin called the Netanyahu regime a three year nightmare and said Barak should make drastic changes in Israel s positions regarding a full withdrawal from occupied Arab lands and a just and inclusive peace based on U N resolutions The Syria Times expressed some optimism but the main thrust of Arab press comment was negative A number of Arab columnists argued that while Netanyahu alienated the United States with his behavior the peace loving label that has already been attached to Barak even though he has done nothing yet to earn it might allow him to pursue much the same policies while retaining Western support The Palestinian Pan Arab daily al Quds al Arabi went so far as to suggest that the day might yet come when Palestinians will look back on the days of Netanyahu with something approaching nostalgia The Saudi daily Asharq al Awsat said it feared that Barak might prove to be an even bigger headache for the Arabs than Netanyahu for he will pursue much the same hard line policies as his predecessor but with Western backing Jordanian commentator Fakhri Ka war accused state controlled Arab media of having lulled people into the delusion that the only obstacle to the peace process was Netanyahu and that if Barak won the elections he would prove to be the great savior who rids the Palestinian people of their ordeal But he wrote in the Amman daily al Ra i that the Arabs have learned from bitter experience that Labor and Likud agree on essentials share the same expansionist and hegemonic agenda and differ only in style The daily al Khaleej of the United Arab Emirates also wondered whether anything has really changed in Israel Barak the pianist has already started playing out of tune it said And if he finds anyone among us to sing along with him then we can bid what remains of peace one thousand good byes
