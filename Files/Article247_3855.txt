                                 Lingua Europa                        Good morning Jesse            The language front has been unusually quiet today The only news I see isthe European Union announcement reported on the CNN Web site that the year will be the year of language The EU is urging everyone to learn at leasttwo languages arguing that bilingualism will better prepare workers for theinternational economy Im surprised no one is arguing for an internationalEuropean language to match the uniform currency In fact the EU is strugglingwith language issues having authorized a set of official languages and havinggone on record as supporting a variety of local languages as well I assume theEU regards an interlanguage as a crackpot idea although there must be anEsperantist or two out there who will come forward to defend the idea createdlanguages are difficult to spread Quite a few universal languages have beeninvented over the past few centuries and a couple like Esperanto havededicated users even today Esperanto serves as an auxiliary languageits noones native tongue But even if we had a universal language it would soonbegin to break up into minority tongues Babel myth notwithstanding its quitepossible that multilingualism has always been part of the human condition            The European Union may value multilingualism as an economic asset butAmericans seem to think monolingualism is the way to go We have a long historyof encouraging nonEnglish speakers living or settling in the United States togive up their first language Then we turn around and make them take aforeign language in high school Ive seen it argued that the languagesimmigrants give up are not useful ones or ones with literary cultures worthpreserving In the early part of the  th century psychologistsargued that multilingualism was actually a cause of mental retardation Evenmore thoughtful educators claimed that immigrants should give up their languagefor English because children didnt have room in their heads for more than onelanguage            For a variety of reasons language has come to stand in for other issues Itcan mask xenophobia signal patriotism or reveal membership in an elite or astigmatized group One reader asks why we dont discuss how politicians andadvertisers twist language to get across their point of view or sell theirproduct But in a larger sense that is exactly what all of us do when we uselanguage All words have spin There is no strictly neutral or valuefree wayof saying anything It bothers most of us that not all language use is fair orethical that it may be deceptive or an outright lie or what we perceive as amistake or usage error But lying deception and lack of ethics not tomention real and imagined mistakes much as we may deplore them are naturalhumanand linguisticphenomena We can try to get people to change theirlanguage use to make them more precise to make them more honest but itdoesnt help to blame the language for failings we perceive in languageusers            In fact there are many times when language should not be precise or evenhonest Think about linguistic behavior at funerals for example There arelots of times in our social interactions when if we told the truth or spokeprecisely rather than in a more circumspect fashion we would find ourselvesnot socially interacting any morein other words wed get everyone so madtheyd avoid us altogether This too may be a goal of some language userstoanger our interlocutors may be useful even unavoidable            Will there be a universal language I dont think so Will everyone becomebilingual No Will bureaucrats ever learn to write clearly Dont get mestarted But none of those things is my ultimate goal What I hope people willdo is what were doing hereairing issues exploring them criticallyinterrogating our own preconceptions about language broadening ourunderstanding about how we use language and how wed like it to be used            TaDennis
