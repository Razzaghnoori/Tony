 Background Although there have been major developments in its diagnosis and treatment the mortality rate of septic shock has progressively increased over the past few decades The mortality rate can be as high as 60 70 in cases with multi organ failure 1 and several pharmacological agents have been used in an effort to reduce this percentage 2 In endotoxic shock bacterial endotoxin enters the systemic circulation and triggers the release of pro inflammatory mediators Prostaglandin is released during inflammatory reactions causing an increase in microvascular hydrostatic pressure which is a primary cause of edema and a contributory factor in hypovolemia 3 4 Non steroidal anti inflammatory agents NSAIDs such as acetyl salicylic acid and indometasin have been used in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock and an improvement in survival has been noted Several researchers have also evaluated ibuprofen and beneficial effects on pathophysiological changes have been observed 3 The first major study of ibuprofen in endotoxic shock was performed by Jacobs et al 5 This study indicated that ibuprofen can limit the degree of hypotension and acidosis and decrease the cardiac index in endotoxic shock Fink et al 6 reported that ibuprofen restored the normal hemodynamic pattern However Hulton et al 7 saw no major metabolic effect in E coli sepsis Coran et al 8 showed that the administration of ibuprofen in septic shock in dogs did not reduce cytokine levels Herbertson et al 9 showed that ibuprofen administration in endotoxic shock in pigs could prevent the early hemodynamic changes following entotoxemia but not the later changes Bernard et al 10 reported that in patients with sepsis treatment with ibuprofen reduced levels of prostacylin and thromboxane and decreased fever tachycardia oxygen consumption and lactic acidosis but did not prevent the development of shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome and did not improve survival Despite several studies using ibuprofen in endotoxic and septic shock models there are some conflicting results with respect to survival and there are few studies using pre treatment with ibuprofen In this study we investigated the effects of ibuprofen on physiological parameters and survival in pre and post treated rabbits with experimentally induced endotoxic shock Methods Preparation of animals Twenty eight New Zealand rabbits were anaesthetized by intramuscular I M injection with 35 mg kg ketamin hydrochloride Ketalar ampul 50 g ml Eczacibasi Drug Company Istanbul Turkey and 5 mg kg xylasine hydrochloride Rompun ampul 23 32 mg ml Bayer Istanbul Turkey Anesthesia was maintained with additional doses of ketamin and xylasine 24 G canulas were inserted in to the right femoral artery and vein and monitored with a Siemens SC 6000 monitor Danvers MA USA Study Design The rabbits were randomly divided into four groups of seven animals In Group I control 1 mL isotonic saline was given by intravenous infusion and 1 mL blood samples to obtain basal vital measurements and biochemical parameters were taken simultaneously at 0 30 60 90 120 180 and 240 minutes The rabbits in Groups II III and IV study groups received 1 mL sterile saline at 30 minute intervals for 120 minutes after which the sampling and injection frequency was increased to every 60 minutes Sterile saline was given to Group I for the duration of the experiment including at t 0 Group II received 2 mg kg endotoxin Escherichia coli O55 B5 Sigma Chemical Company USA in sterile physiological saline 0 5 mL kg at t 0 Sodium salt of ibuprofen Sigma Chemical Company USA was dissolved in sterile saline at 77 C in a hot water bath It was cooled down to 35 37 C then injected into Groups III and IV by slow infusion at a dose of 30 mg kg 5 mL at 30 and 30 minutes respectively Rabbits in the first group were followed for 240 minutes and those in the remaining groups were followed until they died Measurements Complete blood counts CBC were measured with an S Coulter Counter Fullerton CA USA Blood samples for measuring Thromboxane B 2 TxB 2 levels were collected in EDTA tubes centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 20 minutes and immediately stored at 20 C Urine samples were collected for Prostaglandin E 2 PGE 2 measurements by suprapubic aspiration which completely emptied the bladder The urine samples were immediately stored at 20 C TxB 2 and PGE 2 were determined by radioimmunoassay according to the manufacturer s protocol Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd UK using the Amerlex M Magnetic Separation System at the Department of Biochemistry College of Medicine Istanbul University Rectal temperatures were taken with a thermometer Statistical Analysis All data are presented as mean SEM Parameters were compared over the study period using analysis of variance for repeated measures SPSS version 10 01 for Windows Where the F values were found to be significant data were compared with Tukey s b test Comparisons between the four groups at the same time point were analyzed by one way analysis of variance followed by Tukey s b post hoc test where appropriate P 0 05 was considered statistically significant

rates significantly increased between 30 and 90 minutes compared to t 0 p 0 001 Group III received endotoxin and ibuprofen at 0 and 30 minutes respectively In this group heart rates were found to be increased at 30 and 60 minutes compared to t 0 p 0 05 In this group only one rabbit survived after 420 minutes Ibuprofen was administered to Group IV at 30 min and endotoxin at t 0 An increase in heart rate was observed at 60 minutes but this was not statistically significant p 0 05 When all groups were compared heart rates at 60 min in both Groups II and III were significantly higher than in Group I p 0 05 Heart rates in Group IV were not significantly different from the control group p 0 05 but were significantly lower than both Groups II and III p 0 01 Table 2and Fig 2 Mean arterial pressure MAP levels showed an obvious decrease at 30 minutes in group II which received only endotoxin from t 0 MAP levels gradually decreased in group III but showed a more regular gradual decrease in group IV When MAP levels between the groups were compared it was observed that groups II and III had statistically significant decreases compared to groups I and IV p 0 0001 at 30 minutes Although MAP values decreased in group IV there was an obvious difference between groups IV and I p 0 05 At 60 minutes MAP levels started to decrease in group IV and were statistically different from groups

differences from group I p 0 05 could be seen Arterial pressure in group III was found to be statistically higher than in both groups II and IV p 0 02 At 180 and 240 minutes MAP levels kept decreasing in groups II III and IV They were clearly lower in those three groups than in group I p 0 001 Table 3and Fig 3 Body temperature In general there was no statistically significant difference in body temperature between the study groups but there was a significant difference between Group I and the study groups p 0 001 In addition hypothermia developed after endotoxin administration White blood cell count There were fewer white blood cells in the study groups than in the control group and the difference was statistically significant p 0 0001 There was no significant difference in white blood cell counts between the endotoxin and ibuprofen treated groups Platelet count The number of platelets decreased after endotoxin administration but ibuprofen had no effect on the platelet counts Haematocrit levels These began to decrease gradually after 90 min in group II and after 180 min in group III when they were significantly lower than the onset levels In group IV there were no statistically significant changes in haematocrit values throughout the study Plasma TxB 2levels These increased following administration of endotoxin at t 0 in Group II Significant decreases in TxB 2 levels were detected in Group III from 60 to 240 min after injection of ibuprofen at 30 min Highly significant differences were observed between the t 0 and 240 min samples p 0 001 In Group IV plasma TxB 2 levels were lowest between 30 minutes and t 0 there was no significant difference between them Plasma TxB 2 levels began to increase after 30 minutes which was significantly different from the 30 minute and t 0 values p 0 005 and p 0 01 respectively When plasma TxB 2 levels were compared between all groups t 0 values were not significantly different between Groups II and III p 0 05 but they were significantly lower in Group IV than in any of the other groups p 0 006 At 60 minutes plasma TxB 2 levels were reduced in both Groups II and III but were increased in Group IV They were significantly different between Groups II and III and the control group but no significant differences were detected between study groups p 0 05 Table 4and Fig 4 Urine PGE 2levels These increased transiently after 30 minutes in Group II and the increase at 60 min was significantly different from the 90 min sample In Group III urine PGE 2 levels were significantly increased at 30 min compared with t 0 p 0 001 However they declined after 60 minutes This decline continued to the 90 minute sample so that PGE 2 levels at both 60 and 90 min were significantly lower than the 30 minute value p 0 001 but no different from t 0 p 0 05 In Group IV PGE 2 levels increased at 30 min compared to t 0 after administration of endotoxin They then began to decrease from 60 and 120 min but the difference was only significant between 30 and 90 min p 0 025 Table 5and Fig 5 Survival rates Among the three endotoxic shock groups the longest mean survival time was observed in Group IV 383 0 39 0 minutes The survival rate in Group IV was significantly higher than in Group II 192 9 46 9 minutes but not significantly higher than Group III 339 1 33 5 minutes p 0 05 In Group III mean survival time was also significantly higher than in Group II p 0 05 Mean survival times are shown in Fig 6 Discussion Ibuprofen is a reversible short acting cyclooxygenase inhibitor which particularly blocks the synthesis of thromboxane Under in vitro conditions it has been shown that ibuprofen stabilizes lyszomal membranes restrains the secretion of lysozomal enzymes from granulocytes and prevents the aggregation of platelets as well as the immigration of leukocytes 1 2 3 4 5 NSAIDs were first used by Northover and Subramanian 11 in an endotoxic shock model in dogs in order to improve hemodynamic disorders In endotoxic or septic shock models respiration pathway changes occur in the lungs Metabolites of cyclooxygenase play an important role in this Studies done with ARDS patients have shown that there is an increase in the number of PMNs in the lung and bronco alveolar fluid which cause an increase in elastase and other lysozomal enzymes 12 Kopolovic et al 13 have reported that respiration dysfunction and hypoxemia were improved and pulmonary hypertension decreased in pigs that were administered ibuprofen after Pseudomonas aeruginosa infusion In addition the same researchers reported that treatment with ibuprofen caused a decrease in pulmonary shunt and lung edema Balk et al 14 used ibuprofen in a canine endotoxic shock model and found that it affected the extent of histological and morphometric lung injury In this study the respiratory rates of the study groups were significantly higher than the control group at 30 min The respiration rates in both Groups III and IV were lower than in Group II right out to 360 minutes Because the study groups II III and IV showed no remarkable differences after 360 min we presume that ibuprofen is not effective after this time In addition ibuprofen administration can prevent hyperpnoea if given before endotoxin Endotoxin administration may lead to hypotension and tachycardia 1 In one study Suffredini et al 15 administered endotoxin to healthy volunteers and observed an increase in cardiac output of 53 a decrease in systemic vascular pressure of 46 and an increase in heart rate of 36 Previously it has been observed that ibuprofen administration in endotoxic shock models prevents an increase in heart rate due to metabolic changes or regulation of oxygen dispersal at the tissue level 16 17 In addition another study by Revhaug et al 18 reported that ibuprofen administration before endotoxin prevented an increase in heart rate Yamanaka et al 19 reported that there were no significant differences from the heart rates of controls in a similar study In our study it was observed that pre treatment with ibuprofen prevented heart rate increase The effects of ibuprofen started at 90 min and lasted up to 180 min in the group that received ibuprofen after endotoxin Thus it appears that ibuprofen has no effect on secreted cyclooxygenase products as it inhibits the cyclooxygenase enzyme With this inhibition new production of cyclooxygenase products is blocked Therefore the cyclooxygenase secreted by Group III caused tachycardia but new formation of cyclooxygenase was inhibited by ibuprofen administration so tachycardia was resolved Therefore it seems that ibuprofen administration has little effect on respiratory rate and heart rate Beck and Abel 20 reported that administration of ibuprofen before endotoxin blocked the sudden drop in mean arterial pressure in experimentally induced endotoxic shock in dogs Coran et al 8 reported that mean arterial pressure was significantly higher in animals that received ibuprofen before induced shock than the control group in their experimental canine septic shock model They indicated that MAP was consistently about 90 of the initial arterial pressure level They also reported that when animals received ibuprofen after endotoxin arterial pressure initially fell to about 50 then increased gradually and continued to be about 70 of initial levels In the present study there was a general reduction in mean arterial blood pressure in group II which received endotoxin On the other hand there was a sudden drop in MAP in Group IV which received ibuprofen before endotoxin whereas an increase in MAP was seen at 60 minutes in the group that received ibuprofen after endotoxin However since initial MAP levels were not established in the study groups it is possible that some other mediators were affecting blood pressure at the start of the experiment Ebong et al 21 reported that all mice developed hypothermia in their model where septic shock was induced by caecal ligation While body temperature was above 34 C on day 1 it later decreased below 34 C Haupt et al 22 observed that fever in severe septic shock patients was reduced after ibuprofen administration However they did not see a reduction in PGE 2 levels so they assumed that the reduction in fever was due to ibuprofen causing a decrease in IL 1 and TNF secretion or due to the direct effect of ibuprofen on the central nervous system The anti pyretic effect of ibuprofen started at 4 hours and lasted up to 24 hours after infusion The role of cytokines in hypothermia is not yet known however it is thought that the decrease in body temperature is dependent on a decrease in pyrojenic cytokines During hypothermic sepsis the response of cytokines and eicosanoids is higher than in febrile patients Therefore ibuprofen has been considered to be more useful in hypothermic patients than in septic shock patients 23 In our study changes in body temperature among study groups were not statistically significant The numbers of white blood cells are reduced in experimental animals induced with endotoxic shock 24 Griffin et al 4 reported that the number of white blood cells decreased after endotoxin administration in pigs In addition they found significant differences between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen administration In our study groups the numbers of white blood cells were significantly lower than in the controls p 0 0001 There were however no significant differences in the white blood cell counts between endotoxin and ibuprofen treated groups Haematocrit values appear to increase in some endotoxic shock models but decrease in others 10 19 20 22 It has been reported that ibuprofen has no effect on the consumption of systemic complement thrombocytopenia leucocytosis or leucopenia 25 In our study there was no increase in haematocrit levels This may be related to the fact that 30 35 mL of blood was withdrawn from each rabbit Ibuprofen also appeared to have no effect on haematocrit levels in our study The occurrence of isolated thrombocytopenia is higher than 50 in septic shock patients without disseminated intravascular coagulation 26 The endotoxic shock experimentally induced by Griffin et al 4 in pigs showed that the numbers of platelets decreased after endotoxin administration but no significant differences were again seen between endotoxin and endotoxin plus ibuprofen p 0 05 In our study it was also observed that the number of platelets decreased after endotoxin administration whilst ibuprofen had no effect Many studies have shown that endotoxin administration can result in an acute decrease in the white blood cell count 4 12 but we propose that ibuprofen has no effect on leukocyte and platelet counts It has been indicated that the pathway of cyclooxygenase products such as TxB 2 and PGE 2 increases in many endotoxic shock models and plays an important role in a number of pathophysiological events 21 27 TxA 2 is a product of arachidonic acid and a potent platelet aggregator whose levels increase during endotoxic shock Ibuprofen prevents the formation of TxA 2 as well as platelet and leucocyte aggregation 12 21 Fletcher et al 28 reported that the levels of TxB 2 were significantly reduced in rats by a combination of TNF and ibuprofen Plasma TxB 2 levels were also reduced by introducing ibuprofen into the faecal peritonitis rat model used by Wise et al 29 In this study TxB 2 levels decreased in the ibuprofen post treated group compared with initial onset levels In addition it was found that the onset levels of TxB 2 were significantly lower in the pre treated group than the other groups Making incisions into the rabbits may have caused an increase in pro inflammatory cytokines Low levels of TxB 2 in group IV at 0 30 min were probably a result of ibuprofen inhibiting the increase which would normally be caused by these cytokines The endotoxic shock mouse model reported by Rosello et al 30 showed that the levels of PGE 2 were significantly lower in the ibuprofen treated group than in controls However the levels of urine PGE 2 were higher at 12 hours in both treated and untreated animals but the difference was not statistically significant In our study it was observed that urine PGE 2 gradually increased in group II after endotoxin administration After treatment with ibuprofen urine PGE 2 levels decreased over the next 90 min but later began to rise again In another version of this study published previously it was seen that ibuprofen reduced the endothelin production induced by endotoxin administration 31 Griffin et al 4 reported that there was no difference in mean survival times between control and ibuprofen pre and post treated groups Arons et al 23 performed a study with hypothermic septic patients and reported that ibuprofen could be used to decrease mortality rates Schirmer et al 32 found a transient 24 hour survival benefit in a rat model of septic shock Fletcher et al 3 also reported that TNF induced mortality could be reduced by using ibuprofen Rosello et al 30 found survival rates increased in mice treated with ibuprofen In addition Young and Passmore 33 reported that ibuprofen treated canines with induced endotoxic shock had longer survival times than those treated with propylgallate However Bernard et al 10 reported that there were no statistically significant differences between ibuprofen treated and untreated animals with regards to their 30 day survival rate In our study mean survival time was significantly longer in the ibuprofen treated groups compared with the untreated group In addition the pre treated group had a longer mean survival time than the post treated group but it was not statistically significant Conclusions Ibuprofen appears to increase short term survival due to its positive effect on various physiological parameters Therefore the use of ibuprofen at higher doses over longer time periods or in combination with other drugs in patients who are at risk of developing septic shock could be effective as a prophylaxis or treatment Competing Interests This study was supported by Firat University Research Foundation
