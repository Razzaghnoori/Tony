 Y2OK The New York Times leads with the millennial coming while the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post lead with the resignation just after the Friday papers closed of Boris Yeltsin The chronological milestone dominates both the WP and NYT fronts The former runs a huge 2000 at its top while the latter goes for 1 1 00 The NYT lead communicates the vast unprecedented scope of the revel noting besides the hometown 7 million bash attended by perhaps 2 million people an around the world series of golden moments in the Pacific Asia Africa Europe and the Americas The overriding theme of the coverage is the symbolic enthrallment of the planet from east to west and mercifully the sheer glitchlessness of it all The WP says the 500 billion spent worldwide on Y2K seems to have done the trick although it would be just as plausible to wonder now if most of the spending was ever really necessary The LAT includes an extra front page that briefly notes Australian bus ticketing foul ups and South Korean trial summonses gone awry but which declares above it all in large pitch type Millennial Mildness So taken are the papers with millennial matters and the other pressing stories that none makes room on their front for the news that all the major indexes ended the year century millennium in nosebleed territory Yeltsin s surprise departure from the world scene leaves Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as acting president and also the likely full time successor after the presidential elections that must take place within three months Yeltsin the papers report said the new millennium required new leadership and he appealed for forgiveness on his way out Putin responded by signing an order giving Yeltsin immunity from prosecution On a day that according to the coverage saw Russian and American military officers jointly shepherding nuclear missiles through Y2K Yeltsin and Putin participated in a little transition ceremony that centered on the handover of the suitcase that is used to monitor a nuclear war The other big story which everybody fronts is the peaceful resolution of the Indian Airlines hijacking crisis India traded safe passage for three imprisoned Kashmir militants and the five hijackers for the safety of the plane s 150 or so passengers It appears from the coverage that the Taliban which controlled the overall situation of the plane sitting in Afghanistan was instrumental in forging the deal There is some surprisingly wonderful stuff in the millennial coverage The NYT s coverage of Hungary s celebration dryly mentions a journalist getting belted twice in a minute by a reveler and then hit again by another Of course in Times speak this means the reporter writing the story The WP runs 100 biographical sketches solicited from readers and many of them fascinate TP s favorite My parents were activist intellectual Marxist Jews In the 50s they were blacklisted in the 60s they worked for civil rights and painted an orange Day Glo peace sign in our front window to publicize their opposition to the Vietnam War They embarrassed the hell out of me and I swore I would grow up to be normal But what s written in one s DNA cannot be denied Thirty years later I am a 46 year old Jewish bisexual priestess of eco feminist witchcraft The NYT takes the occasion to fess up to a mistake in the way the paper has been counting its issues Seems that since Feb 6 1898 the paper has been giving itself credit for 500 numbers more than it actually published The mistake the Times tells us was discovered yesterday By a 24 year old news assistant but yes with the help of a computer The papers report inside that George Harrison will recover from his stab wounds and that the man who inflicted them was charged with attempted murder and scheduled for psychiatric evaluation Trivia Question Why is George Harrison alive but John Lennon dead Answer because in England a wack job can t get a handgun There s no sign yet of what the papers are going to call the decade just entered Today s Papers favors the noughties or the uh ohs but a letter writer to the Times proposes another idea that merits consideration the e decade
