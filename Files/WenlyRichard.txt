                     Good Afternoon         Uh I understand that you are interested in some stories that I heard as a very young boy         Uh thinking of some of them now uh one of them was uh Three Bears         The Mama Bear the Papa Bear and uh the Baby Bear and of course they struggled a long competent from each other         I heard that story a long time ago and it is uh it has stuck with me         Uh also another one was uh The Raven the poem The Raven uh that we read in school and uh we had to determine what it was about and um it wasnt easy at first for us to do that and that that story or poem went something like this Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and forgotten lore while I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping as if some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door it is some visitor I said only this and uh nothing more         Of course the story went on for several pages         And we were to tell what it was about and uh and uh I dont think any of us in that class really came up with the answer         Teacher finally told us that it was it was a bird         Uh my family did not uh all they         told were some stories but but they usually talk about past experiences uh when they were growing up uh when they were courting and uh during their early years of marriage and uh this kind of thing         I can remember uh some of those stories now uh my mother would tell the story of a my uh great grandmother my grandmother sitting in the door of living room when uh my daddy would go to see her before they got married and and of course she would sit there until they leave and sometimes she would act as though she was sleeping and got rather quiet she would           In other words I went to the conclusion that there was strict supervision of of teenagers uh while they were under the influence of their parents         Uh         I would like to tell you about some traveling that Ive done         Ive been to uh to counseling conferences at University of Michigan no it was at Michigan State University at East Lansing MI         Uh and the purpose of these three visits was a conference on counseling third world students         And of course the goal of this uh these sessions was to help individuals to become more familiar with uh some of the uh concerns and problems that uh they may have due to language uh new country and ability to uh interpret whats happening around them         Um we had a lot of good speakers and we had representation from uh a large number of different ethnic groups and uh this proved to be very beneficial and the most important thing to me was while I was there I read in the library a a book that listed scholarships that have been listed and given out by the   Foundation and they listed uh a couple of people who were on Michigan States campus as uh individuals who had served as readers for uh the proposals that were sent         So immediately as soon as possible rather I got on the phone and I called over to Justine Morrow School and I got a chance to talk with the director who knew about the uh workings of   Foundations and grants         I went in to conference with them and I went over to uh talk with them in person and explain to him what I wanted to do and showed me how I could incorporate the mandates of uh scholarship that I was trying to get the fellowship         Uh and to a study uh an experience related event         So it boiled down and I ended up working on uh the national design of uh experiences that would help students from small areas make the transition from rural to uh to larger cities in eastern NC and of course I based that on the basis of high percentage of individuals who left the area after college and went to larger cities many of them succeeded more than we would like to         I guess basic problems in the transition from uh small towns and rural areas to uh the large cities         So I wrote this proposal to do this and I got an interview from one of the readers who was from Kentucky and I met him in Greensboro he interviewed me         In three or four weeks later I was notified that I had received which was for one year of study at uh Temple University and it offered a stipend of          Uh this was quite helpful uh to me and also uh while I was there I received a grant to uh improve minority scholars on uh predominately minority campuses which was known as AEP Advancement of Education of Personnel and of course this was given out on four different campuses Bowie Coppin Livingstone and Elizabeth City State uh colleges and maybe one or two others and we would they would send four people in the summer for study and two would return for the winter and two would stay and by doing this uh each person in the group was able to get in their one year residency and continue studies         Uh by uh taking at least one semester off campus with continuous education and of course uh returning in the summer courses that were taken off campus when we return to our respective campuses had to be approved and they sent a professor to these campus to uh interview us two or three times a year as to the progress that uh we were making toward the uh plan of study that we had made         OK uh so guess youve decided by now that that I did not have it easy growing up in fact I did not expect to get the opportunities that I received but by making necessary contacts good contacts and uh meeting people who were movers and shakers and could influence my career I was able to build on that and uh and to get a terminal degree at uh Temple University in Urban Education which helped me when I returned to my own campus to move from counseling to uh Social Science Education and uh study in a society professor moving into the position of professorship uh with tenure before I left         So uh these are some good things that I think I uh happen to good people         There is a book Ive heard individuals lecture upon and Ive read some of it myself Why do Bad Things Happen to Good People         And this is true everybody does not uh deserve unfortunate things that happen to them         But it is my philosophy that a lot of good things happen to uh good people and that more than likely they will happen to good people because they will be on the right track         Now um uh         these these ideas have stuck with me through the years and I guess there is a combination of stories that Ive heard speeches that Ive heard and uh and of course books that Ive read         But I remember when I was in college at AT State University WO Kerrington speaking uh and he used for a subject that for every soul open its own way           And he went on to say that high soul chooses the high way the low soul chooses the low way         And in the midst is the misty flats which most people choose and then he went on to talk about the middle road being crowded uh the low road meeting destruction and disappointment tragedy         But the high road leading to success and opportunities and even then though we were quite young he challenged us it seemed to get through that if we selected the high road that benefits had the possibilities of being numerous and sometimes when Im out alone when test and trials come those words come to me         a group of words were uttered by   that we were expected to learn and we were expected and required in high school to learn poems to read poems and try to interpret poems that we could think of and one of them was by Kipling which was If and I dont recall all of it now but it went on to say that if you can dream and not make your dreams your master if you can think and not make your thoughts your aim you can meet with triumph and disaster         Treat those two imposters just the same and it goes on the say that if you can do all these things yours is the world and all that is in it         And what is more that you will be a man or woman in life           That was meant to be nonexistent language at that time         Uh so that has been a source of inspiration to me         Sometimes when I might have a have exploded used other approaches I sought to keep my head when it seemed like everybody else was not thinking at the moment         What inspires one individual uh may inspire another and may inspire something else         These these are things that that I would like to share with and I will tell you look at about my background         Lets see my mother taught in the schools of North Carolina for  some years over  years and my father uh was a minister and uh I have three brothers no sisters and have always wished that I had sisters so that I can understand maybe girls a little bit better than I do         Ladies but uh thats the way it came out         We were a loving family         We did a lot of most things together worked together we grew up in a rural area and we worked together we ate together we uh went shopping together         We went to church together and uh that bonded us to the extent that we have remained relatively close though gone our separate ways to different parts of country uh because of that early loving and care and concern         We were taught and soon acquired being concerned about each each other         Played with animals grew plants         This has helped me uh as Ive gone out on my own to be able to grow plants and find enjoyment and relaxation working in that area when I can find time to do so         I would not want to get anyone to cut my grass and thought they would do it free because I enjoy doing it myself         I did go to the Philippines         When I graduated from uh from Temple University as a present for my graduation         I spent  days there I visited the embassy I met some individuals         I got an opportunity to uh school with them         Which they would go out into the bars I think they called it in Manila and on the weekend I spent one weekend there I had a chance to taste the foods uh to sleep under the uh net see little bit of a cock fight         To go to the swimming to pool and to make um very beautiful pictures         And I found uh         I found everybody was very warm toward uh me as an American         I dont know why I would do that by myself         I went by myself basically without one in a tour group and my visit after I got there         I didnt have any problems except uh when I was getting ready to leave it was in the monsoon season         It was raining very hard         When the cab came to the hotel to take me to the airport I had my pull off my shoes and socks and wade halfway up my legs to get to the airport         Once I got to there I dried them up and put them on         It wasnt very long before the plane was in and we headed back to the United States through the way of Guam and laid in Hawaii and California Washington DC and uh back to Norfolk VA         So that I shall always cherish and it helped me to understand other cultures and helped me to appreciate the uh opportunities that I had in the United States         Uh I hope to return to work uh the in an embassy level position with some of those that would go on the international teams of teachers doctors and so forth         But uh the Iranian Crisis hostage crisis took place a few months after that and I was never able to get that that off but I had a vision I had a desire to return again         Well never done anything like this before but I hope that I said something like that uh will help you to understand what it is like to grow up in uh North Carolina and uh the values that are perpetuated are taught by good wellthinking parents and the love and concern for each other that is expressed in many ways         Uh nobody nobody had lost to make us treat each other right         But at that time women were put on a pedestal and treated with the highest degree of respect and they were devout and loving to their husband and they didnt feel anybody was putting something on them and becoming unnecessarily agitated uh because somebody didnt do something according to term         Uh we had   School was a happy place place for play we had limited supervision at a small high school and students basically uh loved the teachers         The teachers lived in the community primarily they visited the churches         And sometimes members of the churches that students went to         So they saw the students in nonacademic settings as well as in academic settings         They knew the parents and of course they had the confidence of the parents and um students tried to do the right things because they did not want their teachers to tell um their mother on them         Because if they did the mother wouldnt curse the teacher out she she would penalize the student in some way and um most students didnt even have to go through that because they did the right thing because it was the right thing to do         And never heard of fights well we had some little fist fights but not with guns and that kind of thing uh until very recently in the area I grew up and I still havent heard of it happening there but Ive heard of it happening in other parts of NC and the United States         But uh parents spent a lot of time at that time with um their children         I think this is this is the key and missing ingredient many of them are busy working everyday         They have other problems they have children while they are young         They want to socialize and many times the children left to fend for themselves and to make choices and of course they fail to make the proper choices         Role models certainly are needed in our communities and uh in our schools also uh because students mirror what they hear and what they see         Uh and if they see adults doing some other things they we accuse them for uh they figure that this is cool         These individuals become their heroes and uh they try to emulate them         Uh one final thing that I must mention is religion was more of an important factor in the lives of young people when I was a teenager         Growing up almost everybody went to church and students went with them and it sure didnt make them perfect but it seem to uh place some fear in their minds some people today I think have no fear even fear of death         They think theyre going to come back its some temporary vacation and they dont realize when they use violence or they when they overdose how permanent it is         So if we dont people have different tendency of churches and religions Judaism Hinduism   Christianity and then you have Atheist         But if we dont use any of those uh we need something that can cause us to think and let us know that we are not really masters of our own fate captains of our own souls but uh that we are dispensable that we are passing through here for a short period of time         Its important to make our mark in the sand and one way to do it certainly is to live a decent life and uh if we can do that and add education competencies and skills that we can help lift someone else then uh we would come to the end of the road with joy and happiness I think uh saying that we have helped to make the world better         Thank you
