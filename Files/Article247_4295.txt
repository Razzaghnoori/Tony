 Hits and Misses Dear Jack I m glad you picked up on the alternative newspaper question for two reasons One it spotlights the frustrating limits of Rosen s definitions of journalism and journalists There is nary a mention in this thick book of any of the leading alternative weeklies which are often stuffed with material that one might expect to intrigue Rosen There s also little mention of national magazines whether specialized political ones or big general interest ones There s almost no attention paid to radio where hundreds of of excellent American journalists work and only at the end does Rosen acknowledge the development of the Internet as a news medium Even television doesn t get much play here at least not compared with the audience it garners in real life In other words For someone with as sweeping and academic seeming a criticism as Rosen s he s done a poor job of defining the terms of what journalists do where they work and how they operate Two as you indicate alternative newspapers have been thriving many for decades by providing readers with exactly the kind of service Rosen says he wants reporting with perspective reader inclusion making stories into crusades etc Their success in doing so is of course debatable but it makes you wonder Has Rosen simply never read those papers Or is he avoiding using them as models My guess is the latter I ll bet it s a prestige problem The folks at Pew Charitable Trust and the other purse strings of public journalism would scream We didn t cough up several million dollars so you could tell the media to behave like the goddamned Village Voice That said I think you re being awfully sanguine about the state of American media I find most American newspapers to be quite bad to argue that they might once have been worse is neither reassuring nor really the point Most television journalism is horrendous and some is actually harmful by misinforming viewers about crime for example Either you want that situation to change or you don t but denying it seems silly You re also arguing against straw men of your own creation A journalist does not need to have a lunch pail and straphanger audience in order to be out of touch Pick up a copy of the Miami Herald or for that matter the San Francisco Chronicle and tell me with a straight face that those papers are doing the best job they can to reflect and report life in those cities Remind me which prime time network news show it is that deals with immigration public education workplace discrimination and how to solve health and child care problems Seems to me that whenever I tune in I am asked to contemplate The Miracle of Sextuplets As for presidential politics we agree that poor coverage is not exclusively the media s fault or even principally its fault But it also seems a cop out to say that if the candidates don t disagree then there s no way to cover the issues I don t think that some of the experiments in this book are all that bad for that kind of coverage That is start with local issues in my neighborhood they include AIDS homelessness housing prices and the need for a Second Avenue subway Then look to what candidates can offer skeptically of course since the real story may be that these problems elude solutions on the presidential level If they don t disagree one iota then maybe there s a political problem but I don t think there would be a problem producing good or interesting journalism I suspect by the way that the better New York papers will do something like this as the primary approaches though they won t call it public journalism
