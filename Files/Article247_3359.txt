 Daniel Bell the Once Famed New York Intellectual Daniel Bell who recently turned 80 cuts an odd figure on the intellectual landscape Although he is generally considered to be the greatest living American sociologist surprisingly few people today have heard of him He is probably better known in Europe than in the United States There is no Bellian school of sociological thought He has been called a sage without a following In the 70s when the book we are discussing was originally published he had a higher profile One survey placed him among the ten most respected intellectuals in America No doubt that had something to do with his 1960 volume of essays The End of Ideology which Bell himself once called the most cited and least read of books Although Bell did not coin the term post industrial it was his book that launched it into the popular lexicon where it was subsequently banalized by untold mindless repetitions That of course is not Bell s fault Indeed it was with some excitement that I opened this new edition of The Coming of Post Industrial Society hoping to recover the rigorous and prescient thinking behind the clich I was also curious to see how Bell in a newly written foreword of some 80 pages would retrospectively appraise the validity of his theorizing and the accuracy of his predictions I don t know about you David but I was at first put off by the rather unleavened prose the endless morphological distinctions systems orders spheres situses axial principles dimensions and the paragraphs full of academic throat clearing But the limitations of forecasting are also evident The further one reaches ahead in time with a set of forecasts the greater the margin for error since the fan of projections widens not to mention the typos factual errors and shoddy copy editing of the new foreword Bell may have been one of the more sparkling of the New York intellectuals in his heyday and he was also of course a writer for Henry Luce s Fortune in the 50s and has even retained some Time ese tics such as referring to Plato in a footnote as the famed Greek philosopher But he has been since the 1960s an academic sociologist first at Columbia which gave him a PhD after they hired him for his writings as a public intellectual and then since 1969 at Harvard And sociologists cannot help generating grand sterile abstract schematics to describe society Curiously if you look at the wonderful anthology of parodies that Dwight Macdonald put together long ago you will find a burlesque of sociologese by Daniel Bell called The Parameters of Social Movements A Formal Paradigm which was allegedly a revision of an earlier scheme titled The Configurative Patterning of Social Movements The parody is not all that funny What is hilarious is that a couple of sociological colleagues to whom he sent it mistook it for the real thing One of them he writes sent me back a serious letter about some of the categories while the other not knowing whether it was a spoof or not wrote You are too good a sociologist not to have created something which itself is quite useful And a third asked me for a copy of my earlier scheme I seem to have left it to you David to say just what Daniel Bell means by the post industrial society Forgive me
