 This is Gladys Shamblin She is Japanese American She has lived in the Charlotte area for 13 years and she is going to talk about growing up Japanese American in West Virginia Um when I grew up in West Virginia um it was like it was backwards compared to the Charlotte area It was just uh the people were just so different there a lot of coal miners and uh there s a lot of people on welfare It was just a different place to live Uh Where were you in West Virginia We were growing up in Madison West Virginia and prior to that Kentucky We lived in Kentucky uh briefly My father was from Kentucky and we call him The Kentucky Redneck and my mother was Japanese and when she came to the United States she couldn t speak any English or anything And uh so she spoke broken English and as we were being raised we learned to interpret everything she said And no matter what anyone uh mom would say no matter what she would say to someone we would understand exactly what she meant exactly what she was saying and they couldn t believe it It was like speaking a different language But um as we grew up our mother taught us a lot about respect and how important it is to be good and kind to other people be courteous uh be thankful for all the little things that people do for you I didn t realize she had implanted that in my head all these years until I grew up and people wondered why I was being so nice Um they thought I had a hidden agenda but it s it was just the way I was raised Um And then growing up in West Virginia and being part Japanese and the only family in that area that was Japanese it was kind of difficult Um especially when there was just a handful of Native Americans then there were some African Americans just a handful of them and then there was us So we were the minority and we were very different than other families Um When they would start to cover like the WWII stories at school and in history class we would uh kind of shrink under our seats because you know everybody would start yelling Jap And uh we until then we didn t feel like we were different and then we realized after that well we looked Japanese although we were 100 American People people would look at us and know we were different so they would treat us different Um But we would go home and my mother would always reassure us that uh it s OK to be different It s what is in your heart that matters So as we grew up I I thought it was a curse when I was younger being Japanese Uh went around with not so much a chip on my shoulder just uh an inferiority complex and didn t realize until I got older that I was very much proud to be Japanese And uh got to visit Japan a couple of times and realized that s the best thing God could have given me was to be different because I m able to help other people go through the same situation Um What kind of stories did your your mother used to tell you Oh Mom used to tell us stories when she was 11 years old um when World War II did hit she looked up which her home was not far from Hiroshima Wow And uh she looked up and could see the bombs and everything And she remembers being scared and thinking that she was going to die and she said it was just one of the hardest times of her life That but uh they made it through that and um she really never showed any bitterness or anything towards American people but uh she was always just grateful for her life Huh Uh And then Mom raised five children I have had three brothers and a sister And she raised us with speaking broken English and she eventually did learn English fairly well She took English as a second language just after my father died Um but she was she never worked outside the home She raised us she said that was her job Um How did your parents meet They met my my mother was going to Tokyo University in Tokyo and working part time at a china factory and my father had gone there to buy some china for his mother and uh he met my mother and just fell head over heels in love And she thought he was a crazy American And um he just kept being nice to her and she her family couldn t believe she would leave them and move to the United States to be with this man but she did And uh they they were pretty happy I mean she went from being fairly wealthy though to being poor Hum And that was difficult But when she started having children she said that that s her life Her children were her life So um as we got older we really appreciated that and uh when Mom got sick she had cancer it was our turn to take care of her So for about six months we my sister and I both we just kept we just stayed beside her bed and we took care of her and it was wonderful it was like us giving back to Mom Hum Did she ever go back to Japan She went back twice She went back right after my father died He died of a massive heart attack when he was 48 and uh she went back that time and stayed a couple months She was able to see her mother and um get to know her family again because it had been 22 years So uh that was wonderful and then she went one other time which was her last time uh and stayed about a month and she came back My first trip to Japan although it was a sad trip it was a watershed in my life It was uh after she died of cancer my sister and I had her cremated and we took her ashes back to be with her family Hum So that was my first trip to Japan My second trip was um to take my daughter when she turned 16 which was a wonderful trip and helped her understand her grandmother s culture And then we plan to take my son next year when he turns 16 just so we can uh show him Japan And we feel like travel is one of the best things you can give your children Money clothes and all that can go away but travel is in your memories and that when I m dead and gone I want them to remember that You mentioned that your mom talked a lot about her older brother What were some of the stories she told about him Well Mom came from a traditional Japanese family um where the Number One son does take over after the parents get to be a certain age And then when he gets to be a certain age his son takes over So it s gone that way for the past 200 years And um right now my uncle is almost 90 and his son is taking care of him He s a Buddhist priest My mother s father was a Buddhist priest So that s the kind of story she d tell us She would tell us about how the people in the community always took care of their family because they were so well respected and they lived in a beautiful place and people would bring them gifts because they just appreciated their presence in the community And um we when Mom would tell us these stories we would laugh We would think Oh yeah right you were rich And then when I did go over to Japan I did see what she was talking about and really felt guilty that we didn t believe her totally believe her that that she had all this but um according to Japanese standards uh they are just very wealthy And then they come here and they look at my house and they no really land over there is so very expensive so they are very wealthy and then they come here and I live in a very basic house and they think I m rich so uh that s kind of comical which we re not we re very middle class That was a drastic change for her It was I mean to go from there to wow She was pretty much treated like a princess pretty much I mean they catered to her family they adopted children Wow What did your dad do in West Virginia Actually my father was um supervisor for the telephone company Hum Which is I guess why I love being around telephones and fixing phones and I love what I do now I guess it s almost to honor him Why was he in Japan Uh he was in the uh Korean War OK Yeah and that s where he learned all his telephone skills He uh learned a lot in the Army and then I think I m the only one that kind of pursued an interest in telephones and communications and such That is interesting that it would come back around that way Um was there anything else your family used to do or talked about that you wanted to include Um we used to camp which was very unusual for my mother Oh I bet I mean she was kind of comical She was Miss Prissy out there trying to camp We used to uh we used to try to act like a normal American family but we would have rice at the campground I never remembered a day in my life that I didn t have rice We always ate rice If you got sick she would ball up little balls of rice and you know Just eat this you ll be OK So she thought it rice was a cure all But uh Do you eat rice now Yes I have a rice cooker and I pretty much keep rice on all the time And my husband has learned to like it and my children love it And my daughter is pursuing a career in uh political science and Asian studies Huh So she can go over there and teach English in Japan And her junior year in college she is at Furman University her junior year she plans to go over there and spend the whole year studying in Japan So I really feel like she s doing everything I wished I could have done Um huh Is there anything else you want to include No not really but I appreciate it
