 No Pain No Gain Once upon a time there was a densely populated island nation which despite its lack of natural resources had managed through hard work and ingenuity to build itself into one of the world s major industrial powers But there came a time when the magic stopped working A brief overheated boom was followed by a slump that lingered for most of a decade A country whose name had once been a byword for economic prowess instead became a symbol of faded glory Inevitably a dispute raged over the causes of and cures for the nation s malaise Many observers attributed the economy s decline to deep structural factors institutions that failed to adapt to a changing world missed opportunities to capitalize on new technologies and general rigidity and lack of flexibility But a few dissented While conceding these factors were at work they insisted that much of the slump had far shallower roots that it was the avoidable consequence of an excessively conservative monetary policy one preoccupied with conventional standards of soundness when what the economy really needed was to roll the printing presses Needless to say the inflationists were dismissed by mainstream opinion Adopting their proposals argued central bankers and finance ministry officials would undermine confidence and hence worsen the slump And even if inflationary policies were to give the economy a false flush of artificial health they would be counterproductive in the long run because they would relax the pressure for fundamental reform Better to take the bitter medicine now to let unemployment rise to force companies to purge themselves of redundant capacity than to postpone the day of reckoning OK OK I ve used this writing trick before The previous paragraphs could describe the current debate about Japan I myself am of course the most notorious advocate of inflation as a cure for Japan s slump But they could also describe Great Britain in the 1920s a point brought home to me by my vacation reading the second volume of Robert Skidelsky s biography of John Maynard Keynes which covers the crucial period from 1920 to 1937 The volume s title incidentally is John Maynard Keynes The Economist as Savior Skidelsky s book believe it or not is actually quite absorbing Although he was an economist Keynes led an interesting life though to tell the truth what I personally found myself envying was the way he managed to change the world without having to visit quite so much of it Imagine being a prominent economist without once experiencing jet lag or never taking a business trip where you spent more time getting to and from your destination than you spent at it And anyone with an interest in the history of economic thought will find the tale of how Keynes gradually painfully arrived at his ideas and of how his emerging vision clashed with rival schools of thought fascinating Click for an example But the part of Skidelsky s book that really resonates with current events concerns the great debate over British monetary policy in the 1920s Like the United States Britain experienced an inflationary boom fed by real estate speculation in particular immediately following World War I In both countries this boom was followed by a nasty recession But whereas the United States soon recovered and experienced a decade of roaring prosperity before the coming of the Great Depression Britain s slump never really ended Unemployment which had averaged something like 4 percent before the war stubbornly remained above 10 percent There is an obvious parallel with modern Japan whose bubble economy of the late 1980s burst eight years ago and has never bounced back Almost everyone who thought about it agreed that Britain s long run relative decline as an economic power had much to do with structural weaknesses an overreliance on traditional industries such as coal and cotton a class ridden educational system that still tried to produce gentlemen rather than engineers and managers a business culture that had failed to make the transition from the family firm to the modern corporation Keynes never one to mince words wrote that t he hereditary principle in the transmission of wealth and the control of business is the reason why the leadership of the Capitalist cause is weak and stupid It is too much dominated by third generation men Similarly everyone who thinks about it agrees that modern Japan has deep structural problems a failure to move out of traditional heavy industry an educational system that stresses obedience rather than initiative a business system that insulates big company managers from market reality But need structural problems of this kind lead to high unemployment as opposed to slow growth Is recession the price of inefficiency Keynes didn t think so then and those of us who think along related lines don t think so now Recessions we claim can and should be fought with short run palliatives by all means let us work on our structural problems but meanwhile let us also keep the work force employed by printing enough money to keep consumers and investors spending One objection to that proposal is that it will directly do more harm than good In the 1920s the great and the good believed that an essential precondition for British recovery was a return to the prewar gold standard at the prewar parity that is making a pound worth 4 86 It was believed that this goal was worth achieving even if it required a substantial fall in wages and prices that is general deflation To ratify the depreciation of the pound that had taken place since 1914 in order to avoid that deflation was clearly irresponsible In modern times of course it would on the contrary seem irresponsible to advocate deflation in the name of a historical monetary benchmark though Hong Kong is currently following a de facto policy of deflation in order to defend the fixed exchange rate between its currency and the U S dollar But orthodoxy continues to prevail against the logic of economic analysis In the case of Japan there is a compelling intellectual case for a recovery strategy based on the deliberate creation of managed inflation But the great and the good know that price stability is essential and that inflation is always a bad thing What really struck me in Skidelsky s account however was the extent to which conventional opinion in the 1920s viewed high unemployment as a good thing a sign that excesses were being corrected and discipline restored so that even a successful attempt to reflate the economy would be a mistake And one hears exactly the same argument now As one ordinarily sensible Japanese economist said to me Your proposal would just allow those guys to keep on doing the same old things just when the recession is finally bringing about change In short in Japan today and perhaps in the United States tomorrow behind many of the arguments about why we can t monetize our way out of a recession lies the belief that pain is good that it builds a stronger economy Well let Keynes have the last word It is a grave criticism of our way of managing our economic affairs that this should seem to anyone like a reasonable proposal
