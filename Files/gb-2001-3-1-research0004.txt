 Background Nomenclature In recent publications involving bioinformatic analysis of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis 9 10 11 12 13 14 we have implemented a nomenclature that attempts logical and consistent naming of genes and their gene products for different organisms The problem is exemplified by the contemporary naming in two model organisms of 3 deoxy D arabino heptulosonate 7 phosphate DAHP synthase the initial enzyme step of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis In Bacillus subtilis the gene appropriately enough has been named aroA but in Escherichia coli the equivalent function is represented by genes encoding three differentially regulated paralogs These E coli genes have been named aroF aroG and aroH In B subtilis these latter three gene designations refer to 5 enolpyruvylshikimate 3 phosphate synthase step 6 of chorismate synthesis chorismate synthase step 7 and chorismate mutase initial step of phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Even in B subtilis where the naming was intended to follow an orderly progression in terms of order of reaction steps there is the complication that DAHP synthase is expressed as a fusion of two catalytic domains one being a class of chorismate mutase called AroQ This requires naming at the level of domain and the designation aroQ aroA was implemented to denote such a fusion 9 10 11 12 Thus a single enzymatic function in one organism is accommodated through the cumulative expression of three paralog genes but in another organism is only encoded by a portion of a single gene A universal nomenclature is needed that labels at the level of domain that labels in synchrony with order of reaction steps as much as possible and that labels isofunctional paralogs at the same hierarchical level but with discriminating identifiers The status of nomenclature for the tryptophan pathway is not so chaotic as the genes in almost all prokaryotes have been named in line with E coli but even here distinct problems have arisen because gene fusions that exist in E coli are often absent elsewhere Much of the literature up to at least 1996 used five gene designations for the seven protein domains 15 In B subtilis these seven protein domains are encoded by separate genes 16 Thus E coli trpD encodes the equivalent of B subtilis TrpG and TrpD The E coli gene fusion has been re designated with the convention of a bullet to represent a fusion trpG trpD 17 Likewise the E coli trpC encodes the equivalent of B subtilis TrpC and TrpF and the E coli gene fusion has been re designated trpC trpF The nomenclature we advocate is more easily remembered because genes are named in the order of pathway reaction Subunits for a given reaction are named at the same hierarchical level anthranilate synthase first reaction consists of TrpAa and TrpAb and tryptophan synthase fifth reaction consists of TrpEa and TrpEb The implementation of a logical and consistent nomenclature as illustrated in Figure 1 should be most helpful in the long term Results and discussion Phylogenetic tree construction Initial amino acid alignments were generated using ClustalW software version 1 4 18 Manual adjustments were made through visual inspection to bring conserved motifs and residues into register This was implemented by use of the BioEdit multiple alignment tool 19 Inferences about the evolutionary relationships within the TrpEa and TrpEb protein families were made using the PHYLIP package of programs 20 The Protpars program was used to generate a maximum parsimony tree and the neighbor joining and Fitch programs were used to generate a distance based tree The distance matrix used in the latter programs was produced using the program Protdist with a Dayoff PAM matrix The Seqboot and Consense programs were then used to assess the statistical strength of the tree using bootstrap resampling Neighbor joining PHYLIP Fitch and Margolash Fitch in PHYLIP and maximum parsimony methods 21 all produced trees consistent with one another Despite low bootstrap values at many individual internal nodes the clusters formed and arrangement of taxa within them were largely identical Ninety TrpEb and 63 TrpEa sequences were analyzed Distinctly different types of TrpEb TrpEb proteins divide into two distinctly different groups as illustrated by the unrooted tree shown in Figure 2 The major group denoted TrpEb_1 includes the well studied enzymes from such organisms as E coli Salmonella typhimurium and B subtilis The minor group denoted TrpEb_2 is represented heavily but not exclusively by archaeal proteins Among the current inventory of completed archaeal genomes only Methanococcus jannaschii lacks TrpEb_2 Seven archaeal genomes possess both TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 Methanosarcina barkeri possesses two paralogs of TrpEb_1 in addition to one species of TrpEb_2 Six archaeal genomes possess TrpEb_2 but not TrpEb_1 Bacterial TrpEb_2 proteins are thus far limited to Aquifex Thermotoga Mycobacterium Geobacter Chlorobium and Rhodopseudomonas genera In addition one of the multiple TrpEb proteins present in the higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana belongs to the TrpEb_2 subfamily In view of the distinct divergence of TrpEb_2 from TrpEb_1 one might expect that either TrpEb_2 has lost the ability to interact allosterically with TrpEa or perhaps that a divergent subgroup of TrpEa has coevolved with TrpEb_2 Multiple copies of TrpEb are often present in genomes Examples include cases where two TrpEb_1 species coexist where two TrpEb_2 species coexist or where TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 coexist in the same organism A number of organisms M barkeri Rhodobacter capsulatus Chlamydia psittaci and Corynebacterium diphtheriae possess two copies of TrpEb_1 In each case the trpEb_1 copy that is linked to trpEa is highly conserved whereas the remaining copy has diverged to the extent that it may be a pseudogene Table 2 The TrpEb_1 products of these probable pseudogenes have elongated branches highlighted yellow on the protein tree shown in Figure 2 It is noteworthy that cyanobacterial and higher plant amino acid sequences form a cohesive cluster for TrpEb_1 as shown in phylogram form in Figure 3 left panel An analysis of TrpEa proteins from the same organisms yields a very similar phylogram output Figure 3 right panel This higher plant cyanobacteria relationship is pleasingly consistent with the endosymbiotic hypothesis of organelle evolution In each case Prochlorococcus marinus and Synechococcus species are the outlying sequence group with the other cyanobacterial sequences Nostoc punctiforme and Anabaena species being closer to the higher plant sequences from A thaliana and corn Zea mays The order of branching shown is supported by very high bootstrap values Zma 3 is the TrpEa protein that has been proposed 22 to function independently of a TrpEb partner producing indole for entry into a pathway other than tryptophan In this case indole serves as a precursor for a defense metabolite that is active against insects bacteria and fungi TrpEa in organisms lacking TrpEb_1 Six organisms all Archaea possess intact tryptophan pathways but they lack TrpEb_1 TrpEb in Thermoplasma volcanii T acidophilum and Ferroplasma acidarmanus is represented only by a single species of TrpEb_2 Although Sulfolobus solfataricus Aeropyrum pernix and Pyrobaculum aerophilum all possess two species of TrpEb both are the TrpEb_2 variety Thus in all six of these lineages TrpEa either might be unable to form a tight complex with TrpEb_2 or might have evolved different protein protein contacts In the latter case distinct TrpEa subgroupings might be expected in parallel with the two TrpEb subgroupings On the contrary all TrpEa sequences fall into a single group Figure 4 However in contrast to sequences present in those Archaea that do possess TrpEb_1 for example Archaeoglobus species of Pyrococcus Methanococcus Methanobacterium Methanosarcina and Halobacterium the six archaeal lineages that possess only TrpEb_2 have very distinctive elongated branches on the TrpEa tree Figure 4 This suggests an elevated rate of evolutionary divergence due either to selection for new productive contacts of TrpEa with TrpEb_2 or to lack of constraint to maintain TrpEa residues previously important for contacts with TrpEb_1 The long branch of the TrpEa sequence of Chlamydia trachomatis reflects its likely status as a pseudogene This is consistent with the observation that C trachomatis TrpEb_1 Figure 2 also seems to be a pseudogene One does not expect positive selection for maintenance of function in C trachomatis as it lacks an intact tryptophan pathway Indeed the alteration in C trachomatis of many otherwise invariant amino acid residues is evident from the information given in Table 2 Overview comparison of TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 Figure 5shows an alignment of the amino acid sequence of TrpEb_1 from S typhimurium with TrpEb_2 from P furiosus Each sequence is shown as a template for its own subfamily as extracted from a refined multiple alignment Conserved residues deduced from a full multiple alignment available from the author on request are indicated as are the gap positions present in the full alignment Functional roles in catalysis and allosteric regulation are indicated for the S typhimurium TrpEb_1 sequence in order to compare similarities and differences between TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 proteins Residues that are ligands of pyridoxal phosphate or that interact with pyridoxal phosphate are scattered throughout the sequences including the catalytic K87 and are highly conserved Residue E109 has been shown to render indole more nucleophilic via proton abstraction from N1 23 The serine substrate binding region is highly conserved as is a monovalent cation MVC binding region 7 coordinating with G232 F Y306 and G A S308 A number of indels insertions deletions distinguish TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 and TrpEb_2 is about 50 residues longer overall than TrpEb_1 In addition to other residues conserved between both TrpEb_1 and TrpEb_2 each subgroup has its own repertoire of uniquely conserved residues The COMM domain 24 a rigid but mobile domain as originally defined with S typhimurium TrpEb_1 25 differs from the corresponding region of the TrpEb_2 subfamily by the presence of an indel Key TrpEb_1 regulatory residues R141 K167 within this region as well as one residue near the MVC site D305 are not conserved in the TrpEb_2 subgroup Loss of intersubunit contacts in TrpEa TrpEb_2 systems The tryptophan synthase of S typhimurium is a rigorously documented example of substrate channeling in which indole generated as an intermediate is passed through an internalized tunnel 7 and references therein Ligand binding at the site and covalent transformations at the site accomplish mutually reinforcing overall allostery The movable COMM domain is comprised of residues G102 to G189 in S typhimurium TrpEb_2 COMM interacts with both the active site and with subunit loops 2 and 6 in response to allosteric signals Within the COMM domain of TrpEb_1 S178 participates in intersubunit signaling with G181 of TrpEa Competing allosteric conformations are mediated by alternative salt bridges between K167 of TrpEb_1 and D305 of TrpEb_1 on the one hand or between K167 of TrpEb_1 and D56 of TrpEa on the other When D305 of TrpEb_1 is not occupied with K167 it forms an alternative salt bridge with R141 as shown in Figure 5 As intersubunit signaling between TrpEb_2 and TrpEa is either lacking or involves different contacts one might expect the important catalytic residues but not the allosteric residues to be conserved in comparison of TrpEb_2 with TrpEb_1 This comparison is shown in Figure 5 Likewise in those TrpEa proteins that lack a TrpEb_1 partner instead being forced to function in concert with TrpEb_2 one might expect retention of catalytic residues but loss of allosteric residues This comparison is shown in Figure 6 Of the intersubunit signaling pair TrpEb_1 S178 TrpEa G181 S178 is not conserved within its own subfamily and equivalent residues seem to exist 26 It is however striking that G181 is invariant in all TrpEa proteins except for those belonging to the six archaeal lineages lacking TrpEb_1 It is even more striking that K167 which participates in the alternative or salt bridges is invariant in TrpEb_1 but absent in TrpEb_2 Likewise the salt bridge partner D305 is invariant in TrpEb_1 but absent in TrpEb_2 The salt bridge partner D56 in TrpEa is invariant except for the six archaeal lineages that lack TrpEb_1 Figure 5shows that TrpEb_2 sequences carry an insertion of 16 residues in the general region corresponding to the COMM domain of TrpEb_1 proteins Tryptophan gene organization in TrpEb_2 containing genomes The organization of tryptophan pathway genes in the ten archaeal genomes and six bacterial genomes that are thus far known to possess TrpEb_2 are displayed on a 16S rRNA tree in Figure 7 Pyrococcus horikoshii has lost the entire pathway and only trpEb_2 is present In Aquifex and Chlorobium all trp genes are dispersed and trpEa is not linked to either trpEb_1 or trpEb_2 In Bacteria and Archaea the gene order trpEb_1 trpEa is one of the most highly conserved of genomic gene arrangements Often translational coupling exists as seen in Figure 7for P furiosus P abyssi M thermoautotrophicum T volcanium Archaeoglobus fulgidus and T maritima In each of the latter genomes trpEb_2 is outside the trp operon Both species of Thermoplasma possess an otherwise intact trp operon that lacks trpEb_1 also not present elsewhere in the genome Hence by default it appears that the unlinked trpEb_2 must function for tryptophan biosynthesis in these organisms In A pernix and S solfataricus all of the trp genes are adjacent but trpEb_2 flanks trpEa and trpEb_1 is absent from these genomes In each case a second unlinked copy of trpEb_2 is present In Geobacter sulfurreducens both trpEa and trpEb_1 presumably partnered based on the results shown in Figure 4 are unlinked to one another and both are outside an otherwise intact trp operon In this case it seems curious indeed that the operon contains trpEb_2 A snapshot of the incredibly dynamic alteration of tryptophan gene organization in prokaryotes is apparent from Figure 7 Of the organisms shown in Figure 7 the most consistent linkage is that of trpAa and trpAb In A fulgidus trpD and trpB are fused whereas in Rhodopseudomonas palustris trpAa and trpAb are fused Operons are sometimes incomplete as with P aerophilum and G sulfurreducens or fragmented as with R palustris In A pernix an inverted arrangement yields a divergent transcription of trpEa trpEb_2 trpC trpD and trpB trpAa trpAb This is also one of the very few cases where the order is trpEa trpEb instead of the usual trpEb trpEa The Ferroplasma genome illustrates a case where a non tryptophan pathway gene aroA encoding DAHP synthase is a member of the operon translationally coupled The implied transcriptional control of DAHP synthase by L tryptophan potentially could produce growth inhibition by L tryptophan because of limitation of precursors needed for L phenylalanine and L tyrosine biosynthesis This is because no other genes encoding DAHP synthase appear to be present in the genome It would be interesting to know whether the Ferroplasma DAHP synthase is sensitive to allosteric control or not The phenomenon of growth inhibition triggered by exogenous amino acids is exemplified by the effect of exogenous L phenylalanine upon DAHP synthase in Neisseria gonorrhoeae 27 and in other organisms 27 and references therein What is the function of TrpEb_2 As previously discussed it seems clear that TrpEb_2 has sometimes been pressed into service with TrpEa to function as tryptophan synthase What might be its function in those situations where trpEb_2 is isolated away from a typical tryptophan operon which possesses closely linked or translationally coupled genes specifying trpEa and trpEb_1 TrpEb_1 from S typhimurium is the prototype member of a superfamily of pyridoxal phosphate PLP dependent enzymes that are of remote relationship and that catalyze replacement and elimination reactions 28 29 30 These include O acetylserine sulfhydrylase threonine deaminase threonine synthase cystathionine synthase 1 aminocyclopropane 1 carboxylate deaminase L serine dehydratase and D serine dehydratase Isolated TrpEb_1 does catalyze the reaction of L serine dehydratase deaminase in vitro but does not support significant levels of the other activities It does not seem likely that TrpEb_2 catalyzes the latter reactions either as Psi Blast of TrpEb_2 sequences did not return hits for them any more avidly than was the case for TrpEb_1 queries Perhaps the most likely alternative function of TrpEb_2 proteins is a catalytic activity already established as an in vitro activity of isolated TrpEb_1 of which there are two The L serine indole H 2 O L tryptophan reaction might function alone for tryptophan biosynthesis in cells that acquire indole from the environment Little information about the availability and utilization of indole in nature seems to exist Model organisms such as E coli and B subtilis transport indole poorly and it tends to be toxic but these organisms lack TrpEb_2 As stated above the second established in vitro activity of isolated TrpEb_1 dimers is L serine dehydratase deaminase L serine pyruvate ammonia It is indeed suggestive that the presence of TrpEb_2 correlates almost perfectly with the absence of the primary L serine deaminase COG1760 used in nature Table 3 This SdaA class of serine deaminase is an iron sulfur protein not a pyridoxal 5 phosphate protein 31 It is absent from the Archaea Although widely distributed in the Bacteria it is not present in Thermotoga Aquifex Chlorobium Geobacter and Rhodopseudomonas Mycobacterium smegmatis is the only TrpEb_2 containing organism to possess an SdaA homolog There are other candidates for carrying out the serine deaminase reaction A serine deaminase that is PLP dependent exists in eukaryotes but seems to be absent or rare in prokaryotes Threonine dehydratase has a lesser capability to carry out the serine dehydratase reaction in vitro Biosynthetic IlvA and catabolic TdcA threonine deaminase are homologs except that IlvA has a unique carboxy terminal extension that provides an allosteric module Most archaea lack ilvA and only a limited number possess catabolic threonine dehydratase If archaea lack ilvA what is the source of ketobutyrate for isoleucine biosynthesis It appears likely that ketobutyrate is generated instead by the pyruvate pathway in which citramalate is generated as the initial intermediate A few tracer studies in the older literature have indicated derivation of ketobutyrate from pyruvate rather than from threonine 32 33 and R citramalate synthase activity has been shown recently in M jannaschii MJ1392 34 This pathway was initially shown to exist in Leptospira 35 and it seems likely that more examples will surface Indeed it is interesting that an enteric bacterium has a latent potential to replace the threonine deaminase step with a pyruvate derived pathway under appropriate selective conditions 36 The citramalate pathway for conversion of pyruvate to 2 ketobutyrate involves a carbon chain elongation mechanism that uses an initial step of condensation with acetyl CoA followed by rearrangement oxidation and elimination of a carbon to produce a keto acid differing from the original substrate by the presence of an additional carbon This mechanism is familiar in nature analogous steps being used in the TCA cycle the ketoadipate pathway of lysine biosynthesis and in leucine biosynthesis These analogous steps in different pathways were originally used in formulating the recruitment hypothesis for evolutionary acquisition of new function 37 and it is interesting that the citramalate synthase gene shown in M jannaschii had previously been annotated as isopropylmalate synthase which catalyzes the initial step of leucine biosynthesis Overall the cumulative evidence indicates that established sources of L serine dehydratase are low or absent in organisms that possess TrpEb_2 and therefore points to a plausible role for TrpEb_2 as L serine dehydratase
