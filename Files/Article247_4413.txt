 Change Should Be Welcomed Well I am more than glad that Larry thinks that I have joined issues on the matter and have been able to penetrate this world notwithstanding my ivory tower libertarian credentials Indeed I think that his answer is so useful precisely because it does not rely on any private norms of the cyberspace community in dealing with the broader issues Substantively the question he poses at the outset of his letter is one that we should all answer Why is this space different from any other space Why and how will markets reduce freedom there In answering that question I will start again from the other side to make the case that the complications and issues that he sees in cyberspace are reflections of similar issues that have developed in other markets where the issue is the same How do we overlay private businesses of one sort or another on some common grid or infrastructure It is clear that architecture matters in both kinds of space and in pretty much the same kind of way As a first approximation we need to have public highways because it is simply too costly in ordinary space to build roads that stand one beside the other each limited to a certain group But the converse hardly follows from that observation There is no need for all roads to be public A large ranch can have lots of private highways for internal communication Common gated communities have roads that exclude the public by allowing limited entry by all members of this commons And if someone could acquire the land to build a private road beside a public one we should not begrudge him because he removes some traffic from the common infrastructure Now what happens if the cost of private roads really drops so that everyone can afford the right level of individualization The answer is that we get more private roads This is what has happened in the telephone industry The party line by which several families shared a single telephone line went the way of the dodo when the cost of technology allowed for cheaper phone lines to be developed And so it is on the Net The reduction in cost could easily allow the creation of private lines side by side with that open space and if we have these two regimes public and private operating side by side we can recognize it not only as a profound change in the Net but a welcome change that is predictable as a matter of general economic theory Larry is less sanguine about this because he thinks that the architecture of these private structures does more than make commerce more efficient It also makes control cheaper But here I can accept the descriptive conclusion but doubt whether he has pointed to a matter of concern It is as not as though when AT T starts its broadband system that it can compel me to join it There still remains the older public road for those who do not want to go along the private road The presence of AT T allows for more sorting in the marketplace which means that those people who care more about freedom can move in one direction with the legions of hackers and researchers while those who care more about security can migrate to a network that gives them protection against anything from advertisement to smut It is hard to see any systemwide threat to liberty when new technology increases the ability of all individuals to separate themselves from their fellow man and to filter out the information that they do not want It is not as though AT T is replacing the open Net It is giving an alternative avenue to it Larry then talks about the issue of anonymity and there again we have to look at both sides of the question Some people prize anonymous speech The Federalist Papers were written in that voice But no one prizes anonymous threats or thefts so the question is whether individuals will trade in liberty for security in the same fashion that Locke asked in dealing with the social contract Nor is there anything that says that the choice of anonymity or identification has to be made once and for all Credit card companies frequently collate data in ways that allow for targeted mailings by advertisers Most people welcome this because they know that the address can be used by an advertiser without being given to him The company prepares a list for third party use and guarantees that the names fit certain protocols Anyone who wants out can click a button to escape Here a good technology allows choices to be heavily individuated A technological and design issue that expands freedom in sensible ways It is not that the Net is architected as though it were an all or nothing issue It is the extent that any portal to the Net architects itself and gives notice of its deep structure to the rest of the world On a similar front several high school students at the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools designed a program that allows individuals to cover their tracks when they surf the Net Here again the private response to the systemwide structure helps improve matters Cookies are subject to the same analysis Let Netscape track me so long as they disclose what they are doing But I think that they would lose market share if they did not allow users to disable the system with a click of the mouse which I take it they do So again individuation works Taken as a whole then I see no reason for gloom that we have changed the Net as its user population changes Larry promises us that more is in store The older Net was end to end so that all the action was in the user applications That is fine in principle But what if the user wants to put his own private network at the end I see nothing wrong with this approach and it would allow Harvard to have as Larry notes a heavily regulated internal computer culture while the University of Chicago is more open a good reason for Larry to return to his intellectual home at Chicago But does the new network add on violate the old principle Not as far as I can see It is the gated community example all over The same open Net carries the same traffic as before It is not as though the size of the commons is diminished because of the subdivision on its side But what about AT T Let it build its own system so long as it does not shut down any other But now they want to make sure that they influence the traffic over the Net So they will get less for the service they supply and others will remain part time on the public highway Or if they have acquired too many direct competitors then we have a situation where there are possible earthbound antitrust issues a point on which I would be skeptical given the ease of entry through other portals on the Net Its power to discriminate could add value to consumers and if it does not it will become the Gandor Airport of the 21 st century Maybe now we have an explanation for the larger puzzle Why are cyber libertarians slow to recognize the dangers to the Net from the new set of uses My explanation is that of optimism itself I don t think there are dangers that are anything close to the enormous possibilities that are introduced by the enormous expansion of its use That one Net can support millions of Web sites dedicated to all sorts of different ends is a tribute to the original model of how private diversity can flourish on a public grid What is truly optimistic about the Net is the sense of ratios The amount of space that has to be kept public for all to gain access is relatively small compared with the amount of land that has to be used to maintain a coherent highway system So I quite agree that we should pay attention to these changes But I disagree that we should view them with suspicion The blurb on Larry s book speaks of it as a dark exhilarating work I see the cause of exhilaration but don t have Larry s dark forebodings So long as we keep our intellectual feet firmly on the ground we shall not lose our way in cyberspace Over to you Larry to explain why this happy estimation of the future is misguided and a gloomier response is warranted
