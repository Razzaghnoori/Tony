        okay lets talk about schooling     yeah uh what what what contacts do you have with uh public school system   okay well i have a boy and he just went into middle school early  and i have a girl and shes in uh grade school and then i have a little boy who goes to uh they have something just before kindergarten and its called Early Childhood and i have a young a young boy in that   oh okay umhum   so i i have a lot of children in in the school system down here   umhum   and um i think we have excellent teachers here i am really uh like the students like the way the teachers work with the students uh ive not been so um happy with the schools  themselves i guess like my last year my son and daughter were in the same grade school before he moved up to middle school and it was just packed   umhum   i mean it was a a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents     yeah   and it was just a real problem uh so we had to do a bond issue and and um vote to take money and either have students bussed to different schools if thats what the preferred to do or to uh work on the school work for another school to be built which is a good idea but in the meantime the school still has lots and lots of kids in it   yeah yeah   so um i think one thing is that would maybe we dont have enough schools and secondly when we have enough schools sometimes we cant get the the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers     well i think thats i think thats uh true i ive got a a little different uh contact but ive ive got a one son that graduated from high school last year and another son thats a   oh   a sophomore this year and uh my wife teaches kindergarten here in Richardson  ah but   uhhuh oh great   in general i i think that the you know one of the reasons that we we uh the choice to live in Richardson when we when we came here was the was the schools and i think that Plano and Richardson in terms of the uh uh things seriously wrong with the public schools are are not nearly to the extent that that   we see through the out the country name   and right right and i think and i think part of that is that is the the uh your big part of that is just uh the demographics the population in those schools are are typically uh people that very much value the education and support the the school systems and and uh   umhum i think thats right   although there is still some still some problems but uh i i you know i when when i was when i was going to school and i grew up in Iowa and and we in my family school was certainly valued but if there was ever any sort of a uh if ever if i was ever in trouble in school i was also in trouble at home and and even more so and i think that that part of it is is not   yeah   exactly with the schools but with the with the uh the culture that doesnt doesnt value the education and doesnt value the schools and doesnt support uh   the home yeah uh i think thats right   what the schools are are trying to do   it is so hard with a family system um either divorced or or just one parent or just   yeah thats true   uh like and then if both of them have to work even that is a a hard situation   umhum   for the children uh to to have a supportive system around them to make school work for them   umhum   and i think its really important that the parents work with the school um   yeah   i think what you said is is really a pinpoint though that the student and the family life really adds or detracts from whats happening in the school   yeah yeah   so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or  shes just ready   well uh she she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher she she has she has two half day classes so she has uh   oh i bet she does umhum   you know  on the order of twice as many students as as the teachers in the higher grades and uh uh   yeah right right   but her her background is in is in uh child development and and uh so forth and so kindergarten is as high as she as she wants to teach and shes shes teaching rather than something else because that that   uhhuh yeah   thats the jobs that are available and that the schedule matches uh you know with our kids and things like that so   right   yeah uh and but uh the
