 Background Prostaglandin E 2 is a major cyclooxygenase metabolite of arachidonic acid which exerts diverse effects on vascular smooth muscle tone and epithelial solute transport via G protein coupled receptors 1 2 At least four distinct G protein coupled PGE 2 receptors have been cloned the EP 1 EP 2 EP 3 and EP 4 1 Pharmacological studies suggest PGE 2 relaxes vascular smooth muscle through two of these receptors the EP 2 and EP 4 receptors which couple to cyclic AMP generation 3 In contrast PGE 2 constricts other vascular smooth muscle through EP 3 receptors which inhibit cAMP generation via G i or EP 1 receptors which increase Ca 2 mobilization 3 Although both EP 2 and EP 4 receptors relax smooth muscle EP 2 receptors are uniquely sensitive to the agonists butaprost and AH13205 3 4 Previous studies have shown that PGE 2 increases the cAMP concentration in many tissues including kidney intestine and uterus but the relative contribution of EP 2 versus EP 4 receptors to these effects is incompletely defined 5 6 Recent studies in mice with targeted disruption of these receptors have suggested an important role for EP2 receptor in regulating systemic hemodynamics Deficiency of the EP2 receptor is associated with a defect in counteracting vasopressor effect of PGE2 7 and the development of salt sensitive hypertension 8 suggesting a predominant normal vasodepressor role of EP2 receptor in blood pressure regulation The vasodepressor action of PGE2 may also play an important role in the kidney It has been previously shown that PGE2 not only directly dilates renal arteries 9 10 11 but also attenuates the AngII induced increase in renal vascular resistance 12 through inhibition of AngII elicited intracellular Ca increase in vascular smooth muscle cells of preglomerular vasculature 13 Based on the fact that PGE2 stimulates cAMP generation in freshly isolated preglomerular renal arterioles 14 the cAMP stimulating EP2 or EP4 receptor has been thought to mediate these effects of PGE2 on renal resistance vessels There is also evidence suggesting that intrarenal EP2 and EP4 receptor activates cAMP stimulated salt and water transport along the nephron 15 16 17 18 Although the localization of EP1 EP3 and EP4 has been determined in human kidney by in situ hybridization segmental distribution of cAMP coupled EP2 receptor along the nephron was not detected by this method 19 To more clearly define the physiologic role of this cAMP coupled EP receptor we cloned the rabbit EP 2 receptor characterized its pharmacology and signaling These studies also defined the tissue distribution with a focus on vascular intrarenal and reproductive localization of the rabbit EP2 receptor mRNA Results Receptor isolation Screening of 5 10 5plaques from a rabbit genomic library using a full length human cDNA for the EP 2 receptor resulted in isolation of two independent clones designated 4B1 13 kb and 6A 11 kb A 5 coding exon of EP 2 receptor was contained in clone 4B1 while a 3 coding exon was contained in clone 6A Sequence data indicated that the entire coding region was present in these two exons A potential translation initiation codon in the NotI BamHI fragment 3 kb of clone 4B1 starts an open reading frame that encodes a polypeptide sequence highly homologous to the first six transmembrane domains of the human EP2 receptor 20 The amino acid sequence of the open reading frame in the NotI fragment 6 kb of clone 6A was homologous to the seventh transmembrane domain TMD VII followed by a short C terminal tail and an in frame stop codon An intron with a donor and acceptor splice site was located following the coding region corresponding to the sixth transmembrane domain of the protein A functional cDNA clone was obtained by screening a rabbit uterus cDNA library using a 700 bp AvaII cDNA fragment from clone 4B1 Two types of positive overlapping clones 18A and REP 2 2 7 were isolated Of the 18 positive cDNA clones isolated 8 belonged to the type designated REP 2 18A and 10 clones belonged to the type designated REP2 2 7 Sequence analysis indicated that these two cDNAs possess an identical open reading frame and 1 664 bp of down stream 3 untranslated region 3 UTR however clone REP 2 18A possesses an 467 additional base pairs in the 3 UTR compared with REP2 2 7 It is also noted that there are 6 and 7 AUUUA motifs in 3 UTR of REP2 2 7 and REP2 18A respectively suggesting an instability of rabbit EP2 receptor mRNA in vivo Because both rabbit EP2 cDNA clones 18A and REP 2 2 7 lacked 50 codons corresponding to the 5 end of the human EP2 receptor and which were present in the rabbit genomic sequence a full length sequence of the rabbit EP 2 was constructed by ligating a SacII XhoI cDNA fragment nucleotide 340 1655 from the cDNA clone 18A with the upstream Hind III SacII fragment nucleotide 1 340 of the rabbit genomic clone This created an open reading frame of 1 083 base pairs with an in frame TGA stop codon The existence of this 5 UTR sequence in native cDNA was confirmed by RT PCR on RNA isolated from rabbit uterus data not shown The predicted polypeptide is comprised of 361 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 40 kDa Its hydrophobic profile reveals the presence of seven hydrophobic stretches characteristic of G protein coupled receptors 20 Fig 1 Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of rabbit EP 2 with human and mouse EP 2 shows 90 and 82 sequence identity respectively Fig 1 Ligand binding properties of the EP 2receptor The putative rabbit EP 2 receptor was pharmacologically characterized using membranes from COS 1 cells transiently transfected with a rabbit EP2 expression vector pcDNA3 REP 2 Membranes from EP 2 receptor transfected COS 1 cells exhibited saturable 3H PGE 2 binding with a dissociation constant of 19 1 1 7 nM and a maximum binding capacity B max of 2 8 pmol mg of membrane protein Radioligand binding studies were performed using various prostanoids and EP receptor subtype specific agonists to compete for PGE2 binding Competition binding experiments revealed a rank order affinity consistent with an EP receptor PGE 2 iloprost PGD 2 PGF 2 Fig 2A 3H PGE 2 binding was partially displaced by the EP 2 3 4 agonist misoprostol and was not displaced by the EP 1 3 agonist sulprostone Fig 2B Furthermore the EP 2 selective agonists butaprost free acid and AH13205 competed for 3H PGE 2 binding with K i values of 3 7 M and 3 4 M respectively suggesting this receptor is the rabbit EP 2 receptor 20 21 Signal transduction properties of the EP 2receptor Incubation of EP 2 transfected COS1 cells with butaprost free acid produced a concentration dependent increase in cAMP accumulation with an EC 50 of 480 nM Fig 3 Cells transfected with the vector alone demonstrated no significant increase in cAMP in response to butaprost free acid Tissue distribution of the rabbit EP 2receptor Solution hybridization RNase protection assays with a radiolabeled antisense EP 2 riboprobe resulted in a RNase resistant fragment of the appropriate size 322 bp Fig 4 EP 2 receptor mRNA was detected in several tissues including ileum spleen and liver Lower expression was found in kidney uterus lung heart liver adrenal gland brain urinary bladder and skeletal muscle Furthermore EP 2 receptor mRNA was detected by RNase protection assay in all blood vessels examined Fig 5 including arteries and veins of large and small caliber Fig 5A 5C and renal preglomerular vasculature Fig 5B The expression level of the EP 2 receptor mRNA in these vessels was comparable to that of the EP 4 receptor Fig 5 EP 2 receptor mRNA was also detected in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured from rabbit aorta Fig 6A Intrarenal localization of the rabbit EP2 receptor In situ hybridization was performed to examine the distribution of the EP 2 receptor gene expression in the kidney and uterus Sections of rabbit renal and uterine tissues were hybridized with the 35S labeled riboprobe from the same cDNA probe used in RNase protection assays As observed for the mouse EP 2 in the uterus a significant hybridization signal was detected mainly in the endometrial epithelium of the rabbit uterus with less expression in myometrium Fig 7 Consistent with previous observation in man 19 only a diffuse weak EP2 mRNA signal was detected in the rabbit kidney Figure 7 To further elucidate the distribution of EP2 receptor along the nephron nephron segments were dissected and expression of EP2 was determined using RT PCR As shown in figure 8 PCR products with expected sizes were obtained for both EP2 receptor 336 bp and GAPDH 411 bp Identity of the amplified products was confirmed by Southern hybridization not shown and sequencing As positive control RT PCR was performed using 1 g of total RNA isolated from rabbit spleen figure 8 As negative control PCR were also performed in the absence of reverse transcription without identifiable product indicating the origination of PCR products were from mRNA other than genomic DNA figure 8 EP2 receptor mRNA was easily detected in glomeruli and medullary collecting ducts MCD Detectable EP2 mRNA was also present in thin descending limbs of Henle tDL and cortical collecting ducts CCD In cultured cells RNase protection assay detected EP2 expression in renal medullary interstitial cells MICs while no signal was detected in cultured cortical collecting ducts or glomerular mesangial cells Fig 6B 6C EP2 mRNA was also detected in cultured rabbit aortic vascular smooth muscle cells Figure 6A Discussion The present studies describe the cloning and characterization of the rabbit EP 2 receptor With this information cDNA sequence for all four rabbit EP receptors is now available 22 23 24 Several similarities between the rabbit and mouse EP 2 receptors exist 5 21 The rabbit EP 2 genomic clone contains an intron with consensus splice donor and acceptor sites near the end of transmembrane domain TM VI The relative position of the intron to the coding regions is also identical to that found in the human TP the human and mouse DP and the human EP 1 gene 2 This provides further evidence that the prostanoid receptor family arose from a common ancestral gene The rabbit EP 2 gene contains a 1 083 bp open reading frame coding for a 361 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 39 919 Daltons Its amino acid profile reveals the presence of seven hydrophobic regions which likely represent transmembrane domains Unlike the TP and EP 3 receptors no alternative splicing in the EP 2 receptor was found in the coding region 21 25 Diversity of EP 2 mRNAs in the mouse was found in both the 5 UTR and the 3 UTR 21 Similar diversity in the 3 sequence of the rabbit EP 2 receptor cDNA clones isolated from the uterine library was observed in the present studies The significance of this mRNA splicing is not yet known but it might play a role in stability or translation efficiency of EP 2 transcripts 21 Ligand binding studies confirm that the rabbit EP2 receptor preferentially binds PGE 2 with significantly higher affinity than other endogenous prostanoids Its low affinity for PGD 2 PGF 2 iloprost misoprostol and sulprostone suggest it is not an EP 1 EP 3 or IP receptor 2 3 As demonstrated for the EP 2 receptor in other species 6 20 21 butaprost free acid and AH 13205 two synthetic PG agonists with selectivity for the EP 2 subtype efficiently and dose dependently compete for 3H PGE 2 binding to this newly cloned rabbit receptor Inhibition of PGE 2 binding to the rabbit EP 2 receptor by AH13205 is about 100 times greater than that to rabbit EP 4 in transfected COS 1 cells unpublished data Finally the EP 2 selective agonist butaprost free acid dose dependently stimulated cAMP generation in COS 1 cells transfected with the rabbit EP 2 receptor These results are in agreement with observations with human rat and mouse EP2 receptors 6 20 21 which also couple to cAMP generation Taken together these results clearly demonstrate that the pharmacology of this receptor corresponds to an EP 2 receptor rather than an EP 4 receptor The expression level of rabbit EP2 receptor mRNA is relatively low Nuclease protection analysis demonstrated rabbit EP 2 expression is highest in ileum liver and spleen with a lower expression in kidney uterus brain adrenal gland lung heart bladder stomach and skeletal muscle This mRNA expression pattern is similar to that of the EP 2 in the mouse 5 21 PGE 2 has been reported to stimulate cAMP formation in many tissues including intestine microdissected renal tubule segments and uterus via butaprost sensitive and insensitive receptors 14 26 27 28 29 The mRNA expression results are consistent with these functional studies and suggest that the EP 2 receptor plays important roles in mediating PGE2 stimulated cAMP generation in these tissues 14 21 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 The presence of the rabbit EP 2 receptor mRNA in the uterus also support a role for this receptor as an important mediator of PGE 2 action in this organ This is in agreement with previous studies which demonstrate that EP 2 is expressed and highly regulated in uterine luminal epithelium cells by ovarian steroids during the peri implantation period 5 21 34 35 The change in level of the EP 2 receptor expression in the uterus may contribute to the increase in G S protein content and cAMP concentration in mid gestation and the decrease at term 26 27 Because the EP 2 receptor is a G S coupled cAMP stimulating receptor the EP 2 receptor may participate in the physiological regulation of uterine relaxation during pregnancy and the transition into uterine contraction at the onset of the labor Lack of normal uterine EP 2 expression may also contribute to implantation defect reported in EP 2 mice 8 36 PGE 2 also plays a critical role in regulating systemic blood pressure 37 38 Although the receptor mediating the predominant vasodilator effect of PGE 2 remains only partially defined recent gene targeting studies suggest that the EP 2 receptor may be an important vasodilator in vivo 7 8 The rabbit ear artery has been used as a classic pharmacological model of an EP 2 responsive tissue while the rabbit jugular vein has been proposed to be an EP 4 bearing target tissue 3 4 39 however in the present studies EP 2 receptor mRNA was detected in both vessels EP 2 mRNA expression was also detected in the rabbit aorta and inferior vena cava thus providing further evidence that the EP 2 receptor is functionally expressed in both arteries and veins Expression of this G S coupled cAMP stimulating PGE 2 receptor in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from the aorta supports a direct role of the EP 2 receptor in mediating vascular relaxation PGE 2 has also been shown to stimulate cAMP formation in several renal tissues notably preglomerular microvasculature 14 renal glomeruli 40 thin descending limb 41 medullary and cortical thick ascending limb and collecting duct 29 42 Although EP 2 receptor mRNA expression was detected in the kidney and this was more pronounced in the renal cortex than in the medulla no specific regions of EP 2 receptor mRNA expression could be detected in rabbit kidney by in situ hybridization 19 Nonetheless low levels of EP 2 receptor mRNA expression were detected by RT PCR or RNase protection assay in nephron segments within the kidney including preglomerular vasculature glomeruli thin limbs of Henle s loop and collecting ducts The expression of EP2 receptor mRNA in medullary collecting duct is distinct from functional studies in the cortical collecting duct where butaprost had no functional effect 17 18 These data suggest a possible unique role for the EP2 receptor in the medullary collecting duct as opposed to cortical collecting duct Alternatively the PCR detection of EP2 receptor expression in these microdissected segments might result from the adherent renal interstitial cells other than collecting duct itself since nuclease protection analysis revealed a relatively high EP2 level in cultured intersitial cells but failed to detect EP2 expression in cultured collecting duct cells It is notable that glomeruli and collecting ducts are distinguished from other segments by high number of adherent cells Selective expression of the EP2 receptor in interstitial cells is consistent with a lack of segmental localization by in situ hybridization Whether the EP 2 receptor participates in PGE 2 stimulated cAMP generation in epithelial cells along the nephron awaits further investigation 14 42 Conclusions In summary we have cloned and expressed a butaprost sensitive rabbit PGE2 receptor that stimulates cAMP formation and is present in many rabbit tissues Physiological effects of PGE 2 through the EP 2 receptor may mediate important physiological actions in these tissues EP2 expression in uterus vasculature and the kidney suggests that this receptor may play important roles in the functions of reproductive system vascular tissues and interstitium of the kidney Materials
