 Background There is currently great interest in using extracellular signaling proteins to influence the gene expression program and differentiation of embryonic cells in particular embryonic stem cells Of the factors that contribute to specifying cell fate during development Wnt proteins are among the most attractive candidates to use in such in vitro experiments Wnt proteins control numerous aspects of development ranging from stem cell control to differentiation and cell polarity 1 2 It has been problematic however to test directly whether Wnt proteins can be used as reagents in cell culture because working with soluble Wnt proteins is difficult and few cell lines are known to respond to Wnt proteins Wnt signal transduction proceeds through a complex series of protein interactions initiated by binding of the Wnt protein to cell surface receptors Frizzled and LRP 3 4 5 which generates a signal to downstream components A key event in signaling is the regulation of the GSK3 protein kinase and its substrate catenin In the absence of a Wnt signal GSK3 phosphorylates catenin which then becomes targeted for degradation 6 The binding of Wnt to its receptors initiates a cascade of events that inhibit GSK3 and ultimately prevent degradation of catenin Together with the DNA binding protein TCF catenin activates expression of Wnt target genes In this work we have identified Wnt target genes using micro array technology Results Identifying Wnt targets on microarrays We tested human teratocarcinoma cells NCCIT cells for a Wnt response Despite the cancerous origin of these cells they share many properties with embryonic stem cells 7 These cells express several members of the Frizzled family including FZD7 one of the receptors for Wnt data not shown Figure 2A To stimulate the NCCIT cells with Wnt we used tissue culture medium containing active Wnt 3A protein produced by mouse L cells Wnt 3A CM 8 in comparison to control conditioned medium CCM In initial experiments we found that Wnt 3A protein elevates the levels of catenin 5 10 fold Figure 4 and that a transiently transfected TCF reporter construct is activated 3 4 fold not shown Cooperativity between Wnt 3A and BMP Several of the Wnt target genes had been identified previously as targets of BMP signaling 11 We were therefore interested in comparing the effects of BMP and Wnt 3A and examining their combined effects As has been reported before for other cells 11 MSX1 MSX2 and ID2 are elevated by BMP 4 in NCCIT cells Figure 3 When Wnt 3A and BMP 4 were combined gene expression was increased to yet higher levels MSX1 expression was markedly elevated by the combination of BMP 4 and Wnt 3A Similar but less dramatic effects were found for ID2 and MSX2 Figure 3 Hence BMP 4 and Wnt 3A appear to have an additive or perhaps synergistic effect on target gene expression However when the time courses of Wnt and BMP induced gene expression were compared it appeared that BMP 4 acts as soon as at 30 minutes but that Wnt takes 2 hours to have an effect Figure 3 Hence Wnt induced changes in gene expression are slower than BMP even on the same target genes and in the same cell type Wnt signaling is blocked by cycloheximide The delay in transcriptional response to soluble Wnt raised the concern that the genes we identified might not be primary targets of Wnt but dependent on the prior induction of other genes Such concerns are usually addressed by blocking protein synthesis in cells because the expression of primary target genes or so called immediate early genes should not be sensitive whereas secondary targets should be blocked This approach is not readily applicable to the Wnt response because the critical step in signal transduction is the block in catenin phosphorylation and degradation leading to the accumulation of newly synthesized catenin Whether Wnt target gene activation is cycloheximide sensitive has never been tested however When we incubated cells with cycloheximide the accumulation of catenin by Wnt 3A was blocked and Wnt targets like MSX2 were not elevated Figure 4 The inhibitory effect was also seen for MSX1 ID2 Follistatin Versican and Cyclin D1 not shown In contrast cycloheximide did not block induction of target genes by BMP Figure 4 the mechanism of which does not involve protein accumulation 12 These findings underscore the importance of catenin protein elevation in the response to Wnt This unique aspect of Wnt signaling may explain its relatively slow effects on target genes protein synthesis is slower than protein phosphorylation or other signal transduction events The requirement for protein synthesis in Wnt signaling means that we cannot use cycloheximide sensitivity as a criterion to discriminate between primary and secondary targets The Follistatin promoter is dependent on a TCF binding site In the Wnt target gene promoters that are functionally mapped MSX1 MSX2 ID2 ID3 Follistatin REST NRSF Versican we invariably found TCF binding sites Moreover we found that a luciferase reporter gene placed under the control of the Follistatin promoter was activated by Wnt 3A protein added to transiently transfected NCCIT cells Figure 5 Mutating the single TCF binding site on the Follistatin promoter eliminated the response These data suggest that Follistatin is activated directly through the Wnt signal transduction pathway and not by another pathway Because the kinetics of Follistatin activation by Wnt are similar to that of the other target genes Figure 2A we suggest that there are no earlier targets i e all identified targets are direct Discussion The overall pattern of gene expression observed in response to Wnt has important implications for the role of Wnt signaling in development and cancer Of particular interest are the ID MSX and REST NRSF genes Expression of each of these genes can interfere with differentiation of cells ID2 was recently shown also to be a target of activated catenin in colon carcinoma cells 13 It is a general inhibitor of the bHLH proteins such as MyoD and E12 E47 14 and can interact with the tumor suppressor RB1 15 MSX1 expression can revert differentiated myotubes into an undifferentiated state 16 REST NRSF is known to block neural differentiation by binding to and inhibiting the expression of neuronal genes 17 18 To what extent these genes are controlled by Wnt signaling in intact animals or in other cell types is not clear yet but we do note that MSX mutants have phenotypes similar to LEF TCF mutants 19 20 The MSX and ID genes are also activated by BMP 11 and we found indeed synergistic effects of Wnt plus BMP There are several examples of interactions between BMP and Wnt family members in vivo particularly in Drosophila 21 and this cross talk adds to the potential of these pathways for cell type specification However Wnt signaling also promotes the expression of such genes as Cyclin D1 22 and MYC 23 which are not elevated by BMP The ability to block differentiation and simultaneously promote cell division is a distinctive characteristic of Wnt signaling which could be instrumental in the role of Wnts as stem cell growth factors such as in the crypt of the colon and in carcinogenesis 2 24 25 Several of the Wnt targets genes encode components of the Wnt signaling transduction system The increased expression of TrCP slimb 26 and the ubiquitin conjugating enzyme Ubc4 5E2 Figure 1 both involved in degradation of catenin 27 could act as a negative feedback loop in Wnt signaling Moreover Frizzled receptors Versican and other proteoglycans which contribute to Wnt protein activity are also controlled by Wnt signaling as previously described in Drosophila 28 29 At the level of transcriptional regulation we found up regulation of CBP P300 which partners with catenin 30 31 but also TLE Groucho which is an inhibitor of TCF function 32 These responses suggest a rich system of homeostasis and feedback control mechanisms but they complicate the interpretation of experimental studies of Wnt signal transduction in which the time course of induction cannot be controlled easily The delayed response to Wnt signaling raises interesting developmental issues Timing of gene expression is very important during embryogenesis A slow response is likely to be an important feature of the activity of Wnts as morphogens when not only the concentration but also the duration of the stimulus is important In considering these issues it is of interest to note that in the early C elegans embryo Wnt signaling proceeds through a non canonical pathway through phosphorylation of the TCF homolog but not using the increase in catenin 33 Cell divisions and polarization in the worm embryo occur on a time scale of minutes and the different mechanism of Wnt signaling in that context may be more suitable than the inherently slower translation dependent catenin increase Conclusions We found that Wnt signaling can activate genes that promote stem cell fate and inhibit cellular differentiation and regulates a remarkable number of genes involved in its own signaling system The overall pattern of gene expression provides clues to the diverse functions of Wnt proteins in cancer cell fate decisions and other developmental events Methods Cells Mouse L cells secreting Wnt 3A were established in our lab by transfecting expression constructs in which the Wnt 3A cDNA 34 is driven by the PGK promoter In order to get cells secreting relatively high amounts of Wnt 3A we selected clones from the transfected cell population The tissue culture supernatant was added to NCCIT cells 7 Hybrizations and array experiments mRNA isolated from Wnt 3A exposed cells was reverse transcribed and labeled with Cy5 red and cDNA from CCM treated cells labeled with Cy3 green Samples from induced and control NCCIT cells were mixed and co hybridized to array slides containing 22 648 different human cDNAs representing 17 083 different Unigene clusters and including 7 230 characterized genes Hybridized arrays were imaged using a GenPix Axon scanner and data were analyzed by hierarchical clustering 35 Depletion of Wnt protein The medium was specifically depleted of Wnt 3A by adding an excess of a fusion protein containing the cysteine rich domain of the Frizzled2 receptor of Drosophila which binds to Wnt 3A protein and alkaline phosphatase 9 By adding antibody to alkaline phosphatase all of the detectable Wnt 3A protein could be removed from the medium In addition an antibody to Wnt 3A itself was used for depletion although it worked less efficiently than the Frizzled fusion protein Mutating the Follistatin promoter The Follistatin promoter 36 contains one putative TCF binding site CTTTGAT at position 223 to 217 from the start of transcription This site was mutated into CATCGAT which led to abrogation of the Wnt 3A response Authors contributions JW ME
