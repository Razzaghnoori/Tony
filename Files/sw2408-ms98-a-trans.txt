 do you have pets yeah i ve got uh three cats uh yeah me and my roommate have a little business on the side and we we breed uh cats yeah it s it s three cats i see oh really that s interesting what breed do you do you deal in well well just about anything we get our hands on right now we ve got a uh a Bombay a Turkish Van and a Himalayan Persian i see oh my and uh yeah they re a lot of fun and we re not in it as a business we just we like cats and we decided well if we re going to have them we might as well get some purebreds and maybe make a little money on the side um hum yeah um hum sure yeah yeah i ve never never done pets you know as a for breeding purposes i ve just you know usually always had a pet of some kind around we re at currently we have two cats i ve got a big old seventeen pound black male alley cat and i ve got a little seven pound tabby cat that we got from the Humane Society she s the cutest little thing then i have a twelve year old Dachshund that s gosh she s one of the family absolutely yeah yeah a friend of mine had a Dachshund and it s same way i mean yeah yeah she s twelve years old she pretty well you know sets the ground rules for the household yeah and the cats listen right yeah loves that s right loves the little dog loves to travel of course she s dead asleep before we get to the end of the block and she never you know she sleeps the whole time but she loves to travel cats of course don t care too much to travel uh one of mine does the Himalayan Persian the little himmy um hum if i take her to the vet i used to put her in her in a cage and take her down but now i just carry her out to the car and she crawls up in my uh up on my shoulder um hum right um hum um hum um hum and just watches everything yeah she she enjoys the car that s amazing yeah we ve never had a cat of course like i said i guess the only time i ve ever had a cat in the car has been in a carrier maybe maybe if we didn t put them in carriers maybe they would enjoy it more i don t know probably i think it s the carrier that scares them now on the other hand the Bombay hates the car she ll uh she probably so probably so um hum uh when i bring that cage out she knows what s going to happen it s probably i don t know maybe it s the maybe it s the thought about the vet that worries her um hum um hum could be yeah could be yeah that our little tabby cat is the only cat that i ve ever seen or had that she absolutely hates to be picked up she would rather just do anything than be picked up more normally you you know you can pick up a cat occasionally anyway she just absolutely hates it i don t know if it s um hum will will she crawl up in your lap yeah some of them some of them are like that they uh they yeah they they don t want to be held but but whenever they want to sit in your lap they want you to be uh open to that yeah yes she does that but she yeah um hum when she wants to of course um hum um hum um hum that s right yeah she does that that s true that s true yeah yeah the little Turkish Vans like that pick her up and boy those claws come out and sticks her arms straight out with the claws extended yeah yeah silly silly cat um hum yes um hum just tense yeah absolutely yeah we ve had our our two cats uh declawed because we keep them in the house all the time yeah well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot uh security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in um hum yeah but our black cat has never never once been outside and has no interest in going outside you can actually leave the door open he ll come to the door and sit down but he never goes outside yeah most mine generally stay in the windows they re they re um hum they love to watch the birds um yeah along the side one side of our house there s nothing but trees and bushes and we ve got lots of squirrels and birds and all that around here and they just they ll sit there in that window for hours watching all this um hum um hum um hum oh yeah they enjoy that um hum that s right just hypnotized yeah yeah and they ll go to the doors and stand up on the screen door looking out but uh they re not too interested in going outside i yeah yeah yeah our little cat just wants wants out maybe once a day that s about all yeah the Bombay uh actually went through one of the screens last week trying to get out uh so i had to go round her up hum hum um hum but uh yeah they re they re fun yeah my wife s a cat person until we married i d never really oh we d had a cat occasionally you know and left it outside most of the time we lived in kind of a rural area my wife s a real cat person one time not when we were together but at one time she had a total of like seventeen cats um hum um sounds like my next door neighbor yeah boy i try to keep her away from the Humane Society she always want to bring something home you know yeah oh that s my problem i ll go down to the uh SPCA or the Humane shelter and i i feel so sorry for them and i just want to i want to bring them all home um hum yeah that s what she does yeah that s right it s so pathetic to see them down there yes it really is i m just uh it irritates me the way people mistreat animals and and they don t do it intentionally they just they re just doing it they go out and they think oh wouldn t it be cute to get a kitty um hum um hum get a kitten yeah um hum and they go out and they don t have it fixed or anything and it has kittens and they can t support it and they take them down there and they end up getting that s right um hum that s right or move off and leave them or move off and leave them and they they end i don t know where this one the my next door neighbor had a had a dead cat next to his front porch yeah i d seen the cat around here before i thought it belonged to somebody but i have no idea what killed it um hum oh gosh um hum yeah good grief may have been poisoned or something it might have been might have gotten hold of something bad or it we had a cold snap here not too long ago it may have frozen out there i i sort of doubt it cats know how to take care of themselves yeah um hum could be could be um hum no not if they ve never been out in any weather i wouldn t think so especially yeah well this this one was definitely outdoor cat because i saw him all the time and i suspect somebody had just had him and moved off um hum yeah co uld be yeah that that s too bad it really is it is it s it s sad i mean and they do it to dogs absolutely yeah um hum the last dog i got i think was that way because he was uh he was in fairly good shape but apparently just didn t have a home or couldn t find his way home and i don t believe it because he was one smart dog strange mixture he was uh um hum um hum right um hum um hum the best i can figure he was part Lab because he had a Lab head um hum uh and definitely part Grayhound uh bloodhound because he had these head big old jowls had the bloodhound mouth but he had the soft bite of a Lab bloodhound yeah um hum um hum and he was the smartest dog i ve ever seen he just i could talk to him and he knew what i was saying yeah um hum yeah they they are smart they really are right next door or my neighbor across the street has a couple of Labs they re really nice dogs they really are um hum well my my brother raises my brother raises Labs and he gave one to uh he gave one to me several years ago i see um hum and she was she was just the sweetest little thing but they love to chew and so after she had chewed up my my redwood furniture um hum um hum yeah yes i ve seen that uh she chewed the corners off the picnic table and chewed cross members off chairs yes i ve had a German Shepherd that did that one time yeah oh i ended up getting her a six foot two by four and let and she had the best time with it um hum i bet she did she d grab that thing in the middle and it was just about as heavy as she was and she d drag that thing around the yard she was a sight to behold um hum um hum that was cheap entertainment wasn t it yeah it was it s so easy to entertain them it really is our kids are all grown and gone and away from home so our our new family is the you know our two cats and our dog we never really well we had we did have some time to devote to them you know but not nearly as much time as we have now so they ve really become children they re they re real characters they really well all of them are yeah yeah well they re enjoyable to to have around i i uh i run a little business out of the house here and uh i m usually alone oh yeah they are um hum um hum um hum and got all these cats around so they they keep me occupied well they um hum they keep you entertained they sure do we have a uh my wife s uh mother is uh oh about seventy seven i guess she really gets a thrill when we go over to see her and bring the dog i think she s more happy to see the dog than she is us i can t get it can t get her convinced that she really shouldn t try to feed my dog chocolate though she always wants to do a little Hershey Kisses you know you really shouldn t feed chocolate to a dog especially a small dog no no they they get get her a get her a box of doggy biscuits to to to let her feed him so i kind of have to watch her when she s around the dog yeah i guess so yeah some for some reason she just really thinks that little dog needs some chocolate of course the dog thinks so too well of course Dachshunds and Dachshunds like chocolate i i remember i remember that other one too he was always after somebody s chocolate bar they do as a matter of fact they do um hum um hum yeah they love it they really do my my cats don t think much of chocolate course they re so they re so damn finicky anyway no oh yeah absolutely it s i think they can read the price tag on the cans of food yeah well they do well it it we found out that didn t work because we even even bought the expensive stuff and they looked at it like you ve got to be kidding like you know what are you a fool paying that much money for this um hum yeah now i think i ve experienced my first cat here that will not eat tuna we have a cat that will not eat tuna um hum i ve got i ve i ve got one that won t doesn t even like anything with fish in it yeah that s strange um hum yeah actually actually you know fish is not their natural food that s that s the yeah i thought yeah that s true people i don t know why i guess the cartoons and everything people grow up believing cats like fish the only reason they go after fish in a fishbowl is because it s moving it s something something to play with um hum yeah that s right that s right yeah i believe this is the first cat that i ve ever had that would not even consider eating tuna i bet it likes chicken though oh yeah absolutely and even beef as a matter of fact in small quantities yeah every one of mine yeah yeah even mine love chicken when i get in when i yeah when i get in there to fry chicken or something they re all standing around waiting because they know they re going to get a piece um hum oh yeah they love love chicken um hum um hum that s right well Jeff it s been good talking to you i just i usually yeah okay well it s been fun you have a good day yeah yeah take care of those cats all right bye bye yeah thanks a lot bye bye
