 America s Bitchiest Debates Hmmm I see a way to kill two birds with one stone here UPN recently imprudently trimmed the word McNasty from the title of Shasta McNasty rendering it a naked Shasta Here s a way for them to boost their ratings repair their grievous show naming error and still save face Gore Bradley McNasty Smackdown I d watch Actually your point about the taunting in presidential debates brings up an interesting point There have never been any presidential candidates possessed of great wit Or even medium wit Even the best moments from presidential debates like Reagan s I paid for this microphone were transparently scripted well in advance More often the candidates throw around canned insults that were a written by ghostwriters and b aren t very good The best example of this that comes to mind is the clumsy taunt aimed at Dukakis Governor that answer was about as clear as Boston Harbor Ooooooh The closest we ve come to a great moment of unpremeditated nastiness during a debate was Lloyd Bentsen s You re no Jack Kennedy line and that has at least three caveats First it was during a vice presidential debate Second I m guessing that it probably was scripted well in advance but at least Bentsen had the ability to make it appear off the cuff And finally it was used on Quayle which is sort of like using a sledgehammer on a drugged baby seal I know that there are those who say politics have become too nasty and personalized that debates should be thoughtful discussions of policy issues And ideally I suppose that would be the case But it isn t Instead what we tend to get are safe silly bromides I believe America s best days are ahead of us the candidates say waiting for their opponents to jump up and scream Liar mixed in with ad hominem attacks So these being the state of affairs couldn t the debates at least be amusing Couldn t we get some ace script doctors in there to write bitchy scathing lines for our candidates Are Elaine May and Paul Rudnick really too busy to come up with bon mots for John McCain George Bush and finally I d support a massive tax cut for the middle class enabling us to continue our proud tradition of freedom in this great country of ours John McCain I heartily endorse Governor Bush s proposals They make a great deal of sense Beat If you ve been smoking crack that is You haven t have you George Lately I mean Now George I know you probably weren t paying much attention in college that was after all during your reckless youth which lasted until you were what 40 but a basic rule of economics is that you can t spend what you don t have Or to put this in terms you ll understand you ve got a 5 bill and you re trying to buy a dime bag Are you following me now Nod your head yes if you understand me Good boy Admit it You d be appalled for the country but you wouldn t be able to take your eyes off the set In other news the New York Post s Page Six reports that a movie produced by Roger Corman titled Fire in the Amazon has received an NC 17 for a nude scene featuring Sandra Bullock and Craig Sheffer American Psycho has also received an NC 17 also for a nude scene Two thoughts First when is the MPAA going to begin charging distribution companies extra for handing out NC 17s They are after all the single surest way for a movie to get reams of advance publicity and yet the MPAA doesn t make a dime off them The cost of taking out an ad proclaiming We ve got Sandra Bullock in a nude scene Hundreds of thousands The cost of having the MPAA announce it Practically nil Seems to me there should be some way for Jack Valenti to make some change off of this The second question is of course what Sandra Bullock is doing in a Roger Corman movie I m worried about her Speed 2 Hope Floats Forces of Nature Now this Should one of us call her make sure she s OK Tim
