cool are you serious they re awesome so uh let s see what else uh see like all we do here is like every time we walk in the room we turn on the TV oh really because we don t want to do anything like study or anything so all the all we do is turn like like when i was in high school i used to do like my homework in front of the TV set you know yeah that sucks really uh kind of annoying but that s cool what kind of annoying to like in front of TV like trying to do homework you know yeah trying to write an essay you start talking about you know like In Living Color or something i don t know well i i like i i just i just bogused on all my homework so it really didn t matter cool yeah BS that s the way to do it yeah i know and i did that all through college and it worked too cool yeah works for me so uh let s see what else like the news we don t watch because they re boring no unless i watched through the war you know there s only one yeah especially the war i mean it was like i haven t i seen this episode before you know i know i guess they think that people don t watch TV but i mean if you watch it like five minutes then it repeats the same thing over and over and over yeah i know it s like oh man and and in North Carolina see the the the thing is like here they just they just give you like local news okay like a house burned down in this little town and were here and i go so what happened worldwide you know yeah oh it s like you know even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else they re not going to tell you you know they re going to spend more time on doing a a thing on a on a cross guard who s a hundred and five years old than they are on anything else you know yeah so but uh let s see what else oh we watch like for example uh okay do you watch Star Trek uh i haven t seen it in years but i used to okay well i used to hate Star Trek yeah i thought i thought like when it like when i was like in high school and junior high school i used to hate it uh huh but then we started watching it and and like the new ones are pretty cool because because they got like uh like special like especially things that like fuck with your mind really oh really that s cool because what happened is like they have this hologram right where you walk in and you can program and everything looks real and you can touch everything and stuff but it s only a program and it s really great because sometimes it s like uh huh are you serious oh man the hologram makes up all these things and uh i mean sometimes sometimes it s funny sometimes it s not but uh you know it s something to pass the time until we do and then and then we watch football that s cool kind of like Pink Floyd or something uh yeah basketball s cool but football kind of after a while which basketball which basketball yeah i kind of like college better it s more spirited college or well we got we got two teams of the ACC going there oh yeah we got Duke and North Carolina cool but i mean the i mean there s nothing to do like for example yesterday uh huh uh they go some some girl goes do you dares want to go to a picnic right uh huh i hear no we re just you know it s like we just woke up we had a hangover and everything you know and so we just woke up and uh we re watching TV and i go no today we re just going to dedicate ourselves to watching golf golf yeah and bowling you know and everybody was like it was like oh God do you guys really watch that no you know i was like a whole golf tournament it s like for example baseball i hate baseball i mean oh me too somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes uh huh because by the play time is when the person when the pitcher pitches the ball and it goes to the catcher or when the when the pitcher pitches and it s hit yeah yeah okay and that takes like you know five seconds for the whole play that s true yeah that s true and that s it it i mean maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases you know but i mean it s it s like that i mean it s was it s just but when i went home that s all like they had on TV so i had to i watched entire games of baseball and they re going oh my God and TV in Argentina s really bad oh really oh really so so why from Argentina why d you come over here uh because um i wanted
