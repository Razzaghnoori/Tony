        anyway what are your what are your first comments on that subject   uh  my first comments on the budget i would say there has   what would you start cutting first what would be the first thing youd cut defense   surprisingly no i would i would cut the prison systems and let them selfsupport   mean private enterprise   hm   have private enterprise enterprise do it   you mean the prisons   uhhuh theyre already talking about it i mean theyre talking about um having it uh as a you know business uh to uh you know to so the you know the government doesnt have to deal with it   i hadnt heard that   but uh yeah because i think its all funded either state or federally funded so or uh obviously so   right   but um   but to me   but see theyre they dont have enough um um you know theres theres not enough room in these prisons and that and that uh to continue funding it they think they need to maybe have uh you know private you know business private enterprise come in so   well see the other way im thinking about is they should be selfsupporting like um the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons anything to where they can be selfsupporting within themselves in other words theyre in there for a purpose put them to work   umhum   rather than sitting there its the same thing like the whole criminal i shouldnt say criminal but the whole police department of the United States i feel the same way uh someone gets picked up for drunk driving he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there   umhum   so its self defense you know selfdefense on that point um as far as my defense budget uh theyre cutting it back now what twenty five percent i wouldnt want to see it cut any more than that   yeah   but again id like to see something on the other end back into education but not in the education we have today so im lost on that one i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems and to come up with something a little better than what weve got   umhum yeah its tough to to say what um you know what uh as far as this  that good or bad or what but uh i was just talking to somebody else and all those European countries they pay all the way through college and stuff like that they so uh   well not so much pay im not trying to see the government put out any more   no yeah i know what you are saying but im just saying that even the differences uh is that you know some countries pay for students to go to through college and etcetera but here it you know its just up to high school   yeah but see we dont even push the fact to the high school kids that theres other means of education out there rather than college to go either as an apprentice which they they do in other countries just doing this which i think would bring the education back up you know why not an apprentice out to a   humum   a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or you know just a technician you can learn on the job   umhum   which of course again which mean would mean again our education budget will go down if this is in a few years i mean its not going to be overnight   yeah   but that would come down   i think the program you know thats one reason uh you know we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board uh theyre not willing to you know to put that you know the training for only a certain amount so um its you know as far as the technical side but uh even like one one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff i mean they theyre trying to get more people into that field but they cant just bring somebody in without even having gone to you know school in that area before they can work you know for a lawyer as a paralegal   excuse me i see it being done i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever and shes training her   umhum well yeah i im well yeah i you know im assuming that it can be done uh my perspective is that you know ive been with a couple of big companies now and its like theyd are unwilling to put the time in you know they want somebody you know when they then when they bring them off bring them in that they have something you know a certain amount to contribute obviously theres uh uh you know theres a lot to learn uh after that but but uh thats true im im sure theres a lot of um you know businesses are small you know small businesses that could uh let me change my channel ive got a cordless phone let me see if that clears this up   is that better   yes  wow   okay and yeah it was a cordless phone and all of a sudden we had a bad uh frequency there or something so we had some interference so i changed that   yeah it sounded you were calling from around the world somewhere   anyway so um but uh you know i think uh   well   they maybe they need to uh help promote that more give incentives like uh if they do bring somebody on they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is you know for them to train people   umhum   you know stuff like that programs like that you know i dont know you know what kind of options theyve got   well thats something about what Germanys supposed to be doing something similar to that right now and uh they have jobs out on you know bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields but see that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people at people per at high school level   uhhuh   which i would like to see rather than so many kids getting out of school theyre they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around   umhum   because they dont have any education i dont mean college and im for college but theres a lot of people that dont want their higher education as far as quote quote college is concerned theyve had it   yeah i think i just heard something the other day it was like only it was either sixty percent or forty percent go to college and then out of that percentage only so many can get their degree   umhum   so i thought that was interesting but uh you know most people i knew have gone and got their degree so   oh yeah but theres a lot of them out there that havent   yeah well i just you know i uh was basic in a you know middle upper middle class area and   so thats   yeah so i think uh that demographic area there you know a lot of them do go on and they go to college etcetera   well it seems to me that kids that are get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it usually are your drop outs where if theyre said hey its just as advisable to go into something you enjoy and you like because you can get just as far as being a journeyman carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that make as much money and if they enjoy it more theyll make a lot happier life for themselves   yeah   question you threw that question on me about the deficit put it on your shoe now what would you do   well as  as far as the you know the deficit thats a whole nother uh my perception of the budget you know the government and they have so much to spend and theres not enough money to spread around but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries and that we have more money or goods you know more money going out and too many goods coming into this country you know  and um you know part of that problem i think is still you know uh like Japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country and and obviously the the demand for their goods is quite high here so they can get their goods in here and um you know to start even that out we need to continue to you know at least threaten that you know were going to give them higher tariffs etcetera to raise their prices to you know ours but um its just that uh theyre in i think youre youre going to find that just because the United States you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh uh the money you know money being spent and the goods flow in and we dont sell you know we dont uh sell products abroad as much as we bring in so   were you watching i think uh one of the news stations i couldnt even tell you which one i watched but they had on there where the the output from the United States was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting   humum
