 The European George Steiner has been writing his incandescent essays on high culture for nearly four decades now steadily deepening his insights and widening his topical reach but carrying on the same essential errand In earlier times he would have been one of Enlightenment s missionaries in our own he has come to be seen more as a guardian a defender of embattled humanism While Steiner has hewed to traditions and verities the world around him has been mutating Post structuralism has come and gone multiculturalism is exercising its liberations and tyrannies the computer has become the dominant tool of discourse And Steiner has been quietly gathering the authority of his intransigence No Passion Spent the latest of the critic s many studies and collections sends its root threads back to nearly every phase of his complex endeavor There are essays on all the familiar Steiner subjects translation tragedy the eclipse of humane culture the connection between language and ethics and Judaism and the Holocaust New if not unexpected subjects include Kierkegaard Simone Weil dreams the deaths of Socrates and Jesus and the phenomenology of Edmund Husserl Steiner opens the collection with The Uncommon Reader a tour de force meditation on Jean Sim on Chardin s painting Le Philosophe lisant which becomes through attentive reading of details his folio his hourglass his incised medallions his ready quill an emblem for the vanishing culture of book and reader Reading has always been for Steiner a quasi priestly activity As he writes in Real Presences the second essay Where we read truly where the experience is to be that of meaning we do so as if the text incarnates a real presence of significant being Chardin s reader in his solitary bearing his grave demeanor honors this most freighted obligation which can be construed as an obligation to being itself But the revolution brought on by computers by planetary electronic exchanges by cyber space and soon virtual reality as Steiner puts it in his introduction has all but brought this particular sense of presence to extinction He lets himself dream that there might arise schools of creative reading but he also knows that his dreams will remain just that For all his elegiac rumination though Steiner does not lack a polemicist s instinct for the intellectual or ideological hot spot He begins his attack with smaller provocations In A Reading Against Shakespeare for instance he uses Wittgenstein s stated reservations about the Bard to test some of our dearest assumptions about this mythic figure Without ever calling Shakespeare s linguistic greatness into question Steiner suggests an alternative requirement for true greatness that comprehended in the German term Dichter which carries certain lofty notions of witness and moral responsibility Steiner knows his Shakespeare and Shakespeare is no Dichter The work is too teeming too multiform it lacks the felt force of either the presence or absence of God Shakespeare gives us plenitude at the expense of ethics or higher spiritual aspiration The conclusion cagey teasing is one of Steiner s typically pregnant equivocations Plato he proclaims was wrong when he banished the poets Wittgentstein misreads Shakespeare Surely this must be so And yet The essay called Archives of Eden seeks to provoke on a larger scale Advancing example after example measuring reputations those of composers Roger Sessions and Elliott Carter say against those of Stravinsky and Schoenberg Steiner insists that America has produced very little that can stand up to the intellectual or artistic achievements of Europe The dominant apparatus of American high culture he writes is that of custody they make the art we build the museums If there is truth to the contention Steiner is persuasive when he compares various fields and finds that only architecture and modern dance those uniquely American triumphs exhibit signs of life his argument still feels more like animadversion than rigorous reflection If as Steiner claims the greatness of a culture rests upon traditions upon history then America must be found wanting In a dangerously cantilevered sentence of the kind that Steiner does at times resort to he asserts I t may well be that the ethnic demographic elements in the successive waves of American settlement are Darwinian negative that they embody the brilliant survival of an anti historical species where anti historianism would entail an abdication from those adaptive mechanisms of tragic intellectuality of ideological caring Kierkegaard s Heidegger s word Sorge which are indispensable to cultural creation of the first rank For the rest of us a translation What those tired and huddled masses that wash up on America s shores are tired of specifically is history The argument continues Steiner rears up to make his well known linkage between elite culture and eruptions of barbarism He notes that the correlations between extreme creativity and political justice are to a significant degree at least negative In this regard he argues the American choice for a leveling democracy makes abundant sense He ends by questioning whether the threat to thought and creation of the first rank lies in the apparatus of political repression or in a consensus of spiritual social values in which the television showing of Holocaust is interrupted every fourteen minutes by commercials in which gas oven sequences are interspersed and financed by ads for pantihose and deodorants His own answer maddeningly brief invokes Archimedes garden in Syracuse where the philosopher worked defiantly on his theorem even as barbarians clamored at the gates That garden may have been a counter Eden writes Steiner But it happens to be the one in which you and I must continue our labor My hunch is that it lies in Syracuse still Sicily that is rather than New York State This is all pure Steiner high toned and irritating vibrating with barely curtailed snobbism but also venturing hard queries and unpopular responses His views are calculatedly divisive Indeed it is hard to square one s indignation at being patronized with the nettlesome suspicion that he may be right Ours is not now nor is it ever likely to become a civilized culture in the European sense of the word Most of us God bless America couldn t care less This is Steiner s point precisely We long ago decided to ignore the poet s counsel and took the road more traveled We narrowed our intellectual horizons and flattened our discourse and more than ever we need a critic like Steiner to remind us of what a difference that choice has made Those who feel no sense of crisis about late modern life will nibble and scowl and drop the book with an impatient thump The rest of us will be piqued shamed outraged instructed and maybe perversely fortified
