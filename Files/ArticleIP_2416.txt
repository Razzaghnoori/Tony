                                 The Bell Curve Flattened            Charles Murray is apublicity genius and the publication of his and Richard Herrnsteins bookThe Bell Curve Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life  inthe fall of  was his masterpiece            Virtuallyall ambitious trade hardcover books are preceded by an edition of  to flimsy galley proofs These are sent out to people who might generate buzzfor the book blurbists bookers for television talk shows editors andmostimportantbook critics There is an ethos of letting the chips fall where theymay about the sending out of galleys Now the book will begin to receiveuncontrolled reaction For example back in  Murray somehow got hold ofthe galleys of my own last book and wrote me heatedly denying that he wasworking on a book about black genetic intellectual inferiority as I hadasserted I left the passage in but softened it            The Bell Curve was not circulated in galleys beforepublication The effect was first to increase the allure of the book Theremust be something really hot in there and second to ensure that no oneinclined to be skeptical would be able to weigh in at the moment ofpublication The people who had galley proofs were handpicked by Murray and hispublisher The ordinary routine of neutral reviewers having a month or two togo over the book with care did not occur Another handpicked group was flown toWashington at the expense of the American Enterprise Institute and given aweekendlong personal briefing on the books contents by Murray himselfHerrnstein had died very recently just before publication The result waswhat youd expect The first wave of publicity was either credulous or angrybut short on evidence because nobody had had time to digest and evaluate thebook carefully                           The Bell Curve isnt atypical work of trade nonfiction It is gotten up as a work of originalscholarly research Most works containing fresh regression analysis andhistorical argument from primary sources would be published in academicquarterlies that send manuscripts out for elaborate lengthy evaluation beforedeciding whether to publish them Herrnstein and Murray didnt do this so itwasnt until a full year or more after The Bell Curve was published thatthe leading experts on its subject had a chance to go through the underlyingdata with care Therefore as time went on the knowledgeability of the BellCurve discussion grew but the attention paid to that discussion inevitablyshrank            The debateon publication day was conducted in the mass media by people with noindependent ability to assess the book Over the next few months intellectualstook some pretty good shots at it in smaller publications like the NewRepublic and the New York Review of Books  It wasnt until late that the most damaging criticism of The Bell Curve began to appear intiny academic journals What follows is a brief summary of that last body ofwork The Bell Curve  it turns out is full of mistakes ranging fromsloppy reasoning to miscitations of sources to outright mathematical errorsUnsurprisingly all the mistakes are in the direction of supporting theauthors thesis            First a quick prcis of The Bell Curve IQ tests according to Murray and Herrnstein measure an essential humanquality general intelligence During the second half of the  thcentury this quality has risen to supreme importance because society hasbecome increasingly complex The intelligent have therefore gone through aninvisible migration from points of origin all over the class system to aconcentration at the top of business government and the professions They arelikely to become ever more dominant and prosperous The unintelligent arefalling further and further behind Because intelligence is substantiallyinherited nothing is likely to reverse this process Blacks areoverrepresented among the unintelligent Any efforts government might make toimprove the economic opportunities of poor people especially poor blackpeople are likely to fail because their poverty is so much the result ofinherited low intelligence About the best that can be done for these people isan effort to create a world of simple decent honorable toil for them            Herrnstein and Murray begin by telling us that the liberal position onIQnamely Intelligence is a bankrupt concepthas been discredited andthat a scholarly consensus has been reached around their position Thisconsensus is beyond significant technical dispute Thus by the end of theirintroduction they have arranged matters so that if intelligence has anymeaning at all the idiotic liberals stand discredited and meanwhileextremely broad claims for intelligence have the cover of consensus            The notion that IQ tests are completely useless neverprevailed in liberal academia to nearly the extent that Herrnstein and Murraysay A more accurate rendering of the liberal position would be that ratherthan a single general intelligence there are a handful of crucialandseparatemental abilities that none of these abilities is important enough toobviate the role of family background and education and that native abilityand economic success independent of native ability can be enhanced byimproving education training and public health The Bell Curve refersin passing to some of these points but on the whole it sets up a cartoonleftposition as its easy target Meanwhile the psychometricians who dominate thefootnotes of The Bell Curve are John Hunter Arthur Jensen Malcolm Reeand Frank Schmidt These men are well known within the field as representingits right wing not a mainstream consensus            The nextproblem with The Bell Curve s thesis is in the idea of the rise todominance of the cognitive elite To the books initial audience of IvyLeaguers this idea seemed valid on its face Everybody knows that the bestuniversities law firms hospitals investment banks and the State Departmentused to be run by preppies whose main virtue was fortunate birth and are nowopen to one and all on the basis of merit            But the larger premisethat intelligent peopleused to be scattered throughout the class structure and are now concentratedat the topis almost impossible to prove simply because the massadministration of mental tests is such a recent phenomenon High scorers onmental tests do bunch up as Herrnstein and Murray put it ineliteuniversity student bodies But this is tautological Any group selectedon the basis of scores on mental tests will be composed disproportionately ofpeople who score high on mental tests Proving The Bell Curve s thesiswould require proving that success increasingly correlates with IQ in areas oflife where mental tests are not the explicit gatekeepers To see howThe Bell Curve tries and fails to get around these inherent problemssee and             Havingconditioned its audience to view IQ as allimportant The Bell Curvethen manipulates statistics in a way that makes IQ look bigger and everythingelse smaller in determining Americans lifechances            The basic tool of statistical social science in generaland of The Bell Curve in particular is regression analysis a techniqueused to assign weights to various factors called independent variables indetermining a final outcome called the dependent variable The originalstatistical work in The Bell Curve consists of regression analyses on adatabase called the National Longitudinal Study of Youth The authors claim todemonstrate that high IQ is more predictive of economic success than any otherfactor and that low IQ is more predictive of poverty and social breakdownVirtually all the early commentators on The Bell Curve were unable toassess the merits of the regression analysis I am not a scientist I knownothing about psychometrics wrote Leon Wieseltier who was otherwise quitecritical in a typical disclaimer            But by now the statisticshave been gone over by professionals who have come up with different resultsThe key points of their critique of The Bell Curve are as follows            What Herrnstein and Murrayused to measure IQ is actually a measure of education as well as intelligenceAll the people tracked in the National Longitudinal Study of Youth took theArmed Forces Qualifying Test which Herrnstein and Murray treat as a goodmeasure of intelligence Because the material covered in the test includessubjects like trigonometry many academic critics of The Bell Curve haveobjected to its use as a measure only of IQ and not at all of academicachievement Herrnstein and Murray concede in the footnotes that scores tend torise with the subjects educationbut they seriously underestimate themagnitude of this rise as shows And they resist the obvious inference thatthe test scores are measuring something other than intelligence            Most of The BellCurve s analysis is devoted to proving that IQ has more predictive powerthan parental socioeconomic status But Herrnstein and Murrays method offiguring socioeconomic status seems designed to lowball its influence asexplains            Herrnstein and Murray begintheir discussion of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth data by announcingthat they arent going to analyze the effect of education because education istoo much a result of IQ Its not an independent variable Of courseaccording to their theory socioeconomic status is also a result of IQ butsomehow that doesnt stop them Therefore what youd most want to know froma policy standpointhow much education can increase opportunityisnt dealtwith in the book except in two obscure footnotes Both would seem to supportthe liberal proeducation position that Herrnstein and Murray say is futileOne footnote shows education increasing IQ year by year The other shows ahigher correlation between college degree and family income than between IQ andfamily income            One of The BellCurve s theoretical linchpins is the high heritability of IQ Herrnsteinand Murray sounding like the souls of caution write that half a century ofwork now amounting to hundreds of empirical and theoretical studies permits abroad conclusion that the genetic component of IQ is unlikely to be smallerthan  per cent or higher than  per cent  For purposes of thisdiscussion we will adopt a middling estimate of  per cent heritabilityThis now looks seriously overstated Michael Daniels Bernie Devlin andKathryn Roeder of Carnegie Mellon University took the same studies on whichHerrnstein and Murray based their estimate and subjected them to a computermetaanalysis a powerful method of statistical analysis The BellCurve  Their paper which has not yet been published says In briefstudies of IQ and our reanalyses of them suggest a narrowsense heritabilityof  per cent and a broadsense heritability of  per cent The differencebetween broad and narrow is too technical to explain in this limited spaceThis is a far cry from Herrnstein and Murrays maximum value of  per cent ortheir middling value of  per cent Consequently Herrnstein and Murray givethe impression that IQ is highly heritable but it is not            If the purpose of the wholeexercise is to figure out what our social policies should be then Which ismore predictive IQ or socioeconomic status isnt the essential questionanyway Making it the essential question avoids the issue of whether IQ isreally so massively predictive that it drowns out everything else Herrnsteinand Murray mostly leave the evidence for this their central contention tofootnotes The figures they offer are far from dispositive            Thechapter of The Bell Curve on policies that might be able to overcome thefate of a low IQ focuses mainly on whether earlychildhood programs like HeadStart most of which arent run with raising IQ as their primary goal canraise IQ significantly over the long term and sorrowfully concludes that theycant What the book doesnt discuss is whether public schoolsby far thebiggest government social programcan raise IQ or earnings after you controlfor IQ As James Heckman of the University of Chicago wrote in the Journalof Political Economy   Evidence of a genetic component to skills has nobearing on the efficacy of any social policy  The relevant issue is thecost effectiveness of the intervention As an example of where the kind ofanalysis Herrnstein and Murray didnt do can lead a new study by Jay Girottoand Paul Peterson of Harvard shows that students who raise their grades andtake harder courses can increase their IQ scores by an average of eight pointsduring the first three years of high school            At the beginning of The Bell Curve Herrnstein and Murray declare that the concept of intelligence has taken on amuch higher place in the pantheon of human virtues than it deserves And theyclaim that their view of IQ tests is squarely in the middle of the scientificroad They end by expressing the hope that we can be a society that makesgood on the fundamental promise of the American tradition the opportunity foreveryone not just the lucky ones to live a satisfying life ThroughoutHerrnstein and Murray consistently present themselves as fair or evenliberal minded technicians who have with great caution followed theevidence where it leadswhich unfortunately is to a few unassailable ifunpleasant scientific truths that it is their reluctant duty to report            In fact The BellCurve is a relentless brief for the conservative position in psychometricsand social policy For all its talk of reflecting a consensus the sources itdraws upon are heavily skewed to the right Herrnstein and Murray usedquasinutty studies that support their position as Charles Lane demonstratedin the New York Review of Books  and ignore mainstream studies thatcontradict it as Richard Nisbett showed in the New Republic  The datain The Bell Curve are consistently massaged to produce conservativeconclusions not once is a finding that contradicts the main thesis reported inthe text  shows how Herrnstein and Murray have made the convergence inblackwhite IQ scores which they claim to find encouraging look smallerthan it actually is The Bell Curve s air of strict scientism doesntpreclude the use of lightly sourced or unsourced assertions such as thestatement that the median IQ of all black Africans is  or thatintermarriage among people in the top few percentiles of intelligence may beincreasing far more rapidly than suspected no footnote Though they piouslyclaim not to be doing so Herrnstein and Murray leave readers with the distinctimpression that IQ is the cause of economic success and failure and thatgenetic difference explains the blackwhite IQ gap            In themost famous passage in The Republic  Plato describes an underground cavewhere people are held prisoner in chains unable to see anything but theshadows cast by figures passing outside they mistake the shadows for realityThe Republic is probably the first place in history where an idea likethat of Murray and Herrnsteins cognitive elite appears Plato believed thatthrough education people could leave the cave and be able to see the truthinstead of the shadows thus fitting themselves to become the wise rulers ofsociety But he was quick to insert a cautionary note Those who have left thecave might be tempted to think they can see perfectly clearly while actuallythey would be dazzled by excess of light The image applies to The BellCurve  Presented as an exact representation of reality in opposition tothe shadows of political correctness it actually reflects the blinkered visionof one part of the American elite It constantly tells these people that theyare naturally superior and offers lurid descriptions of aspects of nationallife that they know about only by rumor Readers who accept The BellCurve as toughminded and realistic and who assume that all criticism ofit is ignorant and ideologically motivated are not as far removed from Platoscave as they might think             DumbCollege Students             SmartRich People             Educationand IQ            Socioeconomic Status             BlackWhiteConvergence
