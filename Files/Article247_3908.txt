 The Etymology of Bumfuzzled Note Throughout this item whenever the word bumfuzzled appears in italics the italics are Chatterbox s not those of the source The lead story in today s New York Times quotes Bill Clinton saying that the Republican budget passed yesterday by the House which he intends to veto totally bumfuzzled American voters on the question of whether Social Security funds would be tapped for current spending Chatterbox doesn t much care whether Social Security funds are tapped for current spending but he knows the Republicans are making a big show of caring about that and therefore are being somewhat dishonest in pretending that they won t But what really interests Chatterbox is the president s use of the word bumfuzzled which Chatterbox has never heard before Here is precisely what Clinton said at an unrelated awards ceremony for blue ribbon schools at the Washington Hilton interestingly the transcription available on the White House Web site spells it bum fusseled which is incorrect Chatterbox here uses the text supplied by the Federal News Service which spelled bumfuzzled correctly T hey tried to say they weren t spending the Social Security surplus chuckles and tried to blame us with wanting to which is a miracle how they got that done Laughter And but you need to know and when you go back home people I can imagine the American people must be totally bumfuzzled keep announcing surpluses and we keep having budget fights That s what s going on here Chatterbox at first felt sure that bumfuzzled was a coinage of Clinton s like but more colorful than Warren Harding s coinage of normalcy The meaning Chatterbox suspected had to do with an intimate act sometimes performed in the shower rooms of correctional facilities In fact though it s a real word An Oct 4 Time article about Jim Morris a 35 year old rookie for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays quotes a baseball scout saying he was bumfuzzled when he saw Morris 98 mph fastball And a Sept 9 AP story quotes George Beason a member of the Alabama Space Science Exhibit Commission saying I m just bumfuzzled that the U S Space and Rocket Center in Huntsville Ala might be for sale Is bumfuzzled obscene Authoritative sources suggest it isn t The American Heritage dictionary says that bumfuzzle apparently used chiefly in the southern United States means to confuse and probably derives from some combination of bamboozle fuddle and fuzzy The Random House Unabridged dictionary says the term first came into use around 1900 and agrees with the American Heritage hypothesis about its derivation The Merriam Webster Unabridged says bumfuzzle is an alteration of English dialect dumfoozle and dumfound If there is an English link it s possible the link is somewhat racy Tim Weiner who wrote the Times piece wonders whether bumfuzzled has at least some associative link to the British slang term bumf a shortened version of bumfodder or toilet paper Bumf is defined in the New Shorter Oxford Dictionary as toilet paper worthless literature usually derog documents official papers Bumf would of course be an especially insulting way for Clinton to refer to the House Republicans budget and it does seem plausible that Clinton encountered the word when he was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford Weiner says he himself learned the term bumf from two friends who work at the Economist On reflection though this reading seems more entertaining than sound Chatterbox was curious to see how bumfuzzled was used in the traditional literature of the American South To that end Chatterbox searched the online collection at the University of North Carolina s Center for the Study of the American South and found two uses of the word The first was in Northern Georgia Sketches by Will Nathaniel Harben Harben was apparently a prot g of Joel Chandler Harris who wrote the Uncle Remus stories Northern Georgia Sketches is dedicated to Harris in grateful acknowledgement of the kindly encouragement which made this book possible Here is how bumfuzzled appears in Harben s book which was published in 1900 Well I ll be liter ly bumfuzzled he exclaimed Ef it ain t John Ericson I knowed yore company was in the fight last night an I thought o you when I heerd the grape shot a plinkin out thar But hang me ef you don t look sick ur half starved Sally give im some n t eat They don t feed the rebs much Johnny she s been a pinin fer you ever sence you enlisted an last night durin the fight she mighty nigh went distracted She Grandpa that s a lie cried the girl fiercely but there were pink spots in her cheeks as she retreated into the cabin and began to slam the pots and pans on the stone hearth The second reference to bumfuzzled was in History of the Life of Rev Wm Mack Lee Body Servant of General Robert E Lee Through the Civil War published in 1918 The Rev Lee a black man was Gen Lee s bodyguard and cook and one presumes slave The Rev Lee s book quotes at length a profile of himself that appeared in the Bedford Va Bulletin It is here that the word bumfuzzled appears Chatterbox will give the Rev Lee as quoted in the Bulletin s profoundly politically incorrect account the last word The onliest time that Marse Robert ever scolded me said William Mack Lee in de whole fo years dat I followed him through the wah was down in de Wilderness Seven Pines near Richmond I remembah dat day jes lak it was yestiday Hit was July the third 1863 Whilst we was in Petersburg Marse Robert had done got him a little black hen from a man and we named the little black hen Nellie

fo dem gemm n So I had to go out to de ambulants and cotch de little black hen Nellie There was a tear in William Mack Lee s voice but in his eye I fancied that I saw the happy light that always dances in the eyes of his race at the thought of a fowl for cooking I jes had to go out and cotch little Nellie I picked her good and stuffed her with breod stuffin mixed wid butter Nellie had been gwine wid us two years and I hated fer to lose her We had been gettin all our eggs from Nellie Well sir when I brung Nellie inter de commissary tent and set her fo Marse Robert he turned to me right
