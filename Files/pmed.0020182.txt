 Introduction More than 35 million HIV infected people live in developing countries with significant resource limitations Although 6 million people living in developing countries are in urgent need of antiretroviral therapy only 700 000 currently receive effective treatment 1 Global treatment efforts including the World Health Organization s 3 by 5 Initiative aim to extend therapy to several million people over the next few years 2 While the cost of antiretroviral medications has dropped considerably other obstacles including the cost technical and operational requirements of CD4 counts viral loads and other sophisticated diagnostic tests used to initiate and monitor HIV treatment remain to be addressed In particular measurements of CD4 T lymphocytes are essential for staging HIV infected patients determining their need for antiretroviral medications and monitoring the course of their infection 3 The CD4 count expressed in adults as the absolute number of CD4 cells per microliter of blood and in children as a percentage of total lymphocytes or total T lymphocytes has enormous prognostic and therapeutic implications and forms the basis for most HIV treatment decisions 4 6 In developed countries CD4 counts are typically performed every three to six months for each patient using the method of flow cytometry Flow cytometers use lasers to excite fluorescent antibody probes specific for CD4 and other cell surface markers to distinguish one type of lymphocyte from another Several factors including the cost of a flow cytometer which ranges from 30 000 to 150 000 technical and operational complexity the need for reliable electricity and the high cost of reagents have made these instruments impractical and or difficult to sustain in resource scarce settings The urgent need for affordable and technically simple CD4 diagnostics is widely recognized 7 11 Several efforts have been made to develop alternative affordable CD4 counting methods for resource poor settings Single purpose flow cytometers have been designed solely for counting CD4 cells such as the Becton Dickinson FACSCount the Partec CyFlow and desktop instruments from Guava and PointCare Technologies Although these newer versions make flow cytometry more affordable in some settings reagent costs remain high and the instruments remain expensive and in most cases technically complex 7 13 Low cost microbead separation of CD4 cells from other blood cells followed by standard manual cell counting techniques using a light microscope offers significantly lower reagent costs than flow cytometry These methods however are low throughput and extremely labor intensive and appear to be less accurate than traditional flow cytometry thus they have not been widely adopted 13 18 Less expensive CD4 counting methods that capitalize on low cost microfabrication efficient light sources and affordable microelectronics and digital imaging hardware have been conceptualized but never realized 19 20 One of us JTM has previously reported the development of a novel microchip based detection system for measuring analytes such as acids bases electrolytes and proteins in solution phase 21 23 This electronic taste chip ETC system carries out chemical and immunological reactions on microspheres positioned in the inverted pyramidal microchamber wells of a silicon or plastic microchip which is housed in a miniature flow cell Microfluidic channels deliver a series of small volume reagents and washes to the flow cell and hence to the chip and to each one of the microspheres Optical signals generated by the reactions on the microspheres are visualized and captured on a charge coupled device CCD with the use of transfer optics and a digital video chip Using the ETC system complex immunological assays such as the ones developed to quantify cardiac risk factors in serum can be performed with small sample volumes short analysis times and markedly reduced reagent costs 22 Further development of the ETC system has shown that it could be adapted to the detection of bacteria spores and living cells 24 We hypothesized that additional modifications could be made to provide accurate low cost CD4 counts to monitor HIV infection in resource constrained settings We show that a microchip based system can perform CD4 counts from 16 5 l of whole blood rapidly simply and with a high degree of accuracy compared to flow cytometry particularly for patients with CD4 counts below 500 cells l We suggest how this prototype system can be readily developed as a low cost portable device for use in resource poor settings Methods Flow Cell The ETC system was originally designed for microsphere based assays 21 23 The modified version of the flow cell see Figure 1 is enclosed within a three piece metal casing with a flat platform permanently affixed to a circular vertical support which is in turn connected to a screw on cap Within the metal casing there are top and bottom plastic inserts made from PMMA Fluids are introduced to and drained out of the flow cell through integrated stainless steel tubing within the inserts The bottom PMMA insert also features a plastic screen disc that acts as a support for a 3 m Nuclepore polycarbonate track etch filter Whatman Florham Park New Jersey United States which serves as a lymphocyte capture and red blood cell separation membrane A gasket between the membrane and the top insert prevents leaks and ensures that the entire sample is delivered into the flow cell and filtered through the membrane The top outlet is used with lateral flow for the removal of air bubbles Fluid Delivery System In initial studies we used a single peristaltic pump to deliver sample and washes to the flow cell Subsequently a partially automated fluid delivery system was developed This functional adaptation uses two miniature OEM peristaltic pumps each in conjunction with a pinch valve and 0 031 in 0 79 mm silicone tubing capable of delivering flow rates of 46 920 l min to the flow cell Integrated software LabVIEW National Instruments Austin Texas United States directs delivery of whole blood samples and washes to the flow cell using the appropriate pumps and valves Sample filtrate including red blood cells is captured in a waste reservoir Optical Station and Image Capture The flow cell was positioned on the stage of a modified BX2 Olympus Tokyo Japan compound microscope equipped with a 10 objective lens and a high pressure 100 W mercury burner arc lamp as a light source Focusing was maintained on a fixed plane throughout the duration of the assay Visualization of AlexaFluor 647 stained lymphocytes was achieved using a Cy5 filter cube 620 nm excitation 660 nm long pass beam splitter dichroic mirror and 700 nm emission while AlexaFluor 488 stained lymphocytes were visualized with a fluoroisothiocyanate FITC filter cube 480 nm excitation 505 nm long pass beam splitter dichroic mirror and 535 25 nm emission For each study participant images were obtained from each of five nonoverlapping regions of the lymphocyte capture membrane in the flow cell using a 12 bit CCD digital camera DVC Austin Texas United States mounted on the microscope Each imaged region represented 0 18 l of whole blood so that for each assay cells were counted from a total volume of 0 9 l of blood Each region was imaged serially with both filter cubes The corresponding images were stored separately as monochromatic eight bit images for subsequent digital image analysis and automated cell counting Image Analysis Images were analyzed using a custom algorithm supported by Image Pro Plus Media Cybernetics Silver Spring Maryland United States processing software An iterative approach allowed for flexible analysis of data acquired under different conditions of illumination focus and sampling For each iteration an upper and lower value defined a range of green or red intensities that were then used to segment the image Pixels whose intensity values fell within the defined range were reassigned values of one while all others were set to zero The process yielded a binary version of the original eight bit image A lymphocyte selection algorithm was then applied Objects i e lymphocytes were defined as contiguous groups of pixels with values of one Object selection was refined by a lymphocyte profile defined by size aspect ratio and uniformity objects not fitting the profile were not counted The number of counted objects was recorded for each iteration From one iteration to the next the upper and lower intensity limits used to segment the image were both increased by a single intensity count The final cell count per image was the maximum object count over 256 iterations upper intensity limits 1 255 for which the average object roundness fell below a threshold value In this manner the software algorithm determined the optimal analysis parameters for each image individually greatly relaxing the stringency of image capture requirements Cell counts were recorded in a spreadsheet as numbers of CD4 CD3 CD4 CD3 CD4 CD3 CD8 CD3 CD8 CD3 CD8 CD3 and CD4 CD8 cells depending on the combination of antibodies used Absolute CD4 counts were recorded as the summed number of CD4 CD3 cells counted over five images normalized per microliter of imaged blood CD4 CD8 ratios were recoded as the ratio of CD4 CD3 cells to CD8 CD3 cells counted over five images Relative CD4 abundance as a percentage of total T lymphocytes was recorded as 100 times the ratio of CD4 CD3 cells to total CD3 cells with cells counted over five images Lymphocyte Staining and Delivery Antibodies utilized in these studies were stored at 4 C and centrifuged to remove precipitated material prior to use This process ensured removal of fluorescent particulate matter that could be captured by the membrane and might interfere with imaging For the initial dilution control studies CD4 cells were purified by immunomagnetic separation from donor buffy coats CD4 cells labeled with AlexaFluor 488 conjugated anti CD4 antibodies A21335 clone 289 14120 Molecular Probes Eugene Oregon United States were introduced to the flow cell in amounts ranging from zero to 200 000 cells and washed with phosphate buffered saline PBS For whole blood studies 33 l of whole blood collected by venipuncture was incubated at ambient temperature 20 25 C with 3 l of AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 647 conjugated antibodies to CD4 and CD3 A21332 clone 289 13801 Molecular Probes respectively and allowed to react for 8 min Similarly for CD8 enumeration 33 l of whole blood with 3 l of AlexaFluor 488 and AlexaFluor 647 conjugated antibodies to CD8 A21340 clone 289 13804 Molecular Probes and CD3 respectively was allowed to react for 8 min at ambient temperature Stained blood samples were brought up to 1 000 l with PBS half of which was introduced directly into the flow cell representing 16 5 l of the original sample of blood and then washed with 1 ml of PBS Because red blood cells are mechanically separated from white blood cells red blood cell lysis is not necessary Images of labeled cells captured on the membrane were obtained and analyzed as described above For SEM scanning electron microscopy a fixative 2 paraformaldehyde 2 5 glutaraldehyde was added into the flow cell and rinsed with PBS The filter was removed from the flow cell fixed for 90 s with OsO 4 vapor and then dehydrated with EtOH HMDS The same SEM protocol was applied to a drop of whole blood on a glass slide Study Participants and Comparison to Flow Cytometry Blood was obtained from HIV 1 uninfected control participants and HIV infected participants at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston Massachusetts United States and from HIV infected participants at the Botswana Harvard AIDS Institute HIV Reference Laboratory in Gaborone Botswana The Botswana samples originated from a study of HIV infected pregnant women attending maternal child health clinics in Gaborone or three nearby villages Molepolole Mochudi and Lobatse Six infants were also included in the study Three milliliters of venous whole blood was collected from each participant in EDTA anticoagulant All samples were run on the microchip on the day of blood collection Parallel samples were processed using standard four color flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur using the MultiTEST reagents and TruCOUNT beads and analyzed using MultiSET software All samples were processed by flow cytometry according to standard operating procedure in the HIV reference laboratory in Botswana The majority were processed within 24 h of blood collection and all were processed and analyzed within 72 h of blood collection A total of 70 participants were enrolled including 64 adults and six infants Three adults did not have flow cytometry results available leaving 67 participants for analysis The study was approved by the institutional review boards of the participating institutions For a preliminary assessment of assay variability blood from a single study participant was assayed as described above 20 separate times over the course of a single afternoon by a single operator Statistical Methods The accuracy of the microchip based CD4 counting system was determined by comparing results directly to parallel samples processed by flow cytometry using Passing Bablok regression analysis and the Bland Altman methods comparisons approach 25 26 For assay reproducibility a coefficient of variance was calculated from 20 replicates of a single participant Data were analyzed and processed using Analyse It software Analyse It Software Leeds United Kingdom Results In initial experiments using the original ETC system 21 23 microspheres were coated with monoclonal antibodies to the lymphocyte surface markers CD3 CD4 or CD8 followed by microfluidic delivery of fluorescently labeled lymphocytes from whole blood obtained from non HIV infected participants Although lymphocytes were readily captured precise quantification of cell numbers and CD4 cell counts were not possible using the microsphere as a surface for lymphocyte capture data not shown We next modified the flow cells with a disposable microporous membrane filter for lymphocyte capture A single polycarbonate track etch membrane with 3 m pores was immobilized and secured within the flow cell creating a lymphocyte capture surface with a surface area of 80 mm 2 Whole blood samples were delivered to the flow cell from a sample reservoir tube and the membrane within the flow cell was washed with PBS from a second reservoir As in the original ETC system cells were imaged under fluorescence optics using a mercury arc lamp light source and a CCD camera Figure 1 To confirm that cells could be adequately captured 33 l of unprocessed whole blood from non HIV infected participants was incubated for 8 min with fluorophore conjugated anti CD4 antibodies and delivered by a peristaltic pump to the modified microfluidics chip Red blood cells passed readily through the pores under appropriate fluid flow conditions In contrast the majority of white blood cells were captured onto a single imaging focal plane Figure 2 This mechanical separation of autofluorescent red blood cells allows for the imaging and counting of white blood cells from unprocessed whole blood without additional sample processing such as centrifugation or red blood cell lysis Using the digital imaging system originally developed for microsphere based capture in the ETC system fluorescently labeled white blood cells can then be imaged directly on the chip and counted To assess the analytical validity of the membrane based microchip system we first performed a dilution control study to evaluate the correlation between total fluorescence intensity and the absolute number of purified CD4 cells from non HIV infected participants labeled with fluorophore conjugated anti CD4 antibody captured in the microchamber The results show a linear correlation between the number of cells in the sample and the intensity of light emitted from the membrane filter R 2 0 999 for a range of CD4 cell counts relevant to advanced HIV disease 0 200 CD4 cells l blood Figure 3 This dose response study established proof of the concept that a modified microfluidic flow cell and a digital image analysis system can accurately detect and measure populations of whole blood lymphocytes labeled with fluorescent markers We next quantified the percentages of CD3 CD4 and CD8 cells in whole blood samples from healthy control participants using this system Prior to delivery to the flow cell we labeled a 33 l whole blood sample with 3 l of fluorophore conjugated anti CD3 and anti CD4 antibodies for 8 min off chip then diluted the sample with 961 l of PBS and delivered 500 l of the resulting sample containing 16 5 l of blood to the flow cell using a fluidics controller Digital images from one region of the lymphocyte capture membrane were obtained with two different emission filters one specific for the AlexaFluor 488 conjugated antibody used to stain CD4 T lymphocytes green Figure 4A and the other specific for the AlexaFluor 647 conjugated antibody used to stain CD3 T lymphocytes red Figure 4B Automated digital merging of the two images and image processing allowed the system to distinguish the CD3 CD4 T lymphocytes of interest i e CD4 cells which appear yellow from the CD4 CD3 monocytes green and the CD3 CD4 T lymphocytes red Figure 4C We next developed a custom algorithm for translating these digital images into accurate CD4 and CD8 T cell counts using pixel analysis with the aid of a commercial image processing package Automated counting of the three subsets of cells was based on object size aspect ratio and uniformity iterated across the range of color intensity levels As shown in Figure 4D a binary mask first removes the unwanted cell types and residual objects representing CD4 T cells are counted A similar protocol was applied to a second aliquot of blood stained with AlexaFluor 647 conjugated CD3 specific antibody and AlexaFluor 488 conjugated CD8 specific antibody to visualize and count CD3 CD8 T lymphocytes In order to calculate an absolute CD4 count with standard flow cytometry one of two measures must be undertaken to calculate a concentration in cells per microliter Either a standardized reference reagent such as calibration beads at a known concentration can be added to the assay single platform flow cytometry or an absolute total lymphocyte count in cells per microliter can be obtained on a hematology analyzer dual platform flow cytometry The microchip assay we describe here uses a direct volumetric method and functions as a single platform approach By delivering a consistent volume of blood to the flow chamber 16 5 l of stained whole blood diluted to a total volume of 500 l of PBS and calculating the unit volume of blood per digital image 0 18 l we were able to count the total number of CD4 CD3 cells in 0 9 l of blood and determine the absolute CD4 count per microliter We next tested this rapid whole blood microchip assay in a series of samples acquired in an HIV reference laboratory in Botswana Seventy consecutive HIV infected participants presenting to the HIV reference laboratory for standard CD4 counting as part of a vertical transmission study were enrolled of whom 64 were adult women and six were infants Parallel samples were processed by standard four color flow cytometry on a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur The time from blood collection to complete analysis and results reporting using the chip based assay was approximately 15 min per sample Three adult participants did not have valid flow cytometry results available leaving 61 adults and six infants for analysis Representative processed data images from three participants two adult women and one infant are shown in Figure 5 Figure 5A shows a 31 y old woman with an absolute CD4 count by flow cytometry of 83 cells l While numerous CD3 T cells red are present as well as scattered monocytes green her low CD4 count is reflected in the few double labeled CD3 CD4 T cells yellow seen in the image Similar representative data images from a young woman with a CD4 count of 271 cells l by flow cytometry and a 5 mo old infant with a CD4 percentage of T lymphocytes of 0 39 by flow cytometry are also shown in Figure 5B and 5C respectively These images illustrate the dynamic range of the membrane capture and digital image analysis system including the ability to quantify both absolute CD4 counts and CD4 percentages We compared results from our microchip assay with results available from flow cytometry the latter obtained on a FACSCalibur through standard clinical laboratory operating procedures The data for adult absolute CD4 counts are plotted in the Bland Altman methods comparison plot shown in Figure 6 For 61 adult participants with CD4 counts ranging from 35 to 1 087 cells l mean 372 cells l by flow cytometry results show a good correlation between absolute CD4 counts measured by our microchip assay and those measured by flow cytometry Bland Altman methods comparison analysis shows a bias of 50 cells l 95 confidence interval 81 to 20 cells l and good 95 limits of agreement Figure 6 Several of the results from participants at the higher end of absolute CD4 counts fall outside the 95 limits For these participants individual lymphocytes may overlap in the digital images as seen in Figure 5C which can interfere with the accuracy of the lymphocyte counting algorithm In resource limited settings the primary use of CD4 counts is as a trigger to initiate antiretroviral therapy which typically occurs at a CD4 count of 200 cells l Higher CD4 count thresholds of 350 and 500 cells l are also used to increase the intensity of monitoring For these values the sensitivity and specificity of our method are CD4 250 sensitivity 0 86 specificity 0 81 CD4 350 sensitivity 0 97 specificity 0 83 and CD4 500 sensitivity 0 96 specificity 0 85 One important application of our method is in pediatric HIV monitoring The wide range of normal absolute CD4 counts in infants and children requires the use of CD4 CD8 ratios or CD4 percentages in pediatric infection Results for CD4 CD8 ratios and CD4 percentages of T lymphocytes for all 67 participants 61 adults and six infants are shown in Figure 7 Agreement bias and correlations between the microchip method and flow cytometry are excellent for both CD4 percentages of T lymphocytes Figure 7A and 7B and CD4 CD8 ratios Figure 7C and 7D Bland Altman plots for both CD4 percentages of T lymphocytes and CD4 CD8 ratios show low proportional bias with tight 95 limits of agreement Correlations are excellent for both CD4 percentages of T lymphocytes r 0 98 p 0 0001 and CD4 CD8 ratios r 0 98 p 0 0001 Overall the data show that all three approaches to measuring CD4 cell counts can be accurately quantified using the microchip method and that both adult and pediatric CD4 results can be obtained To determine assay variability we examined 20 replicate samples of blood from a single participant over the course of one day using the established basic protocol We determined that the coefficient of variance was 12 data not shown which is similar to other methods of CD4 counting 27 Although the assay described here introduced 16 5 l of blood into the system the actual volume of blood analyzed by digital image analysis is only 0 90 l We have conducted preliminary studies that suggest that we can accurately measure CD4 counts from less than 5 l of blood obtained via fingerstick data not shown additional studies will be required to assess the correlation between CD4 counts obtained by fingerstick and by venipuncture Discussion Our results provide proof of principle that low cost microfluidic structures combined with fluorescence imaging and digital image analysis can be successfully applied to the measurement of CD4 cell counts which are critical to the clinical management of HIV infection The method described here can deliver both absolute CD4 counts for adult monitoring and CD4 percentages or CD4 CD8 ratios for pediatric monitoring Most importantly the rapid and accurate CD4 assessments obtained with this method together with its anticipated low cost relative to flow cytometry may make this type of approach ideal for resource scarce settings As our results show this method may be less accurate at the higher range of CD4 counts where cells may be more likely to overlap in our digital images While this may limit its applicability our method is accurate at CD4 counts below 500 cells l which represent the clinically relevant CD4 levels in resource poor settings In addition both the bias in the method described here 50 cells and the accuracy at higher CD4 counts are likely to be improved significantly by the further development of a disposable microfluidic cartridge where the volume of distribution of the sample will be much smaller and more accurate volumetric control will be possible Our study was designed to evaluate the accuracy of our method against the gold standard in a population of adults During enrollment a small number of pediatric samples were made available to us by the staff at Princess Marina Hospital in Botswana We chose to include these samples in the data presented here to provide proof of principle that pediatric CD4 percentages can also be assessed with this method Although only six pediatric samples were available limiting claims of statistical significance we believe the issue of pediatric CD4 count monitoring to be of such importance that the data merited inclusion Excluding the six pediatric samples does not affect the analysis The results presented here were obtained with a stationary tabletop monitoring system using a standard epifluorescence microscope and commercial image processing software While the methods we described provide the basis for a highly portable and flexible miniaturized CD4 counting system it should be emphasized that a number of additional developments are required to enable the widespread use of this approach in resource limited settings With additional engineering of optics electronics and mechanical components along with advancements in integrated microfluidic systems it should be possible to develop a point of care instrument that is battery powered uses simple light emitting diodes LEDs and secures analyzable digital images with affordable video imaging chips When combined with an embedded microprocessor and disposable assay cartridges for both adult and pediatric monitoring manufactured from injection molded plastic it should be possible to create a functional CD4 counting device that can be used at the point of care Further trials in a larger more diverse cohort of patients including adult men and children will be necessary to confirm the accuracy of the method including an assessment of assay bias and reproducibility Such a device is currently in commercial development and may be available by early 2006 While it is too early to provide an accurate cost estimate for a portable instrument and disposable plastic CD4 assay we expect the equipment cost would be substantially lower than for flow cytometry and the assay cost would be similar to assays using existing methods Table 1 Although several CD4 counting systems are now used in resource limited settings they remain suboptimal to meet the needs of HIV care and treatment scale up None can truly be used at the point of care beyond a district hospital or similar facility and either the capital and operating costs remain high or throughput is low or both Table 1 Pediatric monitoring using CD4 percentages also remains largely unavailable The method we describe here addresses several of the limitations of performing diagnostic assays in resource limited settings First sample volumes are minimal so that tests can be performed on fingerstick samples of blood circumventing the need for venipuncture and minimizing both medical waste and operator exposure to biohazardous material Second reagent use is minimized in the microchip system reducing reagent costs by as much as 90 Third labor and equipment intensive sample preparation is eliminated Fourth the microchip CD4 assay is extremely rapid CD4 results in the prototype system described here are available in less than 15 min from the time of blood collection In a mature microfluidic device with push button operation results should be available in less than 10 min and thus can be used to make real time clinical decisions at the point of care Fifth the assay is technically simple analogous to a portable glucometer and ultimately will be useable by a health care worker in remote settings with minimal training extending the reach of CD4 assays to district hospitals and remote clinics and reducing labor costs Sixth both adult and pediatric monitoring are possible We believe that the future of low cost diagnostics for use in the developing world lies in the development of new lab on a chip technologies that integrate sample preparation and sample measurement systems into miniaturized devices with minimal power requirements Preliminary cost estimates for the instrumentation here described suggest at a minimum a 10 fold reduction in the cost for the associated measurement system Further reagent consumption for the microchip system can be reduced by a similar factor relative to flow cytometry while sample storage and shipping costs are expected to be reduced dramatically by virtue of the point of care capabilities of this new lab on a chip structure The importance of microtechnologies to the realities of laboratory infrastructure worldwide has been recognized previously 28 30 Although CD4 counting represents the most urgent need in HIV diagnostics for resource poor settings the microchip platform is adaptable to other important assays Through the interface of the lymphocyte capture membrane described here with the previously reported microchip arrays cellular assays like CD4 counts can be multiplexed with other molecular biomarker measurements i e proteins and nucleic acids on a single miniaturized chip The rapid extension of the chip based CD4 counting method described here to HIV RNA measurements diagnostics for opportunistic infections liver enzymes and other biochemical markers of interest in infectious disease is feasible
