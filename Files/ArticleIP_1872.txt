 Master P Master P a k a Percy Miller reigns as king of rap The 28 year old has two albums in Billboard s Top 100 Rappers on his No Limit record label have four more and he has just signed Snoop Dogg hip hop s biggest star to a recording contract Master P s new movie a blaxploitation comedy titled I Got the Hook Up which he wrote produced and stars in has already grossed 10 million far more than the 2 5 million he spent to make it His No Limit empire has been valued at 100 million Hip hop s leading magazines Vibe and the Source have run adoring cover stories about him and even the New York Times has anointed him rap s savviest mogul The Master P phenomenon is an object lesson in how far rap hasn t come as an art and how far it has come as a business First how far it hasn t come The hype about Master P has overlooked the banality of his music He is unapologetically ghetto He was a teen age hood in New Orleans his terrible autobiographical movie I m Bout It hints that he was a major crack house operator and he likes to say that his music is authentic Namely It celebrates the thug life of drugs violence and general sociopathic idiocy Every man is a nigga every woman a bitch and all and sundry are motherfuckas The title track of his 1997 triple platinum album Ghetto D is a recipe for making crack from cocaine Master P hits all the clich s of gangster rap the elegy honoring murdered homeboys the chronicle of his rise through the drug dealing ranks the tribute to marijuana the paean to his gun The rhymes are crude though the beats are potent as in this clip of his trademark groan unghh The artists on his label Kane Abel Fiend Silkk the Shocker C Murder Mac Mia X etc hew to the same gangster themes Master P s marketing does too No Limit album covers are heavy on guns bikinied women gold jewelry wads of cash and No Limit s logo a gold and diamond encrusted tank Master P in short promotes and produces the same socially appalling if aurally appealing kind of rap that had parents and William Bennett predicting the end of civilization five years ago Back then Master P would have sparked public outcry and condemnation Why doesn t he today Why is there no hue and cry about this monster Gangster rap was supposed to be a minor perversion a sick dead end It was supposed to have been killed by now murdered by public backlash or by the resurgence of R B or by its own fratricidal strife But instead of dying gangster rap has been institutionalized thanks to Master P as well as Tupac Shakur and others It has become clich Familiarity has bred indifference No Limit s music does not outrage because it does not surprise Master P is and I mean this in the best possible way a hack He sticks to the conventions of the genre and produces derivative competent music Even his admirers admit he breaks no new ground and is essentially a skilled imitator of more innovative artists But hackdom I would argue may be the proof of a genre s maturity Motown spawned zillions of copycat acts and grunge joined the mainstream when Nirvana rip offs began winning gold records Master P too represents the mainstreaming of a once outrageous art There is another reason why Master P doesn t prompt any outrage the glorification of the entrepreneur No one pays attention to what he sells because everyone is so fascinated by how he sells it Rap has always been a commercial affair and there is a long history of hip hop entrepreneurs Def Jam s Russell Simmons and Rick Rubin Death Row s Suge Knight Bad Boy s Puff Daddy Master P s chief rival to name a few but there may not have been anyone with better business instincts than Master P In six years he has turned a tiny California record store into a multimedia empire The No 1 lesson of the Master P school of management ownership Musicians have been getting ripped off by their record companies as long as there have been record companies Master P wouldn t permit that to happen to him He is the most independent of the independent producers He started selling records out of his own car and he hasn t relinquished control of anything yet He owns his master recordings his studio his label By paying the production costs of I Got the Hook Up out of his own pocket and retaining ownership of it he stands to make at least twice as much as he would have if he had taken Miramax s 5 million offer to buy it outright This is a business where everyone has a 400 an hour attorney negotiating for them You have to admire P for doing all this on his own putting the records and movies out himself and turning it into a nine figure company says rap legend Bill Stephney CEO of StepSun Music The other guiding principles of the Master P operation are volume and speed What Roger Corman is to movies he is to rap No Limit CDs usually include 20 songs nearly twice as many as other hip hop CDs He sells double albums at single album prices He works fast producing his latest straight to video movie Da Last Don in 10 days and he records albums in even less time Everything is branded and tied together All No Limit albums advertise coming albums by other No Limit artists He makes movies in order to sell soundtracks The cross marketing works No Limit CDs advertised months in advance inside other No Limit CDs sell hundreds of thousands of copies in their first week in record stores No single Master P product is phenomenally successful but there are lots of them and all are profitable It adds up He has taken his vast fortune and diversified He runs a sports management company a shoe store a gas station a clothing line and a phone sex firm The do it yourself bootstrapping ethos is admirable but Master P also represents something more atavistic He sometimes refers to his enterprise as the No Limit family If it s a family it s more like the Corleones than the Cleavers Master P was a hood and a hustler and even as a corporate man he behaves like a hood and a hustler He models No Limit on the mob not the Fortune 500 He calls his artists No Limit Soldiers Some of them are named after mobsters Gambino Family Goodfellas Li l Gotti Master P values loyalty and friendship above all Most of his performers are relatives or homeboys The hip hop industry is concentrated in Los Angeles and New York but he and the No Limit posse occupy a compound in Baton Rouge La They are well armed and wear bulletproof vests And they don t welcome outsiders This may not be the best foundation for a durable business empire Simmons probably rap s greatest entrepreneur lives in New York schmoozes bankers fashion designers and record executives and cuts deals with conglomerates such as Time Warner He is sophisticated urbane wise to capital flows and big business Master P by contrast seems to be following in the footsteps of Knight founder of Death Row Records In the early 90s Knight built Death Row into a phenomenally profitable rap label even bigger than No Limit is now Suge too imitated mob style valuing loyalty and insularity over all surrounding himself with thuggish cronies Death Row was run more like a criminal operation than a real business with huge suspicious cash payments shoddy accounting and management by intimidation Eventually Death Row collapsed Star rapper Shakur was murdered and Knight went to jail Master P has avoided such chaos so far But can he forever If he abandons his mob pose and posse he abandons the image and the authenticity that made him a millionaire If he doesn t he could end up like Knight For Master P neither is an appealing prospect
