 Sad Sack Superman Like Hermann Hesse s Steppenwolf and anything by Antonin Artaud Frederick Exley s A Fan s Notes is one of those books that gets pushed on you by crazy people I was in Munich in the early 1980s widening my horizons on a Eurailpass when it was pushed on me An aging beatnik with a ragged knapsack plunked down next to me in the Haufbrauhaus and started raving about the book of books He brought out a tattered paperback and thrust it at me insisting that the volume was too important not to be passed on When I asked the man what A Fan s Notes was about I expected an answer profound and mystical instead he fixed his bright eyes on me and said Frank Gifford It s all about this guy who loves Frank Gifford A Fan s Notes which is being canonized this month in a Modern Library edition and whose author is the subject of a new biography by Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley is actually more of a memoir than a novel and is only incidentally about the former New York Giants halfback Frank Gifford First published in 1968 the book has been kept alive by zealous readers who feel compelled to promote it Amway style to everyone they meet Read a chapter or two and you ll know why Written by a self pitying autodidact for consumption by self pitying autodidacts A Fan s Notes divides the world into two camps tortured bewildered misfits Exleys and serene fair haired conformists Giffords In America Exley implies indeed he shouts it a person is either a suffering poet or a cheerful drone I m in pain you re in pain It s the classic invitation of the memoirist the ploy that teams reader and writer against the world and it s also the classic lament of the barroom which is where Exley s painful story opens While watching a televised Giants game indulging his overweening passion for football he collapses from alcoholic exhaustion The breakdown occasions a jigsaw of memories of an upstate New York boyhood dominated by a local hero dad of doomed attempts to make it in the straight world of Manhattan advertising of romantic humiliations at the hands of perky centerfold blondes and finally of dreamlike interludes in sadistic mental hospitals Where have all the anti heroes gone Literary dementia seems dated now but there was a time when a month in the funny farm was as de rigueur for budding writers as an MFA is now To be sent away was a badge of honor to undergo electroshock a glorious martyrdom Was I too insane Exley asks when he s committed It was a difficult admission to make but I am glad that I made it later I came to believe that this admission about oneself may be the only redemption in America This notion was once a staple of big novels see Catch 22 or One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest and Exley plays it for all it is worth ennobling himself through nausea A rosy cheeked suburban family seated next to him at a football game makes him want to cut my jugular When he falls in love with a beautiful Midwestern girl her milk flecked with butter complexion renders him impotent Exley is so over rich in his descriptions of all things wholesome and American that his disgust is infectious His prose is moist with lyrical revulsion Autumn days are blinding in their goldenness pretty girls suffocating in their softness young executives crucifying in their crispness Exley as sensitive as a rotten tooth can bear the world in the smallest doses only and any extended period of consciousness forces him back to the bar the hospital In one chapter Journey on a Davenport he tucks himself in on his mother s couch and goes on a sort of existential sit down strike In a land where movement is virtue where the echo of heels clicking rapidly on pavement is inordinately blest it is a grand defiant and edifying gesture to lie down for six months Exley s self loathing is really self love His is an Olympian degradation His voice on the page is a rummy baritone fat and resonant but capable of a cruel exactitude as when he describes a girlfriend s melting love for him T here came a point when Bunny had a kind of terrifyingly loose and constant moistness the kind of totally loose submission one detects in a woman he has impregnated the moist eyes the warm moist hands the loose moist breasts beneath the cotton blouse At other times Exley s smoky eloquence turns blowsy and verbose Thus it was that the days of my youth flew by like violently clashing confetti Exley writes in short like what he was a middle aged unpublished novelist tuning up to write his magnum opus just as soon as he finishes one more drink The amazing thing is that Exley s postponement of his great work inspired a great work about postponement a portrait of the artist as procrastinator The drunken bore of A Fan s Notes is never boring He s vibrant with resentment alive with failure a sad sack superman When he gazes up from his stool at fleet Frank Gifford catching a touchdown pass it s a transporting thrill a brief ascension Exley found consolations in his sloth among them an awe of physical transcendence His talent for disgust and mockery was saved by a paradoxical gift for praise Exley s life of splendid indigence didn t change when his book met with wide acclaim According to Jonathan Yardley s Misfit Exley didn t become rich just somewhat famous though this was enough to turn his alienation into an act a tiresome self caricature From the bar of Greenwich Village s Lion s Head pub where he reigned as a sort of rumpled deadbeat Buddha he attracted a circle of seedy admirers who kept him in cold beer and pocket change in return for recycled embellished anecdotes concerning his hard luck youth and years of wandering He hectored friends and publishers for money repaid people s love for him with cold neglect and followed up on A Fan s Notes with two sequels neither of which the critics deemed interesting In Yardley s affectionate yet dubious portrait of a man he knew only through rambling late night phone calls Exley was a classic one hit wonder a writer who never overcame his breakthrough The wonder of course is that Exley broke through at all Yardley s book does little to solve the mystery of how a man with no apparent self discipline minimal formal training and colossally self destructive habits managed to write a contemporary classic on his first go round To make the job of reconstruction harder Exley wrote few letters rarely lived long at one address and wasn t given to intimate conversation When he died of a stroke in 1992 too early to see his adored Frank Gifford dragged from an athletic state of grace into the oily tabloid muck he left behind no significant paper trail other than the memoirs that made his name Yardley hunts in their margins for clues to Exley s inner life with modest results He concludes on the basis of a few short passages that Exley was strangely obsessed with oral sex On even less evidence he speculates that Exley may have had homosexual leanings to which readers may feel entitled to ask Doesn t everyone Yardley s conclusions don t add up to much in any conventional biographical sense and he admits as much in his prologue Exley lived on another planet if not in another universe Still Yardley s book has value as a study of just how small and brief and enigmatic certain writers lives can be once you ve subtracted their work from the equation Exley put all he had into his books and what he had besides his talent was shockingly little a troubled heart a bottle an affection for the home team and a cacophony of chemical imbalances It s no wonder that crazy people love him Exley did more with less than any writer I can think of His failure will endure
