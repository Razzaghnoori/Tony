 Thanksgiving I was hanging out with my friends on a Friday night OK to give you a little background You know we just went to the movies or whatever and then the next night I went to work I was working at a nursing home I was washing dishes and cleaning pots and pans and stuff like that So and then all of a sudden I got this massive fever Which you know when you get a fever you don t realize you have a fever at the time especially when you re that age because you don t know exactly what the symptoms are Right But I felt like crap I was aching all over and it just hit me like that Within five or 10 minutes I just felt terrible So then I called my mother to pick me up I had driven there but she had to come pick me up that s how bad I was You couldn t drive I couldn t even drive I was that sick but within a half an hour I would say that was So she took me home And uh while she was taking me home I got this pounding headache I felt like somebody was hitting me in the head with a rubber mallet You know just a thud like this thud thud thud maybe a little slower than that But it hurt So she took me home I went to the doctor the next day was Sunday morning and I was in bad shape I was terrible I was just like half conscious just in a lot of pain Well actually I was fully conscious but I was just in a lot of pain So I looked really weird So I go into the doctor s office you know back in high school days I thought it was cool I had the black leather jacket and all that The long hair Fonzie No I had long hair didn t look exactly like Fonzie It was the heavy metal thing Uh so he asked what drugs I m on you know what I had O D d on Nothing nothing trying to tell him I was just sick So he examines me and all that sends me home with my mother and he had given her instructions on what to do if anything happened to me So as it turns out something happened to me I lying in bed I passed out while I was lying in bed I fell out of bed or something I think my parents heard me hit the floor So they come in so my father and my sister take me to the hospital So did the doctor know what was wrong with you He had an idea what was wrong with me but he didn t want to tell my parents because he didn t want to get them in a total panic Oh OK Ah So they take me to the hospital and I bang my head a couple of times on the way there I bang my head on the car door I don t remember any of this No wonder no wonder you felt like a mallet was hitting you Yes And I don t remember any of this The last thing I remember was you know being sick Sunday morning After I got home from the doctor s I don t really remember anything after that So you know I hit my head on the car door My sister told me that at the time that I let out a huge scream which I don t remember And I remember while my mother was driving me around every time she would hit a bump you know that was like the mallet would ah increase the pain level about four times It was a fun trip I m sure it was a real fun for your family Yeah oh it was horrible for them So I wake up three days later And it turns out that I had meningitis Humph I almost died during that three days You know all these things my parents had to call my school and everything and tell them I was in the hospital practically dying So it was actually a lot worse experience for my family because you know they had You were passed out half the time Right they had to go through wondering for three days whether or not I was going to live For a couple of days maybe not three days for like a I guess maybe like a 24 hour period or what ever Right uh huh I could have lived or died or I could have had some major damage done to me Oh really like permanent stuff could happen Because meningitis effects your uh the lining of your nervous system Oh OK And your brain which is called the meningitis it gets swollen and that is what caused the pain You know that is like the throbbing pain it s like a swelling or whatever So then all my friends had to get throat cultures because it s very contagious Oh really Anybody that I interacted with at school had to get throat cultures Now where were you working in the beginning when you started washing the dishes in a restaurant In a nursing home In a nursing home OK Right so I was doing dishes So did they have to test the nursing home people I m sure they did yeah And I never worked in a nursing home again after that I kept telling that I was going to come back They didn t want the Outbreak monkey to come back I kept telling them I was going to come back but then I never did So OK now another family tragedy In 1992 my sister the same sister that drove me to the hospital when I had meningitis with my father she got cancer in 1992 in 1991 in April of 1991 she was diagnosed a week after my niece was born Now is that her daughter Yes OK so she had a baby and a week later she is diagnosed with cancer Yeah Cancer of the what She had lymphoma OK It was throughout her body And the way it happened was she her arm went numb They were examining her and trying to figure why her arm went numb And what they figured out was that it was a tumor so the tumor was pressing against a nerve which made her arm numb Oh OK So but then a year later she died in June of 92 with the cancer Uh huh And so those three weeks before she died was like you know The whole time was a terrible time So as soon as diagnosed it did they pretty much say that there was not much we can do because it is all over her body No She went through chemo she went through everything she went through chemo ah radiation Drugs Yeah you know she fought it the whole time She never thought she was going to die OK good good She never had that idea in her mind I mean like right up to a month or two before she uh passed away she was doing math homework I was helping her with math homework Yeah she never thought she never gave up She was a fighter Right basically That s how you can say it She never gave up and you know she went through all the treatments and then well then a funny thing relates to that story like well then the whole story is not funny But we had the two or three weeks before we wound up going to the hospital a lot we knew her time was short And then every time I wound up driving into Manhattan you know we lived on Staten Island so I was driving into Manhattan and every time I would park on the street I would get a parking ticket It was like a guarantee I should have learned I should have just parked in the parking garage but the parking garages were like anywhere from 14 to 24 a day How much is a parking ticket Well I think that a parking ticket at the time was maybe 25 or something like that So it wasn t that much difference It wasn t that much difference But it could have been I mean some of them were like 50 I think But this is meter parking and I mean if you went a minute over you had a ticket You mean there was someone there waiting for it to go a minute over Yeah it was like magic Yeah this is how efficient the people were that were giving the tickets out were uh so that was fun You know driving into Manhattan getting a ticket How was it on the family to see just to know that the end is near I mean because you all live there together in the same basic area right Right we all most of us live on Staten Island My sister lives my other sister lives in New Jersey She was living at the same place at the time uh you know it was sad of course it was also you know it was a binding experience my family did become closer after that you know because you know united in tragedy I guess you could say Sure Ah Did different people tend to handle it differently How Oh yes definitely a wide range of reactions you know You know you know one of my brothers was real upset you know ah most of us were pretty mellow like you know we weren t really at the time we weren t really outwardly trying you know we really didn t show a lot of upsetness Right Because everybody was trying to show Trying to help her out Right and help everybody else out How long I mean did the doctor just come and say she has got about six weeks left or one of those kinds of things did did you know JG Yes yes Pretty much Well they said in April they said that she had she had about three months which would be like July towards the end of July I think But it uh turns out she died right in the middle of June so she actually died before the time that they gave her Uh huh They gave her three months but she only lived about a month and a half Did she know that Did they tell her directly Yeah I think they did um I just can t imagine someone saying you have three months to live Well you know I don t think did I don t think they did tell her that They told my brother in law you know whom we are still very close to Oh that was her husband Right yeah He is living in Manhattan now with my two nieces you know my family is still very close to them You know I consider him you know just as close as any of any of my other relatives Sure My in laws or whatever Sure You know there was never any like severance of relations you know what I mean Yeah Um you know because of that Anyway so him and my two nieces still live in Manhattan How old are the little girls now They re ah man Well one is eight no well she is nine and the other one is 11 So she never knew her mom man Well she was about a year old when my sister died A year and two months old so she really didn t no she never really go that close to her She only saw her about half that time you know during that period So she was you know like we kept her at my house a lot And my other niece she stayed at my father in law s family a lot Ah let s see Another funny story was related to that my other niece the older niece she was three at the time she still had her pacifier and everything I got to share a room with her this is fun she was a cute as a button But uh she would wake up at night sometimes going Mimi Mimi Mimi Now is that Mom No she had a pacifier she called ah Mimi So her pacifier would fall out of her mouth at night so she would just wake up It would be right next to her she wouldn t just grab it a stick it in her mouth she would go Mimi Mimi So I had to get up a put the pacifier in her mouth it was really cute Just so she would go back to sleep That is really funny It was really sweet Uh I can t imagine having to tell a three year old that mommy has gone to Jesus Right Or whatever Right Well my brother in law had that pleasure Yeah But you know I mean she was upset but she wasn t well she was upset Right But I don t know if it totally hit her you know what I mean If she had been about five or six it probably would have been very different Right But she would go through stages where she would be upset you know like she would realize I mean she realized what happened and of course now she is really aware Yeah But at the time I guess you know I guess she would forget you know and sometimes she would remember OK I see interesting I guess you know but Well I think we have got enough Thanks a lot
