 Jew Talkin to Me Barry Levinson has said that his new movie Liberty Heights was born when a magazine critic made a breezily derisive reference to the Jewishness of Dustin Hoffman s character in Levinson s dud sci fi picture Sphere 1998 Why he asked make an issue out of a character s ethnicity The barbs of that Jewish critic don t seem like such a big deal to this Jewish critic but in Levinson they clearly touched a nerve Trounced a nerve even He has responded the way his teen age alter ego Ben Kurtzman Ben Foster and friends respond in Liberty Heights when they defy a sign on a local pool that reads No Jews Dogs or Coloreds Allowed He s saying You got a problem with Jewish I ll show you Jewish Does Levinson fully understand what teed him off The charismatic young men in Diner 1982 his first autobiographical work and his masterpiece weren t labeled as Jewish and its most memorable turns were by actors named Kevin and Mickey In his third on screen visit to his native Baltimore Avalon 1990 the milieu finally was Jewish but the director was more interested in making sweeping points about the cultural fragmentation of the central immigrant family and by extension the American family than in exploring his tribal or religious roots That family was impersonated by those Hebrews Aidan Quinn Elizabeth Perkins Armin Mueller Stahl and Joan Plowright The point is Levinson airbrushed the Jewishness out of his movie memoirs and that review must on some level have shamed him made him feel as if he d been dodging the issue The problem I think is that he s still dodging the issue Levinson might be so assimilated by now that he barely remembers what would impel someone to filter the Jewishness out of his or her autobiographical alter egos On the basis of the family depicted in Liberty Heights he hardly seems to remember what a Jew is only what a Jew is not It s not a WASP It s not an African American As a boy in the exclusively Jewish Liberty Heights section of Baltimore being Jewish was just being it was when he perceived his otherness the movie suggests that a more complicated relationship to the world began That s what Liberty Heights attempts to recapture The movie opens in 1954 when 16 year old Ben first pokes his head out of his neighborhood and when desegregation is starting to bring together disparate ethnic and racial groups Jews are not only interacting with WASPs and blacks in the case of Ben and his older brother Van Adrien Brody they re falling for them much to the horror of the older generation both white and black Ben takes a shine to a colored girl Rebekah Johnson who sneaks him into her upper middle class house and introduces him to rock n roll and to comedians who make fun of white people Meanwhile Van and his buddies crash a Halloween party on the WASP side of town where Van goes gaga for a chill blonde goddess Carolyn Murphy in a fairy godmother ensemble the supreme shiksa Even their dad Nate Joe Mantegna is forced to ally himself with non Jews The owner of a dying burlesque house whose side business the illegal numbers racket has become his lone source of income Nate loses a fortune to a small time black drug dealer called Little Melvin Orlando Jones a loose cannon who ultimately threatens his livelihood and his family Levinson s remarks about the review of Sphere which was released only last year suggest something else about Liberty Heights that it was written fast That might not be a problem if its canvas weren t so broad but Levinson doesn t work simply anymore He wants to make an epic So he spreads the narrative thin and the script plays like a first draft It s full of wonderful bits that don t mesh some of them could be spun off into their own movies and with characters conceived either too coarsely or too vaguely Little Melvin is a flaming racist outrage and I can t make any sense out of Trey Justin Chambers a glamorous rich WASP who s fond of crashing cars and who takes such a liking to Van that he appears to be foisting his girlfriend the blonde goddess on the Jew Is this Aryan guilt or does he really want to jump Van s bones No clue from the actors who look uniformly marooned The crosscutting among the movie s various strands is even weirder While Van and his buddies comb wealthy neighborhoods for a glimpse of his shiksa Nate auditions a stripper whose costume doesn t arrive and who ends up doffing her conservative street clothes on stage to wild acclaim Is Levinson drawing a parallel here saying that Jews are turned on by WASPs because they re so buttoned up I think alas he is And when he crosscuts between a James Brown concert and a WASP party is he saying that Jews are turned on by blacks because blacks are so unbuttoned because they shake rattle and roll Ditto Is he saying that coming of age as a Jew means learning to embrace both chocolate and vanilla In the end the narrator Ben retreats into generic memory play mode If I d known things would no longer be I d have tried harder to remember them Loss of the past that s a universal theme a gentile theme The director has backed away from what appears to be his real more local theme which is the tug of war within American Jews of his generation between a compulsion to embrace other cultures and a feeling of superiority toward them That idea is hilariously embodied by his best character Van s friend Yussel David Krumholtz who starts a brawl when he gets his nose rubbed in his Jewishness at one WASP party and shows up for the next with his hair dyed blond and with a tale of Nordic ancestry I wish there were more of Yussel in Ben and Van who are both unforgivably wide eyed and marshmallowy Their blandness neuters what should be the movie s reason for being Liberty Heights is less gaseous than Avalon The Jewish boys exploration of life among the other kind is often wryly funny and when they show up at the familiar Baltimore diner to compare notes time stops and we bask in their banter If I sound sour compared with other critics it s because I think Levinson missed a chance to get something unique and audacious on screen the story of a thin skinned Jewish kid who d grow up to make autobiographical movies that somehow leave out the Jewishness and then get so enraged by a critic s offhand projection of Jewishness into a big WASPy sci fi picture that he vows to go back and remake his other films with Jews instead of gentiles That would be something to see Critics have been falling all over themselves to announce that All About My Mother marks Pedro Almod var s arrival as a mature world class director Not to take anything away from his movie it s a lovely work but Almod var arrived as a world class director 15 years ago when his silly campy and impassioned melodramas were like joyous dances on Gen Franco s tomb His new work is his most sober maybe because his alter ego an 18 year old devoted son aspiring writer and worshipper of flamboyant actresses gets run over by a car while chasing an actress who d just played Blanche DuBois for her autograph This shocking act of self effacement paves the way for a film suffused by the boy s loss His grief stricken mother Cecilia Roth goes off in search of the father the boy never met now an AIDS ridden transvestite in Barcelona and ends up at the center of a benign matriarchal society that includes the very actress Marisa Paredes that her son was pursuing The film has been consciously devised as the flip side of All About Eve 1950 as a tale of women not bitchily at one another s throats but holding one another together through life s most senseless tragedies The definition of women here is broad enough to include transvestites and transsexuals Things that might once have been screamingly campy are now played straight People dramatize their emotions but rarely overdramatize them And even though the film is full of laughs the jokes hover on the edge of the abyss This is a world in which lurid colors and extravagant gestures are means of filling the void Almod var s movies are the transparent reveries of a gay star struck adolescent Most of us have equivalent fantasies but we d be ashamed to expose ourselves by putting them out there Almod var even here in his square Douglas Sirk mode gives them the kind of soul that banishes embarrassment I m embarrassed to admit it but Pierce Brosnan is growing on me Ian Fleming s James Bond was a snob and a lightweight It was only Sean Connery s peculiar combination of traits he could seem rugged and snooty at once that made us think 007 a more interesting character than he was In The World Is Not Enough Brosnan brings the right Flemingesque irritation to the opening chase Unlike Roger Moore who seemed detached from the action as well as from his stunt double and Timothy Dalton who seemed above it Brosnan makes you believe that Bond s absurd feats are the plausible upshot of his refusal to be bested by social or sexual inferiors The actor is still sleek but the touch of crepe paper around his face has eliminated the plastic department store mannequin look that Remington Steele exploited so shrewdly He s vulnerable now You don t want his sewn on suit to get wrinkled because fine tailoring appears to be all this man has He even winces in pain a couple of times and in the climax lets out a grunt that takes the Bond girl the dire Denise Richards aback The movie is better than you ve heard although that s not saying a lot I confess I always want to like the latest Bond flick I have a Pavlovian reaction to the pre title black white and red bit with Monty Norman s theme and the gun site roving over the latest 007 as he saunters to the center of the frame I go Kill em Bond Much has been made of hiring Michael Apted to bring a more human touch to the series There s only so much a director can do with the most ironclad formula in movies but Apted s documentary instincts give the eastern European locations more personality and the dialogue scenes aren t as choppy as usual Brosnan and his co stars actually get a rhythm going There s even a rare performance from one of the Bond girls Sophie Marceau as a damsel in distress who turns out to be very distressed psychologically by a previous kidnapping attempt Plus she has a long rounded chin that I find mysteriously intoxicating The filmmakers drop the ball though on their master villain Renard who has a bullet in his brain that renders him impervious to physical pain Robert Carlyle is a wonderful and frightening actor but the movie pumps him up to be such a terminator his only goal is chaos and he grows stronger every day until he dies that when this little guy comes shambling on and turns out to be such a soulful twit the movie loses all its credibility Apted might be too much of a humanist for a Bond picture It s not so bad that the blows aren t heavily amplified but when the bad guys get it there isn t that extra sadistic beat to let you know how surprised they are that their aura of invincibility has been punctured I kept thinking Kill em again Bond
