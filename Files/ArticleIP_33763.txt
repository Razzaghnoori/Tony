Gielgud the Bad and the Ugly Following an outcry from among others Academy Award winner Sir John Gielgud the Smithsonian Institution has canceled a program What was the program and the problem Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson Unparalleled Kings of British Stage and Screen The problem was that Gielgud has nothing left to lose and was willing to show up with a truck bomb if necessary Greg Diamond Jon Delfin had a similar answer Thanks to Gielgud and fellow Brits museum goers from ages 5 to 105 won t be able to attend the Hands on History The British Aristocracy exhibit which encouraged attendees to examine life sized models of past sovereigns and then hypothesize which members of the royal family might have been syphilitic Michael Fein The Look at Me I m John Gielgud and I m a Stuck Up Sissy Pants Boo Hoo Hoo program Sir John formally announced that he was neither stuck up nor a sissy pants while sniffling and blowing his nose into a frilly lace handkerchief Francis

Liver was the program and the problem was that according to Sir John It tastes yucky When it was pointed out that there are starving children in Asia who would love to have some nice liver to eat Gielgud replied Well then my dear boy send it to them Floyd Elliot Click for more answers Tim s Wrap Up How odd that John Gielgud and the Smithsonian are fighting with one another since they are in many ways so alike Both are old both are revered and as a result people tend to focus on the highbrow exploits of both while discreetly ignoring the lowbrow The Smithsonian may be exalted as the repository of American culture and get high marks for whenever it hosts say a monthlong exhibit on the hardships of the pilgrims But let s face it a disproportionate number of visitors just want to see Archie Bunker s chair Similarly when Sir John Gielgud s obituary is written the Shakespearean plays and films will figure prominently less likely to be discussed are the roles in Caligula First Knight and Arthur 2 On the Rocks Luckily Quiz participants aren t so kind One might think they d team up to feature a monthlong show of John Gielgud sitting in Archie Bunker s chair explaining the pilgrims to passers by But one would be wrong Arthurian Answer The program as Floyd Elliot and others knew was titled Foie Gras A Gourmet s Passion Gielgud along with other animal rights advocates protested the evening which was to consist of a panel discussion followed by the distribution of bits of liver Apparently the method of producing foie gras which requires that food be crammed down the throats of ducks and geese is offensive to the activists to say nothing of the geese Seems to me that an equitable compromise would be to have the foie gras crammed down the Smithsonian visitors throats but nobody asked me Nobody ever asks me A Correction From Ian Austen I hate to dispute the abilities of News Quiz s crack research team but given the recent trouble over Great Lakes greatness
