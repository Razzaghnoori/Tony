 Background Human breast tumorigenesis is a multistage process encompassing complex cellular transformation from normalcy to malignancy 1 It has been proposed that multiple different cellular events dictate the biochemical changes that allow normal cells to become highly malignant These key events require alterations in the expression of many genes translation of RNA transcripts and cellular activation by growth factors hormones and proteins in the evolving tumor cell population 1 2 3 4 5 Steroid hormones play a vital role in the growth of normal mammary gland tissue as well as the development and progression of breast tumors Human estrogen receptor alpha hER is detected in 50 85 of all breast tumors 6 and is utilized as a prognostic marker to identify patients who may have a favorable response to hormonal or endocrine manipulations Thus hER provides a useful prognostic index in patients with metastatic disease and is associated with disease free survival 7 8 9 10 However 35 of all patients with hER positive ER tumors do not respond to hormonal interventions suggesting cellular and molecular alterations 6 11 12 This lack of response may be attributed at least in part to the presence of nonfunctional hER as determined by the inability of hER to bind hormone to recognize and bind to specific DNA responsive elements and or its inability to recruit other transcriptional activation factors 6 11 12 It may also be attributed to tumor heterogeneity in which some tumor cells may continue to express functional hER while other cells may express either dysfunctional hER or do not express hER at all This may permit the tumor to become autonomous with respect to hormone sensitivity allowing tumor progression Currently human breast tumor hER content is determined by ligand binding assays or immunohistochemistry While these techniques measure either hER content or its cellular distribution they do not provide the means for assessing hER functionality In our search for new tumor markers we identified and characterized a novel 55 kDa nuclear protein termed nmt55 13 The amino acid sequence of nmt55 was highly homologous but not identical to that reported for the nuclear protein p54 nrbidentified in HeLa cells 14 A more recent report by Peters et al 15 noted differences in the sequence of the reported HeLa cell p54 nrb 14 and placental p54 nrb When we compared the sequences of nmt55 and placental p54 nrb U Muller Personal Communication we determined that the sequences were identical The differences in the sequence for nmt55 placental p54 nrband HeLa p54 nrbare most likely due to HeLa p54 nrbsequencing error Chromosomal location and sequence identity data confirm that p54 nrbhas the same sequence as nmt55 and are the same gene We refer to this protein as nmt55 p54 nrb Our studies on nmt55 and those of p54 nrbhave characterized this protein as an RNA binding protein with the ability to associate with Topoisomerase I and the polypyrimidine tract binding protein associated splicing factor PSF 16 17 18 19 20 Further we observed the association of nmt55 p54 nrbwith several splicing factors known to be essential for spliceosome formation suggesting a role for nmt55 p54 nrbin pre mRNA splicing unpublished results Our previous studies investigated the protein expression of nmt55 p54 nrbin human breast tumors using a monoclonal antibody with an epitope localized to the carboxyl terminal domain of this protein These studies demonstrated a statistically significant association between nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression tumor hormonal phenotype and mean tumor size 13 Specifically in tumors large in size or those tumors which were determined to be ER the expression of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein was absent or greatly reduced 13 These results suggested that loss of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression may be related to hormone insensitivity tumor differentiation state unregulated tumor growth and metastases The absence or reduced expression of nmt55 p54 nrbmay be attributed to the regulation of mRNA expression protein processing of a specific functional domain or the presence of a heterogeneous population of nmt55 p54 nrbisoforms which may not be immunodetected by monoclonal antibody NMT 1 In this study we compared mRNA levels in ER and ER human breast tumors using Northern blot analysis and ribonuclease protection assay to assess if nmt55 p54 nrbis regulated at the transcription level We further developed nmt55 p54 nrbspecific site directed polyclonal antibodies to the amino terminal region and to a mid region to assess the potential presence of multiple nmt55 p54 nrbisoforms or processed nmt55 p54 nrbin human breast tumors Methods Isotopes reagents and chemicals 2 4 6 7 3H Oestradiol 3H E 2 102

purification of peptides We have previously used sequence specific peptides to generate site directed monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies 21 22 24 25 27 28 Two peptides NMT 4 and NMT 5 were synthesized purified by gel filtration and analyzed by HPLC Analyses of the amino acid composition correlated well with the primary sequence The sequences of these peptides is given in Figure 1A

of each peptide was then dissolved in 5 ml of the KLH solution or BSA solution The pH of the mixtures was adjusted to 9 0 with 0 1 M LiOH Coupling of the peptide to the carrier protein was initiated by drop wise addition of 6 25 glutaraldehyde to achieve a final concentration of 1 Each mixture was incubated at 4 C for one hour with gentle agitation Each mixture was then dialyzed extensively against four changes of PBS Aliquots were taken after dialysis to determine efficiency of coupling and the remaining dialyzed material was stored at 80 C New Zealand White female rabbits were obtained from Pine Acre Rabbitry Norton MA Prior to immunization serum was collected from each rabbit by bleeding through the ear artery and this was designated as pre immune serum Each animal was immunized by

contained 500 g ml of the desired peptide After 3 weeks the animals were boosted with the antigen in incomplete Freund s adjuvant Two weeks after the booster shots the animals were bled the sera were collected and tested for the presence of anti peptide antibodies by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA RNA preparation and northern blot analyses Total RNA from MCF 7 cells and human breast tumors was prepared as described 33 Total RNA was electrophoresed on 1 formaldehyde MOPS agarose gels and transferred onto nylon reinforced nitrocellulose membranes Northern blot analysis was carried out using double stranded DNA probes labeled to a specific activity of 10 8 10 9cpm g with 32P CTP using T7 DNA polymerase and random primers Hybridization was carried out at 67 C for 2 hours in Quickhyb solution Stratagene La Jolla CA Membranes were exposed to Hyperfilm Amersham Arlington Heights IL for 24 hours at 70 C following low 2X SSC 0 1 SDS 25 C and high 0 2X SSC 0 1 SDS 65 C stringency washes The probe used for nmt55 p54 nrbanalysis was a 499 bp SacI BglII fragment representing the unique carboxyl terminus of nmt55 p54 nrb 13 This probe was utilized to prevent cross hybridization with other homologous RNA binding proteins A 545 bp HindIII Xbal fragment of human glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH was utilized as a probe to normalize for RNA loading 34 Ribonuclease protection assays Ribonuclease protection assays were performed using the RPA III Ribonuclease Protection Assay Kit from Ambion Austin TX according to the manufacturer s specifications RNA was isolated and prepared as described above A 499 bp nmt55 p54 nrbfragment was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 32P CTP and non radioactive nucleotides to generate an

digestion RNase was inactivated and hybridized RNA was precipitated according to the manufacturer s instructions Precipitated samples were resuspended and analyzed by gel electrophoresis on 5 urea polyacrylamide denaturing gels Following electrophoresis gels were dried for 2 hours at 80 C and subjected to autoradiography for 24 hours at 70 C Century markers were radiolabeled according to the manufacturer s instructions and used as molecular weight markers Electrophoresis and western blot analyses Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analyses were performed as described 13 23 Briefly samples were electrophoresed on 10 resolving sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gels SDS PAGE according to the method of Laemmli 35 Proteins were then electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and the membranes were incubated in TBST buffer containing 5 nonfat dry milk for 1 hour to block nonspecific protein binding Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies at various dilutions for 1 hour and then washed three times with TBST 10 minutes each Nitrocellulose membranes were then incubated with the appropriate corresponding horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody for 1 hour and washed as above Antibody protein interactions were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Pierce Rockford IL and autoradiography Immunohistochemistry Formalin fixed paraffin embedded blocks of human breast tissue were re cut at a thickness of 4 m and consecutive sections were stained with Gill s hematoxylin and eosin H E 23 Immunohistochemical assays were performed using a modification of the antigen retrieval technique based on microwave exposure Unless stated otherwise all incubations were at 37 C in a humidity chamber followed by two PBS plus Triton X 100 1 500 washes 2 minutes each Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched using a 3 hydrogen peroxide methanol solution for 30 minutes at 25 C This was followed by antigen retrieval and subsequent incubation in blocking reagent 1 50 normal horse serum for 20 minutes Anti hER monoclonal antibody EVG F9 and anti hPR monoclonal antibody 4 14 were diluted 1 200 and incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C Anti nmt55 p54 nrbpolyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 were diluted 1 2500 and incubated for 2 hours at 37 C Non immune mouse IgG was used as a negative control antibody Sections were rinsed and incubated with secondary antibody rabbit anti mouse IgG biotinylated or swine anti rabbit IgG biotinylated for 30 minutes followed by a 30 minute incubation in Streptavidin solution using DAKO s Quick Staining LSAB Kit DAKO Corp Carpinteria CA To visualize antibody binding tissue sections were incubated for 10 minutes in 3 3 diaminobenzidine DAB at 25 C Sections were then rinsed in distilled water and counterstained for 1 minute in Gill s hematoxylin Slides were analyzed by standard light microscopy Results Analysis of nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA in ER and ER human breast tumors We have previously shown that nmt55 p54 nrbprotein was expressed in most ER PR human breast tumors but was undetectable in ER PR human breast tumors 13 Since loss of hER expression is associated with poor prognosis and continued expression of hER is associated with disease free survival and correlates well with tumor differentiation state we wanted to investigate the regulation of nmt55 p54 nrbexpression To test the possibility that nmt55 p54 nrbmay be transcriptionally downregulated in ER tumors we analyzed mRNA levels from a series of human breast tumors utilizing Northern blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays Figure 2shows Northern blot analysis of nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA expression in 12 human breast tumors MCF 7 cells Lane M used as a control express an abundant 2 6 kb mRNA transcript for nmt55 p54 nrb nmt55 p54 nrbtranscripts were detected at varying levels in both ER and ER tumors mRNA transcript was expressed at high levels lanes 2 3 5 9 11 and 12 moderate levels lanes 2 7 and 10 or low levels lanes 1 4 and 8 The tumor sample in lane 6 was degraded and was not analyzed further These different nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA levels were not due to differential RNA loading as GAPDH levels were similar in all tumor samples These results suggest that nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA transcripts are expressed at various levels It also suggested that nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression in some breast tumors does not correlate with nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA expression Specifically the decreased nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression observed in ER human breast tumors may not be attributed to transcriptional regulation of nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA since mRNA expression in ER tumors is not universally decreased To confirm these observations ribonuclease protection assay was utilized to analyze a set of different human breast tumors As shown in Figure 3 all human tumor samples expressed nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA transcript nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA was not detected in calf uterine tissue This was expected since the nmt55 p54 nrbprobe utilized for detection is of human origin and calf uterus tissue expresses a different transcript for nmt55 p54 nrb This prevents high fidelity hybridization between the probe and the mRNA allowing complete mRNA probe digestion Based on the data presented in Figures 2and 3 it appears that nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA is expressed independent of tumor hormonal status suggesting that nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA is not regulated by hER These results together with those reported previously 13 further suggest that decreased expression of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein in ER human breast tumors is likely a post transcriptional event Immunochemical detection of multiple nmt55 p54 nrbprotein isoforms in human breast tumors Since there was no apparent nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA regulation in ER or ER human breast tumors it was possible that monoclonal antibody NMT 1 may not detect the presence of potential multiple isoforms of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein especially in ER tumors This necessitated the development of domain specific antibodies To this end two peptides were synthesized and purified based on selected sequences in the subdomains of human nmt55 p54 nrb Figure 1A These selected peptides were referred to as NMT 4 and NMT 5 and represent sequences 56 72 and 371 386 of human nmt55 p54 nrb respectively Figure 1A Polyclonal antibodies were developed against these peptides polyclonal antibody NMT 4 recognized a sequence in the amino terminal region of nmt55 p54 nrband polyclonal antibody NMT 5 recognized a sequence in a mid region of nmt55 p54 nrb Figure 1B Figure 4shows the binding of polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 to a protein with an estimated molecular weight of 55 kDa lanes 3 and 5 respectively Pre immune sera detected no specific protein in the 55 kDa range lanes 1 and 2 Specificity of the polyclonal antibodies was assessed by pre incubation with the appropriate immunogenic free peptides As shown in Figure 4 lanes 4 and 6 the antigenic peptides competed effectively for the binding of the antibodies to the protein indicating that these antibodies are specific Complete displacement was not seen in Lane 6 which was due to high titer of the antibody Incubation of NMT 5 antibody with a higher concentration of free immunogenic NMT 5 peptide resulted in complete displacement results not shown These results indicate that the anti peptide polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 detect this 55 kDa protein with high specificity and high affinity Since nmt55 p54 nrbbelongs to a family of RNA binding proteins with conserved domains it was possible that the polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 were detecting a protein with a similar molecular weight To investigate this possibility we carried out immunoprecipitation assays of MCF 7 nuclear extract with a series of antibodies and immunoblotted with the same series of antibodies Figure 5shows MCF 7 nuclear extract immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody NMT 1 polyclonal antibody NMT 4 polyclonal antibody NMT 5 or monoclonal antibody EVG F9 The immunoprecipitate samples were then separated by SDS PAGE and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody NMT 1 top panel polyclonal antibody NMT 4 middle panel or polyclonal antibody NMT 5 bottom panel The results show that this 55 kDa protein is detected regardless of which antibody is used for immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting Since monoclonal antibody NMT 1 is specific for nmt55 p54 nrbprotein 13 the results suggest that polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 are specific to nmt55 p54 nrband do not detect related RNA binding proteins nmt55 p54 nrbprotein was not detected in the anti hER monoclonal antibody EVG F9 immunoprecipitation sample negative control Monoclonal antibody NMT 1 and polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 also detect bacterially expressed partially purified nmt55 p54 nrbprotein results not shown These results indicate that monoclonal antibody NMT 1 carboxyl terminal and the polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 amino terminal and NMT 5 mid region detect nmt55 p54 nrbprotein with high affinity and high specificity Figure 6shows Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts from 10 human breast tumor immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 top panel NMT 5 middle panel and monoclonal antibody NMT 1 bottom panel No antibodies detected nmt55 p54 nrbprotein in ER human breast tumors lanes 1 5 confirming previous observations 13 Monoclonal antibody NMT 1 and polyclonal antibody NMT 5 detect nmt55 p54 nrbprotein in all ER tumor samples lanes 5 10 albeit at varying levels Interestingly however polyclonal antibody NMT 4 detected nmt55 p54 nrbin only 3 out of 5 ER tumors These results have been reproduced in the nuclear extracts of approximately forty human breast tumors suggesting that there is an alteration or modification in the amino terminal domain of nmt55 p54 nrbthat prevents polyclonal antibody NMT 4 from binding to nmt55 p54 nrbprotein The observations made here further suggest the presence of nmt55 p54 nrbvariants in a subset of ER human breast tumors Detection of nmt55 p54 nrbby Western blot analyses requires tumor pulverization homogenization fractionation and the preparation of cellular extracts These manipulations may result in biochemical alterations of nmt55 p54 nrbduring processing To insure that this observation was not the result of experimental manipulation and indeed the nmt55 p54 nrbvariants detected with polyclonal antibody NMT 5 and monoclonal antibody NMT 1 but not polyclonal antibody NMT 4 were also expressed in intact cells we utilized immunohistochemical analyses in human breast tumor tissue sections Further immunohistochemistry permits the assessment of nmt55 p54 nrbsubcellular localization and distribution within human breast tumors Figure 7shows immunohistochemical analyses of a human breast tumor using hER hPR and nmt55 p54 nrbspecific antibodies Tissue sections stained positively with monoclonal antibodies EVG F9 Panel A and 4 14 Panel B showing the expression of hER and hPR respectively Positive staining with polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 Panel C and NMT 5 Panel D showed the presence of nmt55 p54 nrb Figure 8represents a tumor which exhibited positive staining for hER Panel A hPR Panel B and nmt55 p54 nrbwhen utilizing polyclonal antibody NMT 5 Panel D However this tumor did not stain positive for nmt55 p54 nrbwhen polyclonal antibody NMT 4 was utilized Panel C Similar results have been observed in sixteen different human breast tumor tissue sections The immunohistochemistry data confirm the results obtained by Western blot analyses suggesting that nmt55 p54 nrbprotein is expressed in various isoforms in a subset of ER human breast tumors The nature of the alteration or modification in the amino terminal region of nmt55 p54 nrb which prevents the detection of nmt55 p54 nrbby polyclonal antibody NMT 4 by Western blot and immunohistochemical analyses remains to be determined Discussion We have previously investigated nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression in human breast tumors and observed a statistically significant association between decreased nmt55 p54 nrbexpression loss of hER and hPR and increased tumor size 13 It is possible that decreased nmt55 p54 nrbexpression represents poor tumor differentiation increased tumor growth and metastases since reduced or absent hER expression and function correlates with poor tumor differentiation 11 36 and tumor size is a strong indicator of tumor progression 37 Here we investigated nmt55 p54 nrbmRNA expression using Northern blot analyses and ribonuclease protection assays to determine if the reduction of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression was the result of transcriptional regulation mRNA transcripts for nmt55 p54 nrbshowed similar expression in human breast tumors and were not related to hER expression These results suggest that the regulation of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression observed in human breast tumors is likely a post transcriptional event Results from Western blot analyses with polyclonal antibodies NMT 4 and NMT 5 showed that nmt55 p54 nrbexpression was absent or greatly reduced in most of ER tumors This confirmed the previous observations obtained with monoclonal antibody NMT 1 13 Data also showed that a subset of ER tumors expressed nmt55 p54 nrbprotein detectable with polyclonal antibody NMT 5 and monoclonal antibody NMT 1 but not polyclonal antibody NMT 4 These results suggested the presence of nmt55 p54 nrbvariants in a subset of ER human breast tumors The inability of polyclonal antibody NMT 4 to detect nmt55 p54 nrbin some ER tumors may be attributed to proteolysis during nuclear extraction and analyses or biochemical modification of functionally distinct isoform While the altered molecular weight of the protein sample shown in Figure 6 lane 9 may be attributed to proteolysis most of the protein samples in Figure 6displayed a similar estimated molecular weight of 55 kDa Thus the lack of nmt55 p54nrb protein detection in this study is most likely not due to proteolysis We also wanted to determine if nmt55 p54 nrbvariants detected with polyclonal antibody NMT 5 and monoclonal antibody NMT 1 but not polyclonal antibody NMT 4 using nuclear extracts and Western blot analyses were also detectable in intact cells To test this premise we utilized immunohistochemistry to detect nmt55 p54 nrbprotein in human breast tumor tissue sections The data from immunohistochemistry confirmed the results obtained by Western blot analyses which suggested that nmt55 p54 nrbprotein was expressed in various isoforms in a subset of ER human breast tumors These potential isoforms may have altered biological function due to the loss of domain specific interactions We have attempted to ascertain the presence and nature of these isoforms by utilizing mixing experiments however these experiments have proved inconclusive The expression and role of this isoform in human breast cancer remains to be determined A plausible explanation for the lack of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein detection with polyclonal antibody NMT 4 is a point mutation in the epitope for polyclonal antibody NMT 4 a post translational modification such as phosphorylation in or near this epitope or an alternative splice variant affecting this epitope Another possibility is the methylation of arginine residues although this would not alter the overall charge of the protein it could sterically hinder the protein antibody interaction The methylation of arginine residues has been shown to take place in other pre mRNA splicing proteins though the role of this modification is unknown 38 One approach to determine the presence of a point mutation or a splice variant is to perform PCR coupled with sequencing techniques Another approach to resolve this issue is to analyze this protein isoform by Mass Spectroscopy These studies are currently under investigation In this report we show that nmt55 p54 nrbprotein is expressed in a variant isoform in a subset of ER tumors These data along with our previous observations suggest that the association of nmt55 p54 nrband hER expression represents three separate human breast tumor phenotypes The first phenotype represents tumors that express wild type nmt55 p54 nrband are ER These tumors may be classified as low grade or early stage tumors and respond well to endocrine manipulations The second phenotype is identified as ER using Western blot or immunohistochemical analyses and would express the amino terminal altered modified nmt55 p54 nrbisoform This may represent mid grade and mid stage tumors which are very heterogeneous It would be of interest to determine if these tumors express nonfunctional hER and as a result do not respond to hormonal therapy Finally the third phenotype represents tumors that do not express hER and nmt55 p54 nrb These tumors would most likely be highly proliferative classified as high grade and late stage hormone insensitive and potentially metastatic While the focus of this study has been the biochemical relationship between nmt55 p54 nrband tumor hormonal status a more expansive study correlating nmt55 p54 nrbprotein expression with various breast tumor clinicopathological characteristics may provide additional key information These studies are under investigation Our data suggests that nmt55 p54 nrbmay be critical to cell growth and function such that decreased nmt55 p54 nrbexpression in ER human breast tumors or the expression of nmt55 p54 nrbvariants in ER tumors may indicate loss of normal growth nmt55 p54 nrbhas been shown in several studies to bind RNA and interact with PSF and Topoisomerase I 14 16 17 18 19 20 39 Those results along with our observations that nmt55 p54 nrbassociates with several splicing factors essential for spliceosome formation unpublished and relates to tumor hormonal status 13 suggest that nmt55 p54 nrbmay be involved in pre mRNA processing Thus loss of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein or the expression of nmt55 p54 nrbprotein variants in tumor cells may result in the loss of hER expression the expression of nonfunctional hER or the altered expression other critical cell growth factors due to lack of proper pre mRNA splicing Specifically the role of nmt55 p54 nrbas a splicing factor may affect hER structure and function The progression of breast cancer may be associated with changes in RNA processing and the production of aberrantly spliced mRNAs which may result in non functional gene products or the loss of specific gene expression It has been proposed that loss of hER expression in breast tumors is the result of aberrant RNA processing 40 41 42 43 These aberrantly spliced mRNAs if translated could lead to truncated receptors with hormone binding but not DNA binding function 44 Further there is evidence for the role of RNA processing in oncogenesis 45 46 Many studies including those on human hnRNP A2 B1 and the CD44 gene suggest that high fidelity pre mRNA splicing is critical to normal cellular function and may play a key role in oncogenesis and breast cancer progression 47 48 The strong association between nmt55 p54 nrband hER expression indicates that nmt55 p54 nrbmay be an important marker for breast cancer progression The decreased or altered expression of nmt55 p54 nrbmay be related to tumor differentiation unregulated tumor cell growth and metastases and may explain tumor heterogeneity especially with respect to hormonal interventions in the course of treatment Although an RNA splicing protein hnRNP A2 B1 has been used as a tumor marker in lung cancer progression 47 this is the first time that a protein involved in pre mRNA splicing has been implicated in breast cancer progression and may represent an important breast tumor marker Further studies are necessary to determine a functional link between this RNA binding protein and hER in human breast cancer Competing interests None
