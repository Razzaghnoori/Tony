 I am Meredith Combs and it is March 8 2000 and I am interviewing my mother Jane Combs Um what can you tell me about the stories that you first remember being told as a child Um The stories I remember being told the most came out of the Little Golden Books It was a series of little fiction stories and my mother must have read me every single one of them Um do you want names of them Sure Well there were names like The Pokey Little Puppy um Mr Bear Squash You All Flat um just they were just little stories about animals and they had Big Golden Books and Little Golden Books and my mother I know she bought me every one of them and read them to me Did your dad read to you too Sometimes but I remember my mother reading to me the most I had aunts and my grandmother one of my grandmothers read to me too Um how old do you remember being Um well I know it was before I was five probably I know at least four and I m sure she read to me before that OK Um what do you remember any stories they told you your parents told you You mean like imaginary or fictional stories They made up stories sometimes my mother in particular she made up stories In fact I think she still does now But she made up a lot of stories then um sometimes they had us my sister and me in the stories and then sometimes the just were from I don t know where But she was very imaginative and creative and she made up lots of little stories for us Did they ever tell you factual stories about the area that you lived in Oh yes yes they did They told me lots of family stories about people that I knew about my grandparents and my great grandparents and um lots of family stories history history of the people we knew or heard about Um hum So that helped you learn about people that you had not necessarily met No hadn t seen some of them Um beyond my grandparents I hadn t seen any of them I guess but they began to take on a personality and something I could kind of see in my imagination Um hum Um what kind of things did you remember reading when you started to read Um I read some of the same books that they had read to me first and then as I got older I just got hungry for books I read my parents had a lot of books They had bookshelves um that my daddy built that were built in bookshelves and he um they were filled up with books and one summer I remember when I was a teenager I just made it a mission to read as many of those books as I could and I plowed they were fiction most of them There were some were history books in there too But I plowed through a bunch of them that summer I just kept reading until I finally had read almost every one of them Lots of them Do you remember the names of any of them They were um they were best seller type fiction from the um 40 s and 50 s and 60 s and on just they were members of a book club and they got a lot of books that way And whatever they got I read Um well let s see so do you think that those experiences helped you figure out the kinds of things you liked to read Like what the stories that they told you and read to you did Well they must have because I still read fiction I still read history I love historical novels I love to read just plain history um it must have rubbed off in some aspect because that s the kind of thing I still read Um well do you think it also helped when you became a parent that you naturally wanted to read to your kids Yeah I d always been a reader I d always been read to so I think yes I mean I did read to my children to you guys to you and your brothers What was that Oh that I had to let the dog in Excuse me All right now what Oh I know what I was going to tell you Um another thing my mother read to us was poetry and she also had books that had songs in it children s songs and so not only did she teach us the words to all those things but we sang them too And um she read I forgot about the nursery rhymes We learned all of those and the fairy tales the classics she read all of those to us But the poetry I remember and she taught us you know some poetry She remembered poems that she had learned when she was in high school I think she must have enjoyed it because she read them to us too Original poetry that she Not really original no it was uh poems by well known authors that you d find in a book but she had to memorize a lot of them and she but she read us children s poems too out of books books that were written for children I see Well as a teacher do you see reading as something that is still important in families today I think a lot of parents are still reading to their young children I I do think they read to them when they are little But as they get older I think children are so involved in other things They re going to lessons for this and that and sports and they re playing interactive games with their computer and uh watching TV and I think really they re not reading on their own like maybe we did when I was that age because we didn t have all those other things to do So I think maybe reading for young people is not as important They re still a few that you get in the classroom who are avid readers and they just stand out The others you can see in things like vocabulary and um just their general knowledge of things um they re not reading anymore They don t even watch the news but they re not reading the newspapers or new magazines or anything You see it I think you see it in their in how they do in school Does it affect their comprehension I think it probably does because they re just not reading as much Um the good students the ones who do well academically they re going to do OK anyway but the ones um there are some that would really benefit from continuing their reading either being read to or reading on their own for pleasure Right I don t think they do that so much anymore OK well um going back to you do you think uh are there any other ways you can see that reading and listening to stories and literacy um being exposed to literacy has um affected you in your life Hmm well I had some teachers that were really um influential about what I read and their love for literature I don t know rather how much it directly affected the fact that I was an English major in college but I know that um it didn t hurt to like to read when you have that major um there were some times I remember a fifth grade teacher and a seventh grade teacher who were especially um full of the love for reading and literature and they made that come alive for me as a student So I hope somehow along the way that I ve been able to pass that along to my kiddies Well I m sure you probably have Well um is there anything else you d like to add I can t think of anything but it s been nice chatting with you Thank you
