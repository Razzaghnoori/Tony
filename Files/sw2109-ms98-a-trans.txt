 okay Mary yes um the uh the latest one i ve seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um and it was uh it was called Manhunter actually uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental dysfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people uh just uh kill them with uh with as much blood and and guts as possible oh how awful it was true it was truly awful it was not one that i picked but uh uh it it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the FBI because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were FBI people and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the FBI about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who they re looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that and it was uh uh it was was pretty telling about the the the FBI and and their procedures i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional yeah i i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh going i guess yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes yeah yeah uh the most recent movie i saw uh i m afraid was uh well two two of them actually uh the Rain Man was one oh that was a great one wasn t that fabulous and and Driving Miss Daisy oh i loved it you know i haven t seen that one yet and i need to go see it oh you need to see that that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people yeah uh huh two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was Black and this all took place in the South and uh normally never the twain shall meet oh my um you bet especially in the South yes right and um uh it it it really was a fantastic movie the acting was phenomenal but as it it as i recall it got some Academy Awards didn t it oh yes Jessica Tandy won best actress and uh say oh yeah that s right it it might have one best picture too yes it did yes it did just as Rain Man uh with Dustin Hoffman yeah um hum that was uh that that was tremendous and Tom Cruise yeah i i think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from Dustin Hoffman but uh yes uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman yeah it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff and yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right there in Cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of Dayton oh is is the Kmart there that was oh well we do have a Kmart here you better believe it isn t there a Kmart everywhere that was so funny had to or was it Kmart uh he had to buy his underwear at Kmart yes right right yeah that was hilarious the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks yeah oh yes and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable yes yes well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things and everyone feels they are totally retarded yeah yeah yeah well because that s the way they they might seem outwardly but boy there s a lots going on in there that s right it s amazing yeah yeah and i the the i think the the best thing about Rain Man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease yes and only and and and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then again then again work with it toward a good end yes and the not not toward you know winning in Las Vegas for example right well the warmth that developed between them and again it i think was a picture of relationships yeah again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident yeah right right i was uh i was so impressed with that movie i saw it three times i can i can say tell you oh oh so much about that movie just because it it did you it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background i i have a a brother myself that s that s older and uh he s not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes yes and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers that was neat uh huh well that s tremendous that it s good because it does make you think about your own family yeah a lot and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother um hum no question he the he was he s one of these guys though that doesn t really like to go see movies like that he likes the bang them up shoot them up things um hum uh and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it but uh oh boy he was uh uh he he gave the the the best response that i ve heard him give of this type of movie for Rain Man i mean he he certainly didn t he only saw it one time and he didn t go back for more but uh but he he said he enjoyed it and and well he at least saw it one time yeah yeah yeah and and he really i don t know he he he s kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this i m like oh come on well just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had yeah it and to make it believable i mean i was i i was believing it i don t know about anybody else but i was it was great yes well i m sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them he did great well it s just uh been delightful talking with you yeah yeah you take care up there and uh let s hear it for the summertime absolutely i m ready for it they re predicting some more snow for our direction no oh no oh well take care take care now bye bye bye bye
