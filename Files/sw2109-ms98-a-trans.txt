              okay Mary   yes   um the uh the latest one ive seen uh had to do with a uh uh the uh basically a manhunt um and it was uh it was called Manhunter actually uh the uh the guy uh apparently had a a mental dysfunction in which he needed to go out and just slay people uh just uh kill them with uh with as much blood and and guts as possible   oh how awful   it  was true it was truly awful it was not one that i picked but uh       uh it it it did show some some uh some interesting things about the FBI because they were the the uh the characters trying trying to get him were FBI people and uh uh of the of the few good things that were in it it did show uh a lot about the FBI about the training and and how they go through training and how they try to to develop uh uh a mental picture of who theyre looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that and it was uh uh it was was pretty telling about the the the FBI and and their procedures   i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether that was fictional   yeah i i i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the FBI uh going i guess   yeah well they keep it rather secretive yes   yeah yeah   uh the most recent movie i saw uh im afraid was uh well two two of them actually uh the Rain Man was one   oh that was a great one   wasnt that fabulous and and Driving Miss Daisy   oh i loved it you know i havent seen that one yet and i need to go see it   oh you need to see that that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people   yeah uhhuh   two diametrically opposed people from the stand point that one was Jewish and one was Black and this all took place in the South and uh normally never the twain shall meet   oh my um you bet especially in the South   yes right and um uh it it it really was a fantastic movie the acting was phenomenal   but as it it as i recall it got some Academy Awards didnt it   oh yes Jessica Tandy won best actress and uh say   oh yeah thats right it it might have one best picture too     yes it did yes it did just as Rain Man uh with Dustin Hoffman   yeah umhum that was   uh that that was tremendous and Tom Cruise   yeah i i think it was more a lesson for Tom Cruise than anything else in terms of uh of how to act from Dustin Hoffman but uh   yes uh oh that was that was uh what the much of the hype was that Tom Cruise learned so much from Dustin Hoffman   yeah it must have been great just being with him on on a daily basis and seeing how he prepares for his for his lines and all that stuff and   yeah and a good bit of that was filmed right there in Cincinnati which is just forty five miles from from where i am where i actually live in a suburb of Dayton   oh is is the Kmart there  that was   oh well we do have a Kmart here you better believe it isnt there a Kmart everywhere   that was so funny had to or was it Kmart uh he had to buy his underwear at Kmart   yes right right yeah   that was hilarious the the i guess the the first the first uh scene in that movie that really got my attention uh concerning the the that disease and all that was when he uh dropped the the uh the toothpicks   yeah oh yes   and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image unbelievable   yes yes well you know there are people uh referred to as savants also uh who can do most phenomenal things and everyone feels they are totally retarded   yeah yeah yeah well because thats the way they they might seem outwardly but boy theres a lots going on in there   thats right its amazing   yeah yeah and i the the i think the the best thing about Rain Man was the uh the way that they put together the the real awfulness of the of the of the disease   yes   and only and and and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it you know and and and you need to to to work with it uh you know certainly on on a daily basis but then again then again work with it toward a good end   yes and the   not not toward you know winning in Las Vegas for example   right well the warmth that developed between them and again it i think was a picture of relationships   yeah   again the relationship uh between the two uh that uh never would have occurred uh by accident   yeah right right i was uh i was so impressed with that movie i saw it three times i can i can say tell you oh oh so much about that movie just because it it   did you   it really rang uh rang a lot of my uh my personal background i i have a a brother myself thats thats older and uh hes not you know nothing nothing of course serious is wrong with him but uh but we have gone through these these lapses of of a relationship somewhat sometimes   yes   and then you know uh for for for no real you know uh uh direct reason i guess uh we we get into uh uh a really good relationship for a while and then you know back and forth so i i was really able to to relate to the the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers that was neat   uhhuh well thats tremendous that its good because it does make you think about your own family   yeah a lot   and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother   umhum no question he the he was hes one of these guys though that doesnt really like to go see movies like that he likes the bang them up shoot them up things   umhum uh      and uh it it was like pulling teeth to go get him to to see it but uh oh boy he was uh uh he he gave the the the best response that ive heard him give of this type of movie for Rain Man  i mean he he certainly didnt he only saw it one time and he didnt go back for more but uh but he he said he enjoyed it and and     well he at least saw it one time   yeah yeah yeah and and he really i dont know he he hes kind of a Dustin Hoffman fan anyway but he was but before he saw the movie he said he was like disappointed that Dustin Hoffman would do this im like oh come on         well just think of what a phenomenal actor Dustin Hoffman is be able to do that to research it and be able to mimic a person uh uh with the kinds of problems that he had   yeah it and to make it believable i mean i was i i was believing it i dont know about anybody else but i was it was great   yes     well im sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them     he did great   well its just uh been delightful talking with you   yeah yeah you take care up there and uh  lets hear it for the summertime   absolutely im ready for it theyre predicting some more snow for our direction   no oh no oh well take care   take care now bye bye   bye bye
