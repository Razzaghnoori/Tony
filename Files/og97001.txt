number of potentially eligible food stamp recipients and increases the benefit level of certain households that are affected by these provisions The Department estimates that this action will increase the annual cost of the Food Stamp Program by as much as 145 million by fiscal year 1998 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Department reports that it reviewed this rule in relation to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 601 612 The Under Secretary for Food Nutrition and Consumer Services has certified under section

Register on October 17 1996 61 Fed Reg 54282 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 This Final Rule contains information collection requirements subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The reporting and recordkeeping burden associated with the application certification and continued eligibility of food stamp applicants was approved by OMB in 1995 under No 0584 0064 The added information required by this rule was included in the estimated burden in 1995 In the supplementary information the Department requests comments on the necessity of the new information requirement the accuracy of the burden estimate ways to enhance the use of the information collected and ways to further minimize the burden Executive Order No 12866 This rule was determined to be economically significant and is therefore subject to Executive Order No 12866 According to the Department the Office of Management and Budget has reviewed the rule Executive Order No 12778 According to the Department this rule was reviewed under Executive Order No 12778 Civil Justice Reform We note that the Executive Order has been replaced by Executive Order No

those requirements The supplementary information published with the Final Rule clearly states the preemptive effect to be given to the rule what if any retroactive effect its provisions may have and the administrative procedures to be followed prior to any judicial challenge to provisions of the rule Executive Order No 12372 According to the Department this rule was reviewed under Executive Order No 12372 Intergovernmental Review of Federal Programs and the Department determined that it was not covered by the Order Page 2 GAO OGC 97 1 Statutory Authorization for the rule Section 13921 of
