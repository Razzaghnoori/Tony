 All right this is Elissa Adams and Elissa you ve lived in Charlotte for Five years Five years OK Um First thing I want to ask is if you remember any books that you read as a child um or either books that were read to you either by a teacher or your parents or grandparents that you really remember enjoying Is there anything in particular that comes to mind No Nothing OK Um How about stories that uh you didn t read or weren t read to you but stories you know how people come up with stories I mean is there any were there any particular stories that people told you that you really liked hearing when you were growing up Not that I can remember no uh uh OK Um How about when you were in school Everybody has to read stuff in school Do you remember anything that um I mean there are always books that I liked I always had to read everything but uh there were certain things that I liked more than others do remember anything you liked in particular um about stuff you had to read maybe in your English class or um things like that Nothing Nothing I re that I recall No Not really No Not really OK Um Well what about now like um Thanksgiving s coming up and families get together for that and for Christmas when when you are um you know eating dinner or you know just talking and everything Are there particular stories either either family stories that you might tell or stories about um you know things that have happened to people in the past Or maybe stories that you know some people just make up stories to tell Are there any particular stories that your family tells now Oh Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up Family um Um Anything in particular Well do you remember one of those particular stories that um might come up when you re just sitting around reminiscing Well a lot of times we had company over Um I guess the time when I was four Hum Uh my mom took me for a it um doctor s visit uh it was a physical The doctor got did some tests and uh done some tests He dia diagnosed me as having acute leukemia and um this was when I lived back in Raleigh And uh Momma and I took trips back and forth to Chapel Hill and went through a couple of treatments and uh you know uh uh I had had to have different shots each time I went back Uh huh It was and the little I remember Momma telling me on the way you know just little things I don t know really let me think now Um I guess I was in a wing of the hospital where five or six other children in that whole wing of the hospital well in that that wing and everybody went through the same treatments Uh huh And uh Uh let s see Turned out after all the treatments were done I was the only survivor in the particular wing of the hospital Well you know to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then So when when that comes up does is your mom primarily the one who would tell it or your dad Both Either Actually my sister wrote a story on it Oh really And I have it back in my room It s just one of those things that you know you just don t think people want to hear much about these days It s just one of those things you know that happened And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh sidewalk and uh Mom was Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I went up to the front door and rang the doorbell And Mom came to the door and uh she saw like this glow of light all around me as if the Lord had definitely cured me of leukemia No more treatments no more What do you call it Um Nothing more Actually I went back to see my doctor and when I everything you know was fine Nothing you know nothing more to do He knew right then that it was a miracle miracle child Would you say that um your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story tells that part of the story the the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end Beginning to end OK What you said that you were four Four And I m sure you remember parts of it Um do you remember everything that your mom like when she s telling the story do you remember everything she tells or is some of it you remember and some of it you don t I pretty much remember the whole thing The whole thing I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on Yeah And uh I remember exactly going to the hospital and the uh waiting room but um yeah it s just something you don t know anybody goes through It was a very interesting experience Do you ever tell this story yourself Obviously you re telling it to me I have told it to several other people like my co workers and to this day they can t believe it they would have never known Uh huh Well you people don t know unless I share it with them Right The Lord helped me for a reason I was on this earth you know I ve lived on this earth for some reason I just don t know what it is yet Um huh Well as far as being a story this is not an ordinary story that every family tells obviously some do um is it something that comes up a lot or is it you know something that your family doesn t talk about a lot or is it something that comes up on a pretty regular basis Maybe once in a while Once in a while OK well um are there any particular stories related to this or anything else you enjoy reading now or um I mean is there anything looking at what you experienced is there anything any type of stories that you like to read now or that you like to hear about now Maybe other people who survived leukemia or other diseases that you know were life threatening like that or I mean do you ever try to find out other people s experiences I do enjoy reading the um stories related to Guideposts or uh what s another Reader s Digest they come in When cancer comes up I m just pretty pretty interested in it to find out what they went through and I can relate to it Other than that I get more out of reading Reader s Digest or Guide Guideposts stories Um OK Well thank you very much and thank you for sharing your story with me Oh
