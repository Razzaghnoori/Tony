want to ask is if you remember any books that you read as a child um or either books that were read to you either by a teacher or your parents or grandparents that you really remember enjoying         Is there anything in particular that comes to mind                     No                     Nothing         OK         Um         How about stories that uh you didnt read or werent read to you but stories you know how people come up with stories I mean is there any were there any particular stories that people told you that you really liked hearing when you were growing up                              Not that I can remember no uh uh                     OK         Um         How about when you were in school         Everybody has to read stuff in school         Do you remember anything that um I mean there are always books that I liked I always had to read everything but uh there were certain things that I liked more than others do remember anything you liked in particular um about stuff you had to read maybe in your English class or um things like that                     Nothing         Nothing I re that I recall         No         Not really                     No                     Not really                     OK         Um         Well what about now like um Thanksgivings coming up and families get together for that and for Christmas when when you are um you know eating dinner or you know just talking and everything         Are there particular stories either either family stories that you might tell or stories about um you know things that have happened to people in the past         Or maybe stories that you know some people just make up stories to tell         Are there any particular stories that your family tells now                     Oh         Lot of times we just sit around and just reminisce and go back to the time when we were growing up                  Family um                  Um         Anything in particular                     Well do you remember one of those particular stories that um might come up when youre just sitting around reminiscing                     Well a lot of times we had company over         Um I guess the time when I was four                     Hum                     Uh my mom took me for a it um doctors visit uh it was a physical         The doctor got did some tests and uh done some tests         He dia diagnosed me as having acute leukemia and um this was when I lived back in Raleigh         And uh Momma and I took trips back and forth to Chapel Hill and went through a couple of treatments and uh you know uh   uh I had had to have different shots each time I went back                     Uhhuh                     It was and the little I remember Momma telling me on the way you know just little things I dont know really let me think now         Um                  I guess I was in a wing of the hospital where five or six other children in that whole wing of the hospital well in that that wing and everybody went through the same treatments                     Uhhuh                     And uh                  Uh lets see         Turned out after all the treatments were done I was the only survivor in the particular wing of the hospital         Well you know to this day every now and then that particular story comes up every now and then                     So when when that comes up does is your mom primarily the one who would tell it or your dad                     Both                     Either                     Actually my sister wrote a story on it                     Oh really                     And I have it back in my room         Its just one of those things that you know you just dont think people want to hear much about these days         Its just one of those things you know that happened         And it was one afternoon I was out playing on the uh sidewalk and uh Mom was Mom was in the kitchen doing something and I was I guess pretending to act like a salesman and I went up to the front door and rang the doorbell         And Mom came to the door and uh she saw like this glow of light all around me as if the Lord had definitely cured me of leukemia         No more treatments no more                  What do you call it         Um                  Nothing more         Actually I went back to see my doctor and when I everything you know was fine         Nothing you know nothing more to do         He knew right then that it was a miracle miracle child                     Would you say that um your mom or you dad or whoever is telling the story tells that part of the story the the last part when you came to the door and she saw the glow of light would you say that they tell that part of the story more than any other part or do they tell the whole thing from beginning to end                     Beginning to end                     OK         What you said that you were four                     Four                     And Im sure you remember parts of it         Um do you remember everything that your mom like when shes telling the story do you remember everything she tells or is some of it you remember and some of it you dont                     I pretty much remember the whole thing                     The whole thing                     I was old enough at the time that I knew what was going on                     Yeah                     And uh I remember exactly going to the hospital and the uh waiting room but um yeah its just something you dont know anybody goes through         It was a very interesting experience                     Do you ever tell this story yourself         Obviously youre telling it to me                     I have told it to several other people like my coworkers and to this day they cant believe it they would have never known                     Uhhuh                     Well you people dont know unless I share it with them                     Right                     The Lord helped me for a reason         I was on this earth you know Ive lived on this earth for some reason I just dont know what it is yet                              Umhuh                  Well as far as being a story this is not an ordinary story that every family tells obviously some do um is it something that comes up a lot or is it you know something that your family doesnt talk about a lot or is it something that comes up on a pretty regular basis                     Maybe once in a while                     Once in a while         OK well um are there any particular stories related to this or anything else you enjoy reading now or um I mean is there anything looking at what you experienced is there anything any type of stories that you like to read now or that you like to hear about now         Maybe other people who survived leukemia or other diseases that you know were life threatening like that or I mean do you ever try to find out other peoples experiences                     I do enjoy reading the um stories related to Guideposts or uh whats another Readers Digest they come in                    When cancer comes up Im just pretty pretty interested in it to find out what they went through and I can relate to it         Other than that I get more out of reading Readers Digest or Guide Guideposts stories                     Um OK         Well thank you very much and thank you for sharing your story with me                     Oh youre welcome
