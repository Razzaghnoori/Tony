 Background The B cell antigen receptor BCR is a multi subunit complex that acts as a key sensor regulating the response of lymphocytes to their environment reviewed in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 In mature B cells activation through the BCR stimulates cellular proliferation and differentiation In immature B cells activation through the BCR induces either a state of unresponsiveness termed anergy or death by apoptosis depending on the physical nature and concentration of the antigen 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 In some B cell lymphomas activation through the BCR can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and tumor dormancy in vivo 19 26 27 28 The core of the multi subunit BCR is membrane bound immunoglobulin mIg which is non covalently associated with two co receptor molecules CD79a Ig and CD79b Ig products of the mb 1 and B29 genes 29 30 The biochemical changes induced by engagement of the BCR are extensive and include an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins hydrolysis of membrane phospholipids fluxes in the concentration of intracellular free Ca 2 activation of several serine threonine kinases including components of the MAP kinase pathway and changes in the activities of a panel of transcription factors Although much is known about the biochemical changes occurring in response to BCR mediated activation the differences in the signal transduction pathways that give rise to the different cellular responses following activation of the same receptor in immature versus mature cells have yet to be elucidated completely discussed in detail in refs 7 Some of the earliest changes that occur following BCR engagement are the activation of several non receptor protein tyrosine kinases PTKs including p55 blk Blk p59 fyn Fyn and p53 56 lyn Lyn of the Src family 31 Btk of the Itk Tec family 32 33 and p72 Syk Syk of the Syk ZAP 70 family 34 The importance of Syk in BCR signaling and lymphocyte development has been clearly demonstrated using gene inactivation approaches Although syk deficient mice die perinatally analysis of radiation chimeras reconstituted with fetal liver from syk deficient mice has demonstrated a block in the transition from proB cells to preB cells indicating that signal transduction through Syk is required for early B cell development 35 36 Inactivation of the syk gene in the chicken DT40 B cell lymphoma leads to a loss in the activation of PLC 2 the increase in intracellular free Ca 2 and the apoptotic response following engagement of the BCR In contrast BCR mediated activation of Lyn kinase was largely maintained 37 38 The Syk dependent signaling pathway appears to be facilitated by the adaptor molecule BLNK also known as SLP 65 and BASH 39 40 41 Syk can induce the phosphorylation of BLNK in co transfection experiments 42 which may be important for the recruitment of other Syk substrates like PLC 2 through a scaffolding function 42 BLNK function is necessary for signal transduction since no Ca 2 flux or PLC 2 phosphorylation is observed in response to BCR engagement in BLNK deficient DT40 cells 43 The formation of large protein complexes associated with the membrane receptor through specific protein protein interactions appears to be an early step in BCR mediated signal transduction In response to receptor activation Syk becomes non covalently associated with the BCR through tandem SH2 domains located in the amino terminal half of the protein 44 Following engagement of the BCR phosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in immunoreceptor tyrosine based activation motifs ITAMs found within the cytoplasmic tails of CD79a and CD79b provides docking sites for Syk localization 45 46 47 The ability of phosphorylated ITAM peptides to selectively enhance Syk kinase activity in vitro suggests that recruitment of Syk to the receptor complex may serve to activate the kinase in part through allosteric changes in the structure of the Syk protein 44 48 49 Upon activation Syk and the receptor complex become localized in detergent resistant cholesterol rich membrane microdomains lipid rafts resulting in the segregation of the BCR complex from other membrane components 50 In this report we describe the use of a mutant form of Syk that leads to the constitutive activation of the endogenous wildtype Syk kinase when introduced into B cells a dominant positive effect in the absence of detectable tyrosine phosphorylation It was anticipated that the presence of a constitutively active Syk enzyme could help in delineating the signaling events that occur upstream and downstream of Syk activation in the BCR signal transduction pathway However although these cells carry a highly active Syk kinase no evidence for downstream signaling was found These data indicate that activation of Syk kinase enzymatic activity in cells is insufficient for signal transduction Results BCR engagement induces apoptosis and Syk activation Stimulation through the BCR has been shown to induce changes in cell growth and viability in several B cell systems including the human Daudi chicken DT40 and mouse WEHI 231 and BCL 1 3B3 B cell lymphomas 12 19 27 38 51 52 53 For example stimulation of BCL 1 3B3 through the BCR suppressed exponential population growth in cell culture Figure 1A Using flow cytometry to measure membrane permeability and DNA content of cells BCR stimulation resulted in a 5 fold increase 6 5 to 32 6 in the proportion of apoptotic cells after 24 hrs Figure 1B BCR mediated tyrosine kinase activation is thought to be involved in the signal transduction cascades that give rise to these changes in cell growth and viability 19 To determine if BCR engagement under these conditions leads to Syk kinase activation increasing amounts of anti IgM were added to cultured BCL 1 3B3 cells An in vitro Syk specific immune complex kinase assay was used to measure changes in Syk activity in response to BCR stimulation Figure 2A In unstimulated and control treated BCL 1 3B3 cells lanes 1 and 6 low basal levels of Syk activity were detected The autophosphorylation activity of Syk increased dramatically with the addition of anti IgM Syk activity responded in a dose dependent manner and reached a plateau at 10 g lane 4 in which activity was 15 fold higher than in unstimulated cells The kinetics of BCR induced Syk activation was analyzed to determine the rates of Syk kinase activation and inactivation following initial engagement of the BCR Figure 2B Maximal Syk activation occurred within 1 min of receptor engagement lane 3 and decreased to intermediate levels at times thereafter lanes 4 and 5 Additional experiments revealed that even 1 hour after BCR stimulation Syk activity remained slightly elevated in comparison with unstimulated cells data not shown The increase in Syk activity in response to BCR engagement in BCL 1 3B3 was accompanied by an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk protein in cells Figure 2C No phosphorylated tyrosine residues were detected on Syk in unstimulated or control treated cells lanes 1 4 and 5 Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk peaked after 30 seconds of BCR stimulation lane 2 and decreased by 5 minutes lane 3 The rapid induction of tyrosine phosphorylation and its subsequent reduction paralleled the kinetics of Syk kinase activity Figure 2B Expression of a K395A 3F mutant Syk results in a dominant positive effect BCR mediated apoptosis was preceded by an increase in Syk kinase activity in BCL 1 3B3 Syk has also been implicated in BCR induced apoptosis found in the chicken B lymphoma line DT40 38 To determine the role of Syk kinase activation in the apoptotic response in BCL 1 3B3 overexpression of a mutant form of Syk was used in an effort to alter the level of Syk activation following BCR engagement Site specific mutations were placed in two regions of Syk A lysine at amino acid position 395 predicted to be critical for kinase activity was replaced by an alanine Figure 3A Three carboxy terminal tyrosines positions 624 6 hypothesized to play regulatory roles were replaced by phenylalanines Based on the effects of similar mutations in other kinases it was expected that the combination of these replacements in K395A 3F Syk might produce a dominant negative effect BCL 1 3B3 cells were infected with defective retroviruses expressing wildtype or K395A 3F mutant Syk Clones expressing varying levels of wildtype or mutant Syk mRNA were identified using a three primer reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR assay Figure 3B Using this approach PCR products differing in size were simultaneously amplified from the transgene and the endogenous syk cDNAs in the same PCR reaction K395A 3F Syk expression varied relative to endogenous Syk and ranged from undetectable levels Figure 3C lanes 8 10 to equivalent expression levels lane 4 The highest transgene expression was found in clone 2 1 2 The ICKA was used to determine the effect of K395A 3F Syk expression on endogenous Syk Syk activity was measured in parental BCL 1 3B3 Figure 3D lanes 1 3 and cells that express the K395A 3F Syk molecule lanes 4 15 Surprisingly cells that expressed the K395A 3F Syk molecule displayed constitutive Syk activity in unstimulated cells lanes 4 7 and 10 A correlation between constitutive kinase activity and mRNA expression levels of K395A 3F Syk was observed compare Figure 3Cwith Figure 3D clones with higher levels of K395A 3F Syk mRNA e g clone 2 1 2 had higher levels of constitutive kinase activity while clones with lower levels of K395A 3F Syk mRNA e g clones 2 1 6 2 4 2 and 2 1 7 had lower levels of constitutive kinase activity Thus it appeared that introduction of this mutant form of Syk resulted in a dominant positive effect on kinase activity rather than a dominant negative effect To determine if the observed Syk activity is an artefact of the in vitro assay a series of immune complex kinase assays of Syk precipitated from mixtures of lysates was performed Most significantly a mixture of a lysate from unstimulated BCL 1 3B3 cells harbouring wildtype Syk with a lysate from unstimulated DT40 expressing the K395A 3F mutant Syk see below at 1 5 1 1 and 5 1 ratios showed no activity in the immune complex kinase assay data not shown These data indicate that the mutant Syk protein must be expressed together with the wildtype enzyme in cells to generate the dominant positive phenotype and suggest that it s effect is indirect Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the kinase activation is occurring during the isolation procedure the results of the mixing experiment suggest that the wildtype Syk enzyme is active in vivo under these conditions To determine if expression of the K395A 3F Syk mutant resulted in a change in BCR responsiveness the kinetics of Syk activation were measured in clones 2 1 2 and 2 1 6 following BCR stimulation Figure 3E Incubation with anti IgM induced a rapid increase and delayed reduction in Syk activity with kinetics similar to that of control clones Although the basal levels of Syk activity were elevated in clones that expressed the K395A 3F Syk molecule the cells were still responsive to BCR signaling To determine if the constitutive Syk activity observed in unstimulated cells carrying the K395A 3F transgene was accompanied by constitutive Syk tyrosine phosphorylation the levels of phosphotyrosine on Syk were determined by immunoblotting after immunoprecipitation Figure 3F Syk from unstimulated BCL 1 3B3 and vector control clones had undetectable levels of phospho tyrosine lanes 1 3 4 and 6 upper panel Syk from unstimulated clones carrying the K395A 3F transgene which had constitutive Syk activity also had undetectable levels of tyrosine phosphorylation lane 7 9 10 and 12 upper panel Thus despite constitutive Syk activity observed in these infectants tyrosine phosphorylation did not correlate with activity compare lanes 7 and 10 of Figure 3Dwith lanes 10 and 7 of Figure 3F Syk from all clones analyzed became tyrosine phosphorylated after BCR stimulation lanes 2 5 8 and 11 It was possible that more Syk in the immunoprecipitate was required for detection by the anti phosphotyrosine antibody However even when more protein was present in the immunoprecipitate little if any phosphotyrosine was detected in unstimulated cells lanes 13 and 15 These results indicate that Syk activation does not require tyrosine phosphorylation Two hypotheses were considered to explain the high level of Syk autophosphorylation in the ICKA In unstimulated clones expressing the K395A 3F Syk molecule the possibility existed that the intense band observed in the ICKA Figure 3Dlanes 4 7 and 10 was not due to increased Syk activity but rather to the ability of the background levels of active endogenous Syk to preferentially phosphorylate the K395A 3F Syk molecule due to possible changes in its three dimensional structure If the kinase activity of Syk was truly higher in cells expressing K395A 3F Syk enhanced phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate would also be observed To examine the ability of Syk from cells that expressed K395A 3F Syk to phosphorylate an exogenous Syk target c3b GST was added to the Syk ICKA Figure 4 lower panels The exogenous substrate was phosphorylated by Syk from unstimulated clones expressing the K395A 3F Syk molecule lane 7 lower panel demonstrating that the Syk enzyme isolated from these cells was highly active Although activated endogenous Syk was the likely source of the constitutive Syk activity observed in clones that expressed the K395A 3F Syk molecule the possibility remained that the activity might originate from the K395A 3F Syk molecule itself As proof that the K395A 3F Syk molecule was inactive as predicted K395A 3F Syk and wildtype Syk expression constructs were transfected into syk negative DT40 cells and activity measured by the ICKA Figure 5 While wildtype human Syk was capable of autophosphorylation lane 2 upper panel the K395A 3F Syk mutant was not lanes 3 and 4 demonstrating that this molecule was kinase dead This result indicates that the constitutive Syk activity identified in BCL 1 3B3 clones expressing K395A 3F Syk was likely due to endogenous Syk and not the K395A 3F Syk mutant Expression of the K395A 3F Syk molecule resulted in constitutive activation of Syk However overexpression of a full length unmutated Syk might also generate the same phenotype To determine if the constitutive phenotype was a result of the specific mutations introduced or if overexpression of a full length Syk molecule was sufficient to give high basal kinase activity Syk activity was analyzed from BCL 1 3B3 cells that expressed a wildtype human Syk transgene Figure 6 The levels of wild type human Syk expression were determined using the three primer RT PCR assay described earlier Figure 6A Shown are representative clones that expressed low levels or equivalent levels of human Syk mRNA as compared with the levels of endogenous Syk mRNA lanes 3 and 4 upper panel The levels of Syk activity in unstimulated cells expressing wildtype Syk were indistinguishable from the levels in unstimulated controls Figure 6B compare lanes 1 4 and 7 None of the clones analyzed contained elevated constitutive Syk activity in unstimulated cells demonstrating that this phenotype requires the presence of the unique mutations introduced Constitutive Syk activity is insufficient for downstream signaling In syk deficient DT40 cells BCR induced apoptosis was abrogated indicating that Syk was necessary for this cellular response 38 Having established cells with constitutive Syk activity it was now possible to establish if Syk activation is sufficient for any of the signaling responses However no impact on cell growth in culture was found in clones with high constitutive Syk activity nor was the growth suppressive effect of anti IgM treatment enhanced Figure 7A Likewise no significant difference in apoptosis was observed between clones with constitutive Syk activity and controls Figure 7B Thus Syk kinase activity alone was insufficient to signal a cellular response in BCL 1 3B3 However the presence of Syk kinase activity was still expected to lead to increased phosphorylation of protein targets in the absence of stimulation through the BCR To examine this possibility the levels of protein phosphotyrosine were evaluated by immunoblotting Figure 7C Basal levels of phosphotyrosine containing protein were detected in all clones analyzed lanes 1 4 7 and 10 However no increase was observed in cells with constitutive Syk activity After stimulation of BCR many intracellular proteins became highly phosphorylated on tyrosine to equivalent levels in all clones regardless of the level of Syk kinase activity lanes 2 5 8 and 11 These data indicate that despite elevated basal and induced Syk kinase activity in clones carrying the K395A 3F Syk mutant global phosphorylation of cellular proteins was not increased The anti phosphotyrosine immunoblot used is a relatively crude measure of Syk kinase activity in vivo The possibility remained that any specific effects of constitutive Syk on its downstream targets might be masked by the combined effects of the other tyrosine kinases activated in response to BCR signaling To focus the investigation on downstream events of Syk activation the phosphorylation state of PLC 2 an authentic direct downstream target of Syk 54 was evaluated No PLC 2 phosphorylation was detected in unstimulated clones containing constitutive Syk activity Figure 7D lanes 4 and 7 upper panel In contrast PLC 2 was rapidly and highly phosphorylated after stimulation of BCR lanes 5 and 8 As in the total cellular phosphotyrosine analysis the levels of phosphotyrosine on PLC 2 were indistinguishable between control and experimental cell lines Discussion Previous studies have identified apoptosis and cell cycle arrest as mechanisms of BCR induced growth arrest in BCL 1 3B3 cells 19 The studies presented here have demonstrated that stimulation of the BCR resulted in the rapid and transient activation of the non receptor tyrosine kinase Syk Previous studies have implicated Syk in BCR induced apoptosis in other cell lines 37 38 To examine the putative role of Syk in BCR induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in BCL 1 3B3 we attempted to alter Syk activity through the expression of mutant forms of Syk When the K395A 3F Syk mutant was co expressed with endogenous Syk in BCL 1 3B3 cells a constitutive Syk activation phenotype was observed The presence of elevated Syk activity allowed us to evaluate the role of Syk activation on the growth and viability of BCL 1 3B3 and on other biochemical changes associated with BCR signaling To our surprise no evidence for downstream signaling was found in cells with high levels of Syk kinase activity Two novel observations were obtained from these studies First expression of the K395A 3F Syk molecule in BCL 1 3B3 results in constitutive activation of endogenous Syk Since K395A 3F Syk was enzymatically inactive when transfected into Syk deficient DT40 cells the observed constitutive kinase activity must be derived from endogenous Syk and not from the K395A 3F Syk protein Mutant molecules that inhibit the activation or function of the wildtype counterpart in the same cell have been defined as dominant negative molecules Since K395A 3F Syk has an activating effect on endogenous wildtype Syk we propose that K395A 3F Syk is a dominant positive molecule It is likely that the replacement of the three carboxy terminal tyrosine residues with phenylalanine is necessary for the dominant positive phenotype Zeitlmann et al found that transfection of a mutant Syk expression construct carrying only the 3F alteration into a T cell lines could overcome the need for TCR occupancy for IL 2 expression in PMA treated cells 62 However since the mutant Syk used retained kinase activity these studies could not distinguish between a gain of function effect versus a dominant positive effect as found here The mechanism by which the K395A 3F Syk molecule activates endogenous Syk is unknown One hypothesis is that a negative regulator of Syk is bound and sequestered by the K395A 3F Syk molecule By sequestering this negative regulator expression of the mutant Syk molecules gives rise to the activation of the endogenous wildtype protein in the absence of specific stimulation leading to a constitutively active Syk phenotype Several negative regulators of Syk have been reported BCR induced interaction between Cbl and Syk increases the susceptibility of Syk to proteolysis 55 possibly through enhancement of ubiquitination 56 Expression of a dominant negative SHP 1 phosphatase in the mature murine B cell line K46 resulted in an increase in BCR induced Syk kinase activity as measured by C3b phosphorylation in an ICKA and enhanced BCR induced Ca 2 fluxes 57 It remains to be determined if interference with any of these known regulatory proteins is responsible for the dominant positive effect The second novel observation that Syk kinase enzymatic activity was insufficient for signal transduction suggests that multiple biochemical processes may be required for the Syk dependent step of signal transduction Presently it is unclear what biochemical changes other than enzymatic activation are required However in light of the present model of signaling through the BCR perhaps appropriate subcellular localization to the BCR protein complex and the ITAMs of CD79b Ig is also required In support of this hypothesis Syk did not co precipitate with IgM in K395A 3F Syk containing cells without stimulation data not shown This is not surprising since the ITAMs in CD79 which are proposed to be docking sites for Syk are unlikely to be phosphorylated in the absence of BCR stimulation since phosphorylation of these residues likely requires activation of Src family tyrosine kinases expressed in B cells Therefore despite constitutive Syk kinase activity the ITAMs in the dominant positive expressing cells remain hypophosphorylated because kinases that are upstream of Syk and or are Syk independent are not active in the absence of BCR crosslinking This result implies that in addition to enzymatic activation localization of Syk to the BCR might be required for functional signal transduction There is precedence for this model Mutation of tyrosine 130 in Syk to glutamic acid had two effects First the Y130E mutation resulted in constitutive activity of Syk Second molecules with the Y130E mutations did not co immunoprecipitate with the BCR 58 A second example involves an in vitro model of histamine release in the Syk deficient RBL 2H3 cell line 59 When tyrosines 519 and 520 were mutated and introduced into Syk deficient RBL 2H3 cells these Syk molecules were capable of phosphorylation of c3b substrate in an ICKA However despite this activity there was no high affinity IgE receptor Fc RI induced degranulation Further analysis demonstrated neither increases in phosphotyrosine nor phosphorylation of PLC 2 Alternatively the absence of signal transduction in the presence of Syk activity may be related to its ability to interact with its downstream targets Within Syk there are two phosphotyrosine binding SH2 domains allowing for protein protein interactions In addition phosphotyrosine residues in Syk would provide additional sites for protein protein interactions Perhaps further modification is necessary to increase its affinity for downstream binding partners e g BLNK or PLC 2 The absence of signaling in the presence of constitutive enzymatic activity described for Syk in different systems implies that execution of the Syk dependent step in this signaling cascade is a multi step process Multiple requirements for progression through this step in the signal transduction pathway may serve to integrate the cellular response to multiple environmental cues In this case the ultimate cellular response to the activation of the BCR signaling pathway is cell death Each of these required steps may provide a regulatory site where other signal transduction pathways could intersect the default response to antigenic stimulation giving rise to an altered cellular outcome Conclusions In summary here we describe the use of a mutant Syk construct to produce a dominant positive effect on endogenous Syk activation in the absence of BCR engagement The presence of a dominant positive effect under these conditions suggests that the Syk kinase is kept inactive in resting cells by an active suppression mechanisms which is disrupted by the presence of the K395A 3F Syk mutant The specific target for this dominant positive effect remains to be identified Although the Syk enzyme is active under these conditions it lacks any detectable phosphorylation on tyrosine residues This observation indicates that the current paradigm that Syk activation results from tyrosine phosphorylation may be incorrect Finally the presence of a highly active Syk enzyme in cells was insufficient for downstream signal transduction as evidenced by a lack of change in global tyrosine phosphorylation phosphorylation of PLC 2 or enhanced spontaneous or induced apoptosis These data suggest that the Syk dependent step in signal transduction requires biochemical changes in addition to enzymatic activation perhaps proper localization of the active enzyme to a signaling receptor complex Methods Cell Culture The in vitro adapted BCL 1 3B3 cell line was previously selected from the BCL
