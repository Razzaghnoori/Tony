 okay so have you seen any good movies lately uh well let s see i think the best one i saw was probably Sleeping with the Enemy oh i haven t seen that one yet have you seen Silence of the Lambs uh no i haven t seen that one yet either oh well tell how about uh Awakenings no but i ve heard it s really good okay well have you seen LA Story no i haven t seen that did you uh yeah i have what did you think of it uh well it was it was entertaining it was funny Steve Martin did a pretty good job huh yeah uh it s uh they portray the LA lifestyle uh huh and it s uh quite a lot uh crazier in the movie than it is in actuality i ve been to Los Angeles before oh really and nothing s as crazy as what they how they uh uh describe it in the movie yeah well i saw a few of the uh little coming attractions you know it looked really cute but it s kind of fun if you ve been there before you ll you ll be able to relate to uh to the humor that they have in the movie yeah well i ve never been to California i ve lived in Washington but not California so okay i thought it was interesting how they cast that movie with uh Victoria Tennant as his uh love interest in the movie because she is his wife in reality oh i didn t even realize that that s interesting hum so that added something to the movie yeah i guess so did you see Home Alone no i haven t seen that one yet either oh well i was kind of disappointed in that one okay i ve heard so much about it that you know it s such a great movie and you ought to go see it over and over again and uh i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble yeah i i heard that uh it was a little pretentious that the family was very wealthy and uh huh it just didn t uh appeal to uh to as many people as it as it could have yeah yeah i was kind of disappointed but um are you intending to see Silence of the Lambs have you yeah i ve heard that s really really good uh friend of mine at work saw that yeah it s pretty intriguing yeah it s it s a very unusual movie kind of keeps you well the first part of it wasn t as scary and intense as i thought it was going to be but toward the end it got got more that way well i understand it has a real complicated plot yeah yeah it really does the only way they can get any information is through someone who s so crazy and bizarre it s hard to tell what he s going to do next so yeah so it was a good movie uh huh and then i thought Sleeping with the Enemy was even scarier but that s because it was about a man chasing a woman and that s my big fear so okay yeah um i was trying to think if i ve seen any others lately but that probably pretty much sums up i don t get to go to the movie too much you seen uh Ghost no i haven t as a matter of fact it s on at the dollar movie around here and i was wanting to go yeah it s been out for quite a while already yeah i heard it was really good that is a is it is a very good movie yeah uh Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore did a really good job very uh uh emotional put it that way uh yeah um hum yeah yeah that s the way i understand as a matter of fact my sister believes in uh ghosts and she said that she thinks that s a real uh true portrayal of what it would be like well that s interesting the special effects were great i have to admit that yeah yeah i i want to see that as a matter of fact i intended to go one night and didn t get to so okay hopefully we ll go soon you seen uh Edward Scissorhands no i haven t oh it s as a matter of fact i don t know anything about that movie what it is is that funny or it s uh yeah it s somewhat of a a bittersweet comedy huh it stars uh Johnny Depp uh huh he s uh from 21 Jump Street right and uh he portrays uh Edward Scissorhands this uh creation of uh Vincent Price uh kind of a uh scientist hum who uh creates a person uh out of uh oh just uh spare parts and i guess uh cookie cutters or whatever oh really huh it it s kind of interesting he he doesn t complete the job though and his hands are are are not finished so he has scissors on the ends of his arms yeah oh oh huh and uh is is found in this uh castle by uh oh it s the local Avon lady or something like that uh huh and she takes him into her house and uh he learns what life is like uh in a uh moderately normal suburb oh well that is interesting it s uh it it is entertaining it s kind of like a fairy tale yeah huh with a sad ending but uh yeah oh it s uh uh it was different yeah well that sounds pretty yeah is it something uh that you could take a child to a fun movie oh yes certainly um hum oh i have a six and a half year old that d probably enjoy that oh i think it d be great for a for a a child yeah huh it does have a a a fairy tale like uh quality oh oh well i ll have to that have to take her to see that scenery is is very entertaining uh and what he does with the with the scissors and uh um hum uh doing uh certain types of landscaping uh working with shrubberies hum uh he uh carves out different figures in t he in the plants plants shrubs oh really huh wow that sounds like that would have been a hard movie to make uh yeah i they spent they evidently spent a lot of time on uh on the scenery for that the special effects yeah i can imagine have you seen The Field over at the Inwood no i haven t that s i thought that was an outstanding film huh i don t know anything about that either with with Richard Harris uh huh uh he plays a uh kind of a patriarch in uh Ireland nineteen twenties Ireland um hum uh huh and uh it s about a uh piece of land that he rents uh he works uh a piece of land and rents it from uh an old English uh widow hum but uh he he has an obsession with this piece of land that he wants to own it and won t allow anyone else to uh to uh control that land and when the widow puts it up for uh for sale uh he claims that it s his even though he cannot afford uh the price the price hum um hum it uh goes to an American American uh who has uh ancestors from from the area um hum he s trying to uh apparently trying to uh uh gain some background on his his heritage from uh Ireland so he s buying this piece of land to try to introduce civilization to the area um hum hum and uh there are just a lot of uh interesting i have never been to the Inwood theatre well they well they have more of of the artsy type of uh films a lot of foreign films there um hum yeah do you go there often no not too often uh but uh this was a uh just a good opportunity to go see that movie it was uh yeah hum i really enjoyed it yeah well it sounds interesting well does this um however this is set up tell you when you ve talked for five minutes or well they cut you off after ten do you oh really oh that s interesting yeah oh okay well i didn t know this is the first call that i ve made so i wasn t real sure if you oh okay if it tells you when you ve talked long enough or let me think if i have seen anything else that s interesting lately well getting back to uh to that other uh film uh with uh which one was that with Jodie Foster uh huh yeah Silence of the Lambs um hum uh Silence of the Lambs yeah i didn t really care for her her earlier films uh Taxi Driver or The Accused and i was kind of wondering if this was uh a little different style um hum um hum oh i m sure departure from what she s done before i haven t seen either one of the other films she was in but uh my husband said that he thought she was playing a real different role in in this show yeah okay see i never did care for her too much in the other films so yeah friend of mine at work says that this one is a lot different that uh she s really good yeah i i one of the things that i was really impressed with uh she has to have an accent that she does a real good job with i it sounds so real that she sounds like she s from that area of the country all right that s interesting because i yeah uh i think it s like in the i don t know Alabama Georgia South Carolina area or something it s and she does a real good job sounding like she s from that area okay but um i thought she did a really good job well that s good i ll have to go see that yeah it s been highly recommended the man that plays this bizarre character is really i don t know if i ve ever seen him in a film before i don t even Anthony Hopkins oh with Anthony Perkins yeah i didn t remember him from anything else i i m sure i ve seen him in other movies but he looked so his his face the entire movie just haunts you uh huh and uh he did a real good job sounds like i ll have to go see that one soon yeah yeah there was a big crowd there i think it s uh definitely getting some good ratings okay yeah Sleeping with the Enemy with Julia Roberts i haven t seen Pretty Woman yet uh have you seen that one um hum no i haven t because she was just on uh the People s Choice Awards the other night oh really and won uh a People s Choice Award for uh best uh female entertainer hum as well as uh an award for this movie oh i didn t realize that well i thought it was i really enjoyed that movie i mean it scared me more than the other one but it was real intense to me i enjoyed it okay well i ll have to go see that one too yeah yeah it was it has a real eerie beginning and the man that she s married to is obviously crazy but at the first you don t really know about that and it s real interesting the way it starts out so uh i thought it was really interesting sounds like another obsession type movie uh like Fatal Attraction yeah yeah it is it s a lot like that i thought Fatal Attraction was a good movie did you like it uh i thought that uh the movie the movie that it was based on was better i didn t like the ending but oh really that was uh which one was that with uh Clint Eastwood and Donna Mills hum it came out in nineteen seventy trying i didn t know it was based on another film oh it was called Play Misty for Me um and i thought that was a very good film and Fatal Attraction was on the same theme almost identical um hum oh i see huh but uh i didn t care for Fatal Attraction as much huh well i liked it until toward the end i i didn t care for it too much but no it gets quite violent yeah yeah and it s kind of unbelievable too yeah the this woman can live through everything she lived through right yeah well well i can t think of much else to talk about okay well i think we re reaching our limit anyways so yeah i think so well thanks for calling all right i appreciate it thanks a lot bye uh huh good bye
