 Background DNA arrays variously called microarrays complementary DNA cDNA arrays gene arrays and gene expression arrays have been widely heralded and are becoming increasingly integrated into the current research and future plans of many laboratories 1 The main utility of DNA arrays lies in their ability to report the expression level of thousands of genes simultaneously although other uses are being continually introduced There are an increasing number of different commercially available DNA array formats These include the glass slide based oligonucleotide array system 2 3 4 developed by Affymetrix the glass slide based cDNA clone Gene Expression Microarray GEM line from Incyte Genomics IGI the filter and glass slide based Atlas arrays developed by Clontech Laboratories composed of selected regions of PCR amplified gene sequences filter based GeneFilters from Research Genetics RGI which like IGI s GEMs utilize partial or full length cDNA clones Many research institutions are also investing in core facilities that after the fashion of the Brown laboratory 5 6 are producing their own filter and or glass arrays from PCR products of clones from the Integrated Molecular Analysis of Genomes and their Expression IMAGE consortium or other clones A detailed explanation of the differences between these various array formats and other aspects of current DNA array technology can be found in the review by Rockett and Dix 7 The efficiency sensitivity and reproducibility of commercially available arrays is good and improving but they are limited in three main areas their cost is still somewhat prohibitive for some labs the number of species for which arrays are available is small the genes available are limited in scope and number Although many companies offer a custom service for producing arrays the process is expensive and cumbersome and does not lend itself well to the commonly changing needs of the researcher Most commercially available off the shelf arrays contain a cosmopolitan series of well characterized genes expressed across many cell types As most researchers focus on one or two tissues only this global approach to array production is somewhat wasteful In many cases it would be far more useful to report on the expression of only those genes that are part of the transcriptome of the tissue of interest Thus a group interested in the liver may be better served by a chip containing only those genes expressed in the liver and a group such as our own interested in the testis should find more value in a testis expression chip We are interested in the effects of environmentally induced male infertility with a focus on using components of the stress response as a means to indicate qualitate or even quantitate the degree of harmful exposure It may also be possible to use this gene expression data to elucidate the mechanisms of action of toxic agents and identify the causative agent thus facilitating better preventive or palliative action The development of an in house array is a complex process however which must overcome a number of logistical problems We describe here our approach to developing a testis expression array including the gene selection and printing procedures We have assembled two lists of genes one of 950 mouse genes and one of 960 human genes that are expressed in either mouse testis or human testis or both These two distinct sets of testis expressed genes containing 764 homologs have enabled us to focus our resources more efficiently and begin to develop a picture of gene expression patterns in environmentally and genetically challenged mouse models It is anticipated that the production of human testis expression arrays will follow thus permitting the direct comparison of gene expression networks in mouse models and human clinical samples This may aid in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying genetically and environmentally induced male infertility Results and discussion Availability of a publicly accessible clone Although suppliers such as Clontech IGI and the IMAGE consortium 12 provide public access to a vast number of full length and partial clones from a number of species not all genes are represented by a publicly accessible clone of the gene or gene fragment This problem is most often encountered when newly discovered or characterized genes have been selected from the literature Availability of a sequence verified clone It is important to select sequence verified clones where possible to ensure that correct sequences are obtained For example clones provided by IMAGE by far the largest selection of publicly available clones can be mislabeled between 7 and 13 13 3 end clones When the choice is available with UniGene database 14 verification selection of a 3 end clone is desirable as the inclusion of the 3 UTR will in most cases enhance the specificity of the gene fragment for its gene in the hybridization process Length of clone Selected clones should be checked to confirm that they are not so small that they allow a high degree of non specific hybridization and not so long as to introduce concerns about being able to amplify the insert by PCR for printing on the array Gene fragments in the range of 200 1 000 base pairs bp are optimal It should also be recognized that IMAGE and other clones are frequently reassigned to different gene clusters in the UniGene database and that UniGene numbers and the genes clones they represent can be removed at any point as new information becomes available Consequently the tracking and naming of clones is of central importance in projects such as this and gene lists should be constructed to provide as much detail as possible Thus it is prudent to include for each gene such details as the UniGene number and note the build from which it was taken the IMAGE or other clone number the GenBank accession number 15 the SwissProt number 16 the source of selection which may be of value if questions subsequently arise concerning specific clones Selected details UniGene number IMAGE number and gene name of the final gene lists for our mouse and human DNA arrays are shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively available with the complete version of this article online The 764 homologous clones are shown in Table 1 available with the complete version of this article online More detailed lists have been posted on the US Environmental Protection Agency MicroArray Consortium EPAMAC website 17 where they are freely accessible as a public resource Assembling the list of genes to be included in a tissue specific array is perhaps the most challenging part of the process The subsequent acquisition of clones can be as simple as ordering the entire set from a sole supplier In this case the assembly of the gene list will be limited by the supplier s library However distributors of IMAGE clones clearly have a very large selection and are continuously sequence verifying and purging this vast resource of phage contamination Proprietary clones are also available from companies such as Clontech and IGI Although these tend to be a little more costly than IMAGE clones they include genes that are not available through IMAGE To prepare DNA arrays clones of the genes to be printed are grown the plasmids containing the gene fragments isolated and the gene fragments amplified using PCR see 18 for detailed protocols This can be done in house or as in this case provided as a contract service by the clone supplier In preparing PCR products of a clone set for printing it is prudent to note that clone growth may not occur in some cases Six of our 963 requested clones 0 6 were scored as no grows However spots representing two of these clones produced positive results in our TestisFilter hybridizations This suggests that in these cases limited bacterial growth did actually occur permitting the isolation of small amounts of plasmid and subsequent production of small amounts of PCR product whose levels were below the detection limit of the gels used to check them Hybridization signals from such spots should be treated with caution as it is not known whether enough PCR product was deposited onto the membrane to be in excess of the target cDNA in the test sample In addition PCR amplification of IMAGE and other clones can be expected to fail at a small rate Of the 963 original amplifications carried out by RGI 45 4 7 did fail and had to be repeated under more carefully controlled conditions to obtain product Furthermore a small number of PCR products can be expected to produce multiple bands or smearing Such results are most likely the result of mispriming events in the PCR reaction although it is possible that the original stocks may be contaminated with one or more additional clones In fact we observed that 5 5 53 963 of our PCR products contained a double PCR band 3 0 29 963 contained a triple band 0 3 3 963 contained a quadruple band and 0 5 5 963 produced a smear Despite these anomalous amplifications we printed from all wells without re racking to eliminate the anomalous PCR products Although this saved time and resources the caveat is that significant results from all subsequent array hybridizations must be checked against this list of potentially spurious clones If hybridizations with the spots containing multiple band PCR products repeatedly give statistically significant changes it should be possible to isolate and sequence the different PCR products and use this information for confirmatory analysis perhaps using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR Genes from the mouse testis expressed gene list were procured as both clones and PCR products from a single supplier RGI Five additional reactions were added from PCR amplifications of heat shock protein clones available in our laboratory This final set of PCR products was prepared for printing PCR products were then printed as filter arrays by a contractor Radius Biosciences Relatively small amounts of DNA were required to produce multiple arrays We obtained 84 arrays with each spot printed in duplicate from approximately 3 g of PCR product resuspended in 12 l 3x SSC Preliminary hybridizations were carried out on the arrays with adult mouse testicular RNA from C57BL 6 mice Figure 2a b Bromochloroacetic acid BCA 216 mg kg day or water was administered daily by gavage for 14 days RNA extracted from these testes and hybridized against the TestisFilters produced measurable signal in the duplicate spots of virtually all the arrayed genes confirming the expression of the genes we selected At the time of writing there were a small number of genes 14 that did not appear to be expressed in the testis of either this BCA model or a second metallothionein knockout 129SvPCJ background 19 model which was also investigated Four of these genes were no grows The other ten may have represented genes that were not expressed in the two models we tested although they could also represent clones that had been UniGene clustered with the wrong gene As described earlier the selection of some of the genes on this mouse testis array was based on results with human expression arrays showing that our cross species approach to gene selection is a viable means of identifying candidate genes for such tissue specific arrays We also produced slide based DNA arrays of our testis expressed clone set at the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics Wayne State University Detroit MI A picture of one such array stained with POPO 3 iodide Molecular Probes is shown in Figure 3 Experimental samples had not been applied to this array at the time of writing but the POPO 3 stain clearly shows the quality of printing and the configuration of the sub grid of spots within the array The TestisSlides were printed on bar coded slides the numbers being visible to both the naked eye and in the fluorescence scanned image The use of such slides is highly recommended as it ensures that hybridizations with different RNA populations can be identified quickly and linked unambiguously to subsequent image and data analysis Data acquisition from both the TestisFilter and TestisSlide requires that the identity of the cDNA spots be related to their respective positions on filter or glass slide This information can be embedded in appropriate Excel spreadsheets For the TestisFilters we are currently testing two approaches for acquiring intensify values from digital phosphorimages of the hybridized arrays In the first approach we designed templates matching the arrangement of cDNA spots on the filters using ImageQuant for Macintosh Molecular Dynamics These templates were used for volume integration as a measure of signal intensify Our second approach utilizes Phoretix Array v2 0 software Nonlinear USA to automatically generate an acquisition template and perform volume integrations for the cDNA spots Both these software packages accommodate background determination and subtraction and the Nonlinear software also supports data normalization TestisSlides are being imaged using a ScanArray 4000 confocal laser scanner Packard Biochip Technologies and data acquisition accomplished using QuantArray software from the same vendor Although it is widely acknowledged that DNA arrays are most powerful when they contain as many different gene probes as possible the cost of purchasing or producing such large arrays is prohibitive for most researchers Thus the primary advantage of developing a relatively small tissue specific array is its economy whereby the researcher is not obliged to obtain prefabricated arrays or libraries containing genes that are uninformative for their favorite tissue and or genomic interests Another advantage is that the clone set is also retained by the researcher and can be reused at will to prepare nucleic acid for further array printing New clones can also be added to the set as they become available Such a set also allows the researcher to be more or less focused in their choice of genes for expression analysis permitting use of the full set or subsets This approach enables the researcher to select genes that are of specific probable or possible interest in a particular context and thus to tailor the final array exclusively to the model s of interest For example the researcher may wish to examine the effects of a chemical treatment on a particular gene pathway for example glycolysis or family of genes for example heat shock proteins cytochrome P450s in a particular tissue Relatively small targeted arrays can be used in this context to provide a focused platform to generate leads for the new kind of data driven research that is gradually supplanting hypothesis driven experimentation in genomics Despite these advantages it should nevertheless be recognized that like commercially available arrays the final list of genes selected for this array is arbitrary in that they were selected on the basis of the somewhat restrictive combination of individual judgment and the limited availability of sequence verified clones and therefore may not reflect a priori the most versatile or optimal set of genes for such an array For example at the time of purchase we were unable to acquire sequence verified IMAGE clones of Prm1 Dmc1 Msh4 and a number of important cyclins all of which have key roles in testicular function Fortunately the number of available sequence verified IMAGE clones is increasing daily as is the understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying cell function Thus arrays developed in future will benefit from this increased resource and knowledge base and will therefore be less arbitrary than current versions permitting an even more efficient use of resources In an ideal situation one would perhaps like to array whole tissue transcriptomes so that all possible transcription profiles can be accounted for It should be noted however that a complete normal adult mouse testis transcriptome or that of any other tissue or organ will be extremely difficult to assemble given that expression differences undoubtedly exist between strains and even between individuals of the same inbred strain Migrating cells such as immune cells can also complicate the issue Completion of the sequencing of mouse and other laboratory animal genomes will facilitate the production of more directed arrays but until the full transcriptional and post transcriptional that is alternative splicing repertoire of every cell type in every condition in every strain at every age is mapped out developing a fully representative array is unrealistic Nevertheless we have described the first steps and the caveats to consider for those wishing to begin developing the kind of tissue or cell specific arrays that will we believe be used with increasing frequency by the array community Materials and methods Obtaining a mouse testis transcriptome Animals Male C57BL 6 mice were obtained from Charles River Breeding Laboratories at 8 weeks old and maintained in a temperature and humidity controlled room on a 12 h light dark cycle The animals were housed singly in polycarbonate cages with pine shavings bedding and free access to food and water Heat shock treatment At 10 weeks of age two animals were sedated by an intraperitoneal injection of 100 l per 10 g body weight of 10 ketamine Fort Dodge Laboratories in phosphate buffered saline pH 7 4 The lower half of the torso of each animal was submerged in a 43 C water bath for 20 min after which the animals were dried off and returned to their cages The testes from these animals were harvested 4 h later The testes of two untreated adult male C57BL 6 mice were harvested concurrently Arrays Total RNA was extracted individually from the testes of the four mice using two extractions through Tri Reagent Sigma The control and heat shocked total RNA samples were then pooled and passed twice through the Oligotex mRNA Purification System Qiagen to produce poly A RNA One microgram each of normal and heat shocked testicular poly A RNA was submitted to Genome Systems now part of IGI for contract hybridization against their mouse Gene Expression Microarray I GEM 1 20 Hybridization of the samples and analysis of the gene expression changes was carried out by GSI staff and the data returned electronically All named expressed genes were added to the mouse testis transcriptome gene list The same RNA samples were used to probe Atlas mouse cDNA expression array 588 genes and Stress Tox array 149 genes Clontech Laboratories 32P labeled cDNAs were produced from 2 g of each pooled RNA using the reagents supplied with the membrane array kits Hybridization to the membrane arrays was carried out according to the manufacturer s instructions The control and heat shock RNA pools were each hybridized against two different membranes of each membrane type During exposures the arrays were kept moist with 2x SSC saturated filter paper wrapped in plastic wrap Images were developed using a Phosphorlmager Molecular Dynamics Images were analyzed using Atlas Image v1 01 Clontech Genes whose adjusted signal intensity average intensity minus background were not at least twice their respective background value on both membranes were not considered genuine signals and discarded as were those which were expressed on only one membrane The remaining expressed genes were added to the mouse testis transcriptome gene list Homolog search In addition to the mouse array expression data a search for mouse homologs of genes expressed in human testes according to the Clontech and RGI arrays which were not represented in the mouse arrays was carried out using UniGene and or GeneCards Genes from successful searches were added to the mouse testis transcriptome gene list Database search for testicular transcriptome genes The NCBI UniGene Jackson Laboratories Mouse Gene Expression GXD and National Library of Medicine MEDLINE databases were searched to identify genes expressed in mouse testis 21 22 Genes that were not already present in the mouse testis transcriptome gene list were added Literature search for testicular transcriptome genes An extensive literature survey was conducted to find murine testis expressed genes Genes that were not already present in the mouse testis transcriptome gene list were added Collaborator contributions for testicular transcriptome genes EPAMAC collaborators contributed the names of murine testis expressed genes not present on the master list Obtaining a human testis transcriptome Genes expressed in human testis Adult human testicular total RNA was purchased from Clontech This pooled RNA originated from samples taken from 19 Caucasian males trauma victims ranging from 19 to 54 years of age Two types of Atlas human filter arrays were used the 588 gene cDNA Expression v1 1 array and the 234 gene Stress Toxicology array Two micrograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed with 32P dATP and the labeled fractions collected using ChromaSpin human columns One microgram of RNA was also hybridized against 5 184 element human GeneFilter membrane arrays RGI GeneFilters I to IV and Named Genes following purification of the 33P dCTP labeled probe with BioSpin6 columns BioRad Hybridization to all the membrane arrays was carried out according to the manufacturer s instructions After washing the arrays were exposed to phosphorimaging screens for 1 7 days and images developed using a Phosphorlmager Molecular Dynamics or a Molecular Imager FX BioRad Clontech array images were analyzed using Atlas Image v1 01 RGI array images were analyzed using Pathways v 2 01 software and all expressed genes added to the human testis transcriptome gene list Homolog search In addition to the human array expression data a search for human homologs of genes expressed in mouse testes according to the Clontech and IGI arrays and the database search which were not represented in the human arrays was carried out using UniGene and or GeneCards Genes from successful searches were added to the human testis transcriptome gene list Literature search for testicular transcriptome genes An extensive literature survey was conducted to find human testis expressed genes Genes that were not already present in the human testis transcriptome gene list were added Collaborator contributions for testicular transcriptome genes EPAMAC collaborators contributed the names of human testis expressed genes not present on the master list Assembly of a master mouse human testis transcriptome gene list The mouse and human testis transcriptome gene lists were brought together for comparison Paring of the lists down to the final 960 genes was carried out sequentially according to the following criteria all genes which did not have a sequence verified mouse IMAGE clone available were removed assessed by checking against RGI inventory of svIMAGE clones All genes present in both lists were retained all genes of specific interest to ourselves and our collaborators were retained as were those with proven or suspected toxicological relevance genes shown to be expressed in the array experiments were selectively retained over those obtained from the literature which were in turn selectively retained over those obtained from database searching which were in turn selectively retained over those obtained from homolog searches In this way we were able to produce two final master lists of 960 testis expressed genes for both human and mouse all of which except five were obtainable from a single source RGI Procurement of mouse clones and PCR products Sequence verified mouse IMAGE clones of the 963 genes on the final testicular transcriptome gene list were obtained from RGI along with PCR products of the same genes containing 3 5 g DNA per gene Owing to undetected IMAGE or Unigene number duplications on the submitted list of 955 genes only 945 unique clones were received PCR products of five heat shock proteins HSP70 1 HSP70 2 HSP70 3 Hsc70 and HSC70t were produced in house and added to the library to produce a final total of 950 unique gene PCR products Array printing The PCR products were precipitated washed dried and resuspended in 12 l 3x SSC in V bottomed 96 well microtiter plates These samples were used by Radius BioSciences to print 84 12 cm 8 cm filters Each gene was printed in duplicate on each filter Slide based arrays were prepared by the array facility at the Center for Molecular Medicine and Genetics Wayne State University directly from the clone set Arrays were printed using a Flexys robot Genomic Solutions on a 9 9 double spotted grid with 400 m spacing between spots Bar coded CMT GAPS gamma amino propyl silane coated slides Corning were used Hybridization of TestisFilter with adult mouse RNA Eight week old male C57BL 6 mice were dosed via gavage with either water or 216 mg kg BCA for 14 days Four hours after the final dose animals were sacrificed and testes harvested Total RNA was extracted from half a testis by homogenization in Tri Reagent Sigma and treated with two units of DNase Ambion One microgram of the total RNA from a single animal was primed with oligo dT and incubated at 70 C for 10 min followed by a brief chill on ice Six microliters of 5x first strand buffer RGI 1 l 100 mM DTT 1 5 l dNTPs 20 mM 1 5 l reverse transcriptase Superscript II Gibco BRL 10 l 33P dCTP ICN were then added to the primed RNA Elongation was carried out at 37 C

and 5 l poly A for 2 h at 42 C The probe was added and incubated overnight at 42 C Filters were washed twice with 2x SSC 1 SDS at 50 C for 30 min and once with 0 5x SSC 1 SDS at room temperature for 30 min The filters were then exposed to a Kodak phosphorimaging screen for three days and visualized with a Molecular Imager FX BioRad Data acquisition from TestisFilter and TestisSlide An ImageQuant for Macintosh Molecular Dynamics template matching the arrangement of cDNA spots on the TestisFilter was used for volume integration as a measure of signal intensity Alternatively Phoretix Array v2 0
