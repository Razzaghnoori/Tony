 Analyze This Dear Judith Jesus H Christ How many thoughts can you squeeze into a single e mail I want to tell you a story One day in late 1998 I was hanging around the Westchester federal courthouse waiting for another of John A Gotti s interminable pre trial hearings to begin when I bumped into Gotti s friend Angelo Ruggiero Jr Fat Angie I think they call him Fat Angie is the son of Angelo Quack Quack Ruggerio who got his nickname because he talked too much into government wires Ruggerio the Son is a nice guy not too smart maybe but nice and we made small talk about his Filas There was in fact not much I needed to know from Angelo But I did have one question Why did he and his buddy boy John eat so often at Cracker Barrel This was one of the amazing true facts I uncovered about Junior Gotti some mob reporters uncover complex union kickback scams I expose the secret dining habits of pathetic goombahs What I asked Angelo was this Why would an Italian American heir to the greatest cuisine on the planet stoop to eat chicken fried steak at a redneck restaurant chain Angelo looked at me shrugged his shoulders and said I don t know I mean how much Italian food can you eat Your e mail and the cultural elite s obsession with the The Sopranos reminds me of Angie s profound comment What I mean is how much Culturebox style commentary about The Sopranos can the public eat I know what you re thinking You re thinking Hey I got your Culturebox right here you fuckin mook you I also know I m as guilty as anyone of overhyping The Sopranos I just recently wrote that The Sopranos is the best TV show ever So please don t think for a second that I don t want to hear your theories I have always counted on you for all of that hermeneutics and semiotics and dianetics and other really dope Lingua Franca shit It s just that I fear that too much in the way of high end yammering about The Sopranos and its profound meaning will cause a backlash against the show Expectations are just too ridiculously high i e the comparison to Alexander Nevsky in the Times etc I think the producers would have been smart to intentionally lower expectations over the past six months by leaking stories about massive attacks of writer s block on the set And David Chase the series creator should have killed off Livia Soprano not that I don t love Nancy Marchand when he had the chance But more on that later Whoa I think I just hinted at my opinion of the new season No way I m showing you mine until you show me yours Let me address your pet theories I agree with most everything you ve said or at least everything you said that I understood except that I wouldn t characterize any part of Goodfellas as a jaunty laugh fest I think you ve got one thing exactly right The Sopranos works so well precisely because it is understated because it is the opposite of the operatic Godfather Together The Godfather and The Sopranos make up some kind of whole but here s the fundamental difference between them Every mobster I ve ever met imagines himself a player in The Godfather I interviewed Sammy Gravano a few weeks ago and he said as much The Godfather invested the lives of mobsters who are in fact seedy and boring characters with honor and drama But I haven t talked to a single mobster who would take Tony Soprano s life over Michael Corleone s We re only one season into The Sopranos so it s a bit too early to say if this particular manifestation of mob art is influencing mob life but I think it s fair to say that no one in actual organized crime would ever want to be hooked up with Tony Soprano s crew In a way I think I ve just answered the interesting question you ve posed namely how realistic is The Sopranos Very I d say Not being an actual mobster to my everlasting regret my assessment might be worth bupkus as the hysterical Silvio Dante would say but The Sopranos accurately captures the desperation of today s mobsters The smarter wise guys know that they are the track suit wearing equivalents of one of those prehistoric tribes living in the Orinoco River Basin just waiting for extinction I was talking to David Chase a couple of weeks ago am I just the most insufferable mob related name dropper or what and we got to talking about his use of humor What Chase evidently realized and what Coppola didn t Clemenza aside is that real life mobsters can be quite funny self consciously funny in a non slapsticky non Analyze This sort of way Knowing this makes The Sopranos seem real to me Today s mobsters too are fluent in psychobabble and in the language of self improvement and Chase of course captures this beautifully I will disagree with you on one thing at the outset the writing on The Sopranos is better than the acting not that there s anything really wrong with the acting By the way can we also talk about how badly Analyze This sucked I m going to sign off for the moment but first I wanted to tell you I think you ought to have a mob moniker at least for the week How about Judith Little Herring Shulevitz Also a question for your consideration Do you think mob movies are dead The genre s tired obviously but is The Sopranos a sign of new life Also tell me what you think of the new season already Inquiring minds want to know Jeff Fuckin Mook Goldberg
