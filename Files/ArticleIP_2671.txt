 Partial Truths in the Partial Birth Abortion Debate Banning an obscure technique like partial birth abortion would seem to be a rather modest goal for anti abortion forces faced with the most sympathetic Congress they have had since Roe vs Wade But the issue could change their fortunes That s because as a medical technique nothing makes partial birth abortion fundamentally different from other forms of late term abortion Certainly it is no more grisly If pro choice politicians help pass the ban their case for allowing other late term procedures will be fatally weakened But good policy on abortion would not focus on techniques at all or even on when the fetus can survive outside the womb It would hinge on the question of when the fetus first becomes a perceiving being Pro life advocates offer a seductive argument Whatever you think about abortion in general partial birth abortion is just too ghastly to permit As Republican National Committeeman Tim Lambert argues It is really not about abortion It s about infanticide it s about a procedure so gruesome the American Medical Association is opposed to it Now even strongly pro choice politicians see this as a no brainer and may provide enough votes to override President Clinton s veto of the ban In general obstetricians told me their choice of abortion method depends mainly on the fetus size During the first eight weeks of pregnancy when the fetus is very small medications like methotrexate and RU 486 can safely make the uterus slough the placenta and gestational sac In the United States however obstetricians usually use vacuum aspiration which can be performed through the 15 th week while the fetus s head is less than an inch in size They insert a suction tube through the cervix and suck out the sac and the fetus along with it People are generally comfortable with this They don t like it they wish it had never come to this but they don t identify with in antiseptic doctor argot the products of conception According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute one fourth of U S pregnancies are aborted around 1 4 million a year The institute estimates that a whopping 43 percent of women will have at least one abortion by age 45 Almost all abortions 94 percent are done by the 15 th week of pregnancy predominantly by vacuum aspiration But 6 percent more than 80 000 abortions are done after 15 weeks and several hundred of these are done after 24 weeks commonly taken to be the point of viability The fetus is now too big to fit into the suction tubing A 20 week fetus is commonly 6 inches long or more Why do women wait so long before seeking an abortion Sometimes they have no choice Women who abort because of a fetal abnormality don t find out about the problem until quite late Amniocentesis to collect fetal chromosomes for analysis generally is done at 18 weeks A few late abortions are done for the mother s health to save her for example from possible disaster caused by an infected uterus or a newly diagnosed heart condition Most of the time however they are elective Often the mother didn t know she was pregnant The power of human denial is unbelievable one obstetrician told me It s not at all uncommon he said to see women go through an entire pregnancy without realizing it come to the ER with a stomachache and turn out to be in labor The usual options for late term abortion are 1 induced labor and delivery or 2 dilatation and evacuation For induction used in less than 15 percent of cases labor is stimulated with drugs Delivery usually takes from 36 to 48 hours in the hospital but it can take even longer Sometimes before delivery the obstetrician injects the fetus with a drug that stops its heart If not the heart sometimes beats even after the fetus has been delivered Even without oxygen from its barely formed lungs I m told the fetus s heart can continue beating for minutes and even hours About 80 percent of late term abortions are done by D and E A couple of days ahead small absorbent rods are put in the pregnant woman s cervical opening to expand it gradually Then for the actual procedure she and the fetus are given heavy sedation or general anesthesia The doctor breaks her bag of water and drains out the fluid The opening won t let the fetus out whole So the doctor inserts metal tongs physically crushes the head and dismembers the fetus The pieces are pulled out and counted to confirm that nothing was missed Partial birth abortion is if anything less grotesque The fetus is delivered feet first To get the large head out the doctor cuts open a hole at the base of the fetus s skull and inserts tubing to suck out the brain which collapses the skull Often but not always the fetus is injected lethally beforehand The procedure is used for a very small percentage of late abortions and nothing makes it especially necessary over D and E In fact none of the obstetricians I talked to had even heard of the technique until it became a hot political topic It seems hardly anyone uses partial birth abortion and if it s banned almost no one will miss it That partial birth abortion is rare and inessential makes it easier no doubt for the AMA and pro choice politicians like Republican Sen Arlen Specter and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle to back the ban But they insist that they stand by the right to any other second term abortion If partial birth abortion is too gruesome to allow however it is hard to see how other late abortions especially D and Es are any different And that s the inevitable next target for pro life advocates Grossness is not a good objection Lots of operations are gross leg amputations burn surgery removal of facial tumors etc But that does not make them wrong What makes a late abortion disturbing is that the fetus is big now like a fully formed child Two of my obstetrician friends both strongly pro choice told me that even when it is a mother s life at stake and abortion is absolutely necessary doing the D and E feels horrible We imagine as we look in the fetus s eyes that there is someone in there And if there were any elective late abortion even by induction would be wrong though D and E and partial birth abortion would seem especially cruel Is there someone in there The legal debate after Roe vs Wade has led us to focus on whether the fetus is viable whether it can survive outside the womb But knowing whether we have the technology to keep it alive doesn t answer our question I face the same question when I have a patient on life support His heart may be beating and his lungs may be breathing but that doesn t tell me whether he is a living person anymore What I want to know is whether his brain has ceased functioning Likewise in the case of a fetus it seems that what we want to know is whether it has a brain with the spark of consciousness For example we don t view anencephalics babies tragically born with only a brain stem and not the rest of the brain as living humans Even for viable anencephalics there s no purpose to providing treatment We let them die Whether the fetus is in the womb or out big or small does not matter either But the size and appearance of the late term fetus make us imagine that it has become a sensate aware creature and makes many supporters of first trimester abortion uncomfortable with later term ones It s not clear when the fetus can perceive but it is doubtful that it can before 22 weeks That s the earliest time anatomic studies give for the first sensory fibers reaching the early brain By 25 weeks however neonates show complex facial reactions to stimuli that reflect higher brain possibly conscious activity Somewhere between 22 and 25 weeks the fetus does become a distinctly different being We need more in depth study to identify this critical juncture That s because most people would feel that it is wrong to do elective abortions abortions when the health of the mother is not at risk and the fetus is not seriously deformed beyond that point The current debate glosses over these issues There s no good reason to single out partial birth abortion or any technique From the pro lifers standpoint banning it will not actually save a single fetus And for abortion rights supporters it is only an invitation to inconsistency
