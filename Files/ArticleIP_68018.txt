 The Masked and the Unmasked Paul Thomas Anderson s Magnolia takes place on a dark night of the soul in the City of Angels A patriarch is dying No hold on this is a three hour movie Two patriarchs are dying Rich geezer Jason Robards is slipping in and out of a coma on a bed with an oxygen tube up his nose while his minky young wife Julianne Moore acts out her despair at losing an old man she thought she d married for his money The geezer s nurse Philip Seymour Hoffman listens to his semi coherent monologues then decides to get in touch with the dying man s estranged son Tom Cruise who gives inspirational lectures in which men are exhorted to turn women into sperm receptacles and to leave behind their unmanly pasts The son gets a double dose of his unmanly past this night since a female TV journalist April Grace has uncovered the history he has determinedly concealed and is eating through his mask of machismo on camera We may be through with the past says someone but the past isn t through with us The second dying paterfamilias is Philip Baker Hall as the host of a quiz show for bright kids He bursts in on his estranged daughter Melora Walters with news of his imminent demise but the addled girl for some reason three guesses won t have anything to do with him His visit sends her into a cocaine snorting frenzy which is interrupted by a policeman John C Reilly checking out her deafening stereo You ve been doing some drugs today After 10 minutes it isn t clear whether this dweebish flatfoot is interrogating her or trying to ask for a date or whether he even knows Meanwhile Magnolia could have been titled Meanwhile an aging ex quiz kid celebrity William H Macy gets fired from his job and goes looking for the love he never had while a contemporary quiz kid celebrity Jeremy Blackman tries to make his father Michael Bowen understand that he wants to be loved for himself and not his TV achievements even if that means peeing in his pants on camera What s the connection among these people Some of the links are familial others merely circumstantial But everyone and their dad are having a really lousy day At the peak of their collective loneliness the cokehead daughter puts on a plaintive Aimee Mann song the chorus of which goes It s not going to stop It s not going to stop It s not going to stop Till you wise up She moves her lips and the director cuts to all the characters in all the movie s other strands as they all move their lips to the same universal refrain It s not going to stop The wife in the car sings The aging quiz kid on the barstool sings The cop searching for his lost gun sings I thought Please don t make the guy in the coma sing or I m going to be hysterical but yup the guy in the coma sings too At that point I had an interesting reaction to Magnolia I laughed at it and forgave it almost everything OK you could spend three hours snickering at Anderson s What the World Needs Now Is Aimee Mann metaphysic But his vision cuts deeper than a lot of folky bathos His characters have been screwed up by their families so when he turns around and makes a case for family as the ultimate salvation he doesn t seem simple minded He s saying the diaspora is understandable but that it s also killing people At the point where these people could actually start dying of aloneness he goes metaphorical He goes biblical He goes nuts He has sort of prepared us with weather reports and the recurrence of numerals suggesting an Old Testament chapter and verse But nothing could prepare us for the full scale surreal gross out deluge that s the picture s splattery climax For the second time he dynamites his own movie And for the second time I forgave him almost everything What clinches Anderson s case for family is how beautifully he works with his surrogate clan Many of the actors show up from his Hard Eight 1997 and Boogie Nights 1997 and he s so eager to get Luis Guzman into the film despite the lack of a role that he makes him a game show contestant named Luis Guzman He s like a parent who can t stop adopting kids Anderson knows what actors live to do fall apart He puts their characters backs against the wall then gives them speeches full of free associations and Freudian slips so that they re suddenly exposed and terrified by their nakedness By the end of the first hour of Magnolia the whole cast is unraveling By the end of the second they ve unraveled so much that they ve burst into song Anderson must have needed that bonkers third hour climax because there was nowhere to go short of spontaneous combustion The actors are great all of them It seems unfair to single anyone out but I loved Reilly s unsettling combination of sweetness and prudery unsettling because he s just the kind of earnest by the book cop whose wheels move too slowly in a crisis Between tantrums Julianne Moore opens and closes her mouth like a fish that s slowly suffocating at the bottom of a boat And who would have expected a real performance from Tom Cruise Anderson takes everything fake in Cruise s acting the face pulling the too quick smile and turns it into the character s own shtick so that when the mask is pulled off you get a startling glimpse of the rage and fear under the pose Elsewhere Anderson uses Mamet actors and Mamety diction but he s the Anti Mamet He makes his actors feel so safe so loved that they seem to be competing to see who can shed the most skin The title card of The Talented Mr Ripley is a stroke of genius Adjectives flash before the words Mr Ripley with talented an imperfect substitute for about 30 other possibilities including confused Actually I think confused or vulnerable or desperate would have been a more appropriate choice As played by Matt Damon this Ripley s chief talent is for licking his lips and looking clammily out of place Dispatched to the south of Italy by a magnate named Greenleaf seeking the return of his wastrel son Dickie Jude Law the working class Ripley has to pretend he s an old Princeton classmate But nothing in Damon s demeanor remotely suggests the Ivy League Beside the smooth caramel colored Law even his pale little muscles seem like poseurs Anthony Minghella The English Patient 1996 has adapted The Talented Mr Ripley from a thriller by Patricia Highsmith and it s a gorgeously creepy piece of movie making The Old World luxury even the Old World rot is double edged subtly mocking its bantamweight New World protagonist The light that bronzes everyone else burns poor pasty Ripley We watch him having the time of his life but there s no question of his ever fitting in with Dickie his willowy girlfriend Marge Gwyneth Paltrow or even their fat to the manner born pal Freddie Miles a hilarious Philip Seymour Hoffman he s too tense too hungry too incomplete When Ripley is by himself onscreen there s nothing going on Minghella is a thoughtful man and a snazzy craftsman but by the end of Ripley I wasn t sure what had attracted him to this material What does a vaguely masochistic humanist see in Patricia Highsmith The novel s Ripley and the Ripley of Ren Cl ment s 1960 Purple Noon Alain Delon isn t so palpably out of his depth With a bit of polish he can pass for a playboy and the bad fun is watching him do anything to keep from accepting the swinish Dickie s view of him as an eternal loser Damon s Ripley is an eternal loser an anti chameleon and so conscientiously dreary that he lets Jude Law act him off the screen He isn t allowed to feel a moment s glee at seizing what these rich boobs have denied him Minghella comes up with a bleakly sincere ending that s the opposite of what this ironic little melodrama needs He s trying to inflate it into tragedy where Highsmith s setups are too cold and shallow to be tragic The old biddy herself would have thought this ending stinks Along with many Americans I first caught Andy Kaufman on the Tonight Show in the mid 70s He sat next to Johnny Carson and in his helium pitched foreign man voice told jokes without punch lines Her cooking ees so bad ees terrible and did non impressionistic impressions then he got up and launched into the most electrifying Elvis Presley takeoff I ve ever seen Without that final flourish of virtuosity the shtick would have been just weird With it Kaufman signaled that his comedy was about more than untranscendent ineptitude It was about wondrously fucking with your head That whole act is reproduced in the funny frustrating Kaufman biopic Man on the Moon but not on the Tonight Show Kaufman Jim Carrey does it onstage at a tiny club We don t know where it came from or what the thinking was behind it He brings down the house lots of shots of people smiling and laughing then goes out for a drink with a potential manager Danny DeVito who tells him You re insane but you might also be brilliant That s about as close to analysis as the picture gets As in their Ed Wood 1994 and The People vs Larry Flynt 1996 screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski take marginal or plain cruddy characters and stick them in the middle of breezily wide eyed biopics Their Horatio Alger tone is the joke but it s not a joke that director Milos Forman seems to be in on Forman tells one deadly serious story A reckless individualist is slowly crushed by society It meshed with McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest 1975 but seemed odd with Mozart Amadeus 1984 and disastrous with Valmont Valmont 1989 With Andy Kaufman it seems not so much wrong as beside the point Where did the rage in Kaufman come from and at what point did it kill the comedy More important Did Kaufman himself consider some of his experiments failures or had his aesthetic finally become so punk pro wrestling that he thought driving people crazy was enough As Jared Hohlt in Slate the comedian got sick at the point where he needed to reinvent himself to keep from sinking into obscurity The filmmakers reverse the trajectory and the actual chronology of Kaufman s career so that he seems to achieve a magical synthesis of warmth and aggression and then gets cut down at his prime That s not just bogus it s false to the conflicts that ate Kaufman alive The reason to see Man on the Moon is Jim Carrey It s not just that he does the Kaufman routines with the kind of hungry gleam that makes you think he s channeling the dead comedian It s that he knows what it s like to walk the high wire and bomb He knows what it s like to lose control of his aggression It happened to him in The Cable Guy 1996 maybe his real Andy Kaufman film I bet that what Carrey saw from inside Kaufman s head would be more illuminating than anything in the movie He s not just a man in the moon He generates his own light Anyone who reads Angela s Ashes is torn down the middle appalled by the misery and deaths of small children and yet exhilarated even turned on by the cadences of Frank McCourt His alcoholic father starved him of real food but filled his head with the kind of stories that nourished his poet s instincts I worried that the movie directed by Alan Parker would miss McCourt s voice and dwell too much on the tragic details But what happens is the opposite McCourt narrates the film and it turns into a lifeless slide show There s no flow no connective tissue between episodes After the 80 th teensy scene goes by you realize the movie isn t just botched It doesn t even exist Emily Watson suffers prettily but whatever she s thinking stays in her head and Robert Carlyle is so mopily present that you don t have a clue why such an earnest fellow would drink so many lives away The horror of the father McCourt describes is that he s not at home on planet Earth The narrator says his dad was a helluva storyteller but the man on screen doesn t say so much as Once upon a time Has anyone involved in this disaster ever heard a real story
