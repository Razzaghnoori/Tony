 Now He Tells Us Now He Tells Us So we were reading the Washington Post on Wednesday online of course when we came across a report of a speech by Bill Gates at Cambridge University We re always interested in what Bill Gates has to say because well obviously You would be too would you not Anyway this speech was especially interesting to us According to the Post The computer genius sketched out his rosy vision of a future world of technology loving households yeah yeah and schools in which computers enhance the learning process sure buddy But he conceded that sometimes the old ways are still the best He prefers magazines the way they come in the mail he confessed and he cannot read anything longer on his computer screen than a three page memo Whoa These words came as quite a shock to those of us who have spent the past year and a half trying to develop on behalf of the Microsoft Corp a magazine whose distinguishing characteristic is that it does not come in the mail Although we disagree with Mr Gates about the best way to read magazines we do agree that sometimes the old way is still the best For example we generally prefer typewriters to Microsoft Word and we find that our sturdy abacus crashes less often than Excel Lesser online magazines might find it discouraging to learn that their own proprietor prefers magazines that come in the mail And there were tears of course even at Slate mainly from the software developers a notoriously sensitive lot But ultimately we at Slate invoked the true Microsoft spirit and took this as a challenge A two pronged challenge actually The first challenge was how to prevent Bill Gates from finding out that his company publishes an online magazine The second challenge was to misrepresent or spin to use the vernacular his remarks to the general public The second part is easy The Washington Post as is so often the case with the media misquoted Mr Gates speech What he actually said was that he prefers magazines that come in e mail and he reads them on his specially designed computer screen that can display a three page memo He was referring of course to Slate s free weekly e mail delivery Click here to subscribe Part 1 is tougher Although Slate is a tiny division of a large company it is frequently mentioned in the press and its Microsoft connection is often noted But we have assigned a junior staff member to lurk near the Gates family mailbox and when no one is looking to go through the contents and Magic Marker out all references to the fact that Slate is owned by Microsoft That ll teach him to get his magazines by mail Fourplay If you ve installed Internet Explorer 4 0 the new version of Microsoft s browser you might like to take a peek at our new Table of Contents designed especially to take advantage of the advances in Internet Explorer 4 0 Among other features it allows even the smallest standard computer screen to display the entire contents of an issue of Slate without scrolling Make sure that you re running Internet Explorer 4 0 then click here to take a look This is still a beta meaning that we re still tinkering with it but we think it s pretty close If you run into any problems e mail help slate com And if you haven t yet installed Internet Explorer 4 0 you can get a free download by clicking here Be forewarned that the download takes quite a while via modem You can also order a CD Or you can while away the time reading magazines on paper Michael Kinsley
