 The Cult of Che So they have finally given Che Guevara a proper burial the interment took place Oct 17 in Cuban soil in the town where he achieved his greatest revolutionary victory You might suppose that in these after days of communism Che s legendary glamour will soon enough find its way to a similar interment though perhaps not in Cuba itself where glamour like everything else remains under state control Che was not after all the best of communists He was in his dashing manner the worst an extreme dogmatist instinctively authoritarian allergic to any democratic or libertarian impulses quick to order executions and quicker still to lead his own comrades to their deaths in doomed guerrilla wars Love of the Soviet Union was his first instinct and when he evolved a second more critical instinct it was only because the Soviet leaders turned out to be less rigidly Marxist Leninist and less suicidal than himself Of the innumerable commentaries on Che that have been published in the last few weeks Alma Guillermoprieto offered the clearest in The New Yorker He was a fanatic she wrote consumed by restlessness and a frightening abstract hatred who in the end recognized only one moral value as supreme the willingness to be slaughtered for a cause But I am struck most by a commentary that appeared in the Mexican weekly Etc tera under the byline Gilberto Guevara Niebla no relation to Che himself yet a figure of great importance in the revolutionary history of the 1960s Gilberto Guevara Niebla was arguably the single most important student leader of the Mexican student uprising of 1968 the uprising that was finally put down in a massacre by the Mexican army in October 1968 He wrote Che offered his life to the cause of the disinherited but he did it by offering a political method that in the long run had disastrous effects on whoever tried to uphold it Guerrilla war imposed a militarist logic and closed the space for democracy What Latin America lived since Che launched his slogans was a bloodbath and a wave of destruction and terror The myth of Che has been a wall impeding the observation of those fatal historical results Who was Che A man who wanted to change the world through the means always sordid of killing other men Couldn t be clearer Yet among the kind of people who once upon a time had admired Che and his cause a lot of people especially in the generation that was young in the 1960s the more typical commentaries have balanced on a but as on a fulcrum Che was wrong but he was good His ideas were hopeless but he remains the embodiment of an ideal Let me quote the French weekly Le Nouvel Observateur which devoted an issue to Che earlier this month That his politico military theory failed matters little What remains on both sides of the Andes is the example of a man the child of his continent who knew how to die for his generous ideas in an unequal struggle Or last Sunday s New York Times Book Review which concluded What is left is simply the man a rebel who could not part with his dream and who earned a place in history precisely because he refused to yield to it Or a Portuguese writer in Etc tera s special Che issue Che Guevara is only the other name of what is most just and dignified in the human spirit And so forth one commentator after another which would be hard to believe except that right now the world is awash in Che T shirts mugs barroom d cor a Che beer in England posters and utterly pointless editions let us hope of Che s military writings And the mania is not just a matter of mass culture Among the books about Che that have just now come out one by Jorge G Casta eda Compa ero The Life and Death of Che Guevara offers an exceptionally lucid analysis of Che s life and doings based on a tremendous amount of research both in Cuba and in American government files Casta eda knows more about Latin American guerrilla movements than anybody outside of Castro s secret agencies Yet in a few paragraphs at the front and close of his book on Che even Casta eda this most intelligent and admirable of historians extols the fervent idealism and generational arrogance of 1968 around the world and then anoints Che as the one man who most closely embodied its deeper meaning R gis Debray Che s comrade wrote a memoir last year in which he warned against exactly that delusion the anti authoritarian revolt of 68 taking this hardcore partisan of authoritarianism for its emblem But then I can understand that particular confusion A couple of years ago I wrote a piece of my own about Che in The New Yorker and though I knew better I ended up adding a superfluous nod to the innate nobility of this man whose fanaticism and lack of human sympathy brought about so much suffering and death Why do people who know better say such things It is not because of the doctrines of communism It is because of the doctrines of glory which are much more primitive What is glory This an absolute commitment to your own principle whatever it may be the kind of commitment that expresses itself in only one way by a willingness to kill other people on its behalf and to be killed in turn A commitment finally to defeat For victory is always partial and compromised but defeat and death are total and grand Victory is secular defeat is sacred A Che who like any ordinary communist politician had never killed anyone a Che who had survived his guerrilla adventures and was today an elderly figure administering some grim bureaucracy for Fidel Castro or alternatively writing books at home in Argentina surrounded by his anti communist grandchildren a Che like that would cause no stir at all today and writers around the world would not be straining their brains to draw ever finer distinctions between the man s calamitous influence and some undefinable greatness There is a precedent to the Che cult It was the cult of Napoleon in the 19 th century a young man s craze that went on for generations the craze that Stendhal described in his character Julien Sorel in The Red and the Black and Victor Hugo in his character Marius in Les Mis rables In the 19 th century intelligent people in France knew perfectly well that Napoleon had embodied the worst aspects of the French Revolution had betrayed the revolution s democratic ideals and had spread death and fire from Spain to Moscow Yet those same clear thinking people found ways of separating Napoleon s horrors from his glamour They would say He was wrong but he was great It was a question of glory of his having risen in the world and having killed his thousands and having failed spectacularly and not having flinched It was the appeal of death doled out and accepted And so the cult of Napoleon was finally a cult of the tomb In 1821 Napoleon was murdered he was poisoned while in the hands of his enemies far away from home just as Che was murdered in 1967 It took 19 years to bring Napoleon s remains back to France compared to 30 years for Che Napoleon s reburial took place on Dec 15 1840 People who should have known better found the ceremony moving Victor Hugo who stood among the crowd dutifully recorded in a poem on the occasion that Napoleon had been wrong that Napoleon had tried to conquer with the sword instead of with the mind Yet a few lines later Hugo wrote his Bonapartist blood pounding May the people forever keep you in their memory Day as beautiful as glory Cold as the tomb So in the Cuban tropics too there has just now been a day as beautiful as glory cold as the tomb And because the cult of glory feeds on defeat and not on victory we can be sure that like the passion for Napoleon in the last century the passion for Che will disappear no time soon Not in this generation not in the next
