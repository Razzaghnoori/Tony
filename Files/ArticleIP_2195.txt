 One Year June 24 marked Slate s first anniversary The occasion was celebrated here in Redmond with a gala black tie dinner and a nude fun run around the Microsoft campus It was declared a national holiday in several states of the former Soviet Union for a small fee The new government of Congo issued a stamp ditto And in Mexico criminals were released from prison in a general amnesty for plagiarists and other violators of intellectual property rights Do we deserve such honors On balance we think we do The first year has of course brought both successes and disappointments On the positive side we have transformed the nature of journalism morally vindicated the World Wide Web vastly enriched the Microsoft Corp captured Pol Pot and learned the correct spellings of many difficult words On the downside we did get it slightly wrong about the senator s love child grand child love child it s an easy mistake to make There was the unfortunate occasion when we accidentally albeit repeatedly linked the word Netscape to a site for devil worshipers That litigation with Mother Teresa remains unresolved although Microsoft s lawyers believe our offer of free Flight Simulator TM software upgrades was more than generous Our RealOdor TM streaming olfactory feature does not as yet work as well as we had hoped frankly We re talking to the people at StenchMaster about a new strategic alliance One year We asked Bill Gates how Slate should mark this historic occasion He said Give the whole staff enormous raises It was of course a characteristically insightful suggestion brilliantly slicing through to the heart of the strategic challenge we face at the close of the second millennium But our publisher Rogers Weed was deeply offended by the idea That guy seems to think money grows on trees he complained And so displaying the kind of corporate independence our many enemies think us incapable of we told Mr Gates his idea sucked Well actually we told him that Rogers thought his idea sucked As an alternative to Gates suggestion we have put together a special selection of Slate articles published during our first year We all agree that perusing some of the highlights from a year of Slate is far more pleasurable than a large raise But try it and judge for yourself Black and White and Read Online We inaugurate a new feature this week called Today s Papers To be updated daily six days a week it is a summary and instant analysis of the lead stories in five major U S newspapers the New York Times the Washington Post the Wall Street Journal USA Today and the Los Angeles Times The author Los Angeles writer Scott Shuger will report what the papers chose as the day s big stories assess how they played those stories both placement and content and tell us about any exclusives or unique pieces Today s Papers will of course link where possible to the full stories on these newspapers own Web sites We aim to post Today s Papers by 12 a m Pacific Time 3 a m Eastern Time on the day of publication Sunday through Friday So if you re one of those people who doesn t bother to get five newspapers home delivered each morning go to www slate com for a quick briefing before you face the world so you can embarrass less informed friends and colleagues throughout the day Gear Alert Too many people we regret to report are attempting to read Slate without the proper equipment The proper equipment according to the Webzine Safety Task Force of the American Academy of Internet Bores AAIB is a Slate T shirt and matching baseball cap Attempting to access Slate while improperly dressed can lead to slow download time and even in some cases to the implosion of your computer Please take a few moments to order the appropriate gear directly from the Web scroll right to find the Slate stuff or if you still use one of those old telephone things by calling 800 380 3180 24 hours a day seven days a week Resting on Our Laurels In honor of Slate s first birthday as well as the United States of America s 221 st Slate will not publish next week The site of course will still be available including all current contents The Compost and The Fray Today s Papers will be updated daily throughout the week And there may even be the occasional Dialogue entry or Chatterbox item You never know But Slate s editors and staff will be spending the week in various mountain retreats perfecting the spiritual arts of transcendental meditation and HTML coding Regular posting of new material will resume the evening of Monday July 7 Michael Kinsley
