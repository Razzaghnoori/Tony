 Boston vs Austin It started innocently enough Bobby Kennedy gearing up in the fall of 1959 to manage his brother s upcoming presidential run visited Lyndon Johnson s Texas ranch to inquire after the Senate majority leader s presidential ambitions Johnson assured the younger man that he had none Then as was his wont Johnson took his guest hunting Bobby a Navy vet who never saw action in World War II fixed a deer in his sights squeezed the trigger and landed flat on his back from the recoil Son said Johnson helping him up with a smirk you ve got to learn to handle a gun like a man He went on to break his word by giving Jack Kennedy a fight for the 1960 Democratic presidential nomination Bobby Kennedy never forgave Johnson the slight loathing him to the end Johnson for his part never gave up trying to knock Kennedy on his ass And while their feud may not have defined a decade as Jeff Shesol claims in this wonderfully entertaining original and exceptionally researched book it certainly makes for a hell of a gripping yarn It is hard to imagine two politicians more opposed in temperament than Lyndon Baines Johnson and Robert Francis Kennedy Kennedy was supremely self confident and unyielding Johnson was self pitying and prone to the blackest paranoia For his paranoia readers owe the 36 th president a debt Johnson recorded just about every telephone call he ever placed and Shesol deploys impressive documentary gifts to knock the resulting transcripts into one of the most intimate portraits of the inner life of a White House yet committed to print The kinds of things Johnson reveled in locker room talk and stiff belts of whiskey the muted grays of the Senate s well turned compromises even his own hard earned influence and wealth were the kinds of things against which the Harvard educated Kennedy defined his very identity Indeed one senses that nothing less than the deepest matters of personal identity fueled their intense and bitter rivalry The Bostonian must have sensed that compared with the Texan he came off as snobbish petulant and obtusely rich Kennedy certainly made Johnson feel like a wheedling country bumpkin who was unable to pick out the right suit jacket Kennedy who cherished his very own LBJ voodoo doll called Johnson mean bitter and vicious an animal in many ways Johnson found Kennedy a little shitass and a grandstanding little runt It is not surprising that they didn t care to be in the same place at the same time But circumstances forever conspired to place them in the same place at the same time namely in John F Kennedy s shadow Their enmity began in earnest at the 1960 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles where JFK decisively turned back Johnson s last minute bid for the nomination Not however before Johnson s reckless attempt to derail him by reminding delegates of rumors that Joseph Kennedy Sr while he was ambassador to England had appeased Hitler Now protocol demanded that JFK offer Johnson the second spot on the ticket and honor demanded that Johnson given that he had insulted the candidate s father turn Kennedy down Instead Johnson accepted Bobby was given the unenviable job of marching into Johnson s hotel suite to talk him out of it To make a long story it takes up the greater part of a gripping chapter short The dust lifted with Lyndon the vice presidential candidate loathing Bobby for plotting against him here was Lyndon s paranoia or maybe his ability to spot the hustle and Bobby the campaign manager loathing Lyndon for having the audacity to take a job for which he knew he wasn t the first choice here was Bobby s East Coast arrogance or maybe his idealism Thither to the White House where Attorney General Kennedy whose only previous public service had been as lawyer for two Senate committees earned from journalists the label assistant president for his ubiquity at the highest levels of executive influence while Vice President Johnson who practically ran the government from his Senate chamber in the 1950s found himself so insignificant that he was only informed of Cabinet meetings five minutes in advance JFK s assassination changed everything but the feud which only intensified as the martyr s shadow loomed ever larger In his grief each man blamed the other for the tragedy Bobby had been point man for the administration s Cuban counterinsurgency program whose activities Lyndon insisted privately had certainly brought on the assassination as an act of revenge from Castro Q E D Bobby killed Jack And Lyndon thought Bobby was responsible for his brother s being in Dallas at all to heal a wound in the Texas Democratic Party that Lyndon should never have let fester in the first place Q E D Lyndon killed Jack The executive branch clearly wasn t big enough for the two of them and Kennedy wisely decamped for his successful Senate run Johnson for his part seriously considered dropping out of the 1964 election altogether foreshadowing his 1968 decision not to seek re election Up to this point Shesol s book is nearly flawless though Texan readers might be forgiven for wondering whether Shesol doesn t tip his evidence a little to favor Boston over Austin When the chronicle enters the second half of the 60s however it loses a little of its aplomb This is the period when a single issue Vietnam came to trump all others in establishing the political order of battle With President Johnson s Great Society sluicing off up to 2 billion per month in expenditures on Vietnam and Sen Kennedy being elevated for better or for worse to the role of standard bearer for a generation repulsed by America s imperial presumptions the antagonists became symbols for opposing forces larger than either man could discern By the time they faced each other for the 1968 Democratic presidential nomination the story had outgrown the back room atmospherics Shesol excels in reconstructing This is perhaps why the lesson that Shesol draws from the denouement of the Kennedy Johnson feud feels so unsatisfying He claims that Kennedy is the archetype of today s New Democrat This is not a completely untenable proposition since as Shesol demonstrates toward the end of his life Kennedy began to experiment with some uncannily Clintonesque gestures such as financing urban renewal through market based public private partnerships It is however hard to square Bobby Kennedy whose characteristic response to Johnson s poverty proposals was that they didn t go far enough with the end of welfare as we know it And Shesol overlooks a far more abiding division in contemporary politics than those that divide today s Democrats Like so much that polarizes us these days it is more cultural than strictly political Take a remarkable statistic that Shesol cites but lets pass relatively unexamined In May 1967 Gallup found that the number of people who said they intensely disliked RFK who was also probably more intensely liked than any other practicing politician was twice as high as the number who intensely disliked Johnson the architect of the increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam Exactly who reviled the young senator to such a degree is not broken down further But it is easy to guess Consider the results of another poll this one from 1964 in which Louis Harris found that RFK s presence on a Democratic ticket would gravely hurt the party s chances in the South and border states among businessmen and among fence sitters in both parties That is a rough description of what Kevin Phillips later called the emerging Republican majority the crowd whose voting habits were molded by the act of detesting the likes of Bobby Kennedy politicians who never worked a day in their lives who were eager so the perception went to oppress the plain folk with burdensome taxes in order to fatten the undeserving poor eager to sell out America s military supremacy out of some guilt ridden moralism Politicians who seemed not to know how to handle rifles like men By 1968 that annus horribilis when Johnson cracked from the pressure of mediating an increasingly centripetal Democratic Party and Kennedy fell to an assassin s bullet two political ideal types had solidified a silent majority who supported Johnson s war on Vietnam and voted in Richard Nixon and a new class of liberal professionals and youth who supported Johnson s war on poverty but detested everything Richard Nixon represented This is the mutual contempt hinted at but not developed in this valuable book that haunts us today
