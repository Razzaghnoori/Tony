 More Sex Is Safer Sex By Steven E Landsburg 1102 words posted Friday July 5 to be composted Friday July 12 It s true AIDS is nature s awful retribution for our tolerance of immoderate and socially irresponsible sexual behavior The epidemic is the price of our permissive attitudes toward monogamy chastity and other forms of sexual conservatism You ve read elsewhere about the sin of promiscuity Let me tell you about the sin of self restraint Suppose you walk into a bar and find four potential sex partners Two are highly promiscuous the others venture out only once a year The promiscuous ones are of course more likely to be HIV positive That gives you a 50 50 chance of finding a relatively safe match But suppose all once a year revelers could be transformed into twice a year revelers Then on any given night you d run into twice as many of them Those two promiscuous bar patrons would be outnumbered by four of their more cautious rivals Your odds of a relatively safe match just went up from 50 50 to four out of six That s why increased activity by sexual conservatives can slow down the rate of infection and reduce the prevalence of AIDS In fact according to Professor Michael Kremer of MIT s economics department the spread of AIDS in England could plausibly be retarded if everyone with fewer than about 2 25 partners per year were to take additional partners more frequently That covers three quarters of British heterosexuals between the ages of 18 and 45 Much of this column is inspired by Professor Kremer s research If multiple partnerships save lives then monogamy can be deadly Imagine a country where almost all women are monogamous while all men demand two female partners per year Under those conditions a few prostitutes end up servicing all the men Before long the prostitutes are infected they pass the disease to the men and the men bring it home to their monogamous wives But if each of those monogamous wives was willing to take on one extramarital partner the market for prostitution would die out and the virus unable to spread fast enough to maintain itself might die out along with it Or consider Joan who attended a party where she ought to have met the charming and healthy Martin Unfortunately Fate through its agents at the Centers for Disease Control intervened The morning of the party Martin ran across one of those CDC sponsored subway ads touting the virtues of abstinence Chastened he decided to stay home In Martin s absence Joan hooked up with the equally charming but considerably less prudent Maxwell and Joan got AIDS Abstinence can be even deadlier than monogamy If those subway ads are more effective against the cautious Martins than against the reckless Maxwells then they are a threat to the hapless Joans This is especially so when they displace Calvin Klein ads which might have put Martin in a more socially beneficent mood You might object that even if Martin had dallied with Joan he would only have freed Maxwell to prey on another equally innocent victim To this there are two replies First we don t know that Maxwell would have found another partner Without Joan he might have struck out that night Second reducing the rate of HIV transmission is in any event not the only social goal worth pursuing If it were we d outlaw sex entirely What we really want is to minimize the number of infections resulting from any given number of sexual encounters the flip side of this observation is that it is desirable to maximize the number of consensual sexual encounters leading up to any given number of infections Even if Martin had failed to deny Maxwell a conquest that evening and thus failed to slow the epidemic he could at least have made someone happy To an economist it s clear why people with limited sexual pasts choose to supply too little sex in the present Their services are underpriced If sexual conservatives could effectively advertise their histories HIV conscious suitors would compete to lavish them with attention But that doesn t happen because such conservatives are hard to identify Insufficiently rewarded for relaxing their standards they relax their standards insufficiently So a socially valuable service is under rewarded and therefore under supplied This is a problem we ve experienced before We face it whenever a producer fails to safeguard the environment Extrapolating from their usual response to environmental issues I assume that liberals will want to attack the problem of excessive sexual restraint through coercive regulation As a devotee of the price system I d prefer to encourage good behavior through an appropriate system of subsidies The question is How do we subsidize Martin s sexual awakening without simultaneously subsidizing Maxwell s ongoing predations Just paying people to have sex won t work not with Maxwell around to reap the bulk of the rewards The key is to subsidize something that is used in conjunction with sex and that Martin values more than Maxwell Quite plausibly that something is condoms Maxwell knows that he is more likely than Martin to be infected already and hence probably values condoms less than Martin does Subsidized condoms could be just the ticket for luring Martin out of his shell without stirring Maxwell to a new frenzy of activity As it happens there is another reason to subsidize condoms Condom use itself is under rewarded When you use one you are protecting both yourself and your future partners but you are rewarded with a lower chance of infection only for protecting yourself Your future partners don t know about your past condom use and therefore can t reward it with extravagant courtship That means you fail to capture the benefits you re conferring and as a result condoms are underused It is often argued that subsidized or free condoms have an upside and a downside The upside is that they reduce the risk from a given encounter and the downside is that they encourage more encounters But it s plausible that in reality that s not an upside and a downside it s two upsides Without the subsidies people don t use enough condoms and the sort of people who most value condoms don t have enough sex partners All these problems along with the case for subsidies would vanish if our sexual pasts could somehow be made visible so that future partners could reward past prudence and thereby provide appropriate incentives Perhaps technology can ultimately make that solution feasible I envision the pornography of the future Her skirt slid to the floor and his gaze came to rest on her thigh where
