 Why i Wonderful Life i Comes but Once a Year It s a Wonderful Life aired on television last weekend one of its only 1999 broadcasts Just a few years ago the movie seemed to be shown on a different channel almost every day throughout the Christmas season What changed U S copyright law determines who may distribute display or reproduce a film a book a drawing essentially anything fixed in a permanent medium as the lawyers like to say Works not covered by copyrights including ones with copyrights that have expired and those that never secured this protection are said to be in the public domain These works like the near ancient Sherlock Holmes stories and some of Charlie Chaplin s silent films can be reproduced broadcast and sold freely It s a Wonderful Life entered the public domain by accident In 1946 when the movie was filmed U S copyright protection lasted 28 years and could be renewed for another 28 years by filing some paperwork and paying a nominal fee However Republic Pictures the original copyright owner and producer of Wonderful Life neglected to renew the 1946 copyright in 1974 So the film entered the public domain Though a box office flop on release it became immensely popular on television thanks to repeated showings Stations programmed it heavily during the holidays paying no royalties to its producers and more than 100 distributors sold the movie on tape Republic regained control of the lucrative property in 1993 by flexing a new Supreme Court ruling that determined that the holder of a copyright to a story from which a movie was made had certain property rights over the movie itself Since Republic still owned the copyrighted story behind It s a Wonderful Life and had also purchased exclusive rights to the movie s copyrighted music it was able to essentially yank the movie out of the public domain It claimed that since Wonderful Life relied on these copyrighted works the film could no longer be shown without the studio s blessing Technically the film itself is not copyrighted One could hypothetically replace the music rearrange the footage and sell or show the new product but no one has done this In 1994 Republic signed a long term deal granting NBC exclusive rights to broadcast the movie and the network typically does so between one and three times a year Wonderful Life won t re enter the public domain for quite a while Congress has repeatedly expanded copyright protections and made them effective retroactively Most recently at the behest of Disney and other large media corporations with soon to expire copyrights Congress added 20 years to all existing copyright claims They now stand at 95 years for copyrights held by corporations The copyright protection for individual writers and artists lasts 70 years beyond their deaths Thus showings of Wonderful Life will remain limited well into the 21 st century In 1998 Republic s parent company Spelling Entertainment a subsidiary of Viacom sold the rights to Republic s film library to Artisan Entertainment Next question
