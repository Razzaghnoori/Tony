morning click here Dublin newspapers Thursday urged a yes vote in Friday s two referendums in Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic on the political settlement for Ulster The Irish Times reporting a resurgence in Ulster Protestant support for the agreement said in an editorial Yes gives a chance a good chance for peace and stability No leads back to despair and violence The Irish Independent carried an editorial page article by Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern appealing strongly for a yea vote The good reputation of the island will be immeasurably enhanced if we can cast off the negative impression of conflict as President Clinton has pointed out Ahern said The Times of London said in an editorial that although there are a thousand devils in the details of the agreement democrats should accept the convenient rather than insist on the perfect they should vote yes The Times also warned British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he must stand by his pledge that there will be no fudge between democracy and terror If he fails to insist on the decommissioning of weapons before paramilitaries could hold office in the new Northern Ireland assembly democrats will be entitled to walk away from an agreement which Mr Blair had dishonoured The conservative Daily Telegraph which is strongly supportive of the Ulster Unionists highlighted the agreement s weaknesses and while not recommending a no vote said in an editorial that if a majority of the Unionists were to vote negative their decision should be respected Let no one outside Ulster dare accuse them of bigotry or belligerence it said In voting No they too will be expressing their desire for peace and their sorrowful belief that it is not in reality on offer As President Suharto resigned in Indonesia a commentary written just beforehand by Simon Beck for the South China Morning Post said that the U S response to the crisis in Indonesia had been so low key some critics believe it to be almost non

the Hill Predicting that the delegates would be subjected to continuous U S cross examination about Pakistan s nuclear intentions an unidentified Pakistani diplomat in Washington told the newspaper s correspondent there that they should have chosen a better time to come to the United States on a junket Why to spoil the fun they want to have at this time when every American wants to know what Pakistan is doing the diplomat said And if they want to know what the Americans are doing sadly the Americans do not know it themselves In an op ed piece in Dawn former Pakistani Finance Minister Mahbubul Haq said that Pakistan which for the past 10 years has suffered the wrath of the global community on the nuclear issue should now make the international community ashamed of itself through its nuclear restraint and ensure that it is India that is treated as a pariah nation The Deccan Chronicle of India said the United States has overreacted to India s nuclear tests with a punishment that is not merely heavy but also rather vengeful In an editorial Thursday it said there was an element of contradiction in President Clinton s current policy of unleashing all permissible sanctions against India while offering every gift in its possession to Pakistan to stop it carrying out nuclear tests in retaliation If his aim was to prevent a nuclear confrontation between Pakistan and India then the same purpose would obviously be achieved by allowing Pakistan to conduct the tests so that the principle of mutual nuclear deterrence would automatically come into force and nuclear
