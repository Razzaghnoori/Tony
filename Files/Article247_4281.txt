 Good Intentions and Cracked Premises Dear Jim Idealism sweet as ether boils off the pages of the book that we ve been assigned to read and discuss this week Jay Rosen s history of and argument for public journalism What Are Journalists For I ve survived its narcotizing effect and hope that you re more enthusiastic about Rosen s ideas than I am so we can enjoy a two fisted exchange For readers arriving late to the debate over public journalism we should define it and sketch its 10 year history not that that will be easy Public journalism as propounded by Rosen is so broad and vague so infused with good intentions and cracked premises that it melts at first touch Something horrible has happened to public life Rosen believes He doesn t blame politicians for the disaster Or corporations Or Hollywood Or even our campaign finance system or handguns Rosen finds journalists culpable for the nation s cynical politics our public alienation our adversarial culture as well as the violence perpetrated by terrorist bombers like Timothy McVeigh Our crime We reporters and editors have failed to promote and enhance democracy as imaged by philosopher John Dewey in the 1920s I m not kidding What Are Journalists For is a Deweyan call to arms to rebuild democracy Never mind the old clich s about telling truth to power or writing the first draft of history Instead of hiding behind objective reporting journalists should foster conversation and dialogue in the community to empower citizens in the democratic process In the past decade Rosen has been much pilloried by journalists for his diagnosis and prescription most notably by editorial page editor Howell Raines of the New York Times and Len Downie executive editor of the Washington Post But daily newspapers in Wichita Detroit San Jose Columbus Norfolk Charlotte and elsewhere have lit their candles from Rosen s flame and subscribed to his four step cure which holds that journalists should Approach citizens as potential participants in public affairs rather than victims or spectators Help the political community act upon rather than just learn about its problems Improve the climate of public discussion Help make public life go well so that it earns its claim on our attention Wicked mush don t you think For one thing a story wouldn t necessarily be bad journalism if it hit on all four of Rosen s cylinders But it wouldn t necessarily be good if it did would it In the coming days I want to examine some of Rosen s premises such as his idea that a declining interest in the news can be linked to journalism as currently practiced But I m running out of space and smelling salts and must turn this enterprise over to you Regards Jack
