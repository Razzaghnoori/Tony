 Apocalypse Then How do you portray violence in movies nowadays so that it isn t a turn on Nearly 30 years ago Sam Peckinpah devised a massacre at the climax of The Wild Bunch that he thought would take the casualness out of killing He lingered on it slowed it down fastened on blood spurting bodies as they hurtled through the air and ended up making it lyrical aestheticizing it distancing it Less well intentioned filmmakers followed in the wake of Bloody Sam turning carnage into spectacle even into rock n roll What Steven Spielberg has accomplished in Saving Private Ryan is to make violence terrible again Nothing in the movie s melodramatic narrative can diminish the shocking immediacy of its combat scenes The opening battle might be the most visceral ever put on film After a solemn but predictable modern day prologue an old man and his extended family trudge out to a cemetery to view row upon row of white crosses there s a shock cut to the boats of Allied soldiers surging toward Omaha Beach in Normandy France It s D Day 1944 Trembling hands open a canteen They belong to a familiar star Tom Hanks but everything that follows is alien The camera is down in the surf pitching as young men pray and vomit They ve barely beached before the first bullets come before these smooth faced overgrown kids begin to get blown through We don t see the enemy machine guns or rifles but we hear the pops and the ceaseless whine of bullets and we watch the men as their chests and heads explode Some drop underwater but still the bullets come in near silence producing squalls of blood above the water the din resumes with a vengeance The images are supersharp as if viewed through too strong glasses yet they streak and pixilate break into shards as the camera jerks wildly left then right Color has been drained from the frame The greens of uniforms and browns of earth are muted the sky rendered a neutral gray Against this monochromatic palette the brackish blood leaps out of the screen That blood is everywhere A helmet full of seawater turns out to be full of sloshing gore a soldier with a gushing arm socket picks up his severed limb and staggers aimlessly a man with his intestines on the outside wails through a last protracted hemorrhage A soldier s helmet stops a bullet with a clank he removes it in wonder his brains are then blown out For nearly half an hour the horrors come one upon another unaccompanied by music and unrelieved by any point of view except that of the soldiers in the middle of the slaughter There are no objective establishing shots and no possibility for emotional distance Nauseated I fixed on Hanks because I knew the star would survive until at least the last reel But even that reassurance seemed precarious In Saving Private Ryan death can come at any instant from any direction For the rest of the film s running time nearly three hours total each action even a small one such as the eating of an apple is thick with potential finality This is not the work of the Spielberg we ve come to know After Jaws 1975 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 he could afford to build any set throw money at any creative problem His mise en sc ne became increasingly synthetic He seemed to lose touch with the texture of life Even Schindler s List 1993 edged into the movie ish Deciding to shoot Saving Private Ryan as if it were a war documentary gives Spielberg s art a new orientation Or rather a new disorientation He shoots battles so that we can t always see what s happening our vantage is frighteningly restricted and the world of combat is reduced to pure sensation This isn t about bravery or heroism but getting from Point A to Point B without being torn apart by bullets Saving Private Ryan from a script by Robert Rodat doesn t remain as feverishly abstract as its imagery but at its best early on it feels undiagramed unmapped A squadron of Omaha survivors led by Capt Miller Hanks is sent behind enemy lines to find one Pvt Ryan whose three brothers have been killed on the same day in separate battles The seven men under Miller s command are furious with what they see as a PR mission and a misallocation of military resources they can t believe they re risking their lives to rescue one anonymous private But we in the audience know that the mission is more than PR that Gen Marshall Harve Presnell sounding like Bob Dole has ordered it out of a Lincolnesque compassion for all the families ripped apart by war Freighted with such symbolism the odyssey cannot help but amount to something Miller s journey into the bowels of the war through rubbled villages and fields strewn with rotting corpses attains the surreal intensity that Francis Ford Coppola strove for in Apocalypse Now 1979 except without the self conscious Golden Bough stabs at myth making Spielberg stages an agonizingly prolonged encounter with a German sniper in a mounting drizzle the life of a wounded exposed soldier streaming out of his body with the rainwater The next assault is different an attack on a concrete Nazi pillbox that s barely glimpsed through the thick smoke the action viewed through the eyes of the squadron s skinny bookish translator Jeremy Davies After the shooting subsides the tenderfoot hurries ahead to discover the group s medic Giovanni Ribisi mortally wounded being ministered to by squadron mates hysterically pressing the dying man for instructions on how to stop his bleeding It s no wonder that later the men go through piles of dog tags taken off dead Americans with little more than numb irritation and that when they finally stumble on Pvt Ryan Matt Damon they can barely contain their hostility Soldiers in war movies are usually undercharacterized it comes with the territory But these young actors register Vin Diesel s loping charisma made me sad to see him blown away so early and Barry Pepper gives a stock part the sniper who prays fervently before he kills a monomaniac concentration Mellish Adam Goldberg s nervy Jew who can t keep from taunting captured Germans with his religious identity is a study in aggression like Groucho without punch lines There are stellar turns by Davies Ribisi Tom Sizemore as a plodding but good hearted sergeant and Edward Burns whose acting is less mannered when removed from his own movies Tom Hanks efforts to submerge his moody wise guy personality dovetails movingly with his character s struggle to keep his humanity in check I find Damon s proletarian integrity deeply suspect but must admit that he holds the camera like a star and that finding Pvt Ryan is not an anticlimax The battles in Saving Private Ryan make most World War II pictures seem like Hollywood kid stuff even the bleak existential ones like Sam Fuller s Steel Helmet 1951 and Don Siegel s Hell Is for Heroes 1962 These sequences carry a post Vietnam aura of futility and the scenes between the skirmishes are similarly modern full of rambling talk and post Godot waiting around But the movie s overall vision is surprisingly old fashioned In most Vietnam films authority is insane Here orders from on high bring meaning a glimpse of a more divine purpose The mission has the opposite end of the one in Apocalypse Now not the war s heart of darkness but its heart of light There s another more virulent way in which the movie is old fashioned In the course of the endless massacre of Americans on Omaha Beach I wrote in my notebook No one who experiences this scene will ever cheer for a war again But when the tide of the battle turned and the Germans started getting their heads blown off I wrote YES And when a pair of Allied soldiers fresh from witnessing their buddies being blown to bits shot several pleading Germans rather than take them prisoner I didn t applaud the act but I didn t feel much like grieving either The Germans are faceless with one exception a captured pillbox Nazi who babbles and cajoles for his life sings American anthems extols Betty Grable s gams and screams Fuck Hitler Reiben Burns and Mellish want to blow him away but the translator who has almost never fired a gun protests vigorously that such an act would be a war crime and that the German must be taken prisoner or freed It would be wrong to give away what happens next but the consequence of the squadron s action is ham handedly predictable and morally speaking takes the picture down a peg Too bad It goes without saying however that Spielberg makes the case that soldiers morals explode like land mines amid the terrors of war This is not after all where they live It s hard to recall a more chilling stretch in modern movies than the one before the last big battle when the American soldiers surrounded by the debris of a devastated town listen to the echoey piped in strains of an Edith Piaf recording and then hear the first low rumbles of approaching German tanks each man alone in the shared knowledge that this foreign music will likely be the last they ll hear
