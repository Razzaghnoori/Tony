 Lucent Should Stick With What It Knows For a company whose roots are in Bell Labs source of innumerable technological breakthroughs Lucent is surprisingly unembarrassed about buying technology that it can t or doesn t want to build itself Since it was spun off from AT T three years ago Lucent has made 29 acquisitions at a cost of 32 billion including a major deal it closed today when it agreed to acquire Excel Switching Corp for 1 7 billion While it s now well known that at least half of all mergers fail in the sense that they destroy rather than create shareholder value it s also become well known that certain companies are exceptionally good at integrating acquisitions into their existing operations Not coincidentally perhaps two of the best are competitors namely Lucent and Cisco which reader beware I own shares in Cisco in fact closed a small deal today spending 143 million to acquire MaxComm Technologies which specializes in high speed Net access And before the year is out expect Lucent and Cisco to announce more deals It s a kind of acquisition arms race For the most part the logic behind that race is compelling Lucent with its roots in more traditional telephone equipment is trying to move strongly into computer and data networks Cisco for its part wants to build on its already commanding position in data networking even as it shifts more and more of its business to take advantage of the explosion in the Internet And with technology shifting and developing as rapidly as it is it s difficult let s say impossible for any company to keep everything in house Instead smaller companies create and develop technology and Cisco and Lucent step in buy up these companies with their pricey stock and reap the benefits Needless to say this strategy works only if you re good at bringing companies on board without wrecking them or yourself Both Lucent and Cisco are The danger in all this though is overreaching stretching a company beyond what it s really good at Take last week s 3 7 billion acquisition by Lucent of International Network Services a telecom consulting firm that helps companies design install and maintain computer and data networks The deal was hailed by analysts and the press as a powerful move by Lucent into services offering the possibility that companies will now be able to come to Lucent for one stop shopping Not only will we sell you the equipment Lucent can now promise but we ll help you install it and keep it running Hell we ll even tell you why you should buy it in the first place That last point signals one of the obvious problems with the deal which is that INS s business depends on the fact that companies trust it to give them the best advice possible If every time a company asks an INS consultant what kind of system it should install the consultant says Why Lucent of course companies aren t going to be trusting INS much longer But even aside from that this was a dubious acquisition because in essence Lucent paid 3 7 billion to buy a business whose profit margins and earnings growth are significantly lower than Lucent s This may seem counterintuitive given that all you hear about lately is how important it is that IBM is moving into services i e its e business initiative or that Hewlett Packard is revitalizing itself as a services company But the truth is that it s better to make hardware or software than to be in services Consulting is a fine business on its own terms But next to making switches or routers let alone Windows 98 it s mediocre at best The reason is obvious Services require people and always will When you re making hardware or even better licensing software all your costs are under your control and once the product is actually developed your profit margins are very high And production lines can be automated Consulting though is by definition a labor intensive time intensive business Profit margins are much lower INS s net margins profit divided by revenue are around 8 percent while Cisco s are at 20 percent This is inherent in the nature of the business Lucent won t be able to change it It s understandable what with the new vogue for one stop shopping that Lucent would want to offer services in addition to equipment But in acquiring INS Lucent appears to be forgetting one of the most important lessons of the past two decades Companies do best when they do only what they do best
