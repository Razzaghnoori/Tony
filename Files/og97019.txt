analysis of the rule ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 24750 May 16 1996 incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the expected impact on small entities The analysis provides the information required by paragraphs 603 b 1 through b 3 It describes the reasons for the proposed agency action and its objectives and legal basis It also describes the small entities radio manufacturers and suppliers of radio equipment to which the proposed rule will apply It states that there are no reporting or recordkeeping requirements and that the rule does not overlap duplicate or conflict with any other federal rules Finally the analysis states that the FCC is unaware of any other alternatives which could provide sufficient spectrum in the immediate future but invites comments on this point Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The preamble to the final rule contains the full text of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 62 Fed Reg 4652 This analysis includes the information required by paragraph 604 a by summarizing and evaluating comments received Based on comments which contend that making 350 megahertz as proposed available would interfere with the interests of incumbent or future operations such as mobile satellite service and amateur radio parties the FCC concludes that 300 megahertz is appropriate for the U NII devices to operate Additionally the FCC did not adopt safe harbor rules at this time as suggested by some commenters to avoid interference However the situation will be monitored and if interference problems do arise the safe harbor issue will be addressed in future rulemaking GAO OGC 97
