 Introduction Genes of the ERBB family encode receptor tyrosine kinases that mediate cellular responses to growth signals Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase domains of two ERBB genes epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR and HER2 have been found in a proportion of lung adenocarcinomas 1 2 3 4 For EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to the small molecule kinase inhibitors gefitinib Iressa 1 2 3 and erlotinib Tarceva 3 ERBB signaling pathways include downstream GTPases encoded by RAS genes Some 15 30 of lung adenocarcinomas contain activating mutations in the RAS family member KRAS These mutations are most frequently found in codons 12 and 13 in exon 2 5 6 and may be associated with unfavorable outcomes 7 Interestingly EGFR and KRAS mutations are rarely found in the same tumors suggesting that they have functionally equivalent roles in lung tumorigenesis 8 M Meyerson personal communication Furthermore EGFR mutations are common in tumors from patients who have smoked less than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes never smokers 3 while KRAS mutations more commonly occur in individuals with a history of substantial cigarette use 9 We sought to determine whether KRAS mutations could also be used to predict primary sensitivity or resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib We systematically evaluated 60 lung adenocarcinomas from patients with known responses to either of these drugs for the presence of mutations in EGFR exons 18 through 21 and KRAS2 exon 2 Here we show that mutations in KRAS are associated with primary resistance to single agent gefitinib or erlotinib Our results suggest that a determination of mutational status for both EGFR and KRAS may help define which patients are likely to benefit from receiving gefitinib or erlotinib Methods Tissue Procurement Tumor specimens were obtained through protocols approved by the institutional review board of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as previously described 3 see Protocols S1 S3 Tumor material obtained from patients prior to kinase inhibitor treatment for lung cancer was collected retrospectively for patients on gefitinib who received 250 mg or 500 mg orally once daily n 24 and prospectively for patients on erlotinib who received 150 mg orally once daily n 36 The latter cohort of patients was part of a clinical trial of erlotinib for patients with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma The analysis presented here includes specimens we previously reported on n 17 for gefitinib and n 17 for erlotinib 3 All specimens were reviewed by a single reference pathologist M F Z Imaging studies were assessed by a single reference radiologist R T H who graded responses according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors RECIST 10 Both observers were blinded to patient outcomes Eight of nine patients with tumors sensitive to gefitinib had objective partial responses as defined by RECIST i e at least a 30 decrease in the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions taking as reference the sum measured at baseline The ninth patient had marked clinical improvement as ascertained by two independent reviewing physicians and manifested by lessened dyspnea and cancer related pain However this individual had radiographic lesions pleural and bone metastases that were deemed nonmeasurable by RECIST criteria As erlotinib treated patients were all in a clinical trial all had disease measurable using RECIST guidelines For both drugs in this study tumors were considered refractory if they did not undergo sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response This definition includes patients whose best overall response was either progression of disease n 26 or stable disease n 12 as defined by RECIST No patients had a complete response Mutational Analyses of EGFR and KRAS in Lung Tumors Genomic DNA was extracted from tumors embedded in paraffin blocks except for tumor 109T which was a fresh frozen tumor specimen Primers for EGFR analyses exons 18 21 were as published 3 For KRAS analyses the following nested primer sets for exon 2 were used huKRAS2 ex2F 5 GAATGGTCCTGCACCAGTAA 3 huKRAS2 ex2R 5 GTGTGACATGTTCTAATATAGTCA 3 huKRAS2 ex2Fint 5 GTCCTGCACCAGTAATATGC 3 and huKRAS2 ex2Rint 5 ATGTTCTAATATAGTCACATTTTC 3 For both EGFR and KRAS PCR was performed using the HotStarTaq Master Mix Kit Qiagen Valencia California United States as per manufacturer s instructions Use of this method often obviated the need for nested PCR sets All sequencing reactions were performed in both forward and reverse directions and all mutations were confirmed by PCR amplification of an independent DNA isolate In 12 cases exon 19 deletions were also studied by length analysis of fluorescently labeled PCR products on a capillary electrophoresis device using the following primers EGFR Ex19 FWD1 5 GCACCATCTCACAATTGCCAGTTA 3 and EGFR Ex19 REV1 5 Fam AAAAGGTGGGCCTGAGGTTCA 3 Using serial dilutions of DNA from the H1650 non small cell lung cancer cell line exon 19 deletion positive 11 this assay detects the mutant allele when H1650 DNA comprises 6 or more of the total DNA tested compared to a sensitivity of 12 for direct sequencing These same cases were also screened for the exon 21 L858R mutation by a PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism assay based on a new Sau96I restriction site created by the L858R mutation 2 573T G The Sau96I digested fluorescently labeled PCR products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis and the following primers were used EGFR Ex21 FWD1 5 CCTCACAGCAGGGTCTTCTCTGT 3 and EGFR Ex21 REV1 5 Fam TCAGGAAAATGCTGGCTGACCTA 3 Using serial dilutions of DNA from the H1975 cell line L858R positive 11 this assay detects the mutant allele when H1975 DNA comprises 3 or more of the total DNA tested compared to a sensitivity of 6 for direct sequencing Q Pan W Pao and M Ladanyi unpublished data Statistics Fisher s Exact Test was used to calculate p values and confidence intervals were calculated using Statistics with Confidence software 12 Results We identified 60 lung adenocarcinomas from individual patients with tumors shown to be sensitive or refractory to single agent gefitinib or erlotinib and evaluated these tumors for mutations in EGFR and KRAS Collectively nine of 38 24 tumors refractory to either kinase inhibitor had KRAS mutations while zero of 21 0 drug sensitive tumors had such mutations p 0 02 Table 1 The 95 confidence intervals CIs for these observations are 13 39 and 0 16 respectively Conversely 17 of 22 77 tumors sensitive to either kinase inhibitor had EGFR mutations in contrast to zero of 38 0 drug resistant tumors p 6 8 10 11 The 95 CIs for these observed response rates are 57 90 and 0 9 respectively All 17 tumors with EGFR mutations responded to gefitinib or erlotinib while all nine tumors with KRAS mutations did not p 3 2 10 7 Correlation of EGFR and KRAS mutational status with drug and treatment response is detailed in Table 1 The spectrum of KRAS mutations is shown in Figure 1 and Table 2 Results with gefitinib and erlotinib were similar overall However the incidence of KRAS mutations in the patients treated with erlotinib was low probably because of the fact that all patients treated with this drug had bronchioloalveolar carcinoma which rarely has RAS mutations 13 Alternatively our analyses involving only exon 2 of KRAS2 may have missed some RAS mutations However in our analysis of the exonic regions encoding the first 100 amino acids of KRAS in 110 surgically resected early stage non small cell lung cancers we have found 18 mutations and all were in either codon 12 or codon 13 encoded by exon 2 W Pao R Wilson H Varmus unpublished data Another possibility is that the erlotinib treated tumors have mutations in other RAS genes since a minority of RAS mutations in lung cancer have been reported to occur in N or HRAS 5 6 Discussion These results have important clinical implications First they extend previous data from our group and others showing that lung adenocarcinomas containing EGFR mutations are associated with sensitivity to gefitinib or erlotinib 17 of 17 in this series 100 observed response rate 95 CI 82 100 Second these data show that tumors with KRAS exon 2 mutations n 9 are associated with a lack of response to these kinase inhibitors 0 observed response rate 95 CI 0 30 Third no drug sensitive tumors had KRAS exon 2 mutations n 21 Whether KRAS mutational status can be used to predict responses to gefitinib or erlotinib in patients whose tumors have wild type EGFR sequence is still under investigation our analysis comparing response rates for tumors with neither EGFR nor KRAS mutations versus tumors with wild type EGFR but mutated KRAS does not reach statistical significance five of 22 versus zero of nine p 0 29 Nevertheless these findings suggest that patients whose lung adenocarcinomas have KRAS mutations will not experience significant tumor regression with either drug The incidence of EGFR mutations in tumors responsive to EGFR kinase inhibitors has varied from 71 to 100 1 2 3 and this paper Thus at this point patients whose tumors test negative for EGFR mutations should not necessarily be precluded from treatment with either gefitinib or erlotinib Data presented here suggest that clinical decisions regarding the use of these agents in patients with lung adenocarcinomas might be improved in the future by pre treatment mutational profiling of both EGFR and KRAS These findings warrant validation in large prospective trials using standardized mutation
