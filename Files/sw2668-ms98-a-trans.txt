        are you are you a TIer Carla     yeah i am   oh and you work in the Sherman plant uh whereabouts   uhhuh uh in the front end the wafer fab   oh okay good deal oh im in Dallas im in uh in SC group QRA i im kind of a worldwide quality manager based here in Dallas uh mostly the offshore assembly sites   where do you work uhhuh oh great oh wow   except im fixing not to be a TIer after a week from today   you going to Motorola   no im going to Onum   oh   uh its a subcontractor house they uh they builds in fact they build product for TI but its been thirty two years so i mean ive ive served ive done my time   oh oh yeah   okay you ready to talk about taxes okay   oh yeah were you happy with your return this year  were you happy with your tax return this year   huh what did you say no  no   was it negative   okay i guess were on the air now   okay   uh well what do you uh what do you think uh uh whats your biggest gripe do you think is it the proposed state income tax or the or the gigantic federal income tax we seem to be paying every year or what   i think my biggest gripe is the gigantic federal income tax i came from a state that paid uh state taxes three years ago and that seemed to be relatively small compared to like the uh the tax you pay on sales sale items   umhum umhum   and um i dont know i think uh my biggest gripe is with federal   what what state are you from Carla   Indiana   Indiana you had a state income tax there are you able to credit that against your federal income tax   right yeah though its a percentage you divide that well you uh how much you paid or something by your federal   oh okay so you do get some credit but not the whole thing   right   okay because   theres a lot of tax breaks for like you know a lot of things if youre involved in the state like uh giving to colleges and things like that theyll break you for   oh i see okay what uh uh what generally what percent of your income is it   um not even sure because i was a student so i didnt pay that much   oh okay okay   but uh   because as as you know where uh theres theres uh a ugly rumors on the horizon out there that we may be faced with that here in Texas   right and what percent would that be   yeah uh i have no idea i i i uh im im originally from Massachusetts but they didnt have a state income tax when i worked when i lived there so i have uh no and i know they have one now uh and i have no idea i have no idea what it is   uhhuh uhhuh   but you know getting to the back getting back to the Federal income tax i remember during the Reagan administration i think it was the Tax Reform Act of nineteen eighty six or something like that when the taxes were reduced and it was made simpler and all that kind of stuff   uhhuh uhhuh   uh i dont believe it its worse   i know well you cant deduct for credit card interest that type of thing   oh sure and i seem to have more of that every year and yeah the only thing thats left deductible is uh is mortgage uh interest basically   yeah right right   and would then and and thats significant and every once in a while they make noises like theyre going to take that out and that would just kill the housing industry if they did   oh yeah   and and uh one other things that i only found out this year and uh uh i thought at one time i worked in Malaysia for TI and and had more money than i knew what to do with so i started making accelerated house payments and i said gee you know this would be great because ill ill have a lot of equity in my house   uhhuh   then when my children are old enough to go to college ill get a equity loan which will increase my mortgage so ill be able to get money to send them to college and then get the mortgage interest deduction part   oh wow   guess what   what happened   that thats not legal in Texas its the only state in the country that its not legal everybody else can do it but in Texas   oh my gosh   and and so i i got this three thousand foot five bedroom house that ive got almost paid off and have all kinds of equity in it and dont have  and you know struggling to keep ive got two children in college and im going to have three by September   oh man   but but uh it it was just my fault not checking it up because ive heard of people doing it so i thought it was pretty good deal   uhhuh   so but the uh uh i i it just seems to me that the that the income tax is getting a bigger and bigger hunk of us every year   oh yeah   and and im not exactly sure what what we get in return i was listening to a talk show i dont know we ever get any talk shows from Dallas up there but i listened to David Gold this afternoon on KLIF and he was saying that in nineteen fifty four   uhhuh   Americans paid about one cent on the dollar in taxes   uhhuh   and now were paying something like a little over fifty fifty cents when you consider federal income tax FICA tax sales tax and all the other things we get hit with   fifty cents its incredible   and it is it is absolutely incredible and and and the mentality that you cure ills by throwing money at it and you throw and you raise the money to throw at it by raising taxes is just absolutely terrible   uh   uh is you know do you have children in school   no i dont i just got married i dont have any children   oh you know you just got married okay well you one of the worst things in Texas how long you been in Texas     three years   oh okay well youll find out one of these days because you probably came from a state thats got a very decent public school system and youll find out that in Texas weve got uh i think we rank fiftieth out of fifty states   uhhuh yeah   and and the way they keep proposing fixing that is to raise taxes spend more money   i think what would cure that problem is to consolidate some of these schools and they wouldnt have so much money going to so many different schools   yeah well that plus that fact that you look into the weve got some very good private schools here and more and more people are sending their children private schools and what you look in the private schools is theyve got a higher proportion of people on the payroll that are teaching   yeah   than they do in the public schools and and my my son goes to a uh high school here in the Richardson school district which is one of the better ones in Texas   yeah ive heard that   uh and and and uh however my goodness they got an assistant principal for everything   really   and and and theyve got uh i dont know what the ratio is but theyve got a tremendously high ratio of administrative people to people that are actually out there teaching and it is sor t of like we do at TI   sounds like TI is was getting ready to   yeah yeah we get we get fat in those areas and yeah and and and and we got they they got a lot of overhead in those schools and rather than throw more money at it they got to figure out how to get get the most out of the people that they got   yeah and then all your money goes to overhead uhhuh   uh and and get them in the classroom plus uh i dont know it seems to me that that more so than when i went to school there are a lot of courses that arent going allow first first of all theyre not college prep courses and i dont think theyre going help a person make a living theyre just sort of things to get the kids their twenty one credits so they can graduate   right yeah   and  and and all that and so im not im not overly pleased with that either but the uh uh the tax thing and i think our sales tax is uh uh somewhere around eight percent now isnt it   right in Dallas it uh might be a little less here in Sherman   and yeah i i think right here in Dallas were paying about eight percent and you know uh i say i was initially from Massachusetts ive been here thirty two years but they used to call it Taxachusetts and uh i was there on business last weekend   oh really   and i i made a few purchases and i realized that as bad as their reputation is their sales tax only about five percent   oh wow   and i know there were several things that i bought that were something in the order of a dollar and i noticed it was about five cents added onto it plus it doesnt cut it as early you know you buy a ten cent candy in seven eleven here and you pay eleven cents   uhhuh oh really   for it and and i notice theirs doesnt cut in much below fifty cents i think so so the little items you pay what the price tag says   well now if they propose this the if this you know state income tax goes through are they going to lower the sales tax   i dont know i i dont i bet theyre not i ill absolutely bet theyre not it its interesting i wish i knew this question was coming up because ive only heard of it in bits and pieces but apparently there was a bill before the federal legislature today to uh lower social security tax but the other end of it they were going to raise income taxes   oh man   they were going to they were going to give with one hand and take away with the other and i i just heard bits and pieces on the radio today and i i hadnt uh uh i havent heard that i havent heard that much about it uh what what kind of a sales tax was in Indiana Indiana   think it was like five and a half percent   uhhuh okay yeah did you go to school there in Indiana  Indiana University   yeah Purdue no Purdue   oh Purdue okay you were you were a Boilermaker huh yeah yeah you follow the girls uh basketball team boy we were were tremendous uh girls basketball fans here and we saw them we saw them play in the Midwest Regionals down in Austin last year   uhhuh oh yeah yeah oh great oh   and we were Lady Longhorn fans naturally but we did see Purdue so were aware uh that theyve that theyve got a very good program there   yeah they well its just been the last three or four years actually they had poor seasons before that but   yeah yeah and i think they went further this year uh i i think they got into the second or third round of the of the playoff this year   yeah they yeah theyve been exciting to watch   yeah and uh thats an  what did you get get your degree in   supervision   okay supervision supervision thats an interesting degree uh what what sort of things does it entail   yeah lot of theory um its pretty its pretty broad   uhhuh   uh took some engineering courses some math a lot of uh a lot of theory lot of practical like personal um problems and personnel problems and that type of thing   are you are you actively in supervision now have have you taken some of the TI supervisory skill courses   yeah yeah the The Boss Course   yeah the Boss Course   yeah that was a really good course   yeah and and i was i was going to ask you what did you think of it relevant to some of
