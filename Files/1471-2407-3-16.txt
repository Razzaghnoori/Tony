 Background Radiotherapy treatment planning is in broad terms the process of planning the delivery of a prescribed dose to a tumor or target volume while minimizing dose to the surrounding critical structures Prior to the modern radiotherapy treatment planning era the optimum plan was decided upon using qualitative criteria or by estimating the inhomogeneity of the dose in the target or in critical regions With the advent of CT based planning the planning process could be done with increased precision as 3 dimensional structures representing the target and critical structures could be defined more accurately and reproducibly One of the most useful tools which emerged in the 3 dimensional planning era that could be used in establishing the acceptability or unacceptability of a treatment plan is the dose volume histogram DVH 1 The DVH is used ubiquitously and plots delivered dose on the x axis and percent volume of the structure of interest on the y axis The general shape and area under the DVH curve is instrumental in determining adequate coverage and homogeneity of dose in the target volume as well as in determining acceptable dose to critical structures Indeed the DVH has occupied a central role in modern treatment planning 2 3 4 5 The DVH is not without its limitations however First there is an inherent loss of spatial information with the construction of a DVH plot Second the dose plotted on the x axis of a conventional DVH C DVH is conventional dose which does not take into account many factors influencing the effects of the dose on the given tissue Among them are the of the structure which can vary considerably for early vs late reacting tissues and for early vs late reactions within the same tissue time taken to deliver treatment fraction size and length of treatment interruptions For this reason the concept of biological effective dose BED was developed 6 7 and has been studied extensively by the radiobiology community Because the BED incorporates factors related to delivery of treatment and tissue factors it is a better representation of the dose delivered to a given tissue than conventional dose 6 7 8 The application of BED has particular importance to radiation treatment planning for prostate cancer The prostate more so than any other disease site has been the focus of advances in treatment delivery technique The prostate has been the paradigm site for treatment planning efforts related to conformal therapy 9 10 11 12 and intensity modulated radiotherapy IMRT inverse planning 13 14 Also the prostate has been the leading disease site for efforts related to improving daily setup 15 and incorporating organ motion into the delivery strategy 16 These above efforts have allowed for dose escalation of the prostate while minimizing early and late treatment toxicity 9 10 11 12 13 14 17 In view of the lead role the prostate has taken in understanding treatment planning patient setup and dose escalation incorporation of treatment related information into the DVH to further facilitate advances in reduction of rectal or urinary toxicity is highly appropriate The purpose of the current investigation is to compare C DVH s of the bladder and rectum in those patients who developed late treatment toxicity versus those patients who did not develop such toxicity and using the same groups of patients to determine whether the biological effective DVH BED DVH can potentially serve as a better tool for such toxicity comparisons than the C DVH Methods A generalized theoretical model for determination of biological effective dose has been developed and reported extensively 6 7 8 Recently our group has applied this model for use with any combination of short lived interstitial brachytherapy and external beam radiotherapy for prostate cancer unpublished submitted data 2003 For external beam radiotherapy the generalized BED model reduces to the familiar equation BED n d 1 d 0 693 T Tp 1 where n number of treatments d dose per fraction T treatment time 3 Gy for late effects and Tp potential doubling time and linear component of cell killing were estimated from the published literature 6 7 8 18 19 to be 34 days and 0 3 Gy respectively The first term in Equation 1 accounts for dose fractionation and the second term accounts for repopulation The authors recognize that there is considerable controversy in the exact values used for and Tp for prostate cancer in the reported literature The charts of 190 consecutive patients with T1 or T2 prostate cancer treated with external beam radiotherapy at our institution between 1996 1999 were reviewed During this period external beam radiotherapy was delivered using 6 field technique once daily 5 times a week using 180 cGy or 200 cGy fractions to a final dose of 7000 7200 cGy minimum PTV dose The conformal techniques at our institution have been previously reported 20 the prostate seminal vesicles rectum and bladder were outlined routinely on all patients and uniform guidelines were adhered to in order to minimize inter observer variability in the definition of these structures In particular with regard to the rectum our institution followed routine Radiation Therapy Oncology Group RTOG guidelines for definition from the anus at the level of the ischial tuberosities lower border to the rectosigmoid junction upper border 21 The bladder was contoured from the apex to the dome again as outlined per RTOG guidelines The planning target volume PTV was the prostate seminal vesicles 1 cm margin for the initial phase after 4500 5000 cGy the PTV was the prostate 1 cm margin Corresponding DVH s were computed for the PTV entire rectum i e not the rectal wall or rectal surface and entire bladder again not the bladder wall or bladder surface The dose fractionation and total treatment time for each patient were recorded to obtain values for n d and T in Equation 1 above No charts for those patients treated after 1999 were reviewed to ensure long minimum follow up At each routine follow up the GI and GU complications using definitions and grading as stated by the RTOG 22 were recorded Thus the charts were reviewed to identify those patients with significant RTOG grade 3 or grade 4 late GI large bowel or GU bladder complications Of the 190 patients 6 patients 3 2 were found to have late grade 3 rectal toxicity and 6 patients 3 2 were found to have late grade 3 urinary toxicity No patients were found to have grade 4 GI or GU toxicity A matched pair group of patients 6 GI and 6 GU with grade 0 toxicity having similar pretreatment age stage grade and PSA and treatment technique and dose characteristics were identified from the same patient database The characteristics of the groups are shown in comparison with the groups of patients demonstrating toxicity in Tables 1and 2 The limitations and potential biases inherent to a matched pair comparison are well understood by the authors however as these tables demonstrate there is no difference in the pretreatment and treatment characteristics between the groups demonstrating and not demonstrating GI Table 1 and GU Table 2 toxicity The C DVH s were already constructed prior to undertaking the current investigation for the patients in each of the four groups grade 0 rectal grade 3 rectal grade 0 bladder grade 3 bladder these are the C DVH s that were approved by the attending radiation oncologist prior to delivering the external beam treatment Then these C DVH s derived from each of the individual dose distributions were averaged over the six patients in each of the four groups grade 0 rectal grade 3 rectal grade 0 bladder and grade 3 bladder to produce average C DVH s Using equation 1 the time dose fractionation parameters were incorporated to transform the conventional dose to BED at each conventional dose level This allowed for the construction of the BED DVH s for all of the patients Then in a process similar to that for the C DVH s the BED DVH s derived from each of the individual dose distributions were averaged over the six patients in each of the four groups grade 0 rectal grade 3 rectal grade 0 bladder and grade 3 bladder to produce average BED DVH s The authors are aware of the recent efforts regarding advanced modeling concepts for evaluating the relationship between physical irradiation and biological damage on normal structures in particular BED provides a measure of biological effect at a point at which it is calculated measuring the absolute biological effect over a volume having a non uniform dose distribution formally requires the computation of the equivalent uniform dose EUD 23 However this caveat does not apply directly to the current task because the goal of the current investigation is to use the DVH constructed using either conventional dose or BED as a relative measure of biological response not as an absolute measure and in this context constructing a DVH from BED computations and averaging the DVH s both C DVH s and BED DVH s over a patient population was felt to be an appropriate methodology After construction of the C DVH s and BED DVH s it was clear that the general shape of the two were slightly different as would be expected by the non linear transformation in Equation 1 above In order to perform comparison of the individual matched pairs in an objective reproducible and systematic manner the following measure of normalized difference in the average DVH was computed Equation 2 represents an attempt to compress the DVH difference information into a single quantity and was felt to be a valid quantity as the DVH s did not cross that is the grade 3 DVH s were above and to the right of the grade 0 DVH s at all dose or BED levels Furthermore this approach was felt to be valid biologically as integral dose to critical structures has been correlated by many investigators with late treatment toxicity 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 The authors are also aware of the special problems related to applying the DVH for tubular and surface structures such as the rectum and bladder 28 31 However because C DVH s of the whole organs were used as the basis for the original clinical decision making on the patient population under consideration i e those treated before 1999 it was felt that integral dose to the entire rectum and entire bladder would be appropriate as one measure for clinical comparison of the use of BED DVH s versus C DVH s Equation 2 was applied to compute the AUC s both for the C DVH s and for the BED DVH s for each of the six matched patient pairs in the rectal toxicity category and to each of the six matched patient pairs in the bladder toxicity category In order to perform a statistical comparison between these matched pair AUC s obtained using C DVH s and those obtained using BED DVH s the student s t test was used Although the treatment decisions were made with knowledge of the integral dose delivered to the critical structures the authors recognize that there is controversy with regard to the classification of biological response of the normal structures under study in the current investigation In particular many recent reports e g 32 suggest that the bladder and rectum may be serial rather than parallel structures with regard to their biological response to radiation injury Thus an alternative measure of merit was chosen to complement the AUC analysis above Specifically the percent volume receiving above a set high dose level in this study 60 Gy was analyzed The analogous expression to Equation 2 is the following Equation 3 was applied in exactly the same manner as above to compute V60 s for the C DVH s and BED DVH s for both the bladder and rectum It should be noted that when applying Equation 3 to the BED DVH s the 60 Gy conventional dose transforms using Equation 1 assuming once daily 2 Gy fractions to approximately 100 Gy thus V60 on the C DVH s corresponds to V100 on the BED DVH s The statistical comparison between the matched pair V60 s obtained between C DVH s and BED DVH s was performed using the student s t test Results As expected the DVH s both C DVH s and BED DVH s were predictive of rectal and urinary toxicity that is those that developed late GI or GU toxicity had DVH s that demonstrated more integral dose to the rectum or bladder than those patients who did not develop such toxicity This reinforces and validates the well known and widespread use of DVH s in evaluating external beam 5 24 25 26 27 28 29 and interstitial 33 treatment plans for prostate cancer patients Figure 1shows the comparison for the case of the conventional DVH s of the rectum In this figure the average C DVH of the rectum was computed for the 6 patients in the grade 3 group as well as the 6 patients in the grade 0 group The average DVH s are displayed as is demonstrated the grade 3 curve is to the right of and above the grade 0 curve Similar analyses were done for the BED DVH Rectum as demonstrated in Figure 2 for the C DVH Bladder as demonstrated in Figure 3 and for the BED DVH Bladder as demonstrated in Figure 4 It should be noted that in all cases the average grade 3 DVH s conventional or BED were consistently above and to the right of the corresponding grade 0 curve at each dose or BED level from zero to maximum again validating the uniform comparison approach summarized in Equations 2 and 3 Table 3shows the results of the detailed matched pair AUC analysis In this table the AUC s obtained using the C DVH s and BED DVH s for each of the matched patient pairs is displayed The students t test was used to obtain a p value for each of the rectal toxicity and bladder toxicity categories As Table 3displays the AUC analysis demonstrates a p value of 0 036 for the rectal toxicity comparison and a p value of 0 065 for the bladder toxicity comparison suggesting that when using AUC as the measure of merit the BED DVH s were significantly better correlated than the corresponding C DVH s with rectal toxicity and marginally better correlated with bladder toxicity Table 4displays the results of the matched pair V60 analysis In this table the V60 s obtained using the C DVH s and BED DVH s for each of the matched patient pairs is displayed This table demonstrates a p value of 0 021 for the rectal toxicity comparison and a p value of 0 021 for the bladder toxicity comparison suggesting that when using V60 as the measure of merit the BED DVH s were significantly better correlated than the corresponding C DVH s with rectal toxicity and with bladder toxicity Conclusions The values for AUC and V60 are higher for the BED DVH s of the rectum and bladder than for the counterpart C DVH s Because the AUC and V60 are dosimetric endpoints used routinely for the evaluation of radiation treatment plans this analysis suggests that BED DVH s for the rectum and bladder correlate better with late toxicity than C DVH s and should be considered when attempting to minimize late GI and GU toxicity after radiotherapy for prostate cancer Because this analysis was performed with two independent measures of merit of the DVH s the AUC and the V60 the early results reported herein appear promising for the use of BED DVH s Because the patient population having late grade 3 4 toxicity which is a small population but was chosen as the target population that is most likely to benefit from the incorporation of BED DVH s into the process of treatment planning was the focus of this initial investigation the number of patients in the current study is understandably small Six cases of late grade 3 4 GI toxicity represent approximately 3 of the study population this low incidence also applies to the six cases of late grade 3 4 GU toxicity Assuming that the same low rate of late toxicity is maintained the number of cases of such late complications will not increase significantly with a significant increase in size of the study population Thus while the results are encouraging for the correlation of BED DVH s to rectal toxicity the correlation to bladder toxicity using the integral dose AUC endpoint did not reach statistical significance likely due to the limitations in sample size However because the integral dose AUC analysis did reach significance for the rectum and because the V60 analysis did reach statistical significance for both the bladder and rectum the results of the current investigation represent initial success with the application of the BED DVH concept As one means of avoiding the statistical problems posed by evaluating late toxicity analyzing early grade 3 4 toxicity which has a higher incidence may allow for greater statistical power in validating the BED DVH concept However because the modeling for the Tp alpha and alpha beta is altogether different for early vs late structures and because the transformation between late to early parameters in Equations 1 2 above are nonlinear the results of the current analysis and corresponding conclusions may be completely different from such an early toxicity analysis For these reasons the use of BED DVH s for evaluating and predicting early GI and GU toxicity will be the subject of a separate communication The results of the current investigation are encouraging the well known conventional DVH can be successfully expanded to include treatment delivery tissue biology and time fractionation related information that better represents the true effect of the treatment on critical structures Other investigators have expanded the C DVH to include functional and spatial information 4 34 35 but the current investigation is the first report correlating a DVH which has been expanded to include BED parameters with late treatment toxicity for prostate cancer irradiation Although the initial focus of this investigation was the study of late radiation effects on the rectum and bladder there is no conceptual limitation to the use of the techniques described herein to study early effects of treatment for acute toxicity assessment or to study target structures for outcome survival analysis at any anatomic site The results of the current investigation while encouraging are preliminary and require validation by other investigators because of the low incidence of late grade 3 4 complications such an analysis might be better undertaken at a multi institutional level Competing interests None Declared Authors contributions ABJ designed and coordinated the investigation and drafted the manuscript CMH CAP and JCR
