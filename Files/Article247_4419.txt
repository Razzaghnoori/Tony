 Ballot Box to Bush Release the Codes Whenever someone complains about George W Bush s opting out of the voluntary federal spending limits in order to raise the unprecedented sum of 67 million and counting for the primaries Bush and his supporters have an answer ready Actually they have two answers The first is that thanks to the antiquated contribution limit of 1 000 even the maximum donation is a minute drop in the bucket something on the order of 0015 percent of the total collected Their other answer is that the campaign goes well beyond what the law requires by making prompt and complete disclosure of all contributions on its Web site A story by Michael Isikoff in Newsweek gives the lie to both these defenses Isikoff discovered that the Bush campaign has devised a system for keeping track of how much various special interests are collecting for the candidate These amounts are far in excess of 1 000 And they aren t publicly disclosed at all In his own way Bush stands to advance the cause of legal corruption as much as the groundbreaking work of the 1996 Clinton Gore campaign did The Bush campaign s technical innovation is the use of tracking codes to monitor how much money is coming from its big fund raisers Though the euphemism sounds as harmless as a Fedex delivery this practice allows the campaign to stay fully informed about who is giving what It also appears to stir a sense of competition if not competitive panic among Bush s major contributors and fund raisers Here s a link to a Bush fund raising letter obtained by Newsweek that shows how the system works In it Tom Kuhn who runs a utility trade association called the Edison Electric Institute tells recipients of his solicitation to make sure to incorporate the 1178 tracking number in your fundraising efforts according to the instructions of Bush s top fund raisers Don Evans and Jack Oliver Doing so Kuhn notes does ensure that our industry is credited and that your progress is listed among the other business industry sectors Pause to consider what is happening here A trade association that would be allowed to contribute a maximum of only 5 000 through its PAC not to mention corporations that aren t legally allowed to contribute at all are performing an end run around federal campaign finance law by bundling a large number of contributions from individual executives Of course bundling is nothing new What is new is the Bush s campaign s handy dandy system for sorting out the bundles so it knows just how much it has gotten from the electric industry compared with how much it has gotten from lots of other business industry sectors trade associations and corporations Coming soon White House officials able to locate your precise up to the minute contribution record using a handheld wireless device But more important communicating the secret pass code ensures that contributors in the electric industry know that the Bush campaign knows how much they ve given The only people who don t know who is really giving how much are the rest of us The Bush donor database is searchable by individual name but not by employer or tracking code The Bush team s answer to this complaint is that the tracking codes aren t a way of keeping score or encouraging competition among donors but rather a benign device for making sure that contributors are not stepping on each other s toes according to Bush spokesman Scott McClellan McClellan gives the example of three of Bush s business school classmates who are raising money By using a tracking code the three can avoid bothering classmates who have already given the maximum legal amount Though McClellan tried patiently to explain it to me I can t for the life of me understand how tracking codes help with the problem of repeat solicitations Presumably the three classmates split up the list of Bush s business school class and asked everyone for a check If one of Bush s b school classmates had already given 1 000 in his capacity as say an electric utility executive his contribution would have been counted under 1178 as part of Tom Kuhn s tally This notional donor might also want his gift counted as a classmate contribution But I don t know how his business school classmates would find out from having a code of their own that he had already given at the office Of course they could find out by searching for his name on the Bush database But you don t need any codes for that If the codes really are an innocent bookkeeping exercise there s any easy way for the Bush campaign to dispel suspicion They can do what Slate asked them to do yesterday Release the codes
