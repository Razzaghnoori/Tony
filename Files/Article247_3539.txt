 Homeless Couple Gets Help The FBI videotape s revelation that incendiary tear gas canisters were used at Waco with the knowledge of at least two of its agents there and the political fallout this is generating leads at USA Today the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post The New York Times fronts a story about tension between Janet Reno and Louis Freeh ditto the WP but leads instead with an evergreen the failure of an American diplomatic mission led by Madeleine Albright to produce a peace accord between the Palestinians and Israel a story that is fronted at the LAT and WP The sticking point du jour is how many Palestinians in Israeli jails should be released Israel is willing to spring 350 but the Palestinians want another 50 the Israelis are saying no to USAT s lead mainly dwells on the imminent outside investigation of Waco saying that its honcho could be named as early as today and that candidates include two Republican ex senators The WP has this as well But the Post and especially the LAT focus instead on wringing significance from the videotape released yesterday by the DOJ The WP says it shows a hurried and seemingly casual decision arrived at by the then head of the FBI s hostage rescue team Richard Rogers in a discussion with a subordinate to allow one of the team members to use incendiary military tear gas cartridges against an underground shelter near the main compound building The Post notes that in a subsequent FBI account of the Waco assault Rogers made no mention of the incendiary rounds The LAT adds that when in an appearance before Congress then FBI director William Sessions testified that his agents did not use any flammable munitions at Waco Rogers was sitting behind him The Post adds that in court documents FBI officials stated that no videotape existed covering the phase of the operation when it turns out Rogers directive was issued Rogers the LAT reminds was later removed from his hostage team job because of his role at the Ruby Ridge Idaho standoff the year before Waco in which an unarmed woman was killed by a sniper under Rogers command The LAT raises another interesting point Did senior DOJ and FBI officials in the Washington command center listening to sporadic radio communications from Waco hear the conversation on the videotape The paper quotes Carl Stern then Reno s press spokesman who was at the command center that day as saying that he does not recall hearing it There is much discussion in the stories about how these revelations have hurt the credibility of federal law enforcement But somebody else s credibility takes a hit too the media s It s a little hard to believe that if dozens and dozens of children of a fringe left group had died in similar circumstances the mainstream media would have left the story to a documentary filmmaker A WP front pager reports that George W Bush vowed yesterday that if elected president he would strip federal funding from failing public schools and give the money to parents for tutors or to help them transfer their kids to other schools including private ones The NYT and LAT run the story inside The coverage notes that Bush never used the word voucher The Wall Street Journal reports a new finding in the unraveling Russian funds scandal hundreds of corporate and individual bank accounts at dozens of banks around the world are now suspected of receiving parts of the estimated 10 billion that is missing On some days some of these accounts says the paper received transfers of more than 100 million The NYT goes top front with word that President Clinton and Hillary Clinton have signed a contract to buy a 1 7 million 11 room colonial home in Chappaqua New York They will close in November The Times runs the item under a nice headline WITH SOME HELP CLINTONS PURCHASE A WHITE HOUSE The help refers to the 1 35 million in collateral President Clinton s chief fund raiser Terry McAuliffe put up to secure the house loan The paper quotes one source as saying that since the Clintons have assets of just over 1 million but legal debts of 5 2 million banks were a little bit wary about providing such a large mortgage without some extra security The WP reports that the angel was supposed to be former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles who bowed out at the last minute to the consternation of the Clintons Isn t it a little surprising that the papers don t mention the similarity to the way Richard Nixon got his house with a little help from his rich friends The NYT reports that until yesterday afternoon Ebay was offering for bidding a fully functional human kidney The opening bid was 25 000 and the last bid was 5 750 100 before the company ended the auction no doubt because trafficking in organs is a felony The WP reports that AOL having reprogrammed its computers to allow much longer screen names has also taken the step of preventing subscribers from using as their log ons any of the celebrity names that are now for the first time technically available So the paper explains no Billclinton aol com unless you re Him Today s Papers is reminded of something it just learned about the NYT online The paper requires readers to register with a screen name but doesn t require real names One potential reader suggested he d like the screen name IhatetheNYtimes No the Electric Lady told him that one s already taken Would you like IhatetheNYtimes3
