 do you have a favorite type of music you listen to um most frequently i listen to contemporary Christian music but i like all forms okay i uh we i listen to country and rock and classical jazz is probably my least favorite although i enjoy it too uh huh i tend to favor uh rock and roll mostly from the sixties and seventies oh yeah some great sixties tunes yeah i listen to KGPS classic rock KGPS in Dallas right oh are you in Dallas uh yeah i m in Plano uh well probably around the corner um yeah that s a good station i listen to it every once in a while too uh huh do you play any instruments no i don t never have i m not musically gifted at all well i took piano lessons in fourth grade once for one semester i ll never forget Mrs Burkhalter Miss Burkhalter she had that Nazi mentality where uh uh where d you grow up uh in Milwaukee oh okay uh huh the uh yeah the only thing how to play on the piano is that two handed thing or the two person thing chopsticks no it s not chopsticks it s the other one that has the um oh i don t even i don t i don t know enough about music to do it but you the bottom person uses two hands and the top person just uses one hand and it s this little melody i it may have been a girl thing okay well i have no idea what that is i just know i hated it but i took up trumpet after that and ended up playing in the University of Wisconsin marching band oh really which was fun yeah i went to i went to uh Rice and we had the marching owl band which is quite a it s not known for its musical abilities more so its um comedy abilities it uh uh huh oh we had a great time in the band my uh director was heavy into the big bands so we played a lot of tunes by uh Glen Miller and Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey and people like that oh yeah well that that was fun so it was a lot of fun plus i got to get to go to all the athletic events free yeah that has its plusses for sure well which uh sixties uh rock bands do you like the best oh well the Beatles uh huh Creedance Clearwater Revival uh Crosby Stills Nash and Young when it was still all four right um there uh Black Sabbath did a few albums that i really like is that right yeah they i know it s kind of strange um Elton John is more seventies um yeah certainly but uh Yellow Brick Road right uh huh i love that album yeah i think i ve got all those yeah i had Yellow Brick Road and something happened to it it escaped me and it was sometime in college and never have seen it again um oh i started my uh music collection in college when i started winning radio contests how d you win radio contests well they would uh tell you to call in and be caller number nine and win so i had a touch tone telephone in college and uh i just started calling in and winning all kinds of contests i had forty record albums before i even had a stereo to play them on to play them on that s great i ended up winning about uh two hundred and thirty radio contests in two school years so i accumulated my record collection mostly from that that s incredible i ve never won not one thing from a radio station i haven t tried i probably haven t tried two hundred and thirty times it was yeah well that was in Madison i i won about four times a week it doesn t have near the population that Dallas has the contests here are a lot more competitive yeah have you ever won in Dallas um yeah but not the same type of contests um oh they have contests on the radio in the morning and i think i won one of the movie mystery contests one time um they sent me a small flag in the mail that which which had postage due you re kidding me no it was a oh it s not it s probably not quite the same it wasn t much of a victory actually i did win tickets to the to a Chicago and a Beach Boys concert i saw them i went to a Beach Boys concert i like them too uh huh um i ve never been to a Chicago concert bet it was great uh yeah they were uh they were very good i was impressed yeah Chicago was great too every now and then i ll go ahead and make another tape and uh record a bunch of uh old tunes like the Loving Spoonful and Grateful Dead something from the Birds Rolling Stones uh huh yeah i enjoy listening to those old tunes they don t play a lot of that stuff on the radio any more you have to pick the right station yeah i use my scan button a lot uh huh whole lot i enjoy mainly the old the older rock and roll tunes rather than a lot of the new stuff the lyrics are so repetitive yeah i that i just kind of get lost in it i uh yeah i haven t made any kind of effort to keep up on recent music especially in rock and roll there s not just too much uh new stuff that s well it s not as creative it doesn t seem to be and the lyrics aren t as uh inspiring if you want to call it that yeah yeah some of the tunes used to you know you felt like you needed to go out and do something about it yeah lot of pop music out that just isn t very thrilling yeah course the head bangers i stay away from those entirely is there still that type of music available certainly is just turn on MTV any night oh no i ve got small children i don t trust MTV they ll be playing the latest of Bon Jovi or White Snake or groups like that yeah yeah yeah i uh i tried when um i guess i was in junior high high school when uh Led Zeppelin was real big and everybody i tried to you know really go the whole way and i couldn t go with even with most of Led Zeppelin s music i didn t enjoy it yeah and some of the stuff you know the classics they were fine but some of it was just too heavy even then i always like the easier listening rock the the Crosby Stills Nash and Young Eagles uh in more recent Billy Joel very talented uh huh yeah yeah Z Z Top is different very creative they they really uh made uh quite a transition they used to be almost a country band uh huh uh playing such yeah they play they play some they get some play time on the country stations even yeah such classics as La Grange and Touche yeah and i ve still got my Fandango album that one didn t get lost in college right but uh they they really did change yeah all of a sudden they became a top forty type group appealing to the younger crowd yeah yeah they ve got they ve now they ve got some good videos uh very good videos yeah i m kind of impressed quite creative and appealing to the younger crowd yeah yeah to the pop audience i guess you d call it that yeah the Robert Palmer s got some creative pretty creative videos videos out too i i was thinking that yeah he s his his videos are pretty wild i like his music too oh yeah and there are some that are that get artsy to a point like Steve Winwood uh huh yeah now see i know a little bit i know a little bit about other groups i uh like i said i listen to primarily contemporary Christian uh huh and uh but i spend enough time on scan that i hear what it what is still on the radio well i don t know well who s uh who s who s popular now with the uh contemporary Christian music oh probably Amy Grant is the biggest one yeah she s even she s got a song right now that playing on a few of the other stations it s called Baby Baby it s i don t listen too much right yeah i ve heard of her uh huh uh huh it s neat when you think about how she wrote it and stuff otherwise the lyrics are kind of yeah you know it s just like oh i love you and i you know this that and the other but she write she wrote when she was talking to her baby and if you ve got a baby i mean it s kind of neat thinking about it talking up to your baby and to to an infant right that s interesting so it it makes it neater but well i don t think i d ever make a song writer my secretary has tried to be a song writer she s waiting for her big time yeah well some people get lucky and i guess if you re persistent enough sometimes it works out yeah yeah well yeah i hope that it does for her she deserves it she s a nice person uh huh so i uh well what station plays uh that type of music uh ninety four point one is KLTY okay all right and uh then there s ninety point one is KCBI they do more uh they spend a lot of time with uh oh this preaching kind of stuff right uh huh so i like music i like listening to music so i don t usually listen to KCBI and then there s another one called Journey that s somewhere in between the two of those it s in between ninety and ninety four right i think it s ninety two maybe i ll tune in to one of those some time ninety four point one is fun all right i mean it s it s it s mainly um just family oriented stuff i mean yeah it s very its definitely Christian but it s not it s not hymns right okay you know it s not Amazing Grace every other time okay yeah i still feel like every time if i ever feel like reminiscing over the old stuff i ll go ahead and throw on a sixties tape yeah get something from from the Guess Who or
