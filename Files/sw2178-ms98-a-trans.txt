 okay all right last thing i saw was um i think uh Sleeping With the Enemy with Julia Roberts oh i hadn t seen that but i ve heard that it s real good my husband didn t like it that much i thought it was okay it was a little strange you know this woman supposedly is um being mentally abused by her husband you know he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house and she figures out this way to um to leave him secretly you know she fakes her death kind of thing and he tracks her down uh huh oh so the the end scenes are are kind of suspenseful you know when she realizes he s in the house you know after her but uh kind of had the feeling along that uh why didn t she just tell him to straighten up you know why didn t she just tell him hey look bucko you don t get away with this nonsense yeah oh but anyhow um what have you seen well last week as a matter of fact my children was on spring break and we went to two movies we went to see Awakenings uh huh um with Robin Williams and we went to see Kindergarten Cop uh huh yeah and i really liked both of them i really did Awakening was it was kind of sad to me it really was and it would it would be to anyone because you know they really don t know that much about it uh huh so this is where the people have been kind of well i don t a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma for a long time and the drugs let them come back yeah yeah yeah uh huh but the drugs didn t work for long and they started having real bad side effects oh and this is about nineteen sixty four i believe or something like that and there still hasn t been any you know new development in prescribed drugs that can help it um but yeah there you know it it was a big breakthrough but in time you know the all the side effects started showing well how bad were the side effects bad oh yeah yeah they was actually went back like they were you know oh um yeah all it was they wasn t mild you know they was just bad side effects um but i really enjoyed it though um you know well how about Kindergarten Cop oh yeah that s strictly for entertainment that was just it was you know Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting to be uh a bit of a variety actor you know at first he was just a big muscle man but he s kind of branching out yeah he sure is he is as a matter of fact um Sylvester Stallone is that his name Sylvester Stallone is that his name i really believe Schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety variety player more so than he is because he really played the part good uh huh you know he could be this rough tough guy and then you know this substitute teacher um it was really good well there was a movie out it s been on cable i get cable and there s this thing with uh Danny De Vito called Twins oh i ve seen that yes i thought that was just great it is it is isn t it yes yes i even like some i mean some of the original stuff like i like The Terminator at first you know it was kind of strange but i still like watching him in The Terminator and and some of the other things um yeah uh huh Total Recall last year i thought was really good last summer oh yeah yeah guess it didn t last too long at the box office but i thought it was pretty good yeah i did too i really did and it was i enjoy a lot of movies now as far as let s say heavy violence i can t handle um i m not into that you know i just like Rambo and all that um i that s just something i just don t want to watch yeah yeah and i i have some one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks oh and i just keep telling her how can you do that and i told her when she had her her little girl i said now you better get out of the habit of watching those you shouldn t be watching them with your little girl and she says her little girl s into it now oh my goodness and she watches she watches these really gross things you know like The Nightmare on Elm Street and the you know that kind of junk i don t go for that at all yes oh uh huh yeah oh i guess i m a little too scary for that i remember when i was real little i we all went to some kind of scary movie and it was like this house big house had a basement and there was all these weird things going on in the basement you know and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years oh uh huh you know and i got a lot of really weird ideas from that goofy movie yes yes yes you know they tell you that kids can you know be impressed by all that stuff and it s true i i had a lot of things that i i nobody told me that it was all fake i was just sitting there watching it going oh jeez it is it really is yes watching yeah watching yes oh i don t want to go home yes yes oh goodness but i think a lot of kids it s funny get the same kind of fears like there s somebody under the bed yes oh where do we get that from yes i know uh i have two children i really try to watch what they watch i really do because my youngest one he watches something you might as well just plan on staying up all night because you know he ll come in mama i think the ghost is in the house mama i hear it um don t you how old are they they re eight and ten so they re you know they hadn t really distinguished it s just a movie you know i try to say it s just a movie but no mama i ve seen it oh but i remember i was with a friend of mine had uh three kids and the little boy must have been oh maybe about ten and we rented Charlotte s Web okay oh uh huh and he just bawled at the end and just uh she s not going to die and we were trying to say Kenny it s okay and he didn t want to listen to it oh oh oh he just was beside himself you know this is supposed to be a nice children s movie Charlotte s Web he just couldn t stand it that Charlotte was going to die at the end die oh oh it s funny how your little minds work isn t it oh oh yeah she s so nice she can t die oh it was just oh oh i guess that s why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars people like us you know oh oh goodness well well i ve enjoyed talking to you you too and maybe we ll run across each other again yeah this is kind of neat i haven t ever initiated a call i ve just been called you know by the switchboard and uh well the first week i think a lot more people were doing it but i normally get a call like every other day do you well as far as we could not call in last week um you know from where i m at uh huh we couldn t call in they said it would be up Friday the March the fifteenth before it was prepared so i missed several days because i was getting quite a few calls um how weird i don t know and they they do have a variety of topics my first one was the toughest it was something like discuss pollution oh uh huh oh it was discuss air pollution causes of it and cures i was going oh well yes oh oh well my husband sometimes you know he ll receive a call and he s at work uh huh and if i you know if i know the topic i ll go ahead and accept it as mine but the other day i got one about fishing and i thought oh my i don t know a thing about fishing so i m not even going to try because when they listened to that tape they would have really had a good time believe me say well i know it takes a fishing pole and some bait and some water but i m really not for sure though if well i ll let you go and we ll talk to you later okay bye bye alrighty bye bye
