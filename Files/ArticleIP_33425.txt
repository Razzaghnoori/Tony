 The Life Issue Take 2 A month ago Frame Game that Steve Forbes had begun to delete the word abortion from his comments about abortion substituting the phrase the life issue By talking about the life issue Forbes signals to pro lifers that he s one of them while concealing from pro choicers that he s no longer one of them Here s what Forbes said about abortion in his speech at the Iowa straw poll last weekend Now the issue of life is one of the most emotional and heartfelt in America Like you I am pro life and believe in the life amendment But many in America don t share our goal but that doesn t mean we put our principles aside The highest form of statesmanship is to find ways to bring people towards our goal And I believe that if we move forward with persistence patience engaging in a dialogue we can change the hearts and minds of the American people And I believe that if we do persist the time will come I have faith that the time will come when once again life will be held sacred in our hearts in our homes in our Congress in our courts and yes in our Constitution And here s what Forbes said about candidates who fudge their positions If a candidate won t tell you where he stands that means he either doesn t know where he stands or he doesn t want you to know where he stands and either one is not good for you or the American people So let s try again Where do you stand on abortion Mr Forbes
