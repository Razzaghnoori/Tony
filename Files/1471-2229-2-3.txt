 Background Vacuolar type H ATPases are enzymes responsible for the energization of membranes and the acidification of compartments within the eukaryotic cell via the establishment of proton and electrochemical gradients at the expense of ATP The vacuolar type H ATPase in plants is a large multimeric enzyme complex whose function is to pump protons across a membrane via primary active transport Vacuolar type ATPases are homologs of the F type ATP synthases and probably convert the free energy of hydrolysis of the high energy phosphate bond into rotational motion 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 Vacuolar type H ATPases are critical for the maintenance of homeostasis in eukaryotic cells 10 11 In plant cells V ATPases are responsible for the deacidification of the cytosol and the energization of secondary transport processes across the tonoplast as well as in the endocytotic and secretory pathways 12 In addition the vacuolar type ATPase is thought to be primarily responsible for the acidification and expansion of the large central vacuole 12 13 14 15 In plants a critical event in growth and development is the maturation and expansion of the central vacuole Upon maturation the vacuolar contents can comprise more than eighty percent of the total cell volume 16 Primarily filled with water the vacuole also is a repository for a wide variety of solutes fulfilling numerous important metabolic functions The influx of water and metabolites into the vacuole is dependent in part on the generation of a proton motive force across the tonoplast Vacuolar type H ATPases are large multimeric enzyme complexes of 500 750 kDa consisting of 15 or more different proteins Structurally they can be divided into integral V 0 and peripheral V 1 membrane sectors 17 The peripheral membrane sector is located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is composed of at least five different subunits including the catalytic subunit subunit A The V 1 peripheral sector is further divided into a head group and stalk region The V 0 integral sector is embedded in the membrane and consists of at least 4 different subunits Subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase is the catalytic subunit The subunit A protein is approximately 70 kDa in most organisms studied and is a hydrophilic peptide located in the head group of the V 1 peripheral sector in three copies per holoenzyme 18 This subunit contains a nucleotide binding motif and functions to bind and hydrolyze ATP 19 In addition subunit A contains a highly conserved cysteine residue located within the enzymes catalytic center that may be involved in regulation of the holoenzyme 20 21 22 23 Cloning sequencing and characteristics of subunit A of the V Type ATPase from Arabidopsis thaliana have been previously reported 24 Small multigene families of V ATPase subunit A are known to exist in flowering plants and algae The catalytic subunit exists as two distinct genes with highly conserved exons and intron boundaries in twelve species of plants 25 In the flowering plant Daucus carota carrot evidence exists for two distinct isoforms for the catalytic subunit one of which is tonoplast specific while the other is localized to the Golgi 26 In addition two distinct mRNAs have been isolated from cotton Gossypium hirsutum 27 Two subunit A mRNAs are expressed in the unicellular alga Acetabularia acetabulum 28 29 Isoforms of other V ATPase subunits are also known from plants including subunit B 27 30 32 the proteolipid subunit 33 34 35 36 37 and subunits D and E 38 What is lacking in our knowledge of vacuolar type ATPases is a sense of what purpose these multigene family proteins may serve in the cellular milieu and how they participate in the growth development and metabolism of higher plants It has been proposed that multigene families might be encoding functionally distinct isoforms of V ATPase subunits These isoforms may be required to provide unique functions or regulatory constraints within the varied micro compartments requiring V ATPases 26 27 34 39 43 In addition different isoforms may be responsible for targeting to varied subcellular compartments 10 26 28 36 41 44 47 Furthermore it is possible that gene family members may behave in a differential manner with respect to environmental stress 36 Three enzymes are primarily responsible for the maintenance of proton flux across the tonoplast in plants the vacuolar H ATPase the H pumping pyrophosphatase 48 and the Na H antiporter 49 50 All three enzymes have been implicated in allowing plants to cope with environmental stress conditions Several studies have been conducted in an attempt to evaluate the role vacuolar type ATPases play in allowing plants to cope with environmental stress These endeavors have primarily concentrated on salt and cold stress Cold tolerant Brassica napus a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana demonstrated an increase in both subunit A mRNA and protein in response to chilling at 2 C 50 This chilling also resulted in a concomitant increase in cell sap osmotic pressure and endogenous ABA accumulation These researchers indicated that Arabidopsis also was a cold tolerant plant which exhibited a similar response with respect to V ATPase subunit A mRNA however they provided no data In rice Oryza sativa chilling plants at 10 C resulted in a two fold increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity evaluated by in vitro assay of isolated membranes 51 This study did not analyze changes in protein level in the isolated membranes in response to chilling Cold sensitive mung bean seedlings Vigna radiata subjected to chilling at 4 C for 48 hours contrastingly showed no increase in vacuolar type ATPase activity in isolated membranes 52 In addition these researchers found no change in the amount of V ATPase protein levels in response to chilling The facultative CAM plant Mesembryanthemum crystallinum displays a differential organ level response to salt stress while still engaged in C 3 photosynthesis 53 Subjecting plants to 400 mM NaCl resulted in an approximately two fold increase in the transcript levels of subunits A B and the proteolipid in roots prior to the shift to Crassulacean acid metabolism Fully expanded leaves exhibited an increase only for the proteolipid mRNA an increase of approximately three fold over non salt stressed plants 54 Cell suspension cultures when subjected to salt stress exhibited increase in activity of both P Type and V Type ATPases without concomitant increase in protein levels 55 Transcript levels of subunit E of the V ATPase in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum were recently shown to increase in leaves but not roots of salt stressed plants with a concomitant increase in protein levels in leaves 56 On the other hand subunit E in Hordeum vulgare showed no effect on mRNA level in response to salt stress 57 The effects of salt stress on V ATPases has also been investigated in tobacco Nicotiana tabacum suspension cells Subjecting NaCl adapted cells to salt stress resulted in an approximately four fold increase in both proton transport and ATP hydrolysis on isolated membranes compared to unadapted cells 58 Remarkably this increase in overall V ATPase activity coincided with an apparent reduction in the amount of enzyme on the tonoplast This apparently contradictory finding may be the result of physical changes in the enzyme itself or changes in the lipid environment 58 Especially confounding is the finding that mRNA levels for subunit A increase two to four fold in response to the same levels of salt stress in tobacco suspension cells 59 Experiments with tomato Lycopersicon esculentum showed similar results with respect to induction of mRNA for subunit A with an approximately two to four fold increase seen with respect to salt stress 60 Recent work in the resurrection plant Tortula ruralis indicated that transcript levels of the proteolipid subunit c increased in response to salt stress but that there was no corresponding increase in protein levels 61 The limited work done to evaluate the role of V ATPases in drought stress has provided conflicting results Drought stress in winter Brassica napus resulted in a very similar response as cold stress that is a dramatic increase in subunit A mRNA 50 However drought stress in Lycopersicon esculentum resulted in no apparent increase in mRNA levels for subunit A 60 None of the previously mentioned efforts into evaluating the role of vacuolar type ATPases in environmental stress acclimation take into account the fact that subunits A B and the proteolipid are most certainly present as small gene families in the plants studied Furthermore it is possible that these gene family members may behave in a differential manner with respect to stress The only work published previously on V ATPase subunit isoforms and stress is concerned with the proteolipid gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana Three proteolipid genes were evaluated for their response to salt stress as well as etiolation 36 All three genes exhibited an approximately two fold increase in mRNA levels in response to salt stress 50 mM However with respect to etiolation two isoforms showed no response while the third demonstrated an increase in mRNA levels A number of genes in plants have been found to contain multiple poly A attachment sites yielding different transcripts from a single gene Several examples have recently emerged where differentially polyadenylated genes have transcripts that are post transcriptionally regulated based on sugar sensing In rice Oryza sativa two transcripts generated off an amylase gene exhibit differential stability based on sucrose availability 65 A cell wall invertase gene Incw 1 in Maize Zea mays is expressed as two transcripts differing in 3 ends The two transcripts are differentially expressed in response to sugars 66 In this study we explore the possibility that differentially polyadenylated transcripts of the V ATPase subunit A encoding gene show different responses with respect to etiolation salt or chilling stress Results and discussion A vacuolar type H ATPase subunit A cDNA has been previously identified and sequenced GenBank accession number U65638 24 The cDNA was identified as subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase via identity with other previously sequenced subunit A genes from other organisms The primary nucleotide and amino acid sequence of the A thaliana subunit A cDNA showed a high degree of identity with subunit A cDNA sequenced from other organisms This cDNA encoded a putative open reading frame consistent with that of other subunit A genes and was shown to have all the motifs common to subunit A 67 This high degree of conservation was evident across taxa as diverse as animals plants fungi and protozoa 68 Genome blot analysis was utilized to determine the number of genes in the A thaliana genome corresponding to subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase Genomic DNA was isolated as described subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and immobilized on a positively charged nylon membrane Ten single restriction enzyme digestions were performed Hybridization was conducted at moderate stringency with a 300 base pair homologous A thaliana cDNA probe corresponding to subunit A of the vacuolar type ATPase Results indicated hybridization to only a single band for nine out of the ten enzymes Fig 1 The Hae III digest showed faint hybridization to a second band that was later shown to be the result of a Hae III site located in the region of the probe results not shown All evidences acquired to date failed to indicate the presence of a second V ATPase subunit A gene in A thaliana Whole genome blot analysis detected a single gene in the A thaliana genome Extensive screening of a cDNA library derived from all organs and multiple developmental stages of the plant revealed only a single subunit A cDNA A polymerase chain reaction based screen failed to detect an intron length polymorphism results not shown between two subunit A genes found to be present in other plants 25 Lastly extensive database searches of GenBank the Arabidopsis EST database and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative TAIR http www arabidopsis org report only a single subunit A gene in the current version of the Arabidopsis genome chromosome 1 BAC F9K20 This situation of a single subunit A gene appears to be unusual in plants Admittedly only a small subset of plants has been examined in detail Of the species examined to date three have only a single subunit A gene detected the alga Coleochaete scutata sugar beet Beta vulgarise 63 64 and A thaliana 25 Flowering plants shown to have at least two subunit A genes include oat Avena sativa carrot Daucus carota tobacco Nicotiana tabacum tomato Lycopersicon esculentum cotton Gossypium hirsutum magnolia Magnolia virginana Hydrastis canadensis Chenopodium rubrum and clematis Clematis liguisticfolio In addition the unicellular alga Acetabularia acetabulum has two V ATPase subunit A genes RNA blot analysis was performed to determine the organ level expression pattern of the subunit A gene Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes critical for the maintenance of homeostasis Therefore it is expected that all living plant cells require V ATPase function Since A thaliana seemed to possess only a single gene for subunit A of the V ATPase it was expected that this gene should be expressed in all organs tested Whole RNA was harvested from leaves bolts siliques flowers axenically grown seedlings and axenically grown roots RNA was denatured with glyoxal fractionated via agarose gel electrophoresis and immobilized on a positively charged nylon membrane Hybridization was conducted at high stringency with a 1700 base pair homologous cDNA probe labeled with digoxigenin In agreement with our expectations results indicated high levels of expression in all organs tested Fig 2 with slightly higher levels of subunit A mRNA present in seedlings This is most likely due to the fact that seedlings are the most rapidly growing and metabolizing stage of the plant tested Seedlings are undergoing dramatic and rapid vacuole biogenesis to allow for rapid growth at this stage of development and therefore would be expected to require a higher level of subunit A expression than other more terminally differentiated organs Roots leaves bolts and flowers showed approximately equivalent amounts of signal with somewhat lower levels in siliques Most eukaryotic mRNAs are characterized by the presence of a poly A tail a series of adenine residues post transcriptionally attached to the 3 untranslated region The primary function of the poly A tail is thought to be in message stability assisted by a series of poly A binding proteins 69 In addition the poly A tail in conjunction with the 5 cap may be required for efficient translation of plant mRNAs 70 Subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase in A thaliana was shown to exhibit multi site polyadenylation Sequencing the 3 ends of seven independent clones isolated from the PRL 2 cDNA library and one EST obtained through the Arabidopsis EST database revealed four different length transcripts produced from the single subunit A gene based on different poly A tail attachment sites Fig 3 Multiple polyadenylation sites are fairly common in plant mRNAs but this phenomenon is rare in animal genes 71 72 Since the A thaliana V ATPase subunit A gene produced at least four different transcripts all producing the same protein and is one of two flowering plants observed to date not to have a multigene family for this subunit experiments were designed to determine if muiti site polyadenylation might be a mechanism for gene regulation in plants V ATPase proteolipid isoforms were shown to exhibit differential transcript expression levels in response to environmental stresses 36 This fact implies a possible role for these isoforms in allowing the plant to deal with stress Experiments were designed to determine if in A thaliana differentially polyadenylated transcripts could be regulated in response to stress First it was critical to confirm that subunit A transcript levels were at all responsive to environmental stress conditions Three environmental stresses were chosen including 100 mM NaCl etiolation for four days and chilling at 6 degrees for four days In all three situations axenic seven day old seedlings grown on agar were evaluated Seven day old seedlings were chosen for their short growth time limited space requirements and ease in culturing In addition the facts that they are rapidly growing and metabolizing were shown to produce ample quantities of subunit A transcript and possess several organs including roots hypocotyls and cotyledons made them an attractive choice for analysis Whole RNA blot analysis was used first to evaluate the overall response of subunit A to stress conditions RNA was extracted from stress treated seedlings and non treated control plants Hybridization was performed as previously described Results indicated a subunit A transcript response to stress An approximate 2 4 fold increase in transcript level was detected in seedlings subjected to salt and chilling stress compared to control plants Fig 4 Etiolated seedlings showed essentially equivalent amounts of subunit A transcript compared to controls Since etiolation results in rapid elongation of seedlings it was expected that there would be a concomitant increase in subunit A messenger RNA as seen with proteolipid subunit mRNA in A thaliana 36 and subunit A message levels in rapidly expanding cotton Gossypium hirsutum fibers 73 Equivalent loading of whole RNA was evaluated via spectrophotometry measuring absorption at 260 nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 3 spectrophotometer and by visual confirmation using non denaturing ethidium bromide stained agarose gel electrophoresis results not shown Having established that overall subunit A transcript levels were responsive to environmental stress conditions an assay was designed to examine the response of the four individual lengthed transcripts to the same stress conditions The goal was to determine if any of the four were differentially expressed in response to stress A PCR based approach was taken to evaluate transcript levels for the four different subunit A mRNAs Primer pairs were designed Table 1 that would only amplify one of the four transcripts This was accomplished by anchoring the downstream primer in the poly A tail The upstream primer was located in the coding region of the subunit A cDNA Anchoring the downstream primer in the poly A tail prevented that oligonucleotide from priming at any other site since 10 out of 18 nucleotides were T s at the 5 end The primer pairs were designed such that the four amplification products would differ in size by approximately 100 base pairs for ease of visualization on agarose gels and blots Fig 5and Fig 6 Primer pair T 11 and T 12 corresponds to transcript 1 and produce an amplification product of 579 base pairs Primer pair T 21 and T 22 corresponds to transcript 2 and amplify a band of 455 base pairs Primers T 31 and T 32 correspond to transcript 3 and amplify a 362 base pair product Lastly primer pair T 41 and T 42 corresponds to transcript 4 and produce a 238 base pair amplification product The transcript 4 amplification product which is the smallest and nested within the other three acted as probe to detect all four transcripts This nesting was accomplished to avoid differences in signal during hybridization based on different probe lengths and labeling efficiency A control experiment was performed prior to the actual stress analysis to ensure that the primer pairs amplified the correct transcript only and that the transcript 4 probe would detect all four amplification products Whole RNA was extracted from seedlings and cDNA was generated using oligo dT as described in materials and methods Subunit A transcripts were amplified from the generated cDNA with the appropriate primer pairs and transferred to solid support Hybridization was performed at high stringency with the transcript 4 amplification product as probe The results of this experiment indicated that all four primer pairs amplified only a single band of the appropriate and expected size and that the transcript 4 probe adequately hybridized to all four amplification products Fig 5 The differential expression of subunit A transcripts was evaluated in response to salt cold stress and etiolation Complementary DNA s were generated from seven day old seedlings subjected to individual stress conditions Transcripts 1 4 were evaluated via RT PCR using transcript specific primers Amplification products were immobilized on solid support and hybridized with the transcript 4 amplification product The results of this experiment indicate that all four transcripts behaved identically with respect to individual stress conditions Fig 7 All four transcripts showed approximately 2 4 fold increases in response to 100 mM sodium chloride stress compared to untreated controls Similarly treatment of plants at six degrees for four days resulted in a similar increase in signal for all four transcripts Etiolation resulted in slightly higher message levels for transcripts 1 2 and 3 compared to controls The lesser degree of increase for transcript 3 might be due to near saturation of the signal The latter might be due to the higher abundance of the transcript or due to more efficient amplification of the transcript 3 primer set Transcript 4 seems to show slightly less signal than control plants but the autoradiograph is somewhat under developed These results are in agreement with the whole RNA stress blot analysis Apparent quantitative differences in upregulation between transcripts shown in Fig 7 might be due to differential amplification efficiency of the four different primer sets and do not necessarily represent true differential upregulation of the four transcripts The data can only be evaluated quantitatively between samples amplified with the same primer set In summation no significant differential regulation of the four subunit A transcripts was detected in seedlings in response to the three stress conditions evaluated Conclusions Evidence gathered to date indicates the presence of a single gene encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase in A thaliana The search for additional subunit A genes was conducted using whole genome blot analysis screening a lambda PRL 2 cDNA library intron length polymorphism analysis and extensive computer searches of the Arabidopsis Expressed Sequence Tag database GenBank and the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative Most flowering plants evaluated to date have a small multigene family encoding subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase The small size of the A thaliana genome may be indicative of a trend toward streamlining of DNA in this plant which may have eliminated a redundant subunit A gene over evolutionary time Subunit A genes and subsequently proteins are highly conserved Therefore it is not likely that a subunit A gene would have escaped the screen by having a low degree of nucleotide identity Vacuolar type ATPases are housekeeping enzymes probably needed in all living plant cells The single A thaliana subunit A gene was shown by whole RNA blot analysis to be transcribed in all organs of the plant tested The organs analyzed included roots leaves bolts siliques and flowers In addition relatively high levels of transcript were found in whole seedlings These results support the notion of a single subunit A gene in A thaliana that is transcribed in all cells of the plant Numerous examples are present in the literature see 14 and references therein of changes in transcript protein or activity levels of vacuolar type H ATPases in response to environmental stress These results indicate a potential role for the vacuolar type H ATPase in maintenance of homeostasis during times of environmental stress Whole RNA blot analysis performed on seedlings exposed to environmental stress conditions indicated that transcript levels of subunit A were responsive to salt and cold stress treatments Transcript levels were shown to increase approximately 2 4 fold in seedlings treated with cold and salt stress Etiolation did not produce as significant a change in transcript level as salt and cold stress The single vacuolar type H ATPase subunit A gene detected in A thaliana can produce at least four different length transcripts by using different polyadenylation sites These transcripts differ only in their 3 untranslated region and produce identical proteins The presence of regulatory elements in the 3 end of the subunit A gene could be a potential mechanism by which this protein is post transcriptionally regulated However the evidence gathered in this work indicates that the four different transcripts generated off the single subunit A gene are not significantly differentially regulated in response to salt chilling or etiolation in axenically grown seedlings Multi site polyadenylation does not appear to be a mechanism for posttranscriptional control of gene expression for subunit A of the vacuolar type H ATPase in A thaliana for the stress conditions and developmental stage tested Materials and methods Plant materials Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia seeds were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center Ohio State University Columbus OH Seeds were germinated in 4 inch pots according to standard protocols Axenic seedlings and soil grown plants were maintained in

14 days later Growth effects of salt stress were evaluated by germinating surface sterilized seeds on agar containing various concentrations of sodium chloride The optimal concentration chosen to evaluate the effects of salt stress on V ATPase subunit A transcript levels was 100 mM Higher concentrations resulted in failure to germinate or extremely poor growth At 100 mM salt most seeds germinated but required more time to do so than controls Plantlets did grow but were less robust than non treated controls results not shown Seedlings were harvested after seven days of growth In the case of etiolation stress surface sterilized seeds were germinated on agar for three days under light and temperature conditions described above After three days the plates were placed in a light sealed box at the same temperature conditions Seedlings were harvested four days later Plantlets exhibited the typical characteristics of etiolation the hypocotyls were lengthened and the cotyledons reduced compared to light grown controls Cold stress was evaluated by germinating surface sterilized seeds as described for three days under normal light and temperature Agar plates containing seedlings were then transferred to a cold room at 6 C Seedlings were maintained at this temperature for four days before being harvested Isolation of nucleic acids Genomic DNA was extracted from

the organs directly into liquid nitrogen to prevent degradation of the RNA Standard precautions were taken to eliminate ribonuclease contamination in solutions and glassware including baking all glassware at 200 C for six hours and treating all solutions except those containing Tris with 0 1 diethylpyrocarbonate for 12 hours followed by autoclaving Nucleic acids were quantitated by
