 Background Infection with human immunodeficiency vims HIV elicits an acute retroviral syndrome characterized by fever pharyngitis lymphadenopathy myalgia rash and headache 1 2 3 Sexual transmission of HIV infection occurs mostly via the intestinal or vaginal mucosa but HIV I is also effectively transmitted by the intravenous route 4 5 6 7 Recent studies have shown that the HIV I or SIV virus rapidly penetrates vaginal rectal or oral mucosa attaching to and infecting primarily CD4 T cells where it replicates and consequently spreads to lymphoid tissue and systemic organs 8 9 10 11 12 Accumulating evidence has implicated virus specific CTL in containing primary HIV SIV infection and HIV I SIV specific CD8 CTL have been documented during the early weeks following infection before a neutralizing Ab response is demonstrable 13 14 15 16 Despite the rapid dissemination of HIV I by mucosal routes productive mucosal transmission appears to be relatively inefficient and is estimated to occur once in 300 or more high risk exposures 17 Cell mediated immunity and direct killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes from the vagina and colon lamina propria may be an important factor in containing viral infection at the site of primary infection 18 19 20 Mucosal T lymphocytes appear to be functionally distinct from those present in the peripheral circulation While activated T cells reenter lymphoid tissues and preferentially accumulate at the site of the initial activation memory T cells migrate continuously and randomly similar to naive T cells 21 22 The implication in terms of HIV infection is that in the initial phase of an immune response once primed Ag specific memory T cells randomly enter and leave various lymphoid compartments but preferentially are retained in the lymphoid compartment where the antigen was presented at first 23 24 In humans it is unfeasible to evaluate the immunological events that occur shortly after infection in the mucosal compartments However in the SIV mac251 macaque model some of these issues can be addressed SIV mac251 establishes persistent infection in rhesus macaques and causes an immunodeficiency syndrome closely resembling human AIDS 25 26 27 28 As in humans the clinical course of SIV mac251 infection varies considerably among macaques Recent evidence from our lab suggests that macaques that express the major histocompatibility class I Mamu A 01 molecule restrict SIV mac251 replication following intrarectal exposure as reported for HIV I infected individuals that express the HLA B 5701 29 further validating this animal model of HIV I infection In this model virus strain dose and especially route of infection can be defined and host virus interactions under different conditions can be assessed Here we used genetically defined Mamu A 01 rhesus macaques to study the extent of virus specific CD8 T cell response and the trafficking of lymphocytes to the gut during the first 12 days of intrarectal or intravenous transmission of the same stock of SIV mac251 Materials Animals and procedure Two female Mamu A 01 positive macaques were involved in this study animal 817 that was infected by undiluted SIV mac251 561 stock virus R Pal et al unpublished data by the intrarectal route and animal 819 by the intravenous route with a 1 3000 dilution of the same viral stock Blood was drawn before infection and at days 4 8 and 12 after inoculation with the virus Animals were sacrificed at day 12 postinfection The spleens and hilar axillary mesenteric iliac and inguinal lymph nodes as well as ileums jejunums and colons were collected in RPMI medium containing 10 FCS penicillin streptomycin Isolation of tissue lymphocytes Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood PBMC lymph nodes spleens and intestines Mononuclear cells from spleens and lymph nodes were isolated by mechanical dissociation of the tissue and consecutive Ficoll gradient centrifugation Tissues from ileums jejunums and colons were treated with 1 mM DTT ICN Biomedicals Aurora OH for 30 minutes followed by incubation in calcium magnesium free HBSS with EDTA Life Technologies Baltimore MD 4 times 1 hour with stirring at room temperature to remove the epithelial layer At this stage pieces of tissue were fixed in 10 neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin and sections were cut and stained with H E Microscopic examination was performed to ensure that all of the epithelium was removed and the lamina propria was intact Further tissues were cut into smaller pieces and incubated at 37 C in Isocove s medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum and penicillin streptomycin containing 400 U ml Collagenase D Boerrhinghem Mannheim GmbH Mannheim Germany and 25 U ml DNAse Worthington Biochemical Lakewood NJ for 2 3 hours The mononuclear cells were isolated from the supernatant containing dissociated cells by Percoll gradient centrifugation Flow cytometry Fresh mononuclear cells were directly stained with PE conjugated tetrameric complexes for Gag 181 Env 622 and Tat 28 PerCP conjugated anti CD3e Pharmingen San Diego CA and FITC conjugated anti CD8 Becton Dickinson San Jose CA were used in conjunction with the tetrameric complexes In addition cells were stained with a combination of anti CD3 PerCP anti CD8 FITC and anti CD4 PE Becton Dickinson San Jose CA To assess their proliferative ability and to confirm the specificity of tetramer staining of ex vivo CD3 CD8 T cells lymphocytes were cultured at a concentration of 3 10 6 ml in RPMI enriched with 10 human serum with addition of 10 g ml of the appropriate peptide and 20 U ml of IL 2 for 7 days Staining with tetrameric complexes was done afterward as described above Briefly 5 l0 5lymphocytes isolated by Ficoll diatrizoate or Percoll gradient centrifugation were incubated with tetrameric complexes as previously described 30 and or selected Ab for 30 minutes at room temperature After washing the cells twice in Dulbecco s phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 2 FCS and fixation in 1 paraformaldehyde Ph 7 4 samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using FACScalibur Becton Dickinson San Jose CA instrument Viral load NASBA SIV mac251 viral RNA copies in plasma was quantified by nucleic acid sequence based amplification 31 Briefly RNA extracted from plasma was subjected to isothermal amplification with SIV mac251 specific primers A portion of the SIV wild type Gag gene was used to generate internal control NASBA amplification products were detected by using chemiluminescence based probe hybridization system The assay can measure accurately tenfold changes and is functional over a dynamic range spanning at least 10 4 10 7copies Results Kinetics of viral appearance and CD4 T cell decrease in the blood Since the knowledge of the Mamu A 01 restricted epitopes 32 33 allows for a quantitation of the CD8 T cell response using the tetramer technology 34 Mamu A 01 macaques were chosen for this study Following exposure to the same viral stock of SIV mac251 of macaque 817 by the intrarectal route and macaque 819 by the intravenous route the kinetics of viral RNA appearance in the plasma was assessed by NASBA Plasma viral RNA was detected as early as day 8 in animal 819 exposed by the intravenous route and was highest at time of euthanasia day 12 as demonstrated in Fig 1C In contrast in animal 817 exposed by the intrarectal route the appearance of plasma virus was delayed to day 12 postinfection Fig 1A and at that time plasma viral RNA was 2 logs lower in animal 817 than in animal 819 Figs 1Aand 1C The absolute number of CD4 T cells mm 3blood decreased by 50 in both macaques by day 12 Figs 1Aand 1C However the absolute number of CD8 T cells and CD3 T cells decreased as well indicating that the apparent depletion of CD4 T cells may be due to redistribution rather than loss of CD4 T cells at this stage of infection Since animal 817 received three thousandfold more virus than animal 819 these data suggest that the kinetics of viral appearance in the blood in primary SIV mac251 infection may depend on the route of challenge rather than dose Virus specific CD8 T cell response in the blood Virus specific CD8 T cells were quantitated in the blood of both animals at days 0 4 and 12 postinfection using 3 tetrameric Mamu A 01 molecules complexed with the SIV mac Gag 181 Env 622 and Tat 28 peptides T M Alien et al submitted In the blood virus specific tetramer binding CD3 CD8 T cells appeared earlier in macaque 817 exposed to SIV mac251 by the intrarectal route than in 819 for all the 3 antigens studied Figs 1Band 1D Overall the size of the virus specific CD8 T cell response in the blood was higher in animal 817 and interestingly a large population of Tat specific CD8 T cells appeared in the blood as early as day 4 whereas in the same animal CD8 T cells specific to Gag 181 and Env 622 peaked later Fig 1 These data are consistent with previous observations on the kinetics of appearance of virus specific CD8 T cells that recognize the Tat 28 epitope and underscore the importance of the immune response to this early SIV mac251 protein 35 36 37 Absence of CD4 T cell depletion in the GALT of Mamu A 01 macaques Both macaques were euthanized at day 12 and the relative percentages of CD4 and CD8 T cells was assessed in various compartments In contrast to previous reports 38 39 depletion of CD4 T cells was not observed in any tissues including the GALT of either animal Fig 2 It is possible that both animals could have controlled viral replication or that the tissues were examined too early and that depletion would have occurred at a latter stage of the infection Preservation of CD4 T cell depletion in the GALT during primary infection may be a key event in delaying disease progression Quantitation of ex vivoCD8 T cell response in tissues Virus specific Gag 181 CD8 T cell response in the blood of macaques exposed intravenously to SIV mac251 appears to peak within the first weeks following intravenous exposure 40 Therefore both macaques were euthanized at day 12 and lymphocytes were harvested from several systemic tissues as well as the GALT Quantitation of the ex vivo CD8 T cell population specific for Gag Tat and Env in the systemic tissues of both animals revealed that in contrast to the blood the highest virus specific CD8 T cell response was found in most tissues of animal 819 challenged by the intravenous route Figs 3and 4and Table In the same animal the percentage of CD8 T cells specific for Tat 28 was as high as 8 6 and 4 in the axillary and iliac lymph nodes and the spleen respectively Fig 3Aand Table The number of CD8 T cells with different specificities was also higher in animal 819 than 817 in the GALT and particularly in the jejunum and ileum lamina propria Figs 4A 4B 4C while the size of these virus specific responses in the remaining tissues of both animals did not differ significantly Table These data indicate that both the Gag 181 and Tat 28 responses are codominant and suggest that the overall higher CD8 T cell response in animal 819 may be related to an ongoing higher viral replication in the tissues of this animal as reflected by the higher level of plasma viremia present at the time of euthanasia Differential proliferative ability of tetramer binding CD8 cells in tissues of animals 817 and 819 Blood lymph nodes and lamina propria lymphocytes were cultured in vitro in the presence of IL 2 and the virus specific Gag 181 Tat 28 and Env 622 peptides to assess the ability of the tetramer positive CD8 T cell population to expand upon antigen stimulation In our experimental conditions expansion of CD8 T cells specific for Tat Env and Gag occurred to a comparable extent in most tissues and was highest in the blood of animal 819 Fig 5B In animal 817 the ability of virus specific CD8 T cells to proliferate was highest in the jejunum and was higher than that observed in the same compartment in animal 819 Fig 5A The finding that the highest level of CD8 T cells with proliferative ability was in the lamina propria of the jejunum of animal 817 challenged intrarectally is suggestive of a qualitative difference of CD8 T cells present at the site of induction and of heterogeneity in the virus specific CD8 response Discussion The impact that the route of viral entry of HIV SIV may have on the virus specific immune response and control of viral replication to it is not yet fully understood Here we conducted a small pilot study using genetically defined Mamu A 01 macaques to study the vims specific immune response following parenteral or rectal exposure to SIV mac251 This study was designed to begin to investigate the specificity of the immune response and its kinetics as well as the kinetics of viral replication according to the site of primary exposure and viral entry Within the limitation of the small number of animals used here the mucosal barrier delayed the appearance of virus in the plasma whereas the decrease in the absolute CD4 T cell counts was equivalent In addition in contrast to other reports 41 38 depletion of CD4 T cells in the GALT at day 12 postinfection was not observed in either animal regardless of the route of challenge It is unclear what is the reason for this finding It is possible that both animals could have controlled the infection or that the tissues were examined too early and that depletion would have occurred at a latter stage of the infection The finding of a higher percentage of tetramer positive CD8 T cells in tissues of macaque 819 infected intravenously than in animal 817 infected intrarectally may reflect a higher rate of viral replication in tissues of this animal at the time of sacrifice Of interest the intrarectal route of infection resulted in faster kinetics of appearance of virus specific CD8 T cells particularly in the Tat epitope in the blood indicating the importance of this immune response early in infection In the same animal a higher number of tetramer specific CD8 T cells able to proliferate in response to all epitopes tested Gag 181 Tat 28 and Env 622 was found in jejunum lamina propria than in other tissues Unfortunately at present it is not possible to assess whether the differences in the proliferative ability of these cells reflect functional status and or differentiation differences effector versus memory or others in part because markers to define accurately these cells in rhesus macaques are not available Conclusions In conclusion this study within the limitation of the small number of animals used appears to suggest that exposure by the mucosal site a natural barrier to pathogens delays viral appearance in the blood The differences in the relative percentage of homing markers may not necessarily reflect a true qualitative difference in the overall lymphocyte trafficking related to the mode of viral encounter and may depend on the time of analysis since the kinetic of viral replication was delayed in the macaque exposed intrarectally Nevertheless these data demonstrate that a short window of opportunity to contain viral infection following mucosal exposure exists and that potentiating the effectiveness of the mucosal natural barrier by local immunization may further limit or halt viral replication In fact in a previous study we have observed that it appears to be easier to protect vaccinated macaques by intrarectal exposure than intravenous exposure to SIV 251 42 In particular since a CD8 T cell response to Tat appears to be the earliest this protein may be a key component of a preventive vaccine as suggested by other 35 36 37 43 List of abbreviations HIV human immunodeficiency virus HEV high
