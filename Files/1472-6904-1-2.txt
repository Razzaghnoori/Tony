 Background The use of hair assays in order to assess the presence of ingested chemical materials has been used in a wide variety of applications 1 2 Hair has been utilized for example in determining the degree of exposure to heavy metals in both post mortem and living subjects 3 In recent years there has been considerable focus on the recovery of illicit psychoactive substances and their metabolites from hair 4 5 6 Others have reported on a wide variety of substances that can be recovered from human hair samples and can be quantitatively determined These include nicotine and cotinine 7 caffeine 8 antipsychotics and anti anxiety medications 9 10 11 12 various antibiotics 13 14 15 16 pesticides 17 digoxin 18 and steroids 19 20 There are several advantages to hair as a sample for analysis but the single most important attribute is undoubtedly the long retrospective time frame to which analysis of a segment of hair corresponds This permits an evaluation of a history of exposure that is not possible with specimens such as saliva or urine A three centimeter length of hair corresponds on average to approximately 90 days of past time or history For compounds that are stable when sequestered in hair this represents a very desirable property This enhanced temporal capacity lends itself to the possibility that hair analysis can be utilized to evaluate individual compliance for substances that are taken on a regular basis such as anti clotting medications antibiotics and anti epileptic drugs This can be an important diagnostic and assessment aid in medical practice and clinical evaluation of drug efficacy Williams for example has advocated the use of hair analysis as a method for assessing therapeutic compliance to anti seizure drug regimens 21 It has been well demonstrated that the major antiepileptic medications phenytoin PHT carbamazepine CBZ and valproic acid VPA are readily recovered and quantified from hair specimens 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 Thus assessing the presence and quantity of these substances in hair may be a reliable marker for consumption and provide an additional source of information to the physician who has historically relied only on the patient s self reported compliance Whether hair analysis can be an effective indication of patient compliance is controversial however It is widely accepted that the qualitative presence of these compounds can be reliably demonstrated by hair analysis The controversial aspect is primarily based on the issue of whether the quantitative value of the assay can be a reliable indicator of dose That is is there a reliable dose assay correlation Tracqui et al 30 for example have argued that hair analysis has value for qualitative evaluation of drug use but is worthless for quantitative assessment of patient compliance Williams 1999 however argues the opposite and presents data for a controlled inpatient population taking CBZ which shows remarkably good consistency between dose and assay outcome Furthermore Williams suggests that compliance is best measured by using patients as their own control This is done by comparing any given assay outcome to a ground state value So hair will show a relative change in concentration It is generally accepted that specific quantitative values related to a specific dose can not applied across study subjects due to substantive individual biovariability One issue that is not clearly understood is the variety of factors influencing the considerable biovariability that appears between persons given identical dosages of these drugs Clinicians general recognize that a very large number of factors can influence the drug concentration in any analytic matrix One potential advantage of hair specimens is they may represent a relatively stable matrix over a relatively long time frame Tracqui even in rejecting the utility of quantitative compliance monitoring in this context notes that a number of studies reported significant strong correlation between dose and assay outcomes for a number of different compounds with Pearson s r ranging from 772 to 868 Another aspect of this interpretation controversy concerns whether there are systematic influences on drug concentration in hair because of color variations differences in cosmetic treatment and different intensities of hair hygiene Another part of the controversy is problems related to the dependency on the accuracy self reported patient compliance which may or may not be accurate and in the case of illicit drugs the purity and actual contents of drugs reported as consumed The attending physicians for these patients were queried on the confidence they had on their patient s compliance and in general they rated the compliance as good with only a small number of missed doses However we recognize that there are reliable data to indicate that patient compliance to anti seizure medication regimens may be weak and a delimitation of this research is that there was not rigid control of patient compliance One of the general weaknesses characterizing much of the analysis of hair assay data has been the inadequacy of the statistical models used to assess the experimental information Oftentimes claims or conclusions are derived from experimental data that is not supported by statistical analysis In some cases in fact analyses of the data show that the conclusions reached are clearly incorrect 31 There has been in general a failure in the assessment of experimental hair analysis data to use appropriate available statistical procedures or to assess whether the critical assumptions that underlay statistical procedures are met by the data And almost without exception there has been no utilization of more sophisticated and sensitive statistical techniques that are available to examine multivariate phenomena This is true even though there is a general recognition that the relationship between dose and assay are likely to mediated by a complex series of intervening events and are particularly appropriate to this analytic approach Materials and Methods The analysis is based upon the concentrations obtained from scalp hair collected by cutting hair from the posterior vertex of the head Each sample consisted of approximately 200 mg of hair Each sample was sectioned into 2 cm segments and each segment was analyzed by FPIA and HPLC methods for CBZ and PHT and by FPIA for VPA The number of segments for each patient varied since it was dependent of length of hair available from each individual Most patients have five segments and no patient provided less than two segments The concentrations used for each case are the mean values for all available segments for that patient HPLC values are used in the analysis of CBZ and PHT FPIA values are used in the analysis of VPA As well serum assay values are provided for each patient The serum assay typology varied including multiple methods to assay serum for some drugs For CBZ serum was assayed by both FPIA and GC MS for VPA by FPIA and for PHT by FPIA and HPLC Bloods were drawn from patients in the morning by their attending physician In a few cases there were multiple bloods drawn In such cases the mean values for the serum levels are represented in the tables Hair color assignments were based upon observation by the attending physician questioning of the patient and in cases of ambiguity by consultation among the field research staff the attending physician and the patient Since this is a secondary analysis of data only a synopsis of technical procedures is presented here Details of the instrumentation including calibration and standardization and elaboration of the analysis techniques are described in detail elsewhere 28 and are not repeated here The general approach was as follows hair samples were dissolved in a strong base NaOH and the dissolved material was subjected to solvent extraction Hair samples were segmented in 2 cm sections and 30 50 mg of hair from each segment was added to 3 ml of 1 N NaOH solution The solution was solvent extracted with diethyl ether centrifuged and the supernatant evaporated The remnant residue was dissolved in saline and subjected to analysis Result and Discussion Carbamazepine CBZ General Dose Assay Relationship The data for the dose assay relationship includes concentration in the plasma serum which was determined by both FPIA and GC and concentration in the hair which was determined by both FPIA and HPLC For hair assays the values are in micrograms per gram of hair and for serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of plasma The findings show that there was no significant dose assay relationship for the serum specimens with either analytic technique and that there was a significant dose assay relationship for hair specimens by both analytic techniques The results are shown in Table 1 Hair Color It has been a source of controversy in the interpretation of hair assays whether or not hair color is a critical factor in the binding of materials in hair It has previously reported that CBZ does not appear to have a significant color effect i e that darker hair shows significantly higher concentrations of CBZ than light hair 31 We examine this finding using the current data There are five color categorizations of hair represented among the 40 subjects The distribution of hair color and the mean concentration of CBZ for each color are shown in Table 2 The concentration values are in micrograms gram as measured by HPLC An analysis of variance for this table fails to show a significant relationship between CBZ mean value and hair color F 1 374 p 263 The Levene Test for equality of error variances indicates that the homogeneity of variance assumption is met Levene F 303 p 874 The K S and Shapiro Wilk tests for normality are consistent with a normal distribution and a normal Q Q plot of CBZ concentration in hair shows a good approximation of normality Hair Color Dose Relationship Another factor worth consideration is the possible interaction effect between hair color and dose The dose values and hair color categories can be a shown as a matrix array as in Table 3 Table 3is a crosstabulation showing the distribution of dosage values by hair color Review of the cell distributions shows a concentration of higher dose regimens to cluster towards the lower left indicating the possibility that persons with black hair may more likely to be on higher doses of CBZ and persons with lighter hair may be more likely to receive lower doses The GLM covariance model is based on the mean hair assay outcomes HPLC The analysis of covariance ANCOVA allows for the comparison of quantitative dependent and qualitative independent variable while simultaneously controlling for a number of quantitative variables or covariates In this analysis the dependent variable is the mean concentration for the hair analysis the independent qualitative variable is the hair color categorization and the covariates are duration of dose in months dose in mgs per 24 hours and patient age in years The outcome of this model is shown in Table 4 Table 4reveals that there is a relation between mean hair concentration and dose F 5 020 p 032 eta 2 136 shaded row while the relationship between hair assay result and color is not significant F 682 p 609 eta 2 079 Thus it is reasonable to conclude that differential hair assay outcomes for CBZ are not color dependent but are significantly related to dose regimens Valproic Acid VPA General Dose Assay Relationship The data for the VPA dose assay relationship includes concentration in the plasma serum which was determined by FPIA and concentration in the hair which was determined by FPIA For hair assays the values are in micrograms per gram of hair and for serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of plasma The findings show that there was no significant dose assay relationship for the VPA serum specimens and that there was a significant correlation dose assay relationship for VPA hair specimens The results are shown in Table 5 Hair Color As with CBZ we will examine the potential for a color effect associated with the reported concentrations of recovered VPA The color categorizations are identical to those used for CBZ Table 6reports the mean concentration of VPA by hair color category There are no dyed specimens so four color categories are used in this analysis An analysis of variance for Table 6fails to show a significant relationship between VPA mean values and hair color F 2 354 p 088 The Levene Test for equality of error variances indicates that the homogeneity of variances assumptions is met Levene F 2 491 p 076 The K S test for normality is consistent with a normal distribution and a normal Q Q plot of VPA concentration in hair shows a good approximation of normality Hair Color Relationship As with CBZ we now consider the possible interaction of hair color dose and recovered VPA from hair Table 7presents the frequency distribution of dose by hair color Visual inspection of the Table 7is consistent with the impression that there may be a slight skewing of higher dosage regimens towards dark haired subjects We subject this data to an ANCOVA As previously we treat mean concentration as the dependent term color as the independent qualitative term and dose duration 24 hour dose value and age as the covariates The outcome for this model is reported in Table 8 The Levene statistic shows the variance homogeneity criteria are met and analysis of the normality of the distribution of the mean hair values shows acceptable conformity with normality assumptions Table 8demonstrates that the relationships between dose age and hair color are all significant shaded rows while duration of dose regimen is not Furthermore the eta 2values which are interpretable as a measure of the percentage of the explainable variance show similar contributions between color and dose and a lesser contribution due to age Table 9reports these contrasts using Bonferroni s criteria The Bonferroni criteria contrasts indicate that specific pair comparisons do not yield a significant difference although the contrasts for black gray and black blond are approaching significance Doing the pairs comparisons using Sidak criteria yields the same results Both of these confidence interval criteria are conservative but the Bonferroni criteria are preferred on the basis that there is a relatively small number of comparison pairs An additional issue of importance is the potential complex interaction between dose age and color categorization First the data demonstrate a difference in mean dose value by age although those differences are not significant for VPA the correlation for dose and age is r 265 p 098 Furthermore the covariance model can be used to generate model regression derived mean estimates adjusted for age and dose that can be compared to the observed values Both the analytic values and the estimated values are shown in Table 10 Comparison of the observed mean values and the model estimated mean values shows that the model is relatively efficient for all color categorizations except gray hair where the observed values are nearly twice the value of the estimated values Since age and gray hair are collinear in the data set Table 10 it is possible that the age color account for this departure Regression evaluation of the color age collinearity for either dose or mean concentration is consistent with this effect eigenvalue age 228 eigenvalue color 081 Small eigenvalues are consistent with collinearity between the covariate factors and thus these values are indicative of an age color collinear condition To further examine this effect we produce a final covariance model for VPA with color categorization as the independent factor and dose as the covariate The results of this model are presented in Table 11 The 2 factor model dose and color presented in Table 11are consistent with the conjecture that age and color demonstrate some interactive or synergistic effect since color alone fails to attain significance It is reasonable to surmise that the color effect for VPA is at best weak and mostly likely collinear with age However there is an effect for color that is operating as a stronger effect than discerned in the analysis of CBZ This effect appears to be dependent on the stringency of the significance criteria used in the analysis and the degree to which the analytic model disaggregates the hypothesized variable relationships Selecting less conservative criteria will produce a weak generalized significant color assay relationship but application of either more conservative methods to assess pair relationships e g Bonferroni criteria or use of more elaborate model specifications e g step wise ANCOVA fail to sustain significance One of the more serious constraints on the VPA analysis presented here is the very limited number of persons with gray hair and the number of light haired persons in general only 6 of the 40 subjects were not classified as either black or brown hair A more confident analysis would require a sample with larger numbers Phenytoin PHT General Dose Assay Relationship The data for the dose assay relationship includes concentration in the plasma serum which was determined by HPLC and concentration in the hair which was determined by both FPIA and HPLC For hair assays the values are in micrograms per gram of hair and for serum the values are in micrograms per milliliter of plasma We note that in contrast to both CBZ and VPA Table 12reveals that there is a significant bivariate dose assay correlation for the serum specimens and for the hair specimens by both analytic techniques Hair Color Table 13reports the number of subjects for each of four hair color categorizations the mean concentration of PHT for that color category and the related standard deviation Visual examination of the table shows that both black and brown color had notably higher concentrations than either blond haired or gray haired subjects A univariate ANOVA on the data in Table 13reveal that there is a significant difference by hair color F 10 2 p 000 However the Levene Test indicates that the homogeneity of variance assumption is not met An alternative analysis using Tamhane s procedure allowing an assessment of unequal variances comparisons also indicates significance but allows for post hoc contrasts for each specific color group The individual comparisons are shown in Table 14 The ANOVA indicates that that there are significant differences in concentration of PHT by hair color The overall mean concentration values appear to cluster with the black brown hair contrast showing no significant difference and blond gray contrast showing no significant difference However contrast of either blond or gray hair to black or brown hair does show significant difference The overall distribution of PHT in the hair assays appears to meet the normality assumptions well Hair Color Dose Relationship In order to further assess the nature of the hypothesized color effect it is important to assess whether or not there is an interaction effect of color and dose Is the effect a result of dosing values are higher for dark haired subjects Table 15reports the relative frequency of daily dose regimens by hair color group Table 15indicates that the higher dose values appear to cluster to some degree with black and brown haired subjects In order to assess this an ANCOVA model including dose dose duration age and hair color is assessed Results of that model are shown in Table 16 Table 16indicates that age dose and color are significant factors in the model values shaded gray are significant while dose duration is not This is identical to the model outcome for VPA Table 17shows the Bonferroni criteria for all pairwise combinations their means differences and their significance outcomes As with VPA the pairwise contrasts show that the black and gray and brown and gray contrasts are significant while the remaining pairs do not have significant mean differences the same results is obtained using Sidak criteria It suggests as with VPA that there may be a color age dose confounding action involving either collinear or confounding relationships between hair color dose and age In order to assess this we first consider the observed means and the estimates mean values from the ANCOVA model This is presented in Table 18 Table 18reveals that the model estimated means for dark hair black and brown are lower than the observed values and the estimates for light colored hair are greater This is a departure from the VPA pattern and is consistent across category with a color concentration positive relationship We can assess this effect by examining the ANCOVA model retaining dose and hair color as the sole covariates replicating the procedure applied to VPA and examining the surviving significant relationship The results of this model are shown in Table 19 Consistent with the approach applied to VPA we delete age from the model in Table 19 Age is removed from the model in this case to see if it diminishes the color effect as was the case VPA Comparison of Tables 17and 18show that the eta 2is diminished but is still significant and makes a substantial contribution to the explained variance Dose still has however the higher eta 2value Further pairwise comparisons show that there are significant mean value contrasts between the light hair categories gray and blond and the dark hair categories black and brown There are however no significant contrasts within those groups i e no significant mean differences between black and brown hair or blond and gray hair Conclusions This assessment of the recovery of three compounds CBZ VPA and PHT from hair samples identifies a variable effect of hair color on assay concentration by drug type The generalized hypothesis assessed is that darker coloration of hair is associated with a greater concentration of analyte in the hair For CBZ hair color does not appear to exert a significant effect on the quantity of the compound recovered from hair For VPA there appears to be a very weak color effect but the number of light haired subjects attenuates the strength of the conclusion For all drugs there appears to be a significant positive relationship between dose and hair concentration We also suggest that for VPA there appears to be effects of collinearity between age and hair color and possibly dose and hair color Both of these phenomena could produce confounding effects in trying to describe the dose assay relationship The limitations of the data are that the subjects are a clinical non random population and the range of dosages across all color grouping was not uniform nor was dosage duration Furthermore the number of light hair subjects was for certain drugs very small Hair Color Dose Dose Duration HPLC and FPIA Concentration per Segment HPLC and FPIA Serum Concentration
