 Um Hi I m Laura Ragonese and I m currently living in Huntersville NC I ve been there for about two and a half years but I grew up in a small town in Connecticut and I basically came down here um just first for the University but then I landed a job so I ve been staying here working Um and I happened upon Charlotte and Huntersville area just on the Internet I was looking for a city down south and I kind of wanted an idea as to something new something upcoming and from what I understand Charlotte is a quite growing city So it seemed like a really good place to come to and so far I really like it Um I m going to tell you a story about a trip I took with my sisters Um I have four sisters and we re all about a year and a half apart and we re going to visit my grandmother who lives in Cape Coral in Florida So I think it was maybe four years ago four four or five years ago and um we left actually just three of my sisters and I went And um we left Connecticut and we were driving down we were driving in my sister Diane s um Ford Escort which she d had for about a year and a half and uh we were driving and everything anticipating good weather and I think we were just about right outside of Savannah GA and I was driving the car and her car is standard and um the clutch went out on the car So I was driving and I said to my sister Diane Di I don t think I think something is wrong with the clutch I said Because it seems to be on the floor meaning it it wasn t didn t feel like it was connected And I um she said Pull off the side of the road so I pulled off into this um I guess it was like a rest stop But there weren t any pay phones a lot of truckers few people whatever so we stopped and definitely the clutch was broken So my sister has a CB and so we tried to radio some people that didn t work This woman came through with a cell phone so we called for help and this honky tonk kind of guy I don t know where he was from he was operating basically his machine shop or his repair shop right out of this truck He didn t have a license plate on his truck He didn t have a decal saying where he worked or anything So it was kind of shady But so it was about three or four o clock anyway so we sat on the curb and waited for this guy He comes first and assesses the situation and said I think that your clutch cable snapped and it s not really a big deal we can rig it up so you guys can get to where you got to go you just have to get it fixed So fine so he leaves And we flag down an officer and he comes and he tries and tells us he proceeds to tell us there was a black belt wait the murder belt I don t know this guy was crazy this cop he said that we were in a really bad section of where people were like murdered and killed and like thrown like behind like the rest stop So my sisters are sitting on the curb thinking Oh my God we re going to die right And not to mention it s getting later in the day and it was about I think it was late March early April it had to be But anyways so the sun had started descending going down Anyways this guy comes and he fix he must have left about four times I don t know where he was going but I don t know where his shop was but every time he comes back with some crazy thing and he eventually fixed our car with some uh chicken wire I think he rigged it up with We have no idea Anyways we got in the car and it got us to Savannah GA And we arrived in Savannah um it was Mardi Gras was it Mar no it was St Patrick s Day and let me tell you there were some crazy things going on The woman the desk attendant the hotel we checked in well first we couldn t find any hotels because it was booked apparently Savannah is like really crazy around St Patrick s Day So um we got there and this woman had long green nails on it was kind of crazy Um she was like OH you guys came for the perfect time it s um St Patrick s Day and we re having parties and parties and all this stuff So I couldn t go out I think I was like 19 years old and you have to be like 21 uh 18 in some clubs and 21 to drink and we decided not to go out considering everything that had happened that day So we woke up the next morning we went down and we drove down to FL I think it took us in all about 23 hours maybe 24 because she Cape Coral is on the West Coast So we got there and my grandma is of course excited to see us and we unpacked our stuff and everything and we proceeded to lay out in the driveway and my younger sister Nancy um being her first time in the sun decided she didn t want to use sunscreen because she really wanted to get a good suntan she got a good suntan she got a sunburn After we yelled at her for about three hours she decided to slap some sunburn on the back of her suntan lotion on the back of her leg and it left a nice white print like hand print on the back of her leg and the rest of her got sun burnt So then we basically um we visited with our grandmother and I have some step family that lives down there so one night we went out with our cousin Teddy and we uh went out to some clubs with him and everything Um and then we went to let s see For I want to say it s Fort Myers Beach I think the beach is on the West Coast we went down it s about an hour from my grandma s and uh it s a really nice beach it s uh was pretty warm that day I think we all got some color but they were having an epidemic of red tide and so all the fish were washing up on the shore and um luck be it since we were having such a good time um Allison Nancy and I decide we are going to take a walk along the beach and there were fish strewn everywhere so we were careful not to step on them However Allison wasn t paying attention and she stepped on a fish and it got a barb which is one of it s defense mechanisms stuck in her foot so it was really painful and her foot swelled up and everything So we go to this gas station and they tell us we have to go to the hospital so we go to the hospital in Cape Coral and I think we were there for probably ten hours
