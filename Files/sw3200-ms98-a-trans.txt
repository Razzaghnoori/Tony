        okay ill let you start do you all keep a budget and how do you hold to yours     no i i never keep a budget my budget or philosophy i guess is is spend as little as possible   umhum well thats thats good  especially for these times   and uh and its its sort sort of always worked   uhhuh   uh but that depends on you know on the individual if they can i guess have self control   well thats a lot of it uh i know we tried several different ways one time we tried something that really worked but we didnt keep it up i passed it on to a friend and she wont quit doing it she loves it and that was the envelope system   umhum   where you go ahead and decide about how much based on what you did last month that you are going to spend and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries and et cetera and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form uh causes you to realize how much is left and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope what shes buying and then at the end of the of the period pay period   uhhuh   if she has any left that much is for fun or entertainment and they kind of work it that way we tried for a while and it seems like the problem that we were having of all the of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldnt think about   umhum yes   and those are the ones that will kill you you know the accident the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that werent supposed to be every month   well yeah i i couldnt probably be bothered doing doing that   uhhuh  thats what i mean it was a hassle   every month and and every since uh well weve been married almost thirty years now but um my my husband got paid once a month   umhum umhum   so  you learn to get through  you learn to get through you know to the end of the month and uh   thats thats kind of hard   but do you sort of self budget even though i mean you wouldnt like on payday think boy i can go do this and that and this and that you kind of think this is got to straight you kind of divide it in fourths in a way dont you   no no because if you charge things and uh you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month when you get paid or you get paid the last day or next to the last day you pay all your bills then there isnt anything left to spend anyway   right right well thats true what were in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely     umhum   and were going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month   well yeah we we tried to to   and   to or we are paying them off now or there was a time when maybe we didnt pay all of them off but you just sort of had to watch what you put in because you you hate to pay those finance charges when you see how much it is   yeah were not there yet umhum uhhuh thats right thats right   and for most of uh i mean im a substitute teacher and ive only substituted i guess for the last fifteen years so theres only been really one working  and uh   um umhum same here yeah   it it works for me but i cant see that it it would work for probably the majority of people   well i could say its kind of you know thats thats good you may you probably have a little extra than you have to have to you know what im saying and so that thats the difference there where sometimes like i know if weve had an especially bad month and were just almost getting down to payday   yeah     then i think if we could really budget we tried one time i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadnt had a car payment in five years we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for to see how much was gonna be left and that was a real eye opener   umhum yeah umhum it it is when you do it that way   uhhuh but to to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes ill spend less on groceries but well go out so its kind of hard to say this is how much youre gonna spend going out for fun this is how much youre gonna spend its kind of hard do you   well we we eat out a a good deal at this point i i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved all that money so because i knew that you couldnt you know spending five thousand dollars on a vacation or whatever we were gonna go for ten weeks   yeah yeah right  right oh how nice   ah in nineteen eighty so i started working in nineteen eighty seven and just saved for three years but the what minuscule amount i made but that way you just didnt put it on your credit card and and it was paid for   uhhuh with well thats good and it made a big and you enjoyed it better probably yeah   yes and so i think that thats difficult for most people but then my father was very Scotch and you know you never could afford anything although he could afford everything if he wanted to um   i think so too so if youre out like in a department store and theres a sale youre just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you that thats excellent thats what im working toward i think youre probably much ahead of me there and im working on it   yes and i never worried about saving money because we just were in the savings plan at work and they took it out so   same here same here and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you dont have to go through the company to get  you know yeah   i uh umhum well we never had too much of that but then we never had any really emergencies that uh   yeah that came up yeah   and we didnt buy really new or expensive cars i think the most my were looking at cars now uh we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars   uhhuh   and they were mainly used cars   well thats the best thing to do my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasnt worth it from the day after so   yeah so you know weve been rather rather frugal in that   rather frugal well that thats gonna payoff on retirement yeah well it uh i guess weve completed do you think weve been here ten   in that respect yeah well each each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please uh
