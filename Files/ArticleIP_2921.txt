 No Cigar The austere installation of Chuck Close s big portraits at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City begins where any artist wants the narrative of his career to begin with fully achieved art No juvenilia no hesitant casting about no finding of the voice You walk into the first white room and bam There s the Big Self Portrait of 1967 68 staring right at you This unforgiving image glories in its sheer seediness A trickle of cigarette smoke takes a detour around the caterpillar mustache before negotiating some nose hairs The stubble on Close s close up cheeks and neck is so magnified that the hairs are an unshavable inch long The whole portrait is a celebration of hair facial nasal chest eyebrow head the freak flag as David Crosby called it of the late 60s But Charles Thomas Close took a while to turn into Chuck Close the disheveled unmade bed of a man with the black glasses Born in Monroe Wash in 1940 he was the only child of a failed inventor and plumber who died when Charles was 11 Charles mother taught piano and encouraged his interest in painting He attended the University of Washington and did graduate work at Yale from 1962 to 64 His Yale classmates included such current art world stars as the painters Brice Marden and Jennifer Bartlett and the sculptor Richard Serra After teaching at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst for a couple of years he returned to New York where with a brief interruption in 1988 when a paralyzing seizure left him in a wheelchair he has worked ever since During his early 20s Close experimented with a variety of provocative styles In 1961 obviously inspired by Jasper Johns he cut up American flags sewed them up in new shapes a mushroom cloud for example and painted over them At Yale he learned to paint de Kooning rip offs with such facility that he once told de Kooning that he d painted more de Koonings than de Kooning had By the mid 1960s like others of his generation he d left the gestural art of Pollock and de Kooning behind though Pollock could have painted the swirling chest hair in Big Self Portrait and begun using photographic images as the basis for his cooler less openly expressive work In 1967 the campus police at U Mass dismantled Close s first solo exhibition which included drawings loosely based on photographs of album covers One showed Bob Dylan exposing himself Close left for New York that summer where he painted his 21 foot long Big Nude an impressive black and white image of a reclining woman with a bikini suntan based on photographs he d taken in Amherst In November he started his Big Self Portrait Three years later an Artforum interview referred to Close by his nickname Chuck which an assistant had scrawled on some photographs for the piece and the name stuck as his professional moniker None of Close s in your face 60s shockers the desecrated flags the oversize nudes the rock stars genitalia is included in the MoMA show though Big Nude is reproduced in the exhibition catalog nor for that matter are some large scale photographic nudes he made during the mid 1980s Close s career of deliberate provocation is airbrushed out What this means is that the Big Self Portrait of 1967 68 seems to come out of nowhere One is left with the somewhat misleading impression of an establishment figure the artist who plays an artist in Six Degrees of Separation as Close did who paints pictures of his celebrity friends who takes a formal photographic portrait of Bill Clinton 1996 in the catalog This interpretation of Close is reinforced by MoMA s focus on his technical and formal innovations to the exclusion of his subject matter The paintings and drawings are grouped in such a way that we follow Close s progression from the black and white enlargements of the late 60s to his puzzling attempts during the 70s to reproduce in paint the chemical process by which Polaroid cameras make color images Instead of mixing his colors on the palette Close built up his images by applying thin layers of primary colors directly onto the canvas Many of these color portraits have a faded pallor like old snapshots but the exuberant Linda 1975 76 has a dispersed energy derived from the spidery network of Hendrix hair crow s feet wrinkles fissured lips and eye capillaries While moving into color Close found ways to engage the crisscross grid that had always been part of his procedure for enlarging photographic images First he made the grid an explicit element of his compositions Then he experimented with different ways to fill that grid pointillist colored dots blobs of papier m ch fingerprints and finally the colorful Symbolist doodles he now favors All this focus on technique while fascinating in itself is a distraction from the emotional impact of the paintings And the most interesting and dramatic technical transition from gestural de Kooningisms to Pop cool is missing from the show MoMA s coy refusal to identify the subjects of the portraits wall panels give title date and medium suggests that their identities don t matter even while first name titles imply that they do that intimacies are being explored and revealed The result is that the show has an insiderly feel Many will recognize that Phil 1969 is the composer Philip Glass or that Roy II 1994 in a rare Closean profile to show off the ponytail is the late Roy Lichtenstein But how many will know as I do that Marge R 1974 is a realtor in Amherst An example of this coyness is the pair of paintings hanging side by side in the first room Nancy 1968 could be a still from a 50s film noir She looks as if she has just caught sight of a stalker on the stairs The sharp focus treatment of certain details light glinting on the uneven Ali McGrawish front teeth the asymmetrical eyes the squashed nose that looks as if it s been broken at least once give a victimized menaced quality to the composition The thug with the fuck you sneer depicted in Richard 1969 a magnified mug shot hanging to her right could be the guy she s just caught sight of But here s where the in group stuff kicks in Nancy is the late artist Nancy Graves and the thug is Richard Serra whom she married in 1965 Is Close with MoMA s cooperation suggesting there were violent tensions in this marriage which ended in divorce Nor are Close s experiments with filling his grids as merely technical as the MoMA show makes them seem In several unsettling portraits Close fills his grids with his own fingerprints inked on a stamp pad These works have none of the finger painting naivet of kids art that you might expect though two of them portray Close s young daughters Rather with their clearly indicated whorls they look like police fingerprints used for identification Is it an accident that two of Close s favorite media are mug shots and fingerprints MoMA s new ways to fill the grid narrative discourages any such speculation about the buried themes of criminality and violence beneath Close s cool images Close s work from the 80s and the 90s loses something of his earlier provocativeness Lucas II 1987 of the painter Lucas Samaras has a wild man intensity part Ezra Pound part Jerry Garcia accentuated by Close s one time experimentation with a radiating circular grid But most of the other recent paintings are jeweled engaging user friendly The colorful little symbols filling the grids remind me of Gustav Klimt whom Close studied in Vienna in 1964 especially when Close is luxuriating in the dark tangle of the artist Kiki Smith s hair Kiki 1993 If you take a closer look though you notice that instead of Klimt s erotic glamour which hints at dangerous passions unleashed by the unconscious Close s doodles depict doughnuts hot dogs and lozenges The candy store colors that Close reined in for decades return here with a vengeance but they seem more frivolous than emotionally charged These top dollar portraits of art world luminaries look good enough to eat
