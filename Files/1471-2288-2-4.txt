 Background Most current methods of cancer early detection such as mammography or cervical cytology are based on anatomic changes in tissues or morphologic changes in cells Recently various molecular markers such as protein or genetic changes have been proposed for cancer early detection 1 2 3 4 This has spurred many investigators with long term cohort studies to serially collect and store blood or tissue specimens The aim is to later perform a nested case control study where specimens from subjects with a particular type of cancer cases and specimens from a random sample of subjects without the cancer controls are tested for various molecular markers Sometime this sort of study is called a retrospective longitudinal study 6 although retrospective longitudinal data could arise in other ways as well Unlike cross sectional study designs the markers are measured on specimens collected well before the onset of clinical disease in cases This avoids the potential confounding effect of the target disease on the marker For example in the ATBC alpha tocopherol beta carotene 7 and CARET 8 studies subjects were randomized to placebo or drug to in a long term study to determine the effect of the drug on lung cancer mortality During the course of the trial serum was serially collected and stored in a biorepository In a subsequent nested case control study stored serum samples from all cases of prostate cancer and a random sample of controls were tested for prostate specific antigen PSA Importantly the nested case control study of early detection biomarkers may be distinct from the original long term study from which serum were collected It is designed to answer a different question it typically studies subjects with a different disease and it often ignores the intervention in the original long term study Methods We had three considerations in formulating appropriate guidelines First we wanted to link the analysis to the goal of study namely to help decide on further study of the biomarker as a trigger for early intervention Second we wanted to minimize possible biases in the selection of cases and the controls and in the investigation of many markers Third we wanted to extract as much information as possible relevant to the evaluation Results We offer the following guidelines for the design and analysis of nested case control studies of early detection cancer biomarkers 1 For the clearest interpretation statistics for binary markers should be based on true and false positive rates or predictive values based on the true prevalence not odds ratios relative risks or predictive values based on the prevalence in the study A promising marker should have a high degree of accuracy in discriminating between subjects who are likely to get cancer from those who are not For a binary marker which is either positive or negative the basic measures of this type of accuracy are the true positive and false positive rates Consider the hypothetical data in the Table 1from a nested case control study of early detection biomarkers The true positive rate TPR or the test sensitivity is the probability the marker is positive given cancer The false positive rate FPR or 1 specificity is the probability the marker is positive given no cancer In Table 1 TPR is estimated by 80 100 80 and FPR is estimated by 10 1000 01 For a perfect test TPR 1 and the FPR 0 There is always a tradeoff between the TPR and FPR so it is meaningless to assess one without assessing the other For example one could make the TPR equal to 1 simply by classifying every subject as positive for cancer But this would be a poor classification rule because the FPR would also be 1 Guidelines for FPR and TPR Because the underlying prevalence of cancer is so low in average risk populations for acceptable cancer screening of asymptomatic people the FPR should be very small 9 As a starting point we recommend basing guidelines for FPR and TPR on the FPR and TPR for mammography which as discussed below is FPR 01 and TPR 80 A mammogram is analogous to a biomarker test for cancer but there is extra information from various studies that makes it useful for setting guidelines One reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography as a standard is that unlike biomarker measurements in nested case control studies in mammography studies there is a biopsy at the time of a positive test This biopsy is the gold standard for determining cancer status in subjects with positive mammograms and is used for computing TPR in a way not possible with biomarkers in nested case control studies The TPR for mammography is the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women with cancer and is estimated via mathematical models or data collected after following subjects not biopsied As discussed in Baker and Pinsky 10 estimates ranged from 74 to 1 00 with 80 a conservative value Importantly the estimated TPR for mammography is not likely to be affected by overdiagnosis which means that some screening detected cancers would never have caused medical problems during the patient s life 11 This would make the biomarker appear more promising than actually the case Results from the HIP screening trial of mammography and clinical self examination 12 suggest that if there were overdiagnosis with mammography it would be relatively small At the time of the last breast screening in the HIP trial there were more cancers in the group randomized to screening than in the controls But with further follow up the number of cancers in the control group eventually equaled the number in the screened group which would not have occurred if there were substantial overdiagnosis A second reason for using FPR and TPR from mammography is that based on various randomized trials with cancer mortality endpoint mammography is generally considered an acceptable screening modality The implication is that a similar FPR and TPR for a biomarker would lead to an acceptable screening modality For a particular biomarker these target values of FPR and TPR from mammography may need modification depending on various factors One factor is the invasiveness of a follow up procedure to investigate a positive test e g needle biopsy of the prostate to investigate an abnormal PSA versus laparotomy to investigate an abnormal CA125 The more invasive the follow up procedure the lower the FPR must be to gain acceptance in practice A second factor is additional work up prior to a biopsy If a positive biomarker is unlikely to trigger additional diagnostic work ups prior to biopsy a higher FPR might be acceptable One caveat when using FPR from mammography is to be careful as to its definition The restricted definition is the probability of a positive biopsy as a direct result of mammography in women without cancer The less restricted definition is the probability of a suspicious mammogram warranting additional diagnostic follow up of any type in women without cancer Typically nested case control studies of early detection biomarkers do not provide information on additional diagnostic follow up Therefore they cannot be used to estimate a less restricted FPR involving diagnostic follow up However because nested case control biomarker studies provide data on cancer diagnosis they can be used to estimate a more restricted FPR based on unnecessary biopsies Therefore the target FPR is based on the more restricted definition of FPR in mammography For mammography the more restricted FPR is estimated by the fraction of women screened by mammography who received a biopsy in which no cancer was detected As discussed in Baker and Pinsky 10 estimates of FPR from three studies ranged from 005 to 013 with a middle value of around 010 Inappropriateness of odds ratio and relative risk When evaluating binary early detection markers it is inappropriate to report an odds ratio or relative risk as is common in epidemiology or clinical trials Because an odds ratio or relative risk is a single number it does not capture the tradeoff between correctly classifying cancer and incorrectly classifying non cancers Also the odds ratio or relative risk can lead to an overoptimistic impression of the performance of an early detection test if the interpretation is based on experience in epidemiology or clinical trials In the latter settings an odds ratio of 3 is often considered large Much larger odds ratio are needed from early detection tests for useful application in the screening setting 13 For example for the target values of FPR 01 and TPR 80 the odds ratio equals TPR 1 FPR 1 TPR FPR 396 as in Table 1 Appropriate computation of predictive values It is sometimes useful to use the FPR and TPR to compute the predictive value negative PVN the probability of no disease if the marker is negative and the predictive value positive PVP the probability of disease if the marker is positive For cancer screening it is the PVP that is most important to the physician in clinical decision making Because the likelihood of any individual cancer type in an asymptomatic person is nearly always very low a negative early detection test usually adds little information to the clinical impression The computation of the PVN and PVP depend on the prevalence of cancer as well as on the FPR and the TPR as shown below PVP TPR prevalence TPR prevalence FPR 1 prevalence PVN 1 FPR 1 prevalence 1 TPR prevalence 1 FPR 1 prevalence When the prevalence is small as with cancer screening a small absolute change in FPR but not TPR can have a large impact on the PVP It is erroneous to directly compute the prevalence from data in the nested case control study as in Table 1 because the ratio of cases to controls in the study is not the same as in the population For example suppose FPR 01 TPR 80 and prevalence 003 We obtain PVP 8 003 8 003 01 997 19 PVN 99 997 2 003 99 997 999 If we had incorrectly substituted the apparent prevalence in Table 1of 100 1100 091 we would have incorrectly computed PVP 89 and PVN 980 For this reason calculation and reporting of PVP and PVN using only data from a nested case control study is not useful or appropriate Extension to ordered categories via ROC curves Many markers for the early detection of cancer can be reported as ordered categories Some markers such as sputum cytology inherently involve ordered categories such as no evidence of cancer slight atypia moderate atypia severe atypia and frank cancer Other markers such as PSA involve a continuous measure for which higher values indicate a greater probability of cancer Dividing these continuous measures into ranges either based on predetermined values or percentiles gives ordered categories With ordered categories the statistics should still be based on FPR and TPR Each ordered category is a possible cutpoint where values equal to or higher than the cutpoint are called positive and values lower than the cutpoint are called negative For each cutpoint one can compute FPR and TPR Table 2 and generate a receiver operating characteristic ROC curve which is a plot of TPR versus FPR for the various pairs 14 See Figure 1 The higher and farther left the points on the ROC curve the better the test performance As mentioned previously acceptable cancer screening requires very small false positive rates Therefore for evaluating cancer biomarkers we are only interested in the leftmost sliver of the ROC curve in Figure 1 2 To avoid overdiagnosis bias cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening For the TPR in the biomarker study to reflect the true TPR cases should be diagnosed as a result of symptoms rather than on screening For example in the study of PSA in the ATBC trial 7 cases were subjects diagnosed with prostate cancer as a result of symptoms If the prostate cancer cases were detected as the result of screening say with ultrasound the TPR could be artificially elevated if there were overdiagnosis as previously discussed 3 To minimized selection bias the spectrum of control conditions should be the same in study and target screening populations For the FPR in the nested case control study to reflect the true FPR in the target population the spectrum of control conditions should be the same as in the target population By control conditions we mean characteristics of the population such as the presence of other diseases or certain known risk factors that could elevate the false positive rate The spectrum of conditions could differ considerably if the retrospective biomarker study were embedded in a randomized trial with strict eligibility requirements For example consider a biomarker for the early detection of lung cancer where the data comes from a biorepository arising from a randomized trial of healthy subjects It would be inappropriate to apply the results to a population with a high prevalence of chronic obstructive lung disease bronchitis or viral pnuemonitis because these conditions could increase the number of positive readings in subjects without lung cancer Because FPR is very small for screening to be acceptable this spectrum bias could have important consequences in a clinical application It would not always be possible to identify all relevant control conditions but to the extent possible the control conditions should be similar in both populations 4 To extract additional information criteria for a positive test should be based on combinations of individual markers and changes in marker levels over time Data from multiple markers present an opportunity to extract potentially valuable information not available by analyzing markers separately Consider the hypothetical data in Table 3 The left side corresponds to subjects without cancer and the right corresponds to subjects with cancer In our idealized circumstance markers A and B are independent for subjects without cancer and are perfectly correlated for subjects with cancer The indicated region for A 2 or A 3 and B 2 or B 3 designates a positive test that has FPR 04 and the TPR 80 Suppose that marker A and marker B were evaluated separately The indicated region corresponding to A only namely A 2 or A 3 and the indicated region corresponding to B only namely B 2 and B 3 each designates a positive test that has FPR 20 and TPR 80 Thus in this particular example the combination of markers leads to a much better test than the separate markers with a smaller FPR 04 versus 20 for the same TPR of 80 One could create a similar example with any number of marker levels For an ideal test in which FPR 0 and TPR 1 the region would encompass all subjects with cancer but no subjects without cancer A real application of how marker combinations provide extra information comes from a recent study by Mok et al 15 on CA125 and Prostasin as markers for ovarian cancer Although the data are not from a nested case control study and have not been validated in subsequent studies they are useful for illustration Based on Figure 5 of Mok et al 15 with approximate values for the outpoints we investigated regions with FPR 02 The combination for a positive test of CA 125 greater than or equal to 40 U ml and Prostasin greater than or equal to 5 g ml had FPR 02 and TPR 92 Evaluating CA 125 alone the criterion for a positive test of CA 125 greater than 80 U ml had FPR 02 and TPR 78 Evaluating Prostasin alone the criterion for a positive test of Prostasin greater than 15 g ml had FPR 02 and TPR 32 Thus in this real example the combination of markers led to a better test than the separate markers with a larger TPR 92 versus 78 or 32 for the same FPR of 02 To more generally compare performance of a combination of markers with a single marker we need to compare ROC curves Creating an ROC curve from a combination of markers is different from creating an ROC curve from a single marker With a combination of markers the number of possible regions as in Table 3a for calling a marker positive is extremely large Some choices of regions correspond to AND rules for example A 1 and B 1 as in Table 3a Some choices of regions correspond to OR rules for example A 2 or B 2 Other choices are also possible but for biological reasons one would usually require all regions to be contiguous A plot of the FPR and TPR for each region would lead to a cloud of points rather than the smooth curve in Figure 1 To create the best ROC curve one should select those points that are highest and farthest to the left which is generally all that would need to be presented and only for small false positive rates For complicated situations Baker 16 proposed an algorithm to select the regions creating the best ROC curve without the need to enumerate all the regions Mathematically in any sample of data the best ROC curve for a combination of markers must be as good or better than the ROC curve for any of the markers evaluated separately The reason is that the set of possible regions for calling a combination of markers positive includes as a special case the regions for calling any single marker positive Alternative approaches that do not directly optimize the ROC curve include linear logistic regression or linear discriminant analysis 17 which choose regions based on linear combinations of the markers and neural networks 18 which choose regions in a very complicated nonlinear manner Due to the potential for overfitting to follow it is not possible to make a blanket statement as to which approach for choosing regions is best If one takes the set of regions for calling a combination positive that gives a good ROC curve in a random sample of data it may give a poor ROC curve in another random sample of the data simply due to selecting chance patterns in the first sample As discussed in the section on overfitting this motivates splitting the data into two random samples training and test and using the regions from the training sample to compute the definitive ROC curve based on data in the test sample Changes in marker values over time also provide potentially valuable information not available when examining markers at a single time point With marker measurements at two different times per subject and approximately the same interval between times a common summary measure is the slope If investigators believe that both slope and baseline level predict cancer the combination can be evaluated using the previously discussed methods for evaluating multiple markers namely treating baseline level and slope as two separate markers With measurements at more than two times per subject investigators may identify a more complicated feature such as whether or not there is a sudden increase in marker levels 19 When biomarker measurements occur at regular time intervals and allowing different numbers of measurements for each subject one can estimate TPR and FPR by using a first order Markov chain in reverse time as described by Baker and Tockman 20 for the analysis of precancerous lesions for lung cancer 5 To avoid overfitting the criteria for a positive marker combination developed in a training sample should be evaluated in a random test sample from the same study and if possible a validation sample from another study With a single marker and a large number of subjects there is usually no concern with overfitting However with many combinations of markers overfitting could invalidate results Overfitting is often associated with step wise regression models 21 but it can occur in other situations as well Overfitting of a larger number of markers to a relatively small number of subjects produces a model that is overly sensitive to chance fluctuations in the data As a simple example overfitting occurs when a sports announcer reports that a baseball player had a very high batting average against left handed pitchers in ballpark X over the past month This average is not very reliable for future predictions because the particular set of factors left handed pitchers and ballpark X were selected to give a high average In reality the high average is more likely the result of chance factors that coincided with left handed pitchers at ballpark X during that particular month One way to adjust for overfitting is to apply the factors in another sample not used for initial reporting The first sample is known as the training sample and the second sample is known as the test sample For example the prediction of the average against left handed pitchers in the ballpark X could be tested on data from a different month Similarly a standard statistical approach to adjust for overfitting is to randomly split the data into a training and test samples This is called the split sample approach Promising marker combinations are identified in the training sample but more reliable FPR and TPR measurements are made in the test sample because it involves different data Baker 16 used the split sample approach to evaluate the performance of four markers for prostate cancer More sophisticated adjustments for overfitting include cross validation and bootstrapping Suppose the interest lies in a single statistic such as the area under the part of the ROC curve corresponding to a small FPR In a typical cross validation analysis i the data are randomly split into ten samples each with 10 of the data ii one of the 10 samples is deleted iii the statistic is computed by applying the classification rule recalculated from the remaining 90 of the sample to the deleted 10 sample and iv an average is taken of the statistic over all ten 10 samples 22 Although one could use a different fraction than 10 ROC computation it is not possible with the most extreme version of cross validation that involves leaving out one subject at a time With bootstrapping i the entire data set is resampled with replacement many times ii on each resampling the statistics is computed and iii the statistics from each resampling are combined in a special way 22 In a recent study comparing these adjustments with other types of statistics in a different setting Steyerberg et al 22 found that the split sample approach tended to underestimate performance cross validation performed poorly on some statistics that were not normally distributed and bootstrapping performed best overall For our purposes of estimating an entire ROC curve rather than a summary statistic more research is needed for cross validation and bootstrapping as it is not clear how best to combine ROC curves over different samples Regardless of the method used to adjust for overfitting in forming a classification rule to obtain the most reliable FPR and TPR measurements the classification rule should ideally be evaluated in a validation sample from a different study as in Baker 16 6 To identify biomarkers with true and false positive rates similar to mammography the training test and validation samples should each include at least 110 randomly selected subjects without cancer and 70 subjects with cancer as based on FPR and TPR for mammography The sample size is based on the need to determine if the biomarker is sufficiently promising for investigation as a trigger for early intervention in a future trial As discussed previously based on considerations from mammography our target values are FPR 01 and TPR 80 In most situations we think it would be of interest to specify a 95 confidence interval for TPR of 70 90 Using a normal approximation the target standard error is approximately 05 Setting the standard error of TPR TPR 1 TPR square root of n equal to 05 and solving for the sample size n we obtain n 64 which we round up to 70 In addition we think that in most situations the largest reasonable value of FPR would be 03 which is 3 times the number of false positives as with mammography screening Because FPR is so small we do not use a normal approximation We specify a sample size of n 110 so that under the binomial distribution with FPR 01 the upper 2 5 bound equals 03 110 Strictly these sample sizes apply only after a single criterion for a positive test has been identified For a training sample one might consider larger sample sizes Conclusion A major advantage of nested case control studies for early detection biomarkers is that they can be done quickly if serum from a long term study has been stored in a biorepository Importantly the retrospective aspect does not compromise the validity There are none of the usual problems with retrospective studies such as recall bias Thus we anticipate that in the coming years there will be many reports in literature from studies of this design These guidelines should greatly help investigators design and analyze nested case control studies for early detection biomarkers and help readers of the literature to interpret them It bears emphasis that these studies do not prove clinical efficacy of the markers Rather they suggest which markers or marker combinations are the most promising candidates for further study as a trigger for early intervention
