 Raskolnikov the Handyman nbsp It turns out that the young man who looks as if he walked out of the pages of Crime and Punishment and who for some unfathomable reason possesses the only key to our new home is not American but Canadian Even better He claims that he doesn t like Americans which makes him as good as French As he opens the door I ask him if in the three years he says he s lived here he s come to know any of the French people in our building He finds the question amusing I prefer to keep to myself he explains And so do they Clearly we are the last thing he needs in his life a bunch of eager Americans trying to shoehorn information out of him about how to invent a life in Paris In any case our new neighbor Raskolnikov I ll call him is a reluctant source His long awkward silences are punctuated only by unsettling smiles and chilling anecdotes We ask him if he knows where the nearest market is he responds by asking us if we know why there is so much calcium in the Parisian water We say we didn t realize there was calcium in the Parisian water He explains that it comes from the bones of the people Napoleon dug up from the cemeteries and reburied under the city We laugh He smiles in his strange unsettling way and insists he is being serious If we want to stay in Paris we must be prepared to drink old French bones In flat tones Raskolnikov quickly explains to my wife the perils of our new home The old woman next door who leaves on her gas burners and who will one day he insists blow us all to bits is just the start of it There is also the French handyman who does the work on our side of the building French handyman strikes my American ears as oxymoronically as American intellectual probably strikes French ones But they do exist ours is named M Gautier A few months ago M Gautier installed new lights in Raskolnikov s room Not long after he d finished Raskolnikov began to receive electrical shocks while taking his bath M Gautier had grounded the wires into the tub Raskolnikov now pulls his hand from his pea coat It is one giant black bruise A heater installed by M Gautier had exploded a few nights earlier and fired a bolt like a bullet across the room and into Raskolnikov s hand I won t let Gautier into my place again says Raskolnikov If I were you I wouldn t either He ll kill you When Raskolnikov leaves Tabitha wrinkles her nose and says I don t like it when I don t know whether people are joking Discomfort Disorientation Anomie Whatever you call it that is the sensation offered to us by Paris these first few weeks Clearly we don t belong here We prove it many times each day Our simplest activities somehow become pitched battles against an entire culture Walking the streets for instance Parisian sidewalks are obstacle courses of dog shit To make the game of avoiding the dog shit really interesting the locals turn it into a competitive sport They come at you in packs and refuse to yield ground even when they clearly lack the right of way If you want to get anywhere on foot you have to at once leap over the dog shit and burst heroically through oncoming hordes of French people Red Rover Red Rover send Henri Antoine right over Here we have next to no ability to determine what is normal and what is noteworthy Take the famous storms They struck three days after we arrived without warning at least to us Around 2 in the morning our house began to shake The windows rattled madly When I got out of bed to have a look outside I found a scene from the early part of The Wizard of Oz plastic garden chairs swirling in the air huge planting pots crashing over medium size trees bent nearly in two I went back to bed assuming that it must be just a typical Parisian winter night The next morning we awakened to find huge trees in the street shattered glass on the sidewalks and cafe awnings ripped in two We stepped over all of it without giving it much thought Oh that French weather C est fou It was not until we found a row of old men peering through the bars of the Luxembourg Gardens mourning the death of their favorite old trees that we realized something was afoot The highest winds in recorded history had swept through Paris and for us it was just another night Such is the curiously disoriented mentality of the newcomer It s childhood all over again To my wife Paris is a problem to be solved She s always been one of those people who believe firmly in reading the instructions before assembly For the past two months she s been poring over one or the other of our nine books on how to get along with the French from which she passes on to me the occasional tip For a while I dismissed these with an almost Gallic aloofness Finally she became so insistent that I picked up one of the books French or Foe it was called Sure enough it was filled with advice Don t smile randomly Avoid being likable When a French person says Everyone likes him what he really means is He s a failure If you must cross your legs do it carefully as a woman does who is wearing a short skirt not sloppily like a golfer at the 19 th hole Never bring wine or flowers to a French dinner party If you do bring flowers make sure they are not yellow flowers as a yellow flower is the signal from a French guest to a French hostess that her husband is cheating on her Subtle Above all never use the toilet when you are out to dinner You might think that by now every Frenchman understands that foreigners pee when they need to and will not think them barbarians for doing so Not so apparently On and on it went The general drift of the advice was that with one exception if you wanted to get what you wanted in France you must exchange your American warmth and directness for a cool and aloof manner The exception was if you wanted to have sex They do that here too apparently A long section of the book was devoted to the sexually charged nature of French public life The author explains that you can t walk down the streets of Paris without stirring up vital juices all around you For instance all polite Frenchmen give the women they approve of what the author calls The Look The author describes The Look thusly The Look from a stranger maybe passing her on the street or in a car of an unmistakable intensity that lets her know that for that man she s got it I put down the book and tell Tabitha about The Look It probably won t come naturally to an American male but in an attempt to enter into the spirit of French daily life I will cultivate a Look of my own I will practice The Look on old French ladies who are happy to have any old look at all I say and then as I get the hang of it move gradually into the big leagues This irritates her immensely Out of that whole book she says all you came away with is The Look
