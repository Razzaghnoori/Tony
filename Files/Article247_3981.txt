                                 The Folklore of the Antiwar Movement                        Our debate reminds me of that old story about Winston Churchill or GeorgeBernard Shaw or whoever the Brit was who asks a woman if shed sleep with himfor one million pounds She is outraged How about for  pence he asksJust who do you think I am sir Weve already established that he saysNow were just haggling over price In a sense thats what were arguingover We disagree on whether the price of keeping South Vietnam out of NorthVietnams control was worth payingor even if there was a price that mighthave been politically acceptable in the United States in the early s            Let me try to make the case that the price was worth paying First look atwhat happened as a result of the American pullout Critics of US interventionhave never come to grips with this But a lot of horrible things didhappen One million boat people of whom tens of thousands died at sea Thecreation of a giant gulag in Vietnam that was euphemistically referred to asreeducation camps Ive even heard American journalists defend the camps aslegitimate educational institutions An oppressive Communist regime over all ofVietnam And the fall of Cambodia which fell all the way back to the StoneAge and Laos countries that might not have fallen if the United States hadmaintained a relatively small military force in South Vietnam and providedserious amounts of aid to nonCommunist leaders My point is that all this wasa very high price to pay though it wasnt paid by Americans            Now what was the most explosive event of the war in terms of adversereaction at home Clearly it was the incursion by American troops into Cambodiain  That led to protests all over the country including the one at KentState in which four students were shot to death by National Guardsmen But asbad as the eruption was the Nixon administration weathered it Anger didntvanish but it did die down And I think there was still plenty of room forPresident Nixon to maneuver The trouble was he and Henry Kissinger maneuveredfor the wrong thing They got a peace settlement that left some NorthVietnamese troops in South Vietnam but ultimately no American troops            I know that whatifs are pure speculation but Im not going to let thatstop me So what if Nixon had announced that he would leave a contingent ofAmerican troops in South Vietnam They wouldnt stay there in a frontlinecombat role That would be left to the South Vietnamese army much improved bythis point in the war But the US troops would be there At the very least Ibelieve their presence would have effectively deterred the North Vietnamesefrom an allout attack It was such an invasion in and not anything theViet Cong didthat caused the collapse of South Vietnam Sure there wouldhave been protests and teachins Rennie Davis and Dave Dellinger would havebeen mad But I think fury would have subsided and the new Vietnam policy couldhave been implemented successfully            OK all this is hindsight But we learn a lot from hindsight You and Iagree with Mike Linds destruction of myths about Vietnam or what he callsthe folklore of the antiwar movement One of those myths is championed byFredrik Logevall in Choosing War  Thats the idea of missedopportunities for a peace settlement before the American buildup in  AsLind points out this myth is a favorite of the left and always pops up inconnection with US relations with a Communist country Its classicantiantiCommunist But would any treaty have stopped Ho Chi Minh a convincedStalinist from pursuing his goal of capturing all of Vietnam by any meansnecessary Of course not Hed have achieved his goal a lot sooner            Jim Id recommend a different book one Ive mentioned before Its ABetter War by Lewis Sorley which explains how the war had been all butwon militarily by the end of  It hasnt gotten nearly the attention thatMike Linds book has but A Better War deserves strong consideration byanyone still interested in Vietnam Yes I was predisposed in favor of hisargument Still I think he made it especially well            As for Nixon Im not going to defend him Ive always wondered whetherabsent Watergate hed have lived up to his promise to President Thieu ofrenewed American military intervention in the case of a North Vietnameseinvasion I doubt it But as you say thats another story
