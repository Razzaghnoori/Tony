 Some Kind of Wonderful In repose Julia Roberts is plainly gorgeous but she s even more so when she fastens those huge eyes on some lucky co star She s the anti Garbo She doesn t vant to be alone For an object of beauty Roberts has an astounding amount of chemistry with other actors She managed to penetrate Rupert Everett s languid self regard in My Best Friend s Wedding 1997 and made the brilliant but remote Denzel Washington almost puppyish in The Pelican Brief 1993 In the past Hugh Grant has mainly had chemistry with Hugh Grant yet in this summer s Notting Hill he focused on something other than his own adorableness Above all Roberts warms up Richard Gere An actor known for a narcissistic blend of preening and Buddha like self containment Gere proved in Pretty Woman 1990 to be a marvel at reflecting her light like a piece of space debris that in the rays of the sun reveals jewellike facets The pair s reunion Runaway Bride is a laborious screwball romance which in its first half hour had me checking off the details it got wrong about journalism small town life and human relations Roberts plays Maggie Carpenter a hardware store clerk check and junk sculptor check with a tendency to panic and leave her grooms open mouthed at the altar Gere is Ike Graham a New York based USA Today columnist who hears about Maggie in a bar and without even a call to confirm his facts check devotes his next piece to an un PC screed on the inconstancy of all women check with this runaway bride as Exhibit A The column makes him instantly check unpopular with all those Manhattan USA Today readers check who recognize him on the street check not to mention the hordes of small town USA Today readers who wait for the paper s delivery truck as if it were the Good Humor man check After the subject of the column responds with a letter composed on a manual typewriter check disputing its facts his editor and ex wife check Rita Wilson promptly check fires him check My notebook has about 50 more checks but once the premise had been established and the leads began to interact I stopped totting up the inanities and had a good time The director Garry Marshall he did Pretty Woman too isn t especially talented at tying up loose ends or gliding over awkward inconsistencies His strength is that he loves actors he s an amusing one himself He ll drop everything for a goofy face a riff a flaky bit of business It doesn t matter that Joan Cusack as Maggie s hairdresser pal or Laurie Metcalf as a busybody baker or Hector Elizondo as Ike s ex wife s husband and also his best buddy check don t have much in the way of rounded parts They re in there improvising and having a blast Compare these larky turns to the robotic caricatures in Nora Ephron s 1998 You ve Got Mail it s the difference between a director who thinks she has it all figured out and one who says Surprise me make me laugh Maggie is a great role for Roberts who can be alternately warm and skittish promiscuous and clammy Each of her weddings Ike gets a videotape is a terrific slapstick turn Watch Roberts head swivel away from an expectant groom as if anti magnetized bearing her out of the church on its own power Gere meanwhile has become exceedingly likable Perhaps it s all the Zen meditation which has mellowed his showy Method edges His enviably thick hair has gone from salt and pepper to just salt and those tiny Slavic eyes have acquired a worldly glint Alternately mocking Maggie and enjoying her hugely he s like a happy laid back stalker In the event I ever teach a filmmaking class I m going to have a special unit on The Work of Hugh Hudson What Not To Do The riotously inept Revolution 1985 will be the ur text but I might find a place for the genteel My Life So Far It s not that it s bad it s that on a dramatic level it barely exists I ve never read the source text a memoir by Sir Denis Forman about his affluent Scottish childhood but another Forman book A Night at the Opera is one of my bibles a cheeky guide to the genre by a former deputy chairman of London s Royal Opera House This movie is supposed to be about the way the arrival of his uncle s dishy young French wife Ir ne Jacob throws the estate into a libidinous chaos but Hudson s camera is always in the right place to catch the rolling hills and splendid staircases and in the wrong place to catch the actors expressions The loss is especially vexing since the actors Colin Firth Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Rosemary Harris Malcolm McDowell might be giving fine performances and Robbie Norman as the boy might be extraordinary The script might even be good We ll just never know
