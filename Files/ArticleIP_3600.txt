 A Bridge to the World I met Alfred Kazin because of I B Singer It was 1991 and I d been working at the Forward for less than a year when Singer the Nobel Prize winning master of Yiddish fiction died The next day the phone rang This is Alfred Kazin I d like to write something about Singer If Singer himself had been on the line I could hardly have been more surprised or more delighted Both men to my mind inhabited a peak of the literary Olympus but I had not understood how connected Singer s Yiddish speaking world was to Kazin s mandarin American literary milieu Of course the evidence was everywhere In A Walker in the City his first and best volume of autobiography Kazin describes his first walk across the Brooklyn Bridge when he was 14 years old He d become separated from classmates who were headed to City Hall but he decided to continue across the bridge alone In rhapsodic language reminiscent of Henry Roth Kazin takes in all the crackling sounds and sights of the emerging city the trolleys and the crush of people and the dark roofs of Manhattan Only the electric sign of the Jewish Daily Forward burning high over the tenements of the East Side he writes suddenly stilled the riot in my heart Whether that sign stilled his heart with calming thoughts of home where the Forward was read in Yiddish by his house painter father and dressmaker mother or whether it momentarily halted the reach of his escaping imagination is not explained For Kazin both were no doubt true for he was able to express multiple selves simultaneously He once told me that he had considered calling his final and fourth volume of autobiography published in 1996 simply Jews He opted instead for A Lifetime Burning in Every Moment a line taken from T S Eliot s Four Quartets Jews he decided would be too much But it isn t as if he chose the lines of the anti Semite at the expense of his own American impulse toward ethnic self assertion He had after all called his third memoir New York Jew When I suggested that what he was really doing was Judaizing Eliot making him serve as an epigraph to Kazin s American Jewish life hungry odyssey he laughed approvingly Yes he said I like that In 1942 at the age of only 27 Kazin had published On Native Grounds The grandeur of the title and the immodesty of the subtitle An Interpretation of Modern American Prose Literature mark it as the sort of book only a grateful child of immigrants could write Who else would tune his ear so finely for traces of an emerging national consciousness while teasing out the finer points of its economic social and moral awareness His open armed embrace of American literature his magisterial we in speaking about literary matters in this country had the assertiveness of the newly enfranchised Once after I got to know him better he told me that his daughter Kate had moved to Israel and I jokingly observed that she was really on native ground Kazin was not amused He had labored too long to make America his own to feel it pulled out from under him even in jest He never denied the Jewish piece of his identity It s just that America was where he felt it was possible to express all the pieces of himself at once Kazin was different from many first generation intellectuals who sailed into American high culture and sent for their past only long after they had established themselves like immigrants bringing over the rest of the family Kazin brought everything with him at once The story Kazin wound up telling in the Forward about Singer recounted the Yiddish writer s desire to see the grave of Edmund Wilson Singer was Kazin recalled fascinated to learn that Wilson that patrician WASP man of letters had chosen a Hebrew inscription for his headstone Kazin was clearly delighted with this confluence of elements Wilson translating himself into Hebrew Singer translating himself into English and Kazin himself telling the story presiding over both knitting together the two disparate elements that fueled his own unique style No wonder Kazin was drawn to the bridge in A Walker in the City Brownsville the neighborhood in Brooklyn where he came from had one foot in eastern Europe and one in the New World Kazin himself had one foot in Brownsville and one foot in the highbrow literary world of Manhattan Critics such as Kazin and writers such as Saul Bellow born the same year as Kazin stretched out their intellect and imagination across disparate worlds and helped a generation of book hungry immigrant offspring walk into American cultural life Kazin was a bridge for me as well It was his introductions to Henry Roth to D H Lawrence to Henry James that helped me feel at home with great modernist writers Kazin wrote about American literature in particular as if he had discovered it himself He imparted to everything he wrote that same feeling of magical discovery he describes experiencing when he walked as a young man out of immigrant Brooklyn into sophisticated Manhattan One day this past winter my wife and I went to a party in Westchester also attended by Kazin and his wife Judith My wife and I had taken the train and the Kazins offered us a ride back to the city but only if I drove His wife told me they didn t mind risking their own lives in the dark but that younger people were another matter Needless to say I was terrified creeping along the Saw Mill Parkway as if all of Western literature were in the back seat Kazin s conversational style now closely resembled a memoir in progress he chatted casually about Harry Levin the great Joyce scholar at Harvard and about critic Clifton Fadiman s TV appearances and about Singer whom he had recently written about for the New York Review of Books We came to the West Side Highway There in the distance was the George Washington Bridge lit up in the darkness This was the same approach to Manhattan I suddenly realized that I had known when I was a teen ager making the drive to New York from the Westchester suburb where I grew up Though I d had a very different childhood from Kazin and approached Manhattan from a direction completely different from Kazin s Brownsville I remembered vividly the sense of possibility the drive suggested And I understood that it was partly because of Alfred Kazin that New York seemed a place of the imagination a place where life opened up My heart filled with gratitude Here was Kazin 50 years older than I but still traveling happily toward New York still talking about books and people with passion and devotion and still holding out the promise of a New World
