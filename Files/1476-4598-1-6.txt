 Background Mitochondria participate in numerous functions in the cell In addition to producing energy mitochondria are involved in intermediary metabolism ion homeostasis synthesis of lipids amino acids and nucleotides active transport processes cell motility and cell proliferation 1 2 3 4 Recent developments also demonstrate that mitochondria are key regulators of programmed cell death 4 Mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most profound features of cancer cells Several distinct differences between the mitochondria of normal cells and cancer cells have been observed at the microscopic molecular biochemical metabolic and genetic levels 5 Microscopic study of oncocytic tumors revealed mitochondrial hyperplasia 6 and differential expression of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase II in benign and malignant breast tissues has also been reported 7 Furthermore mutations in mitochondrial DNA mtDNA are commonly found in a variety of cancers including the ovarian thyroid salivary kidney liver lung colon gastric brain bladder head and neck leukemia and breast cancers 8 Mitochondrial DNA encodes two rRNA 22 tRNA and 13 proteins 2 Each of the polypeptides form subunits of four respiratory enzyme complexes localized to the inner mitochondrial membrane 2 These subunits include seven subunits of respiratory enzyme complex I one subunit of complex III three subunits of complex IV and two subunits of complex V 2 All other mitochondrial proteins including those involved in the replication transcription and translation of mtDNA are encoded by nuclear genes and are targeted to the mitochondrion by a specific transport system 2 Although the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes are physically distinct there is constant communication between the two genomes to carry out many of the mitochondrial functions For example in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae RTGproteins monitor the functional state of mitochondria and mediate the intergenomic communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus In this organism RTG regulates transcription of numerous genes involved in several pathways that help cells adapt to mitochondrial dysfunction 9 In addition yeast cells shift their metabolic profile by altering expression of a number of genes that respond to depletion of the mitochondrial genome 9 As in the case of yeast the depletion of mitochondrial DNA from human cell lines leading to the generation of cell lines devoid of mtDNA denoted Rho 0 provides an opportunity to study nuclear responses to impairment of mitochondrial function In the present study we isolated a Rho 0derivative of a breast cancer cell line Our results demonstrate that Rho 0derivative experience increased oxidative stress and has impaired mitochondrial function Using cDNA microarray we compared differences in the nuclear gene expression profile between parental Rho breast cancer cell line and its Rho 0derivative Our study suggests a variety of structural genes as well as genes involved in cellular signaling and transcriptional regulation are differentially regulated in Rho 0breast cancer cells Methods Reagents The plasmid containing the mitochondrial DNA specific

for a twenty of the differentially expressed genes and for G3PDH a housekeeper gene Twenty five microlitres of the PCR reactions contained 20 mM Tris HCL pH 8 4 50 mM KCl 1 5 mM MgCl 2 200 M dNTP and 10 picomoles of each primer and one unit of Taq DNA polymerase Invitrogen Each gene was amplified by PCR using various cycle numbers ranging from 30 to 55 cycles to ascertain its linear amplification In general the PCR profile consisted of an initial denaturation at 94 C for 5 minutes and a variable number of cycles of denaturation at 94 C for 45 sec annealing at 58 C for 1 min and extension for 2 min at 72 C with a final extension at 72 C for 10 min To aid comparison five microliters of the PCR products of the differentially regulated genes were mixed with an equal amount of the housekeeper gene products and electrophoresed on a 1 agarose gel and visualized after staining with ethidium bromide 0 5 g ml under ultra violet Results Generation of Rho 0breast cancer cell line The rarity of recombination in the replication of mtDNA is prohibitive to the possibility of selectively inactivating mtDNA encoded genes by homologous recombination 12 However by culturing cells in the presence of low concentrations of ethidium bromide it is possible to preferentially inhibit the replication of mtDNA generating a cell line that are devoid of the mitochondrial genome 13 These cells denoted Rho 0 have altered metabolic requirements due to the loss of components of the electron transport chain and require both uridine and pyruvate for growth 13 Cells with this engineered mitochondrial dysfunction require exogenous uridine because a functional electron transport chain is needed for pyrimidine biosynthesis 13 We generated a mtDNA depleted variant of the breast cancer cell line MDA MB 435 by culturing cells with EtBr 50 ng ml for approximately 90 cell generations then isolating clones by limiting dilution Total DNA from this Rho 0clone clone 7 was digested with PvuII which cuts at a single site in mtDNA Southern blotting and hybridization with a mtDNA specific probe showed the presence of a 16 6 kb band in the MDA MB 435 Rho cell line The 16 6 kb fragment was absent in the Rho 0cell line Figure 1A 1B To further verify loss of mtDNA encoded protein the expression of mtDNA encoded cytochrome oxidase II COX II was assessed by western blotting Expression is not observed in Rho 0cell lysates as compared to the parental cells Figure 2Aand 2B To assess the growth characteristics of the Rho 0clone cell growth was measured in glucose and galactose media Cells with dysfunctional mitochondria are unable to efficiently utilize galactose as a primary carbon source for energy production 14 Following an initial growth lag parental MDA MB 435 cells grown in galactose medium proliferated at a rate comparable to the rate observed in glucose Figure 3A However Rho 0cells were unable to grow in galactose media indicating an impairment of mitochondrial function Figure 3B These results demonstrated that we had isolated Rho 0breast cells that do not express protein encoded by mtDNA and which lack proper mitochondrial function Increased lipid peroxidation in Rho 0cells Mitochondria are the major site of reactive oxygen ROS production 1 2 OS cause oxidative damage It is conceivable that altered mitochondrial function in Rho 0leads to increased oxidative stress We therefore measured lipid peroxidation in parental and Rho 0breast cancer cells Malondialdehyde a product of the catabolism of peroxidized lipids forms a pigmented reaction product with thiobarbituric acid that can be measured spectrophotometrically 10 11 Levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species were measured in extracts of parental Rho and Rho 0cells to determine if altered mitochondrial function results in lipid peroxidation Figure 4shows that thiobarbituric acid reactive species were increased in Rho 0cells solid bar compared to the Rho parental cells open bar We conclude that an increase in lipid peroxidation is associated with the impairment of mitochondrial function Microarray analysis Nuclear and mitochondrial genomes interact at least in two possible ways First they contribute essential protein subunits to important mitochondrial function second they collaborate in the synthesis of and assembly of mitochondrial proteins 14 To identify genes that respond to lack of mtDNA encoded genes we compared the mRNA level between the Rho 0cell line and parental Rho cell line by cDNA microarray analysis We analyzed 8000 genes present in the array The microarray analysis revealed that 35 genes were significantly up regulated and 22 genes were down regulated in Rho 0cells Table 1and 2 The differentially expressed genes were classified into various classes including transcription factors and architectural proteins Table 1and 2 Eight genes were selected randomly to confirm the microarray results by RT PCR The messages for each particular gene needed different cycle numbers to assess the exponential amplification accurately indicating the relative abundance of the individual messages The RT PCR results confirmed differential expression of the genes indicated by the microarray results Figure 5 Tables 1and 2 RT PCR results show Figure 5 that p19 cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and v maf were maximally up regulated followed by phospholipase C epsilon a gene involved in signalling by increasing the intracellular levels of calcium ions Among the down regulated genes phospholipase A2 was maximally down regulated followed by progesterone induced blocking factor 1 PIBF1 a protein that acts on the phospholipase A2 enzyme and interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism These results suggest that impairment of mitochondrial function leads to altered expression of nuclear genes involved in communication between mitochondria and nucleus Discussion This paper reports on a comprehensive analysis of the nuclear gene expression in response to the absence of mtDNA in breast cancer cells We demonstrate that expression of a number of nuclear genes is altered in response to the absence of mtDNA in breast cancer cells These genes ranged from transcription factors to genes that are involved in metabolism cell architecture and signaling Our results are consistent with previous studies in yeast and mammalian cells that reported altered pattern of nuclear gene expression due to elimination of mtDNA 15 16 17 We conducted comparative microarray analysis on Rho MDA 435 cell line and its Rho 0derivative Rho 0cells have been used extensively to study the role of mitochondria in a variety of cellular processes that are affected by mitochondrial dysfunction 16 17 18 Our results showed that 35 genes are up regulated 3 fold and 22 are down regulated 3 fold in Rho 0breast cancer cells We chose 10 genes randomly to confirm the results of microarray analysis with RT PCR Figure 5 Among genes that are up regulated in Rho 0cells p19 INK4d a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor is focally expressed during fetal development and plays a role in terminal differentiation 19 Members of the group of INK proteins are involved in arresting cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle Conceivably p19 may be involved in the observed slow growth rate of the Rho 0 A number of genes that influence gene transcription are differentially expressed after mitochondrial impairment The Maf oncoprotein a basic leucine zipper bearing transcriptional activator that recognizes the Maf recognition element MARE DNA sequence 20 is noticeably up regulated in the Rho 0cell line c MAF is highly expressed in developing skeletal tissues cells where mitochondria play a central role in their functioning 20 21 The transcription factors TFIIH and AML1 were also up regulated in the Rho 0cell lines TFIIH is associated with the RNA polymerase II transcription complex which is involved in transcription and transcription mediated DNA repair 22 The transcription factor AML1 is frequently found translocated in leukemic cells 23 Conceivably altered expression of these transcriptional regulators in response to mitochondrial impairment could directly or indirectly lead to the changes in expression of other genes seen in Rho 0cells Phosphoinositide specific phospholipase C PLC was among the signaling molecules that were up regulated in the Rho 0cell line PLC is a critical signaling enzyme that hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids to generate inositol trisphosphate IP 3 which binds to IP 3 receptors and increases intracellular Ca 2 24 The isoform of PLC is a novel effector of ras 25 26 Another signaling molecule of significance that is up regulated in the Rho 0cells is the Slit Drosophila homolog 3 Three vertebrate orthologs of the fly slit gene Slit1 2 and 3 have been isolated Each displays overlapping but distinct patterns of expression in the developing vertebrate central nervous system implying conservation of function 27 Slit3 gene product is the least evolutionarily conserved of the vertebrate Slit genes The fact that Slit3 but not Slit2 is predominantly localized within the mitochondria makes its up regulation in the Rho 0cells an intriguing phenomenon 28 One feature of the Rho 0cell line is the differential expression of certain genes that are involved directly or indirectly in metabolism of fatty acids or signaling Figure 5and Table 1and 2 Among those that are up regulated are apolipoprotein D ApoD and arylacetamide deacetylase While ApoD may have a similar function as the other apoproteins it does not share a similar protein structure to the other family members and does not bind cholesterol with high affinity 29 Hence it may have a unique effect via binding of different ligands ApoD may be involved in the binding of steroids or fatty acids Apo D interacts with Ob Rb but not Ob Ra in hypothalamic neurons in vivo 29 In the central nervous system it was found that Apo D may be activated through its interaction with a leptin stimulated Ob Rb and may bind a specific ligand in hypothalamic neurons where it exerts signaling functions 30 Arylacetamide deacetylase may also function as a lipase during the process of lipoprotein secretion 31 32 Other genes involved in fatty acid signaling were down regulated in Rho 0cells These include phospholipase A2 a protein closely involved with arachidonic acid metabolism and also involved with cell signaling 33 34 35 that was found to be maximally down regulated in Rho 0cells Phospholipase A2 also plays a role in the translocation of PKC mediated by fatty acids Another gene with functions closely related to the arachidonic acid metabolism that is down regulated in the Rho 0cells is the progesterone induced blocking factor 1 PIBF1 PIBF1 is known to act on the phospholipase A2 enzyme and so interferes with arachidonic acid metabolism inducing a Th2 biased immune response 36 PIBF1 exerts an anti abortive effect by controlling NK activity 37 A gene related to lipid signaling that encodes agouti related protein was also down regulated in the Rho 0cells Agouti is a paracrine signaling factor that acts to block melanocortin action 38 39 Disruption of melanocortin signaling with antagonist administration leads to an increase in feeding and eventually to obesity Such blockage has been observed in both lipopolysaccharide induced animals and also during illness 40 The data exhibiting down regulation of the agouti gene is further strengthened by the down regulation of the LPS reponse 68 protein in the Rho 0cells The ATP synthase 5A1 subunit gene that is directly involved in mitochondrial function was up regulated in the Rho 0cell lines ATP synthase is a multimeric complex composed of at least 16 different polypeptides two of which are mitochondrially encoded and the remainder encoded by nuclear genes 2 Certain leukemic cells show an increased production of the ATP5A1 subunit 41 Interestingly a down regulated gene CYP7B1 encoding an oxysterol 7 alpha hydroxylase Cytochrome P450 subfamily VII BI is involved in many metabolic processes including bile acid synthesis and neurosteroid metabolism 42 Mitochondria control Ca homeostasis 2 Protein kinase C neurotensin receptor and neuromodulin GAP 43 are among the genes that are involved in calmodulin regulation or related to calmodulin function 43 44 45 which are down regulated in Rho 0cells Neuromodulin is also a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C 46 which may reflect an influence of mitochondrial function on multiple members of a signal transduction pathway Another interesting feature in the expression profile of cells lacking mtDNA is the low expression of many genes that play a role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system 47 48 Of particular interest is the gene that encodes neurotensin receptor I a short peptide receptor for neurotensin that exerts neuromodulatory functions in the central nervous system and endocrine paracrine actions in the periphery 49 Neuromodulin is also involved in the growth and regeneration of axons and in the elongation of axons as an axonal transport membrane protein 45 Synuclein is expressed in the nervous tissues and mutations in this gene are associated with rare familial cases of early onset Parkinson s disease 50 Gamma synuclein is also involved in tumorigenesis 42 PKC g mutation has been shown to lead to neurodegeneration 51 Dachshund a putative transcription factor plays a role in retinal development 52 Huntingtin interacting protein 2 is involved in the neurodegenerative Huntington disease 53 In summary our data provides an overview of the genes that are involved in the nuclear and mitochondrial cross talk and respond to oxidative stress manifested due to impaired mitochondrial function The identification of a large number of genes whose expression is influenced by mitochondrial function provides a foundation for future investigation of the pathways affected by the impairment of mitochondria in pathological conditions An understanding about the role of the proteins in the maintenance of proper mitochondrial function and in oxidative stress response is critical for understanding the role of mitochondria in carcinogenesis Authors contributions RD isolated and analyzed the Rho 0derivative of breast cancer cell line RD SK and AR
