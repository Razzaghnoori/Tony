        so you dont oh uh random drug testing is kind of tough because it it involves this kind of uh trading off of of our individual civil rights for some kind of concept of uh furthering a common good almost       you know there theres a theres a theres a trade off of our civil rights against i guess our employers right to to having a good job or something   uh i dont dont really see the employers as having a whole lot to do with it ive already it the um privilege of being a victim of random drug testing i spent four years in the Marine Corps and had to pee in a bottle on command   umhum   and it was really a really aggravating and time wasting thing to do um the thing that i really hated most about it was the total waste behind it all they would get maybe between fifty and two hundred and fifty of us together and it would you know wed lose the whole morning what is that thats a thousand man hours uh to go go through this and in the end they would just be shooting for trying to catch a few specific people it really aggravated me i wasnt happy with it at all in fact after i got out i made the decision that i would not work for a company that did that um it just doesnt seem right that a company would do something like that i can appreciate um concern over somebody being under the influence while theyre at work but they could easily be under the influence of alcohol or any number of other things as well   yeah uh well thats thats a good point the only uh the only thing i really disagree with is and and this isnt this isnt exactly disagreement with im not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people but i would think that it also acts as a deterrent if someone if someone knows that theres a threat that that they might get caught it might be that much more of an impetus to to stay away from from whatever the drug is theyre theyre on   now thats implying that um as a punitive kind of a thing as well you definitely want to discourage that is that kind of what youre saying   well i mean i would think that uh if someone knows that theres theres an even greater chance that theyre theyre going to get caught um having drugs that that that that would act to discourage them that it would um you know if you know dads in the other room perhaps youre going to be less likely to steal the the cookies out of the cookie jar because he might be coming in any minute you know   yeah well i guess thats a good policy then if uh youre definitely for eradicating drugs from society im not so certain that thats a a worthwhile goal right now it looks like theres a lot of problems with um you know keeping drugs illegal things that are really scary a lot of people are dying and theres a lot of bloodshed and that that disturbs me i live downtown and uh man   umhum   right diagonal across from campus is uh Teakwood Homes its the oldest housing project in the country Roosevelt opened it and man theres shootings in there nightly and if it wasnt for the uh you know the the high profit margin i dont think it would be going on i dont think that uh wed have the crime over there that we do and man it really spills over into the neighborhood here as well theres at least one nasty bloody violent crime per year um over here where one of the students is a victim   well the the uh the mayor of Baltimore is a Rhodes Scholar and i i forget his name but one thing that he suggested doing was taking the money taking all the money that he gets for uh uh fighting the war on drugs and use it for like drug education to to open up the methadone programs to get the people off drugs that that wanna be off drugs um   uhhuh   in thinking that that its were not doing a good job at fighting the war you know in in trying to crack down on people that are using drugs maybe legalizing them and and trying to help those that you know having the resources there to help someone um would be a better idea but and and i agreed with him somewhat i could see his point but uh Switzerland opened up a um uh a park   is that the park yeah   and and for years it just kept getting worse more and more people kept coming to the park and it just kept getting worse and worse and worse until finally the Swiss have they decided to close it down   yeah i just saw that in the news here recently   so uh i dont know it mean it sounds like it sounds like there arent going to that there isnt a perfect solution   yeah it really is a dirty mess very difficult to come to conclusions i guess one uh one other data point is the old um prohibition here in the US the consequences of that and its ultimate uh repealment   thats a good point thats a good point and although although alcohol consumption did jump right after prohibition it did come back down   yeah and its funny how today in movies and all we really glorify those gangsters and that lifestyle its kind of spooky   yes we do we do   i guess i guess even today in todays movies a lot
