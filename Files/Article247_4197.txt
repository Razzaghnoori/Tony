 Boys on Film Dear all Roger I grew up in Chicago where I read and watched you with admiration and your remarks yesterday on reviewing etiquette gave both my admiration and some dormant Chicago chauvinism a shot in the arm I doubt too many critics in New York squawk and swap their opinions during or even right after a screening But I bet that too few them demonstrate the consideration for their readers that you do or your habitual fairness Elvis you raised two really important points yesterday The dearth of relationship films this year may just be a cyclical thing I suspect Beautifully acted but formulaic films like Walk on the Moon suggest we could use a fallow period a year or two to regroup and think up fresh stories about attraction and trust The dearth of decent roles for black actors goes deeper and is much more frustrating I ll try to see The Green Mile tonight so I can join in on the debate But I have to confess I ve stayed away so far on purpose The preview was a turnoff and not just because of the innocent giant in cuffs For me the red alert was the sight of Tom Hanks gulping and tearing up Hanks is a supremely effective actor I admit but there are times these days when I can barely stomach him Wherever he goes a treacly white guy triumphalism seems to follow He doesn t even have to be on screen for this to happen Did you all see the film he directed a few years back That Thing You Do The main character is a teen age drummer in a band that hits it big in the early 60s Hanks clearly identifies with the kid and the weirdly anti dramatic thing is this Nothing bad happens to him in the film Everything he touches turns into diamonds he gets to steal his best friend s girlfriend but retain the moral upper hand everyone even strangers watches out for his happiness As long as I live I won t forget the ending where a black bellhop with flashing eyes and a big smile and an inappropriately loud excitable voice takes it upon himself to fix up this kid s love life Jeepers what a cringer The film is set in 63 I guess before the civil rights movement kicked into really high gear and underneath the liberal veneer of many a Hanks film I sense some creepy nostalgia for this simpler time Hanks is a bugaboo for me sorry if I got off track Anyway the point I d like to make to Roger is that objecting to objectified characters is not a matter of p c of holding things up to a rigid ideological test This is a moral problem and an aesthetic problem and as I said above at times for me it is a visceral problem of not wanting to sit still for more of the old false humility routine In this regard I appreciate your praise of Three Kings Elvis Yet I actually wanted much more screen time for Ice Cube Even by the abstract and deconstructive standards of the film he felt underdeveloped to me undermotivated complicated though he was he remained a sidekick his decisions less closely examined and symbolically freighted and intensely presented than those of Clooney or Wahlberg One last semi related thought Again please don t take this in the spirit of reductive p c I don t mean it that way But don t believe the hype about men being on the ropes culturally speaking I couldn t help noticing the unabashedly male viewpoint of many of the year s most interesting films With the exception of Run Lola Run Election with its coolly neutral dissecting point of view and Boys Don t Cry which had the fascinating point of view of some androgyne god I noticed a whole lot of guyness in this year s movies I found it a little disappointing that something as humane and innovative as The Iron Giant couldn t put a tiny bit more meat or sass or something into Jennifer Aniston s part The fearless Cameron Diaz turned the role of Lottie in Being John Malkovich into a miracle but its conception and that of Catherine Keener the emasculator was based on a tried and true and rather juvenile male fantasy or so my sources tell me Toy Story 2 Woody Need I say more There are so many more examples highlight Sean Penn finding peaceful rewarding love with a deaf mute but I ll leave you to chew it over This is fun Till soon Sarah
