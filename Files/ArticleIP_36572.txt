 Is the Holocaust Literary SUBJECT G nter Grass Political Art RE FROM Trevor Butterworth DATE Fri Oct 8 Though the critic Adorno admonished that poetry was impossible in the wake of Auschwitz in a different context he also argued that art was more effectively political the less overt its politics pace Brecht Now given the emotional and critical persuasiveness of both positions the question of how one might produce art adequate to the Holocaust is fraught with incommensurability How can art be both authentically free and at the same time totalize the experience of genocide And so Grass like Michel Tournier in The Ogre and D M Thomas in The White Hotel charts an oblique course as far as historical engagement is concerned though Thomas cuts loose in his shocking denouement If this is as far as Grass is concerned a moral failure of literary process then Ms Shulevitz and a notably resentful Jacob Heilbrunn in the Wall Street Journal need to make sense of their criticism by showing how art can measure the Holocaust and still be art and not history or politics or philosophy To reply click here SUBJECT Shulevitz s Political Criticism RE FROM Roy Edroso DATE Fri Oct 8 The Politicization of Nearly Everything Literary Division proceeds apace First the right wingers attack the Nobel committee for giving the Lit Prize to a commie all the while admitting that he might in fact be a good writer presumably they ll get around to reading him sometime if they can ever get through that big fat Tom Wolfe book What s art after all compared to conservative correctness Then Ms Shulevitz gets on Grass for presuming to use an artistic technique specifically irony in the context of the Holocaust for what is art compared to a Holocaust Shulevitz doubts Grass saved German literature I say anyone who writes a masterpiece does a service to literature just as anyone who tries to make a work of art grist for their political mill does it a disservice To reply click here SUBJECT Nixon the Jews and Vietnam RE FROM John Taylor DATE Thu Oct 7 I m the director of the Nixon Library and thus the promulgator of the analysis of the tape opening that Timothy Noah quotes Here s what I noticed about the NY Times article It neglected to mention a principal source of RN s frustration about the Jewish community which is plenty clear in our analysis and the tapes themselves Many of the same folks who wanted the U S to support Israel against her aggressive foreign enemies did not particularly want the U S to support South Vietnam against hers Do you or do you not believe this is a legitimate reason for a commander in chief in the middle of a war he inherited to be frustrated particularly when he was still signing 30 40 letters a week to the families of KIA Add that to the fact that he d gotten about 20 of the Jewish vote in 68 and what you have is a politician and a President who basically viewed the Jewish community as predominantly liberal Democratic and anti war He didn t just think they were against him they were against him And that s fine Blocs of ethnic or religious voters are frequently against certain politicians and maybe all those politicians get frustrated about it That s fine too except when it s captured on tape But here s the bottom line Words are words and actions are actions When RN says Jews on the tapes I hear damn liberals and I understand it This is why the points that he saved Israel in 1973 and that his inner circle included Kissinger Stein Safire and Garment are more than aspects of a some of my best friends defense These colleagues were politically simpatico And this was a politician It s not complicated Also find the tape in the new batch where he talks about how impressed he was after a meeting with Arlen Specter then I believe a tough young prosecutor from Pennsylvania Anyway back to the NYT omission In a whole article about RN and Jews why leave out the bit about Vietnam and Israel Doesn t he have the right to have the most immediate source of his frustration even mentioned Does the NYT want people to think these feelings sprang from him totally unprovoked Here s what I think We re all still tiptoeing around the Vietnam War We post Vietnam elites all tend to think that Ellsberg was a great hero and that the war was immoral We all tend to think that it was okay to be for Israelis freedom from aggression but to be indifferent toward that of South Vietnamese And so we still scapegoat RN for all the sins of the era to avoid having to ask tough questions about what really happened to Indochina and to America when Hanoi and the Khmer Rouge were permitted to have their way with people whom we d pledged to protect and almost succeeded in protecting Check out Lewis Sorley s new book about Vietnam for instance Read more about the book in this Revisionism about the war is inevitable revisionism about the toughest and best Vietnam commander in chief will come next And the tapes won t stop it More likely the tapes will fuel it Maybe it s a good thing he didn t burn them after all To reply click here SUBJECT In Defense of the Torah Codes RE FROM Michael Drosnin DATE Fri Oct 8 Your article that posted late yesterday about the Bible code would not have been published if your reporter or your editors had taken the time to check out the facts As author of The Bible Code I ve spent the past seven years checking out all the claims and counter claims Here are two basic facts your article ignores a The data for the original Bible code experiment were chosen by an independent scholar Dr Shlomo Havlin of Bar Ilan University who did not know how the data would affect the outcome of the experiment That alone absolutely refutes the new accusation that the data were tuned or fitted to the tests b The original Bible code experiment was replicated by an American codebreaker Harold Gans for more than 25 years a senior National Security Agency crypto analyst He not only re did the experiment from scratch but also confirmed the code using entirely new data That alone absolutely refutes the new claim that the results of the Israeli experiment can t be replicated I understand your reporter s false relief in not having to believe in the Bible code any longer I m also secular But this new attack by the same old critics does not let Wittes off the hook He in fact has done what he accuses those who believe in the code of doing he has taken on faith the false claims of the critics Had he actually checked the facts he would know the critics have not solved the Bible code puzzle they told a lie They knew that the esteemed scholar who chose the data had stated in writing that he did not know how the data would affect the experiment They knew that the NSA codebreaker had publicly confirmed that he replicated the experiment These critics even lied about the results of their own experiments which did not debunk the Bible code In fact the critics first experiment confirmed the Bible code So they ran a second experiment rigged to fail and then hid the positive results of their first experiment by lumping them together with the fixed experiment All of us who are not religious think we know that the Bible code simply cannot be real When I first heard about it that was my entire reply I m not religious But then I learned Hebrew obtained a copy of the computer program used by the world class mathematician who discovered the code and worked with it myself every day for years And then I found in the code a warning that Yitzhak Rabin would be assassinated and told the Prime Minister a year before he was killed I still don t believe in God I m still not religious But I can assure you that the code is real Your reporter perhaps too quickly too easily embraced the Bible code and has now like many a disappointed convert too quickly too easily embraced the critics I m surprised that you and your editors have followed him without even trying to check out the facts To reply click here SUBJECT Re In Defense of the Torah Codes RE FROM Benjamin Wittes DATE Fri Oct 8 Both Professor Havlin s role in assembling the data for the rabbi s experiment and Mr Gans work on the codes are discussed at length in the rebuttal paper In fact the central point of that paper as I noted in the article is that the criteria Prof Havlin applied in creating his list of appellations was insufficiently well defined before the dataset was assembled to be scientifically valuable Far from ignoring this I described it as the core of the critique While my article does not discuss Mr Gans experiments that is chiefly because they were never published in a prestigious peer reviewed journal to begin with The fair minded reader will agree that the McKay paper devastates the Gans experiments completely It is also false to say that I ever embraced the Bible Code or am now a disappointed convert Rather I always believed and still do that the codes would if demonstrated to be real propel a scientifically minded person towards Orthodox Judaism I have at the same time also always believed they would ultimately be debunked Hence they did not change my religious convictions at all though they shook them Consider by contrast Drosnin whose work constitutes the least scientific and most intellectually shallow end of the Torah codes discussion He regards the codes as a proven fact yet somehow still professes non belief How is it possible that such a future predicting code embedded in such an impenetrable form in an ancient document could be the work of something less than God How can one believe in the codes and not in God It is not McKay and his co authors who told a lie That dishonor rather belongs to Drosnin himself for publishing a work that grossly transcends even the now discredited science on which it was purportedly based To reply click here SUBJECT The Math of God RE FROM M Didaktikos DATE Fri Oct 8 Faith means that you don t have to have proofs of the existence of God oh ye of little faith Anyone whose faith depends upon mathematical letter sequencing in War and Peace or any other inspired writing is grasping at straws To reply click here SUBJECT Re The Math of God RE FROM Reader DATE Fri Oct 8 Benjamin Wittes says that the loss of the Torah codes is a relief But would it not be sensational to find proof by way of the rational mind for a God with continuing interest in our well being To reply click here
