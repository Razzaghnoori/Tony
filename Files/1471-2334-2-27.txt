 Background Several anionic polymers were shown to have HIV 1 inhibitory activity and are being considered and evaluated as vaginal topical microbicides for prevention of transmission of sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens including HIV 1 These polymers belong to several classes 1 sulfate esters of polysaccharides dextrin and dextran sulfates 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 cellulose sulfate 12 13 14 15 sulfate esters of galactose 3 6 anhydrogalactose copolymers carrageenan 1 16 17 18 19 2 polymers containing sulfonated benzene or naphthalene rings poly styrene 4 sulfonate 20 21 and naphthalene sulfonate polymers PRO2000 22 23 24 and 3 polycarboxylates acrylic acid polymers Carbomer 974P BufferGel 25 26 27 28 29 and acetyl phthaloyl cellulose cellulose acetate phthalate CAP 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 The mechanisms involved in sexual transmission of HIV 1 appear to be complex and are not yet fully defined 38 39 Thus a microbicide with HIV 1 inhibitory activity could provide protection in vivo only if both the compound and the virus reach susceptible cells before productive infection could occur This might be difficult to accomplish For this reason it is preferable that microbicides irreversibly inactivate the virus upon the first compound HIV 1 encounter in the vaginal environment i e microbicides should have direct virucidal activity Such activity was reported for dextran sulfate after 2 h incubation with HIV 1 2 but results of other studies indicated that dextran sulfate failed to neutralize virus infectivity 4 10 Inactivation of HIV 1 by carrageenan was reported in a review article 18 BufferGel is virucidal against HIV 1 by providing a buffered low pH environment pH 3 9 25 but virus inactivation might be incomplete and possibly compromised by minor pH increases due to the presence of seminal fluid 40 To be effective in preventing infection by direct virus inactivation anti HIV 1 microbicides must be virucidal against both X4 and R5 viruses utilizing CXCR4 and CCR5 as coreceptors 39 41 respectively R5 HIV 1 being most frequently sexually transmitted Recent results 36 37 R Shattock personal communication indicate that CAP in soluble form meets these requirements Since CAP unlike the other polymers listed above is not soluble at low pH characteristic for a normal vaginal environment 42 micronized forms of CAP had to be used in microbicidal formulations of this compound 30 31 32 33 34 Therefore it was of interest to determine how CAP in micronized form and other candidate polymeric microbicides affect X4 and R5 viruses represented by HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively Methods Reagents Aquateric the micronized form of CAP containing 66 CAP and 34 of Poloxamer and distilled acetylated monoglycerides was obtained from the

The Galacto Light Plus chemiluminescence reporter assay for galactosidase was from Applied Biosystems Foster City CA Citrate phosphate buffers in the pH range of 2 9 5 0 were prepared as described 47 Enzyme linked immunosorbent assays ELISA The sandwich ELISA for gp41 six helix bundles was performed as described 37 45 HIV 1 IIIB and BaL virus preparations respectively treated with distinct anionic polymers were precipitated with 3 polyethylene glycol 6000 PEG in order to separate virus particles from excess compounds The pellets were dissolved in lysis buffer 1 Nonidet P40 NP40 100 g ml bovine serum albumin BSA in phosphate buffered saline PBS incubated for 30 min at 20 C and then added to wells coated with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to the gp41 core Control virus was treated similarly The lysis buffer was used as a safety precaution to minimize work with potentially infectious virus Similar results were obtained when PBS was used for resuspension of virus particles instead of lysis buffer After incubation at 4 C overnight the bound six helix bundles were detected by adding mAb NC 1 1 g ml in PBS 1 BSA 1 gelatin 100 l well for 1 h at 37 C Subsequently the wells were washed three times with PBS 0 05 Tween 20 and biotin labeled anti mouse IgG 100 l well 125 ng ml diluted in PBS containing 1 dry fat free milk was added After incubation for 1 h at 37 C the wells were washed and HRP streptavidin 125 ng ml in PBS containing 10 goat serum 100 l well was added After incubation for 1 h at 37 C the wells were washed six times with PBS 0 05 Tween 20 Bound HRP was detected using the test kit from Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories following the manufacturer s protocol and the absorbance was read at 450 nm Recombinant gp120 HIV 1 IIIB in the presence of a 10 fold excess of BSA and gelatin respectively was quantitated by adding the gp120 BSA gelatin mixtures before and after binding to micronized CAP or Aquateric Fig 1 at serial 5 fold dilutions 2 fold to 3 9 10 6 fold in 0 14 M NaCl 0 01 M Tris TS to 96 well polystyrene plates Immulon II Dynatech Laboratories Inc Chantilly VA After overnight incubation at 4 C the wells were washed and rabbit anti gp120 diluted 1 1 000 in 20 goat serum 0 05 Tween 20 in PBS pH 7 4 was added After 2 h at 37 C the wells were washed and HRP labeled goat anti rabbit IgG diluted in 1 BSA 0 25 gelatin 0 05 Tween 20 in PBS pH 7 4 250 ng well was added After 2 h at 37 C bound HRP was detected using the kit from Kirkegaard Perry Laboratories The quantity of gp120 not adsorbed to CAP Aquateric was determined from calibration curves relating absorbance readings to the concentration of gp120 not exposed to CAP Aquateric The envelope glycoprotein gp120 released from HIV 1 BaL was quantitated as follows Wells of polystyrene plates were first coated with protein A G 1 g well in 0 1 M Tris buffer pH 8 8 for 2 h at 20 C followed by polyclonal rabbit anti gp120 diluted 500 fold for 1 h at 20 C Serial 2 fold dilutions in PBS containing 1 BSA and 1 gelatin PBS BG of preparations containing gp120 were added to the wells After 4 h at 20 C the wells were washed and bound gp120 was detected by addition of biotinyl sCD4 1 g followed by HRP streptavidin Bound HRP was quantitated as described above The experiments were done in triplicate Measurements of HIV 1 infectivity Two fold serial dilutions of HIV 1 IIIB treated with distinct anionic polymers and separated from these polymers by precipitation with 3 PEG or by centrifugation at 14 000 rpm for 1 h and control virus 100 l respectively were added to HeLa CD4 LTR gal cells which had been plated a day before infection in 96 well plates at 1 10 4cells well in 100 l of DMEM medium containing 10 fetal bovine serum FBS In some experiments anti HIV 1 tat IgG 25 g was added to treated and control virus to suppress the effect of extracellular tat which may have been present in the virus preparations on virus infection 48 49 After incubation at 37 C for 48 h the culture supernatant fluids were removed and the cells washed once with PBS Subsequently 50 l of lysis buffer from the Galacto Light Plus kit were added to the wells for 1 h at 20 C Aliquots 20 l of the cell lysates were transferred into wells of 96 well microplates and galactosidase was quantitated using the Galacto Light Plus System chemiluminescence reporter assay in a Microlight ML 2250 luminometer Dynatech Laboratories Inc Chantilly VA The infectivity of treated and control HIV 1 BaL was measured by the same method except that MAGI CCR5 cells were used Measurement of HIV 1 infectivity in seminal fluid is impeded by the cytotoxicity of seminal plasma 50 51 contributed to by spermine 52 Such effects were minimized by using for titrations of virus infectivity pellets after precipitation with 3 PEG or after centrifugation 14 000 rpm for 1 h Results Micronized CAP induces gp41 six helix bundle formation and is virucidal against HIV 1 Earlier studies 36 37 indicated that soluble CAP at neutral pH binds to the CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptor binding sites on HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively and induced the formation of dead end gp41 six helix bundles These two properties of soluble CAP appear to be involved in the virus inhibitory and virucidal activities of this compound However CAP is not soluble at pH 5 5 and would precipitate in a healthy human vaginal environment which is mildly acidic with a pH range of 3 5 4 5 53 The precipitate would have drastically reduced antiviral activity To overcome this problem CAP in a micronized form was used and proven to have virucidal activity against HIV 1 IIIB 31 and shown to be effective in reducing vaginal infection by simian immunodeficiency virus SIV in a macaque model 34 Micronized CAP provides a low pH buffering system and this may have contributed to its virucidal properties In order to correlate the properties of CAP in soluble and micronized forms it was necessary to establish whether or not micronized CAP would bind HIV 1 virus particles and HIV 1 envelope glycoproteins and induce the formation of gp41 six helix bundles a marker of irreversible virus inactivation as did soluble CAP 37 First it was established that HIV 1 gp120 bound to micronized CAP provided in the form of micronized CAP particles or of a commercial product Aquateric containing about 66 of CAP and used for enteric coating of tablets and capsules in the pharmaceutical industry 54 Fig 1 Similar results were obtained when gp120 was diluted in seminal fluid diluted 1 1 with 0 14 M NaCl Under these conditions 99 9997 of gp120 bound to micronized CAP and Aquateric final concentration of CAP 121 5 mg ml respectively HIV 1 IIIB and BaL virus particles also bound effectively in the presence of seminal fluid to Aquateric formulated into a topical gel Fig 2 As a result of interaction with micronized CAP in the form of Aquateric the integrity of both HIV 1 IIIB and HIV 1 BaL virus particles was strikingly affected as indicated by the observation that most of the p24 antigen after virus contact with micronized CAP was no longer precipitable by 3 polyethylene glycol 6000 PEG unlike p24 antigen within untreated virus particles which precipitates under these conditions Fig 3 Furthermore interaction with micronized CAP elicited the formation of gp41 six helix bundles which were undetectable or present at low levels in untreated virus particles 37 The six helix bundles detectable by ELISA were mostly not precipitable by 3 PEG indicating that they were no longer associated with virus particles Fig 3 Furthermore they were detected partially HIV 1 IIIB or entirely HIV 1 BaL in a form not bound anymore to the micronized CAP particles unlike most of the virus derived p24 antigen This suggests that interaction of virus particles with micronized CAP resulted in stripping off of the viral envelopes which was more noticeable with HIV 1 BaL than with HIV 1 IIIB To confirm that gp41 six helix bundle formation was caused by contact of virus particles with the micronized form of CAP Aquateric and not by low pH contributed by CAP purified HIV 1 III B and BaL respectively was exposed for 5 min at 37 C to acidic buffers final pH 2 9 3 5 4 0 4 5 and 5 0 The suspensions were neutralized and assayed by ELISA for six helix bundles The results were negative absorbance in the 0 to 0 068 range the same as for viruses exposed to pH 7 0 in the absence of CAP Poloxamer a constituent of Aquateric 33 at a final concentration of 30 mg ml also did not induce the formation of six helix bundles Results shown above indicated that HIV 1 adsorbed onto micronized CAP and that the CAP virus interaction lead to the formation of gp41 six helix bundles a hallmark for HIV 1 inactivation 37 To confirm that contact of virus with micronized CAP leads to loss of HIV 1 infectivity HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively were diluted in seminal fluid and the diluted virus preparations were mixed with an Aquateric formulation for composition see legend to Fig 2 at volume ratios of 3 1 1 1 and 1 3 for 5 min at 37 C Subsequently the micronized Aquateric particles were sedimented by centrifugation The supernatant fluids were brought to pH 7 0 and the pellets were dissolved by addition of Na 3 PO 4 final pH 7 0 All fractions were then precipitated by 3 PEG and the redissolved pellets tested at 2 to 256 fold dilutions for infectivity see Methods section Infectious virus was undetectable 99 6 and 99 2 inactivation of HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively Similar results were obtained with other CAP formulations data not shown Induction of six helix bundle formation by polymeric anionic candidate microbicides Since elicitation of gp41 six helix bundles might be involved in or contribute to the virucidal activity of candidate microbicides it was of interest to determine whether anionic polymers other than CAP also induced six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 IIIB and BaL virus particles Results in Fig 4show that carrageenan cellulose sulfate dextran sulfate poly napthalene sulfonate and poly styrene 4 sulfonate all elicit gp41 six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 IIIB but somewhat less effectively in comparison with CAP On the other hand Carbomer 974P the active ingredient in BufferGel was inactive in this respect Strikingly different results were obtained for HIV 1 BaL Fig 5 and show that only CAP and to a lesser extent poly napthalene sulfonate elicited gp41 six helix bundles detectable by ELISA Effect of anionic polymeric microbicide candidates on the integrity of HIV 1 particles Since micronized CAP caused the dissociation of HIV 1 particles 31 Fig 3 it was of interest to determine whether anionic polymeric candidate microbicides in soluble form at neutral pH would have similar effects While no such effects were seen with HIV 1 IIIB the integrity of HIV 1 BaL appeared to be partially diminished by treatment with CAP and drastically affected by cellulose sulfate Fig 6 The latter finding was confirmed by the observation that HIV 1 BaL gp120 was no longer precipitable by 3 PEG or pellettable by centrifugation after treatment of the virus with cellulose sulfate unlike gp120 associated with untreated virus particles Fig 7 This was not seen with cellulose sulfate treated HIV 1 IIIB data not shown Comparative virucidal activity of polymeric anionic microbicide candidates HIV 1 IIIB and BaL respectively were treated with the distinct polymers 10 mg ml for 5 min at 37 C and the infectivity of the treated viruses was compared with that of control untreated HIV 1 In repeated experiments with HIV 1 IIIB soluble and micronized CAP cellulose sulfate poly naphthalene sulfonate poly styrene 4 sulfonate and BufferGel respectively caused a 140 fold reduction in infectivity while dextran sulfate carrageenan and Carbomer 974P pH 7 respectively were less effective 4 to 25 fold reduction in infectivity A typical example for HIV 1 IIIB is shown in Fig 8 Representative results shown in Fig 9indicate that the polymers differed from each other more substantially with respect to their capacity to inactivate HIV 1 BaL micronized CAP cellulose sulfate BufferGel and the aryl sulfonates being most effective Inhibitory effect of polymeric anionic microbicide candidates on blood clotting For the selection of the most promising candidate microbicides it is important to compare not only their virus inhibitory and virucidal activities but to also study their potential untoward effects Since heparin and other anionic polymers are known to inhibit blood clotting 55 the effect of anionic polymeric microbicide candidates on blood clotting was measured While CAP carrageenan and BufferGel Carbomer 974P had moderate or no effects cellulose sulfate dextran sulfate poly napthalene sulfonate and poly styrene 4 sulfonate greatly inhibited clotting of ACD plasma Fig 10 The increase in clotting time might be potentially undesirable for topical applications under conditions of local preexisting injury or bleeding Discussion Several anionic polymers are being considered as topical microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV 1 They include 1 sulfate esters of polysaccharides carrageenan 1 16 17 18 19 cellulose sulfate 12 13 14 15 and dextran or dextrin sulfate 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 2 aryl sulfonates poly naphthalene sulfonate 22 23 24 and poly styrene 4 sulfonate 20 21 and 3 aliphatic Carbomer 974P BufferGel 25 26 27 28 29 and aromatic carboxylates CAP 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 The anti HIV 1 properties of these polymers are expected to depend on their complexation with virus proteins which is likely to occur mainly through the formation of salt linkages or ion pairs between oppositely charged groups on the polymers and virus proteins respectively 56 However the anti HIV 1 properties of these polymers may depend not only on their charge density but also on the characteristics of their uncharged portions which may be involved in hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interactions which can elicit profound conformational changes in hydrophobic regions of proteins and cause disassembly of complex proteins consisting of subunits 57 For these reasons it is not be expected that all anionic polymers considered as anti HIV 1 microbicides would have similar biological activities In vivo protection by anti HIV 1 compounds against sexual transmission of the virus could only be accomplished if the compounds at sufficient concentrations and the virus both reach susceptible cells within genital mucosa before productive infection could occur 38 39 Considering the complex events involved in sexual transmission of HIV 1 this might not be easily accomplished Therefore inactivation of HIV 1 infectivity preceding virus contact with susceptible target cells should be considered a preferred mechanism of protection against infection For this reason it was of interest to study the virucidal activity of anionic polymeric microbicide candidates against both X4 using CXCR4 as coreceptor and R5 using CCR5 as coreceptor viruses the latter being most frequently transmitted sexually 39 Soluble CAP at neutral pH was shown to bind strongly to the coreceptor binding sites on gp120 of both X4 and R5 viruses 36 and to elicit the formation of gp41 six helix bundles the hallmark of irreversible virus inactivation 37 Thus HIV 1 exposed to CAP at sufficient concentrations is rendered noninfectious and continued presence of CAP is not required to maintain lack of infectivity CAP differs from all other anionic polymers listed above in that it is not soluble at pH 5 5 Therefore CAP would be expected to precipitate in a normal acidic vaginal environment To avoid this CAP in micronized form which does not aggregate at low pH instead of CAP in soluble form is being considered as a topical microbicide 30 31 32 33 34 35 Micronized CAP Aquateric was shown to be virucidal against HIV 1 herpesviruses and several nonviral sexually transmitted disease STD pathogens 30 31 32 33 34 The virucidal activity of micronized CAP could at least partly be explained by its buffering capacity at low pH 40 since it is a free acid while other anionic polymeric microbicide candidates except BufferGel the active ingredient of which is Carbomer 974P 27 are sodium salts Results presented here explain how micronized CAP inactivates HIV 1 Both the envelope glycoprotein gp120 Fig 1 and HIV 1 IIIB and BaL virus particles Fig 2 in the presence of an excess of nonviral proteins including seminal fluid bind effectively to micronized CAP Under in vivo conditions when the virus concentrations are by one to four orders of magnitude lower than those used here under experimental conditions 58 59 Fig 2 this would be expected to physically remove virus particles by adsorption onto micronized CAP Aquateric so that they would cease to be available to initiate the complex sequence of events leading to mucosal infection Furthermore interaction with micronized CAP elicits the formation of gp41 six helix bundles and causes the stripping off of HIV 1 envelope glycoproteins Fig 3 The formation of gp41 six helix bundles was not due to exposure to a low pH environment provided by the micronized CAP since exposure to low pH buffers did not elicit gp41 six helix bundle formation In summary the contact of HIV 1 IIIB and HIV 1 BaL representatives of X4 and R5 viruses respectively with micronized CAP resulted in a complex sequence of events involving virus adsorption exposure to low pH induction of gp41 six helix bundles and stripping off of viral envelopes and virus disintegration ultimately resulting in loss of infectivity In order to contribute to the understanding of the potential virucidal activity of anionic polymers their capacity to induce gp41 six helix bundle formation was measured and compared with that of CAP in soluble form pH 7 0 All polymers except Carbomer 974P elicited gp41 six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 IIIB albeit in some cases less efficiently in comparison with CAP Fig 4 On the other hand gp41 six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 BaL was detectable only for CAP and poly naphthalene sulfonate treated virus Fig 5 suggesting differences among the anionic polymers with respect to their activity against the R5 virus HIV 1 BaL The induction of six helix bundles in HIV 1 does not seem to be the only mechanism involved in virucidal activity of anionic polymers compare Fig 5with Figs 8and 9 and there might be other contributing processes Since CAP in micronized form was shown to cause disintegration of HIV 1 virus particles 31 Fig 3 it was of interest to determine whether any of the other anionic polymeric microbicide candidates affect the integrity of virus particles While HIV 1 IIIB was not affected significantly by any of the polymers tested CAP to some extent but surprisingly cellulose sulfate affected the integrity of HIV 1 BaL particles Fig 6 These results were supported by the observation that HIV 1 BaL gp120 after treatment with cellulose sulfate unlike virus associated gp120 did not become precipitated with 3 PEG and failed to pellet by centrifugation under conditions leading to sedimentation of intact virus particles Fig 7 The differential sensitivity of an R5 virus HIV 1 BaL as compared to an R4 virus HIV 1 IIIB to the same negatively charged polyelectrolyte appears unprecedented to the best of our knowledge Among the three polysaccharide sulfate esters carrageenan cellulose sulfate and dextran sulfate cellulose sulfate appeared to be more effective against HIV 1 BaL than the other polymers This might be due to the polysaccharide backbone of cellulose 60 with a propensity to form strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds and to be involved in hydrophobic interactions more than soluble dextrans 61 and galactose 3 6 anhydrogalactose copolymers the saccharide moiety of carrageenan 62 63 Among the two polymers containing aryl sulfonates poly napthalene sulfonate was more effective than poly styrene 4 sulfonate with respect to induction of gp41 six helix bundles in HIV 1 BaL This difference may possibly be due to the high propensity of the uncharged part of the molecule poly naphtalene to be involved in hydrophobic interactions Among the two carboxylate polymers Carbomer 974P and CAP only soluble CAP at neutral pH was able to elicit the formation of gp41 six helix bundles in both HIV 1 IIIB and BaL and was virucidal against both of these viruses The insoluble micronized form of CAP had similar properties The differences in biological activities of these polymers is probably due to their noncharged portions i e mainly the occurrence of benzene rings in CAP Polycarboxylates soluble CAP and Carbomer 974P Fig 10 had a minimal effect on plasma coagulation Among the sulfonates and polysaccharide sulfates carrageenan and poly napthalene sulfonate had lower anti coagulant activity in comparison with cellulose sulfate dextran sulfate and poly styrene 4 sulfonate Fig 10 Consideration of these side effects might contribute to the process of selection of preferred microbicides for future large scale use Conclusions Among anionic polymers considered as topical microbicides to prevent sexual transmission of HIV 1 Carbomer 974P BufferGel carrageenan CAP cellulose sulfate dextran dextrin sulfate poly napthalene sulfonate and poly styrene 4 sulfonate CAP formulated in a micronized form is the only compound which has a capacity to remove from physiological fluids infectious virus by adsorption onto the micronized particles The interaction between HIV 1 IIIB a representative of X4 viruses and HIV 1 BaL a representative of R5 viruses with the micronized form of CAP has the following consequences 1 elicitation of dead end gp41 six helix bundles expected to render the virus incompetent to fuse with target cells 2 loss of virus integrity and stripping off of the envelope glycoproteins and 3 inactivation of virus infectivity Elicitation of gp41 six helix bundles and virucidal activity represent shared properties between micronized and soluble at sufficient concentrations forms of CAP 37 As determined by ELISA the aforementioned polymers other than CAP except Carbomer 974P also elicited gp41 six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 IIIB albeit less effectively than CAP On the other hand only poly napthalene sulfonate in addition to CAP elicited detectable six helix bundle formation in HIV 1 BaL This suggests that X4 and R5 viruses may be differently affected by some of the polymeric compounds being considered as topical microbicides This was confirmed by the results of assays for virucidal activity Abbreviations used ACD acid citrate dextrose CAP cellulose acetate phthalate BSA
