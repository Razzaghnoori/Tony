 all right um i think the topic was crime in the city right i do not live in a city i live in a real small little place where is that uh it s about thirty miles from Sherman north south east or west it s north of Sherman well you live almost in Oklahoma uh it not too far yeah that s kind of ironic because i don t live too far from Oklahoma either huh you know where Saint Joe is uh i ve been through there i m about eight miles south of it okay oh yeah i had been through Saint Joe but um just as far as you know watching the news and reading the papers and all that it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad well you know i ve i ve seen those statistics and everything and you know what frightens me is that you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert um hum with high tech weaponry you know i mean the Iraqis didn t have a lot of high tech weaponry but they had mortars and machine guns tanks and all that oh yeah sure and they didn t kill as many people in in forty five days and they were intending to kill people i mean that was their job uh huh as they killed in Washington DC oh i know i know i know um people i think nowadays people just really just murder is nothing to them you know well i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years i guess and i ve come to the conclusion and this is a pretty scary thought to me even that if a guy is convicted or a gal is convicted of a crime rather than put them in prison because prison s proven not to work just let them go say okay you re convicted uh huh and just let them go yeah and if they get convicted again well just kill them um hum yeah because uh most likely that will happen won t it that you know well i think that the best hope to eliminate crime as we know it today um hum is to eliminate the criminals from society uh huh if someone is known to have been in prison they can t get a job no you know they can t be accepted into society yeah you know if they re not going to be accepted into society then everybody s going to become sociopathic um hum and you know who s to put the limit on it i mean i was watching a thing last night up in Washington State if you get convicted of uh sexual offenses on a regular basis i mean some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions uh huh and they re still let out on the street after one or two years well in Washington State if you re a habitual sexual offender they just don t let you out hum uh you serve your prison term and then you go into the mental hospital and if you re pronounced cured they ll let you go uh huh well they may find a cure for it but there is no known cure now hum so you re you re kind of thinking in other words if you get if you do something the first time that s not real bad you know hey people make mistakes yeah to go ahead and let them go but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then uh well yeah use that or you know there s other consequences rather than killing them you know you could always make them the slave of the people they committed the crime against oh um hum um hum you know at least they might be some benefit in that and if the people they committed a crime against yeah feel at some later date that these people have learned their lesson are are okay you know well they can free them uh huh but uh you know with the technology technology we have today you can put a collar on a guys leg that will knock him down if they leave the property i mean it will just in incapacitate them uh huh and you can put a collar around a guys leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of you know prohibitive act uh huh but you know putting them in prison my God that doesn t work no apparently not because look how many years they ve been doing that and look i mean yeah well you look at places like Turkey Turkey has death penalty for just about everything um hum uh huh i mean if you get convicted of uh you know drug trafficking they just kill you you get convicted of uh you know uh heinous crimes they just kill you i mean there s no two ways about it uh huh and uh you look at their society and the repeat offenders are very few you know and you look at our society almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison has been in prison three or four times three or four times yeah right i mean you know that is true i know you know the way to stop that kind of behavior is this two fold one you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven i i think that s very important oh i m i agree very much so on that i yeah and then if a parent has proved to be unfit for any reason um hum take t he kids away from the parents yeah because you know we are what we teach um hum because that s what our society becomes i mean we have a just a bunch of people comes yeah and i ve and i ve i ve lived in that that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work you know and these guys they come to work every morning and they re stoned to the bone i mean their so high they could fly up to the top of that building and they work all day and they go home and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs and when they run out of money they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money and then they go back to work on Monday um hum and the kids of these people sure they just think that s the normal thing to do don t they are phenomenally they re sociopathic yeah yeah and i worked in a first grade uh classroom for one full semester um hum and these kids were more foul mouthed than i ve ever been i had one kid threaten my life first grader in the first grade threaten my life told me that daddy s going to whoop me to death oh no you know and they flipping me the finger and all that um hum and i just said to this kid i said you got two choices kid you can step into mainstream society or you can die uh huh because you will eventually be killed and you know i just i m just totally aghast aghast at a what s going on oh i know i know um i work in school you know that s huh uh something i do and i it really is i m like you astonishing what the younger ages know and they react to what they see at home You know if they see violence at home that s what you re going to get from the kids at school you know it really is exactly and that s kind of sad well you can see it in the work place you know used to be when you had a personality conflict you just you worked with it and you got through it uh huh now you know people get fired or what s even worse is they promote them into a position that they can t handle and let them get fired yeah or one thing or the other you look at another kind of society like the Japanese you put that many people on that small of a space they ve learned to live together okay it s in their culture um hum and one of the things that s in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to is the fact that while Japan was becoming a great power financially the people that worked for those companies worked for the same company they worked for at sixty five as they did when they were eighteen teen and the company took it upon itself to find a position for these people if they weren t fit for the job they were hired for they didn t just can them they made a position for them some where huh uh huh uh you look at uh Frito Lay my wife used to work for Frito Lay as a typist you know transcribing stuff into the computer uh huh well she can type about one hundred and five words per minute but she don t like it she she just doesn t like to do that i mean she will cause yeah but you know her preference is to be in an office situation where her job is
