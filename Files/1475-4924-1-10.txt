 Background The hedgehog hh gene was identified two decades ago in Drosophila as a critical regulator of cell fate determination during embryogenesis 1 Subsequent work in several model systems has defined and characterized the Hh gene family that encodes highly conserved secreted signaling proteins for review see 2 Hedgehog Hh proteins are synthesized as approximately 45 kDa precursors that autoprocess in an unprecedented fashion resulting in the covalent attachment of a cholesterol moiety to the amino terminal half of the precursor 2 This processed amino terminal domain Hh Np is responsible for the activation of a unique and complex signaling cascade that is essential for controlling cell fate throughout development and into adulthood 2 In mammals there are three Hh family proteins Sonic Shh Indian Ihh and Desert Dhh Gene targeting experiments in mice have demonstrated that the development and patterning of essentially every major organ requires input from the Hh pathway 2 In vitro culture systems of neuronal tissues have been used to characterize the biology of the Hh signaling pathway Most notably the neural plate explant assay has defined the concentration dependent role that ventrally expressed Shh plays in opposing dorsally expressed bone morphogenetic proteins BMPs to pattern the neural tube 2 The assay demonstrates that the Hh signaling cascade can distinguish between small concentration differences in the Hh ligand to instruct the differentiation of specific neuronal cell types Additional insights have been gained by utilizing cultures of postnatal cerebellar neuron precursors 2 These studies have shown that Hh patterns the cerebellum by promoting proliferation of the granule neuron precursors Given the role that Hh signaling plays in promoting progenitor cell proliferation it is not surprising that misregulation of Hh signaling has been implicated in the biology of certain cancers in particular basal cell carcinoma BCC and medulloblastoma The Hh signaling pathway comprises three main components the Hh ligand a transmembrane receptor circuit composed of the negative regulator Patched Ptc plus an activator Smoothened Smo and finally a cytoplasmic complex that regulates the Cubitus interruptus Ci or Gli family of transcriptional effectors Additional pathway components are thought to modulate the activity or subcellular distribution of these molecules 2 There is positive and negative feedback at the transcriptional level as the Gli1 and Ptc1 genes are direct transcriptional targets of activation of the pathway Smo is a seven pass transmembrane protein with homology to G protein coupled receptors GPCRs while Ptc is a twelve pass transmembrane protein that resembles a channel or transporter Consistent with its role as an essential pathway inhibitor removal of Ptc renders the Hh pathway constitutively on independent of the Hh ligand Similarly specific point mutations in the transmembrane helices of Smo are capable of constitutively stimulating the pathway effectively bypassing Ptc inhibition 3 At present a controversy surrounds the mechanism by which Ptc inhibits Smo Although early studies suggested a simple direct stoichiometric regulation more recent data support a more complicated indirect or catalytic model 2 And although it has been demonstrated that Hh directly interacts with 4 and destabilizes 5 Ptc the downstream molecular events remain obscure In particular little is known about the means by which Ptc exerts its inhibitory effect on Smo or how Smo communicates with the cytoplasmic Ci Gli transcription factor complex Through a chemical genetic approach of identifying and studying the mechanism of action of small molecule agonists and antagonists we hoped to uncover some of the complexities of the Hh signaling system Small molecule modulators of growth factor pathways have proven valuable in providing enhanced understanding of the intracellular events that occur subsequent to receptor activation and in establishing the biological functions of these pathways 6 7 8 In Hh signaling multiple insights have been gained through the use of the plant derived Hh antagonist cyclopamine 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 and a recently identified synthetic small molecule Hh signaling inhibitor Cur61414 17 Interestingly these specific inhibitors of Hh signaling appear to function downstream of Ptc but their precise molecular target s and mechanism of action are unknown Although genetic manipulations involving gain of function point mutations of Smo 3 have demonstrated that the pathway can be activated independently of Hh ligand no small molecules with this capability have been identified Indeed it has proven difficult to identify small molecule agonists of any signaling pathway activated by a protein ligand Two examples have recently been described however One involved identification of a non peptide activator of the granulocyte colony stimulating factor GCSF pathway that appeared to act via receptor oligomerization 18 Another report described a small molecule activator of the insulin signaling pathway that also acts at the level of the receptor 19 Since the Hh receptor Ptc serves to inhibit signaling a small molecule pathway activator would need to be capable of one of the following first interfering with the inhibitory effect that Ptc exerts on Smo second activating Smo without affecting Ptc or third activating the pathway downstream of Smo Identifying small molecules with any of these activities would provide useful information concerning the details of Hh signaling and would also provide a simple means of modulating activity of the pathway in vivo or in vitro In this article we show that a non peptidyl small molecule agonist of Hh signaling has been identified that has all the known signaling properties of the recombinant Hh protein But this agonist unlike Hh protein appears to bypass the Ptc regulatory step by interacting directly with Smo Furthermore studies with the agonist and several antagonists of Hh signaling suggest that Smo can be activated or inhibited by direct interaction with small molecule ligands These observations suggest that the Ptc Smo receptor circuit may incorporate native small molecule ligands in the regulation of Hh signaling Results Isolation of Hh agonists by high throughput screening To identify small molecule agonists of Hh signaling we established a mammalian cell based assay After testing several cell lines for Hh dependent induction of the target genes Ptc1 and Gli1 2 we identified C3H10T1 2 and TM3 cells as optimal responders We then introduced into each line a plasmid containing a luciferase reporter downstream of multimerized Gli binding sites and a minimal promoter 20 An isolated stable clone of the 10T1 2 cell transfectants referred to as clone S12 gave a 10 20 fold up regulation of luciferase activity Figure 1a when stimulated with Hh protein 21 for 24 hours Using this assay system we screened 140 000 synthetic compounds at a concentrations of 2 5 M and isolated several putative agonists One of these molecules Hh Ag 1 1 Figure 1a b was studied further Hh Ag 1 1 exhibited half maximal stimulation EC 50 at around 3 M and an activation maximum A max of approximately 35 compared to the Hh protein control Figure 1a In the presence of sub threshold signaling levels of Hh protein 0 3 nM the EC 50 of Hh Ag 1 1 was reduced to around 0 4 M and the A max approached 70 Figure 1a We next tested whether expression of endogenous Hh responsive genes was stimulated by the agonist Using quantitative PCR Hh Ag 1 1 was shown clearly to elevate the expression of Gli1 and Ptc1 in a dose dependent manner Figure 1c Chemical modifications increase potency In an effort to improve the potency of Hh Ag 1 1 over 300 derivatives were synthesized and tested in the cell based reporter assay The relative potencies of the most active derivatives 1 2 1 3 1 4 and 1 5 are shown in Figure 1d The most potent Hh Ag 1 5 had an EC 50 of approximately 1 nM Thus potency was increased over 1000 fold by chemical modification The structures of compounds 1 2 and 1 3 are shown in Figure 1e Hh Ag 1 2 was the most stable derivative in vivo and in vitro data not shown and was used for most cell based assays Hh Ag 1 3 showed lower toxicity in embryonic tissue cultures data not shown and was used for the neural plate explant assays described below These experiments suggest that the agonist may have many of the properties of the Hh ligand To specifically test this we used two established in vitro assay systems that detect the effects of Hh on primary neuronal precursors In vitroassay of neuronal precursors Proliferation activity of the agonist It has recently been shown that primary neonatal cerebellar granule neuron CGN precursors proliferate in response to Hh stimulation 2 To determine whether the Hh agonist could elicit this response we monitored 3H thymidine incorporation of cultured rat CGN precursors treated with Hh protein Hh Ag 1 1 Hh Ag 1 2 or vehicle DMSO The original active molecule Hh Ag 1 1 stimulated thymidine incorporation at 5 M but not at 1 75 M Figure 1f The extent of proliferation was around 50 of that seen with a high dose of Hh protein 50 nM Hh Ag 1 2 stimulated proliferation at 300 nM and 100 nM to levels comparable to those seen with Hh protein Figure 1f These data demonstrate that the agonists can elicit a biological response in primary cells similar to that produced by Hh protein Morphogenic activity of the agonist Neural progenitors within the intermediate region of the chick neural plate Figure 2a respond to increasing concentrations of Hh protein by adopting specific fates The identity of these cells can be assessed by their distinct expression patterns of a set of transcription factors 2 Three of these transcription factors Pax7 MNR2 and Nkx2 2 whose expression is differentially sensitive to increasing concentrations of Hh protein were assayed in response to varying concentrations of the agonist Hh Ag 1 3 The dorsal spinal cord marker Pax7 is normally repressed by low concentrations of Hh 22 Pax7 expression was extinguished by 1 10 nM agonist Figure 2b c d e f Higher concentrations of agonist 10 200 nM induced expression of the motor neuron progenitor marker MNR2 Figure 2b g h i j and yet higher concentrations 20 nM 1 M induced the most ventral interneuron progenitor marker Nkx2 2 Figure 2b k l m n This dose dependent profile of expression closely resembles the response achieved by increasing concentrations of Hh protein 22 23 24 demonstrating that the Hh agonist mimics the concentration dependent inductive activity of Hh on neural precursors Activity of the agonist in vivo Agonist site of action in vivo Having established an in utero assay for Hh signaling we next investigated whether the agonist could rescue aspects of Shh or Smo mutant phenotypes by monitoring lacZ expression in Smo Ptc1 lacZ embryos 26 and Ptc1 mRNA levels in Shh embryos Pregnant mice from Shh and Smo intercrosses were treated by oral gavage with vehicle or agonist 15 mg kg at 6 5 and 7 5 dpc Embryos were collected at 6 8 somite stages E8 5 when the midline defects are first detectable in both Shh and Smo embryos but prior to any general retardation of growth and development 26 27 In both Shh and Smo Ptc1 lacZ embryos Ptc1 was detected in ventral neural tube somites and lateral plate mesoderm Figure 3e i m Treatment with the agonist dramatically enhanced and expanded the expression of Ptc1 in these heterozygous embryos Figure 3f j n This was consistent with what we have observed in wild type embryos Figure 3a b c d It is worth noting that the agonist treated embryos exhibited overgrowth of the headfolds and hindbrain reminiscent of Ptc1 embryos compare Figure 3e mwith 3f n Shh and Smo embryos at this stage 6 8 somites started to show fused ventral lips of the cephalic folds and a single continuous optic vesicle indicating lack of a clearly defined midline red arrow Figure 3g and data not shown As expected Ptc1 expression was not detected in the ventral neural tube of the vehicle treated Shh embryos arrowhead Figure 3g whereas expression was seen in lateral plate mesoderm and weakly in somites Figure 3g k This is most likely due to Ihh signaling in these tissues 26 Both Shh and Ihh signaling were dependent on Smo however because Ptc1 expression could not be detected in Smo embryos Figure 3o Following agonist treatment we observed that the neural tube and somite expression of Ptc1 in Shh embryos was greater than vehicle treated wild type levels compare Figure 3h lwith 3e i The midline defects in Shh embryos were at least partly rescued by agonist treatment compare Figure 3gand 3h red arrows Like Shh embryos Shh embryos had overgrown headfolds after administration of the Hh agonist Figure 3fand h In contrast agonist treatment had no detectable effect on either morphology or Ptc1 expression in Smo embryos compare Figure 3oand p In summary these studies demonstrate that agonist activity in vivo does not depend upon Shh but that Smo is absolutely required Mechanism of action Chemical epistasis studies We sought to determine the level at which the agonist acts in the Hh pathway in cultured cell assays To begin addressing this question we used the Hh reporter cell line to conduct competition experiments between the Hh agonist and known Hh signaling antagonists that block the pathway at different levels Figure 4a These include a Hh protein blocking antibody 5E1 23 a natural product derivative cyclopamine 9 10 that has recently been shown to act downstream of Ptc perhaps at the level of Smo 11 a recently identified synthetic small molecule inhibitor Cur61414 which has inhibitory properties similar to cyclopamine 17 and forskolin an adenylate cyclase protein kinase A activator that is thought to block Hh signaling by stimulating degradation of members of the Gli family of transcriptional activators 2 The Hh blocking antibody 5E1 had no effect on pathway activation by the agonist Figure 4b while forskolin Figure 4c cyclopamine Figure 4d and Cur61414 Figure 4e were all inhibitory The lack of inhibition by 5E1 eliminates the possibility that the small molecule agonist activates signaling indirectly via stimulation of Hh expression Furthermore this supports the data showing that the agonist can activate signaling in Shh embryos Figure 3 and suggests that the agonist function is not only downstream of the Hh protein but also independent of the endogenous Hh signaling modulators Tout veloux and HIP that act via the Hh ligand 2 The competition experiment with forskolin showed identical inhibition curves for Hh protein and the agonist strongly suggesting that the action of the small molecule is upstream of the protein kinase A sensitive step in the pathway In contrast the competition experiments with cyclopamine Figure 4d and Cur61414 Figure 4e showed that Hh protein and the agonist differ in their sensitivity to these antagonists Specifically the agonist appears somewhat resistant to the inhibitory effect of cyclopamine and Cur61414 Identical results were seen using the slightly less active cyclopamine related natural compound jervine and the more potent synthetic derivative of cyclopamine KAAD cyclopamine data not shown These results argue that the agonist activates the pathway downstream of the Hh Ptc interaction while cyclopamine Cur61414 and the agonist may act at a similar level in the Hh signaling cascade Regulation of Ptc and Smo by Hh protein and Hh agonist Recent work in Drosophila tissue culture has shown that endogenous Ptc and Smo proteins are differentially affected by the addition of Hh to the growth medium 5 Ptc was destabilized while Smo accumulated following post translational modification To test whether similar phenomena occur in mammalian cells with Hh protein and agonist we generated stable cell lines expressing two epitope tagged proteins Ptc coupled to green fluorescent protein Ptc GFP and Smo coupled to a fragment of influenza hemagglutinin HA Smo Figure 5ashows an immunoprecipitation anti GFP plus protein blot anti Ptc analysis of extracts from these cells treated for 4 8 and 24 hours with vehicle 25 nM Hh protein or 0 2 M Hh agonist see Figure 1e Hh Ag 1 2 This experiment shows that Ptc GFP appears to be destabilized by Hh protein but not by the agonist Similar results were seen at higher doses of agonist up to 2 M and in several independent lines data not shown These data further support the idea that Hh protein and the agonist act in distinct ways to stimulate the pathway Figure 5bshows an immunoblot anti HA of total extracts from HA Smo expressing cells treated for 2 5 8 and 20 hours with vehicle 35 nM Hh protein or 0 5 M Hh agonist In contrast to the results with Ptc GFP incubation of cells with both Hh protein and the small molecule agonist resulted in the apparent accumulation of HA Smo protein after 5 hours of incubation To test whether the accumulation of HA Smo in response to Hh protein or the agonist required protein synthesis a similar study was performed in the presence of cycloheximide Figure 5c Under these conditions HA Smo accumulation was detectable 5 hours after addition of either Hh protein or the agonist Figure 5c this result argues that the effect of Hh protein and the agonist on HA Smo levels does not require new protein synthesis Finally with increasing concentrations of Hh protein and the agonist there is a clear dose dependent increase of HA Smo levels Figure 5d These effects on epitope tagged Smo protein were observed in multiple lines data not shown Taken together these data suggest that Hh protein and the agonist share the ability to stabilize Smo but only Hh protein can destabilize Ptc Yet the agonist is fully capable of activating the full signaling pathway Testing Smo as the molecular target Binding in whole cells Our biochemistry experiments above show that the agonist modulates Smo levels and thus may activate Hh signaling by directly binding Smo To explore this possibility we tested whether a tritiated form of the agonist analog Hh Ag 1 5 could form a complex with Smo when Smo is transiently overexpressed in 293T cells Figure 6ashows immunoprecipitable counts of extracts from cells incubated at 37 C for 2 hours with 5 nM 3H Hh Ag 1 5 either in the absence columns 1 3 or presence of competitors columns 4 9 Immunocomplexes from untransfected control and adrenergic receptor transfected cells did not contain significant counts Figure 6a columns 1 2 Immunocomplexes derived from cells expressing Smo Figure 6a column 3 resulted in the recovery of approximately 40 000 of the 800 000 added counts however To test the specificity of this apparent Hh Ag Smo complex cells were incubated with 5 M 1000 fold molar excess of unlabeled Hh Ag 1 5 or an unlabeled signaling inactive but structurally similar compound an Hh Ag 1 1 derivative that has a two carbon linker in place of the cyclohexane ring Figure 6a Hh Ag 1 5 column 4 Hh Ag control column 5 The addition of the unlabeled Hh Ag 1 5 but not the inactive Hh Ag 1 1 derivative agonist control resulted in the complete absence of counts in the immunocomplex These results suggest that a stable specific interaction can form between Smo and the Hh agonist It has been shown that the Hh pathway antagonists cyclopamine and Cur61414 block signaling in a Ptc independent manner 11 17 and therefore may act directly on Smo Having established a binding assay for a small molecule agonist binding to Smo expressing cells we next tested whether the Hh antagonists could selectively compete out binding of 3H Hh Ag 1 5 To perform theses studies Smo overexpressing 293T cells were incubated for 2 hours at 37 C with 5 nM 3H Hh Ag 1 5 in the presence of either KAAD cyclopamine at 5 M Figure 6a column 6 the related but inactive plant compound tomatadine at 5 M Figure 6a Antag control 1 column 7 Cur61414 at 5 M Figure 6a column 8 or a related but inactive Cur61414 derivative Figure 6a Antag control 2 column 9 at 5 M These data show that the Hh signaling inhibitors but not structurally related inactive compounds can significantly compete with the binding of the Hh agonist to Smo expressing cells This supports the model that all of these small molecule modulators of Hh signaling are direct ligands of Smo We next asked whether a derivative of the Hh agonist carrying a photoactivatable crosslinker could be coupled directly to Smo to facilitate further biochemical characterization of the binding site To perform this experiment we synthesized a tritiated diazirine derivative of Hh Ag 1 2 with an EC 50 in the cell based assay of 35 nM data not shown We incubated this compound at 0 5 M with HA Smo or control GFP transfected 293T cells and subsequently ultraviolet irradiated them to initiate crosslinking Fractionation by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography of the resulting immunocomplexes from these cells showed crosslinking exclusively to HA Smo but with an efficiency of less than 1 data not shown This result demonstrates that a Hh agonist derivative can be covalently crosslinked to Smo in living cells More efficient crosslinkers are required to extend these studies however Cell free membrane binding assays To test whether the Hh agonist could interact with Smo in vitro we transiently overexpressed murine Smo murine Ptc rat 2 adrenergic receptor and GFP in 293T cells harvested membranes and performed a filtration membrane binding assay in a 96 well plate with 3H Hh Ag 1 5 added at 2 nM Figure 6bshows a bar graph of the bound counts from these binding assays murine Smo column 1 GFP column 2 AR column 3 murine Ptc1 column 4 and a no membrane plate control column 5 The no membrane control column 5 was included to show the degree of non specific binding to the filter plate apparatus The Smo containing membranes column 1 are the only samples that exhibit significant binding above that seen in the absence of membranes To assess the specificity of binding we repeated the experiment in the presence and absence of a 1000 fold molar excess of unlabeled agonist 2 M The addition of cold compound completely competed out these counts Figure 6c column 1 compared to column 2 To control for this observation we added an unlabeled inactive Hh agonist to the binding assay at 2 M a 1000 fold molar excess This compound was unable to compete out the binding of 3H Hh Ag 1 5 to the Smo containing membranes Figure 6c column 3 These results argue that Smo and the agonist form a specific complex in vitro as predicted by the whole cell immunocomplex binding assay Figure 6a Having established an in vitro binding assay for the Hh agonist to Smo we next tested whether the Ptc independent Hh antagonists could selectively compete with the interaction Binding was assayed in the presence of KAAD cyclopamine at 10 M Figure 6c column 4 tomatadine at 10 M Figure 6c Antag control 1 column 5 Cur61414 at 10 M Figure 6c column 6 or the inactive Cur61414 derivative Figure 6c Antag control 2 column 7 at 10 M These data show that the Hh signaling inhibitors but not structurally related inactive compounds can significantly compete with the binding of the Hh agonist to Smo membranes Kinetics saturation and competition binding analysis Next we sought to generate association dissociation and saturation binding curves in order to derive affinity constants for the interaction of the Hh agonist and Smo To control for nonspecific binding we used either Cur61414 or Hh Ag 1 5 as unlabeled competitors Similar results were generated if control membranes from cells transfected with GFP AR or Ptc were used to define the non specific level data not shown First we performed a kinetic analysis to establish the reversibility of the binding reaction and the approximate incubation time required for equilibrium binding studies Association assays were performed at 37 C by combining 2 nM 3H Hh Ag 1 5 with Smo containing membranes for various times prior to harvesting and counting Dissociation studies were initiated by adding 2 M unlabeled Hh Ag 1 5 after 2 hours of association Samples were then incubated for 1 26 hours prior to harvesting and counting Figure 7ashows the association and dissociation phases of agonist binding to Smo containing membranes Using the Prism GraphPad software these data were fit to one phase exponential association and decay curves respectively and gave an association t of approximately 1 hour and a dissociation t of approximately 10 hours These results demonstrate that the binding of the agonist to Smo is reversible and that equilibrium binding will require binding reaction times of approximately 50 hours five times the t of dissociation Next we performed a saturation binding experiment To establish total nonspecific and specific binding curves Figure 7b we added a range of 3H Hh Ag 1 5 concentrations 0 01 3 nM in the presence or absence of unlabeled Hh Ag 1 5 at 2 M Identical results were seen if Cur61414 at 10 M was used as the competitor data not shown On the basis of the binding kinetics incubations were carried out for approximately 45 hours at 37 C to allow for equilibrium to be reached Using the Prism GraphPad software to perform non linear regression analysis and curve fitting we concluded that the data best fit a simple one site binding model with a predicted K d of 0 37 nM for Hh Ag 1 5 This K d is in general agreement with the EC 50 values observed in the cell based assay 0 37 nM as compared to 1 nM To further validate our binding results we performed a competition assay using several agonist derivatives across a range of concentrations 0 01 nM to 1 M Figure 7cshows the competition curves for Hh Ag 1 5 Hh Ag 1 3 Hh Ag 1 2 Hh Ag 1 1 and the signaling inactive Hh Ag 1 1 derivative described above With the exception of the inactive derivative these compounds all compete out the binding of 3H Hh Ag 1 5 0 4 nM to the Smo containing membranes These data are best fit to a single binding site competition model that predicts the following K i values Hh Ag 1 5 0 52 nM Hh Ag 1 3 8 4 nM Hh Ag 1 2 22 nM and Hh Ag 1 1 96 nM These K i values are in general agreement with the agonist EC 50 values in cell culture for these compounds with the exception that the Hh Ag 1 1 compound is not as potent in signaling assays EC 50 2 M as its K i 96 nM might predict This suggests an uncoupling of binding and signaling for certain agonists Although binding affinities and signaling efficacy can correspond for certain ligand receptor complexes exceptions often arise 28 because binding affinity does not necessarily measure the ability of a compound to induce an active receptor conformation As a control for these binding studies identical competition experiments were performed with membranes from cells transfected with GFP or with the adrenergic receptor No specific binding or apparent competition was seen under these conditions data not shown We next compared binding of KAAD cyclopamine Cur61414 and Hh Ag 1 5 to a constitutively active mutant of Smo Smo act or to wild type Smo Smo wt The two Hh signaling antagonists KAAD cyclopamine and Cur61414 have shown decreased potency on Smo act expressing cells leading to the speculation that they may bind this mutant form of Smo less well than the wild type form 11 17 We sought to determine whether the Hh agonist binds Smo actwith a higher affinity an observation seen with certain ligands and constitutively active mutants of GPCRs 29 To perform this experiment we isolated membranes from cells transfected with a cDNA construct encoding a tryptophan to leucine mutation at residue 539 W539L of murine Smo This oncogenic mutation has been found in human basal cell carcinoma 3 and the correspondingly mutated protein is capable of ligand independent activation of the Hh pathway in cell culture assays 11 A kinetic and saturation binding assay with Smo act containing membranes showed that this mutant protein binds the Hh agonist with an affinity identical to that of Smo wt data not shown Using Smo act and Smo wt containing membranes we then performed competition binding studies by adding increasing concentrations of unlabeled Hh Ag 1 5 KAAD cyclopamine or Cur61414 in the presence of 3H Hh Ag 1 5 0 4 nM These binding curves Figure 7d can be fit to a single site competition model Although the K i for Hh Ag 1 5 on Smo act containing membranes was essentially identical to that observed for Smo wt containing membranes approximately 0 5 nM the K i values of the Hh antagonists were seven fold higher on the Smo act compared to the Smo wt containing membranes for both KAAD cyclopamine 38 3 nM versus 5 8 nM and Cur61414 309 nM versus 44 nM These results strongly support the model initially hypothesized for cyclopamine 11 that the reduced potency observed for Hh antagonists on Smo act expressing cells is directly due to a reduced affinity of the antagonist for the mutated Smo protein The agonist on the other hand would be predicted to bind to a site on Smo that is not affected by this gain of function Smo actmutation Discussion Models of Smo ligand interaction To interpret the results of the competition binding studies we assume that the mutation in Smo act like those in constitutively activate mutants of other GPCRs 29 indirectly influences ligand binding by creating a change in the normal equilibrium between the different conformations of Smo Thus the mutation would not directly influence the binding pocket for either ligand A simple two state model Figure 8a predicts that the agonist Ag green square and the antagonist Ant pink circle compete for the same site on Smo to activate or inactivate Hh pathway signaling It also suggests that antagonists should bind Smo actwith a lower affinity than they bind Smo wt while the agonist should bind with a higher affinity as it prefers the active conformation Such a model cannot accommodate our observations with the gain of function Smo mutant Thus we introduce a ternary complex model Figure 8b used traditionally to describe the behavior of GPCRs in binding studies with agonist and antagonists 31 as well as constitutively active receptors 29 The ternary complex model for Hh signaling suggests that there are two independent binding sites on Smo wt one specific for the agonist and another specific for antagonists Binding at either site would decrease the affinity for interactions at the other site allosteric binding with high negative cooperativity The agonist bound form represents the normal activated state while the antagonist bound form is considered the inactive conformation There are also other conformations that would not be bound or would be transiently bound by both ligands A signaling pathway coupler or effector in blue is proposed to bind the activated state of Smo wtso as to generate a complex competent to initiate Hh signaling Throughout the discussion the term coupler effector is used to describe an unknown molecule that binds activated Smo in such a way as to trigger signal transduction The model further suggests that the Smo actprotein resides in a stable conformation in the absence of agonist that is capable of forming an active coupler effector complex resistant to antagonist but not agonist binding Specifically our data suggest that the agonist binds and stabilizes or induces an active signaling state of Smo while the antagonists bind and stabilize or induce an inactive form Furthermore the gain of function Smo mutation renders the protein less sensitive to the inhibitors presumably because the amino acid substitution directly stabilizes or induces an active conformation On the basis of a simple two state model one might predict an increased affinity of the agonist for the mutant form but in our studies binding of the agonist unlike the antagonist is not affected by the activating mutation suggesting that a more complex model requiring two binding sites and perhaps multiple active conformations is needed to account for the observations Thus we propose a variation of the classic ternary complex model Figure 8 a decades old paradigm that has provided the foundation for describing ligand induced conformational changes of GPCRs 31 Briefly if this model is applied to Hh signaling it proposes that firstly agonist and antagonists act at independent sites to select active and inactive conformations of Smo secondly that Smo engages an undefined coupler effector when it is in its signaling state and finally that the gain of function mutant form of Smo Smo act adopts an abnormal conformation that resembles the coupler effector bound signaling state of Smo with low affinity for antagonists but normal affinity for the agonist Activating Hh signaling through the GPCR like Smo receptor As a receptor class GPCRs are considered excellent drug targets because they are often regulated through interactions with small natural ligands 32 33 Specifically studies of classic GPCRs such as the adrenergic receptors show that in the absence of endogenous ligand agonists these receptors exist in multiple interconvertible conformations that are predominately inactive 34 Upon exposure to their natural ligands however the active receptor forms are preferentially stabilized allowing them to readily engage G protein couplers and to create signaling competent complexes Multiple compound classes have been isolated on the basis of their ability to compete for the binding of adrenergic receptors by their natural ligands These competitors can mimic the natural ligand activity agonists or interfere with it antagonists In addition to the binding sites for natural or endogenous agonists orthosteric sites many GPCRs have also been found to have allosteric sites 35 These sites can bind natural ligands as in the case of Zn ions and heparin for the dopamine and neurokinin receptors respectively or bind synthetic drugs such gallamine in the case of the muscarinic receptors 35 Binding of small molecules to these allosteric sites can modulate activity of a receptor without directly mimicking or competing out the interaction of ligands to the orthosteric sites In summary GPCRs have an array of potential regulatory binding sites or potential drug targets How does Smo compare with other GPCRs with regard to the properties described above Although there is clear structural homology between Smo and other GPCRs endogenous ligands have yet to be discovered Early models of Hh signaling proposed a Hh regulated Ptc Smo complex that directly controlled the conformation of Smo making endogenous ligands unnecessary But recent studies argue against this stoichiometric model 5 36 indicating that perhaps natural ligands should be considered Furthermore regarding G protein effector coupling for Smo the results are also equivocal Although no compelling data have been presented that directly link classic G protein activation 37 to the canonical Hh pathway involving Ci Gli stimulation 2 recent studies show that under certain conditions Smo can engage G protein subunits in a Ptc dependent manner 38 and that G protein mediated cAMP modulation may underlie certain effects of Hh on neuronal tissue 39 Finally with respect to pharmacological properties our studies indicate that Smo behaves like a classic GPCR in many regards and that the models used to describe this large family of receptors can be applied to Hh signaling Figure 8 Two relatively novel concepts for Hh signaling are raised by these GPCR models firstly the importance of considering the active Smo coupler effector complexes when modeling pathway regulation and secondly the potential for endogenous ligands in the regulation of Smo activity GPCR models for Smo and potential mechanisms of Ptc function A recent study in Drosophila suggested that Hh stimulates the pathway via Ptc degradation and as a result Smo is stabilized through extensive phosphorylation at the plasma membrane where it initiates signaling 5 This led to speculation that a Ptc regulated phosphatase may control the subcellular distribution and stability of Smo 5 Although suggestive the studies in Drosophila did not establish that phosphorylation translocation or stabilization of Smo is required for pathway stimulation It is plausible that some or all of these effects on Smo result from a feedback inhibition mechanism that targets the activated Smo receptor Interestingly while we did observe stabilization of Smo by Hh in our mammalian cell experiments Figure 5 we did not detect Smo phosphorylation or translocation to the plasma membrane data not shown Perhaps the cellular or species context dictates the degree to which the active conformations of Smo are associated with such changes Thus in considering models of Ptc function based on Hh stimulated effects it is important to consider whether the form of Smo that is being observed is the active coupler effector bound signaling state or perhaps a downregulated and inactive form Several potential points for regulation by Ptc during the formation of a Smo coupler effector complex are apparent in a ternary complex model The ideas proposed for the Drosophila system in which Ptc may affect the levels of Smo or its subcellular localization are easily accommodated Ptc induced instability of Smo protein would indirectly reduce the concentration of an active Smo coupler effector complex Furthermore limiting access of Smo to its effector through targeted vesicle trafficking would prevent a signaling competent complex from forming Alternatively Ptc could more directly maintain Smo in an inactive state On the basis of our studies it is tempting to speculate that native small molecules with properties similar to our agonist and antagonists act directly on Smo in a Ptc dependent manner These putative endogenous Smo modulators could represent orthosteric or allosteric ligands The simplest model would have Ptc acting catalytically to dock a natural antagonist directly onto or remove an agonist from Smo A more complex model would involve Ptc restricting the distribution of Smo such that it is forced into compartments containing the natural antagonists or lacking the natural agonists Finally Ptc could control the distribution of the endogenous small molecule modulators themselves Ptc shares sequence homology with molecules associated with vesicle trafficking and transporter activity namely SCAP and NPC1 36 40 41 42 if it also shares the activities of these molecules as suggested by a recent study 36 then the possibility of the existence of endogenous Smo ligands that are docked via Ptc should be explored Therapeutic potential of a Hh pathway agonist Various studies in mammals have shown that Hh genes are expressed in discrete areas of the adult organism and may function in the normal maintenance of mature organ systems 43 44 45 46 In addition the regenerative healing of vascular and skeletal tissues following acute injuries appears to be aided by re activating the Hh signaling cascade 47 48 Taken together these observations suggest that the Hh pathway may represent a point of intervention for treating certain degenerative disorders Two recent studies in models of Parkinson s disease and peripheral nerve damage support this claim by demonstrating that pathway activation with a Hh protein ligand has therapeutic value 49 50 On the basis of our current understanding of these models and the specific mechanism of action of the Hh agonists we predict that an agonist derivative with low toxicity and favorable pharmacokinetics would replicate these positive results As a drug a Hh agonist would represent an attractive alternative to an expensive Hh protein therapeutic Beyond the economics for disorders of the central nervous system a small molecule with the potential to cross the blood brain barrier would eliminate the need for injections directly into the brain the current delivery mode for central nervous system protein therapies Materials and methods Chemical libraries and medicinal chemistry The compound libraries used in our screens were purchased from a number of commercial vendors and were primarily generated by combinatorial chemistry approaches The Hh agonist class was isolated from a library synthesized by Oxford Asymmetry International now EvotecOAI The derivatization of this compound class utilized standard procedures the details of which will be published elsewhere Cultured cell line assays TM3 and C3H10T1 2 cells ATCC Manassas USA were maintained according to the instructions of ATCC Stable Hh signaling reporter cell lines were established by G418 selection following transfection with a luciferase reporter plasmid 20 containing the neomycin resistance gene Hh signaling was monitored by plating cells at 70 confluence in growth medium After 24 hours the cells were changed to 0 5 serum containing medium and Hh protein or compounds were added 24 hours later the cells were either monitored for luciferase activity using the Luc lite assay kit Packard Instrument Company Meriden USA or harvested for RNA isolation using an RNA isolation kit Qiagen Valencia USA RNA was subjected to quantitative RT PCR analysis Taqman Applied Biosystems Foster City USA utilizing Gli1 Ptc1 and GAPDH primers and probes Assays were run on a Prism 7700 instrument ABI Applied Biosystems Recombinant Hh protein The Hh protein used in the studies described here was bacterially overexpressed amino terminal human Shh modified at its amino terminal cysteine by an octyl maleimide moiety 21 This lipophilic Shh form showed comparable potency to native Shh in the cell based reporter assay data not shown Retroviral cell lines Mouse Smo and Ptc1 genes were introduced by a retroviral approach utilizing the pLPCX vector Clontech Palo Alto USA to limit the copy number per cell Stable HA Smo and Ptc GFP lines were established by puromycin selection following infection of TM3 cells with the respective retroviruses TM3 cells expressing both epitope tagged Ptc and Smo were derived by infecting first with an HA Smo construct and subsequently with a Ptc GFP construct The levels of Ptc were relatively low in these lines and a standard immunoprecipitation procedure followed by western blotting was required to detect the Ptc GFP protein The HA Smo protein was highly expressed and was easily detected in western blots of whole cell extracts The HA tag was sub cloned into the Smo gene so that it would reside immediately after the Smo signal sequence The GFP tag was inserted before the stop codon of the Ptc open reading frame In uteroHh signaling assays Generation of Ptc1 lacZ Shh and Smo mutant mice has been described previously 25 26 Ptc1 lacZ mice were kindly provided by Matthew Scott Shh and
