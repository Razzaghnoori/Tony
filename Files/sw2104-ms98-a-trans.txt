 okay i think we re supposed to discuss our view of the Soviet Union as a continuing threat to the United States how do you feel about that okay i don t really i more i don t know about the government as much as um the people uh i wouldn t consider to be a threat at all and i really don t feel much like the Soviet Union itself is a threat anymore i m i m worried about them they re in a very uh tumultuous state right now with the kinds of uh adaptations that they re attempting to go through so i m concerned about them not as a military threat but as a burden they re very large yeah and they could become very quickly a large financial burden as as one more stepchild we have to carry around yeah i think that s that s a real important aspect and that uh as the the most the most the most let s see the more that we do that we do or that we can do to help them become self sufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming a you know a reality i know that uh this last winter was very hard on uh several areas in the in the the Ukraine particularly the coal mining regions of Siberia uh the people there have money that s not their problem but there s no food for them to buy and its you can t eat money and they have a a problem their their whole attitude um i i m not sure which crop it was but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn t get anyone to harvest it yeah and the people in the city were saying well why should i go do that make the government do that that s not my job right they ve got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they ve been through now and um they ve been they ve been under under the oppression that they ve been under for so long that now they have some freedoms but they don t know how to act yet they don t understand that to make that work they ve got to take some responsibility for themselves it s not just the government s responsibility anymore you can t just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well absolutely and and i think that they re having a hard time with the concept of you cannot go back people only go forward and i think that that is giving them i m expecting a call and unfortunately i think it s come through i ve enjoyed talking to you thank you bye okay all right bye bye
