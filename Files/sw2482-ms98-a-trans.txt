 uh so you have children i take it no i don t you don t no huh uh so it s not a very valid topic no it s not do you have children uh yes uh huh one one stepdaughter uh huh ten ten and uh you know how they are at that age i guess you having been ten once yeah once upon a time i was well i have two dogs those are my kids yourself oh we have one what kind is it uh Keeshonden oh really yeah fuzzy little thing uh huh a what a fuzzy little dog yeah yeah they re cute rather rather odd personality he he he s fun uh huh anyway uh time we spend with our children um hum it seems almost as though children hate it do they yes time spent with mom and dad is uh next is that s probably one of the worst punishments on earth to them yeah especially when they get like into the teenage stage and yeah i guess i yeah i remember when i was that age they you know parents are a curse that they just have to live with uh huh so it it s interesting yeah we do spend time driving in the mountains uh huh oh how nice i would love to live up there no do you work for TI uh huh uh huh you re working then yeah with every passing day we wonder if we will be that s what i heard i ve always thought about maybe transferring up there and i thought if i do that i might not have a job so it s it s better to to be employed um hum um hum especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner um hum i know it and that creates family tensions yeah yeah i m sure it does so you only have the you only have the stepdaughter at home you all don t have any other children around there yes no no i don t have any any children uh huh so how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all uh well it varies what it is of course but usually mom and dad are a curse um hum um hum you know they they d much rather be with friends friends are cool parents aren t oh yeah no huh uh but i remember well i m sure part of it is a male female thing you know i i remember whenever i was growing up um hum often times spent with my Dad was oh just wonderful you know go uh huh go hunting or go to the races or um hum or oh any number of things um hum and we d have um great times oh yeah and it seems that well now the bank s not available yeah and entirely too much time is spent my wife and i were wondering what if um hum and and what if s always rough oh yeah yeah but you know we do have our trips and we do have our fun and um hum i don t know little girls aren t interested in lot of the same things little boys are or were like fishing and hunting and and yeah looking for arrowheads and my husband ll say that he d like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing and i d say well you can take a little girl hunting and fishing just as easily uh but they don t like it that s probably right there there there is a difference there um hum um hum and the and yeah well if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably wouldn t have liked it i go now with my husband and i enjoy it but well girls at that age um hum video games boys and malls yeah yeah not necessarily in that order and friends of course uh huh and that s a little tough for fathers um hum i imagine fathers don t even like malls they despise shopping uh so is that quality time huh no i think not yeah if but there is camping and we both enjoy that uh huh she likes to do that somewhat yeah yeah yeah yeah well that s good getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all and uh huh that s somewhat fun um hum it s she huh so what do you think about child rearing is how how would you spend time with kids probably doing outdoorsie stuff and keep them trying to keep them away from the TV i guess and McDonald s i i ve always said that if i had a kid they wouldn t know what McDonald s is oh yeah but i guess they learn from their friends don t they yeah but well yeah and amazingly a lot of times it s real easy uh huh you know a lot of times whenever we head out of town on a trip or something um hum it s real easy to swing in there for breakfast yeah breakfast and run and yeah breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway yeah and uh it is kids eat funny this lady in our bass club we had a tournament yesterday and she was talking about her daughter said one week her daughter won t uh will be on a no meat kick and one week she ll eat nothing but Twix candy bars you know it s she just eats weird and little girls are worse about it than little boys yeah yeah they they re always wanting to go on a diet or something or or something yeah go on a diet or they um hum they have a well to some extent the public schools or the schools in general um hum influence them um hum the eating meat kick yeah you know it like it s really morally wrong to eat meat or something i i m not sure um hum of course that s not the way i was raised being raised in West Texas yeah oh is that where you re from oh yeah um hum born in Denton raised in Lubbock oh so i understand about bass um yeah uh but it but it is interesting um hum i i will tell you yeah every person out there should have kids at least once or or have some that they can borrow for a time that s the kind i like because everyone needs some torture in their lives my mother used to put that curse on my sister i hope you have kids just like yourself and my grandmother must have put that on my dad because he got my sister she s just like him uh but Jenny is a sweet kid yeah i m sure she is and and yeah we do do things and yeah it it s funny it s almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children um hum to go do um hum the money s not available um hum i know i don t know how people can afford kids you know i mean what we were talking about how much it cost to go to Disney Land uh huh golly a couple three hundred dollars oh yeah you know for just just a day not including you know a day or two not including lodging and food and all that uh huh uh huh it s i don t see how anyone can afford it oh and i understand Six Flags is real expensive now it s uh i heard it s twenty bucks a whack for adults oh yeah yeah that is awful high oh twenty bucks a whack now yeah or twenty one but at least once you pay your way in there at Six Flags uh huh yeah everything s free except for the food and stuff yeah yeah food and junk to carry out so that s that s not as bad yeah yeah but golly you know Disney World or Disney Land uh huh well our problem is that you know a trip to Six Flags or Disney World or uh Disney Land or God forbid Disney World would take forever really or you d have to pay air fare and uh huh oh for a family you know for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick and rent a car when you get there and all that yeah oh yeah that s why i lucked out my dad worked for Braniff when i was a kid so we got you know our air fare free and we got discounts
