 well how about you do you use PCs oh constantly you and i both it seems like uh everything i do has is computer related uh huh and if it goes down then we re stuck all day yeah and so i like the IBM PC personally uh huh but that s pretty much everything i ve worked with and uh i ve become so accustomed to it that uh it s like second nature yeah what do you use well i have an i IBM PS two model thirty yes uh huh and uh it s kind of kind of getting too slow for me but my job i m an EDP auditor so i audit uh computer applications both on the PC and the mainframe level oh uh huh and i use my PC constantly not only do i do PC type things like uh using lotus or word processors huh uh i also use my PC to emulate a mainframe terminal for our IBM mainframe and also to emulate a deck terminal for our deck machine uh huh oh okay so all i have on my desk is my PC but i m i m getting not only our local area network but i m getting two separate mainframe machines also oh okay oh we um we use it s an IBM PS two also huh uh and um you know every now and then the file gets so big that you know it moves slower than i d like huh uh uh but uh uh i we i do mainly um graphics on it huh uh and uh a little bit of word processing and then lotus applications to it yeah and uh uh you know i don t know i just i enjoy working with them yeah there s just there s so many capabilities out there i mean the things you can do are endless yeah i ve become kind of the PC guru in our audit department because it s mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground uh huh and there s three of us EDP auditors and one of the three of us has an accounting background and so she s not real proficient in PCs and the other just hasn t used PCs that much so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they re doing and i m the administrator for our local area network and i need to keep that going and uh huh so i i m i couldn t live my life without a PC i don t have one at home which which we have one at home but i just don t find the time that i can use it yeah i would right now i would rather not have one at home because i would work at home i yes uh um we ve got a couple of portable lap top PCs at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot uh huh to do work if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night oh the one of the reasons why i got mine was before i went on maternity leave they didn t know how they were going to do without me at work because i am pretty much the like you said the guru in the office with the different programs and any trouble shooting that there is yeah uh huh and um so they didn t know how it was going to work they re thinking that we were going to have to get a modem so that we could you know uh and a decks machine so that we could in my home so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so yeah but uh you know it s uh they re they re really great uh it s almost like we could we could become too dependent on them yeah and oh i the uh we use a lot of free lance and uh uh huh that s uh pretty much takes up a lot of our day as far as producing transparencies and things yeah and um it uh you know compared to the way the things have upgraded have uh really what s the word i m looking for i m just totally drawing a blank but uh the way things have changed over the years with the PC and the different programs is just great it s remarkable the things we can do now and compared to you know back a few years yeah just the power i m i m trying to uh get an upgraded machine mine is uh just putting along and it s not fast enough for me so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but uh i don t know yeah i don t know if my boss will spring for it but i m i m i m i determined to brake mine so he has to get me another one we think about that a lot yeah well that s what i do we had a printer a a Hewlett Packard Ready Writer uh huh and we had about ten people sharing this printer by it was attached to like a central PC and you had to take your diskette to the PC to print something oh um now that s awful so the first thing when i started working at this bank is i said well now first of all we need to all be able to share this PC without getting up so i talked my boss into investing in a it s not a uh a uh real elaborate local area network but we can share the printer huh uh and we can uh send files to each other and we can mail send mail messages to each other which is what which is good enough it s what we need uh huh oh okay um hum right and then i talked them into buying a HP Laser Jet oh yes and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it but once he bought it he has been so pleased it s it s fast it s quite oh it has good copy right the quality that you can out off with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers yeah i ve got a little little uh IBM Pro Printer on my desk but and i can use either the Pro Printer or i ve got my PC configured to where i can use either printer the one that s on the network or my own yeah uh huh so if i just need something real quick and i don t feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed i can just print it in my office um uh we re just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer yeah and uh it s just so you you know with budget restraints and things like that it s makes it difficult they have gotten really cheap Hewlett Packard makes it s it s actually a dot matrix printer and uh uh huh but the quality is almost uh laser quality oh uh huh and i think it s called the desk jet yeah and they re under i think they re uh about eight hundred dollars now and we uh got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred oh uh yeah i don t remember what kind they were uh but uh we uh do a lot of transparencies huh uh sometimes the color would take too long to plot uh plot out yeah so they just want black and white ones and see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick yeah because it will only take a minute to print one of those out and then run a thermal copy of it yeah but uh it uh i mean that s all you need for like for like bullet charts and stuff you don t need them in four colors uh huh no uh huh if it was a customer presentation then that would be different we would want to razzle dazzle a bit but uh yeah it s uh yeah we have one in the office and if we want to use it well in our area if we want to use it we have to you know like you said you had to change it put it on a disc and carry it over to there and see if they re not using the printer you use the sneaker net system right and uh wait for an opportunity to use it yeah yeah we you d have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer uh huh until they got off the machine i know i know i understand that was uh i was amazed when i came to work i worked at the uh well it used to be the largest bank in San Antonio until N C N B came up and bought the rival and now N C N B and now N C N B s got a little larger market share uh huh but it s the only uh well it s part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in Texas it s the only one that s still alive oh uh huh so any way i work in a big prestigious place right and i couldn t believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here s the audit department of this this huge holding company sharing a HP Rugged Writer i was going oh wait a minute come on guys this is crummy right so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you re behind the times in technology here yeah yeah we re we re pushing real hard though we re we re trying well see the entire bank is not like that we the the bank philosophy is one of innovation innovation and lead the market uh huh it s just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because the uh the senior vice president over audits is cheap uh huh and it s real hard to pry money out of him to to to do these things but i was i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better and right we we find it hard to believe sometimes or hard to understand when uh so we work for a computer company and uh how are we supposed to present the imagine that we re supposed to present with equipment that s outdated and when it s obsolete yeah and the guys that that some of the guys that run this place are very tight and it s like well why do we need this can t you do that with you know what we have and when we try and then they complain about this doesn t look good yeah so unfortunately the the uh computer equipment and and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly like for instance we bought a um hum
