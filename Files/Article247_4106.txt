 As Ordinary as They Wanna Be Tucker Picking on Ordinary Americans are you You and Steve Brill will have a lot to talk about in Hell A question What is an Ordinary American Are there criteria for membership in the club Hasn t heard of Tina Brown Watches CBS Thinks Slate is a blackboard surface I ask because I m not sure who qualifies anymore or what constitutes ordinary I was on a trip to West Texas last month and my wife daughter in laws and I stopped in Marfa population 2 500 Giant was shot in and around there in the mid 50s and the main drag probably doesn t look much different today than it did then We were in a Mexican restaurant having lunch the sort of time capsule place where people smoke freely at their tables and vegetarians like me are out of luck I thought to myself So this is the last unsullied place on earth these are the last holdouts from the modern world these are the last Ordinary Americans And then we heard a dusty coot in a cowboy hat in the booth behind us talking about his IPO It is definitely true as you say that politicians turn the folks they refer to as Ordinary Americans into props I m reminded of the time in late 95 or early 96 during his belly flop presidential bid when Phil Gramm introduced Dickie Flatt to the world Ol Dickie we were told was a printer from Mexia a tiny Texas town whose previous claim to fame had been that it was the birthplace of Anna Nicole Smith which itself is one for the Hall of Dubious Distinctions Dickie worked so hard and such long hours that his hands were forever stained with printer s ink and if that didn t make Dickie Flatt and Ordinary Americans like him deserving of a massive tax cut well tarnation Dickie was indeed from Mexia but he wasn t just some printer he was a longtime volunteer on Gramm s campaigns It s not as if he was picked out of a rope line to play a round of Who Wants to Be a Campaign Accessory he was a committed partisan duped into portraying no one in particular When politicians talk about Ordinary Americans what they really mean is Ordinary Americans Who Already Agree With Me Whose Life Stories and Lifestyles I ve Vetted for Anything Embarrassing and Untoward and Whose Personal Misfortune I m Going To Exploit For My Own Ends Until the Election Is Over at Which Time No One on My Staff Will Return Their Calls That 96 race is worth recalling for another reason you mentioned At no other time in the history of American politics have both halves of a presidential ticket referred to themselves so frequently in the third person Dole Hello Jack Jack Kemp Bob Dole wants you to be his running mate Kemp Jack Kemp would be honored Dole Bob Dole thanks you Kemp No Jack Kemp thanks you Jack Kemp is happy to quarterback your team Dole Arrggggh Bob Dole Doley Bob I couldn t help but work in a sports metaphor which was the other maddening aspect of 96 If I had to hear one more football reference And it s no better this year The great disappointment of the Bradley campaign has been the incessant use of basketball terminology by political reporters I think it s lazy empty writing at its worst and I m sure Ordinary Americans agree Regards Evan
