        so what movies have you seen lately   well i saw um lately ive seen Soap Dish which was a uh that was a lot of fun it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things   ah well see thats something i want to see thats on my list to see   yeah yeah it was it was okay it was not um not a wonderful film but it was i mean it was it was cute but not the biggest laugh ive seen   oh okay   i saw Thelma and Louise   oh did you   a couple of days ago and really liked that actually i saw it twice because i  liked it so much   oh see thats also on my list   and its very its really disturbing but a good movie   a disturbing movie how do you mean   well it was um lets see the um its its different its kind of its an action adventure kind of you know shoot them up kind of film but its with women in it instead of men so thats kind of a   right a switcheroo huh   thats kind of a twist on the normal thing And it made me think a lot about you know you would applaud Bruce Willis in Die Hard if he was doing this but you might not be so   right   you know so encouraging of Susan Sarandon and Gena Davis when they do it   when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it   so that was kind of interesting ive but i really enjoyed it   oh   so that was   because that that just reminds me of you know like back in school and you know the girlfriends just taking off for a day  or something just getting in trouble and probably not that much trouble but um yeah   yeah thats kind of what it was right they had started out with that then they got into lots of trouble   before we found the shopping malls thats  what we did  yeah well um ill have to put that ill have to keep that on my list then   uhhuh yeah i also saw that Madonna movie   oh   Truth and Dare and that was pretty scandalous   scandalous   yeah it was kind of yeah Madonna   i can imagine   shes pretty trashy so it was it was interesting   i guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is huh   right well i think she kept saying that uh they talked about her it it was a film of her concert um tour she had taken through all all around the world and they were all  to her at the Vatican city and wouldnt let her perform in Rome and   hm   kept saying that her show was not garbage it had a social message to it and   you just had to find it you had to wade through it and find it   right we never quite believed that so   you never quite  got to   i thought that was pushing it a little bit but she   all i know about that woman is that shes an in incredible marketeer   yeah shes rich   yeah and shes rich and she you know so   shes smart at what she does she knows how to do that   she knows how to twist this around huh   yeah so what did you think about Dances With Wolves   well okay see were getting back to last year thats probably the last  movie i saw um Dances With Wolves i just adored it   really   how can i tell you um a couple years ago i guess well maybe ten years ago i ive read Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee and so you know just   umhum   the general theme of the whole movie was um pretty i mean i really liked it a lot i mean it was a real consciousness raiser i guess   right   um and i only bring up Wounded Knee because that was what ten years ago you read and and understood you know about the American pop Indian population and then everything went away for a couple years and now its back again and you know its   right umhum      sort of a popular view of um what happened way back then of course no one will ever know really i dont know   right i know i was i wondered if uh the tribes that they represented the tribe that was the the evil tribe if they were really as bad as they made them to be   well who knows i mean it it it sort of showed like two different types of tribes like one was a warring tribe and the other one was uh vegetarian kind of you know feel good tribe you know sort of thing so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world nobody can get along peacefully   right umhum yeah but i wonder i thought the because they made a big deal about how this this film was such a big leap for the the people who who were the ancestors of these this Indian tribe and that you know that was so wonderful that they done that and they uh i i wonder about how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film if it   oh i see yeah   you know you didnt hear any press about that i thought it was a very interesting movie   huh well i think so i um i have come to respect a little bit more the uh you know what went on here but but who knows how its supposed to all end  you know on the on the broad scope i mean   right uhhuh  right   um like i said it it it had a much bigger thing i think meaning to me i think about you know just the meaning of um the freedom of this country and and what that really meant and that was taking over somebody elses freedoms and sort of trampling that and uh so   right uhhuh   you know it it meant something bigger i think but still it was a fantastic i loved the buffalo scene and and i thought Kevin Costner was just i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every three minutes but hes the director you know um but yeah i i just thought it was   i know the       a really interesting intense film intense i think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast   well thats good that was that was it was it was good i looked at my watch only a few times which is a good thing but it put me in a really it put me in a really bad mood i dont know why yeah we did there were three of us who went we were just all grouchy really grouchy when it was over   yeah ate a lot of popcorn did it really huh   so we decided that may be the mark of a good film it made us think and so we were grouchy we felt guilty   made you think maybe it well maybe that was um but there are no answers you know   for being  i know and we we had  nothing to do with it we were not responsible but we still felt the thick blame for what had gone on we could have   that that can make you crabby yes really thats true but it its they sort of candy coated the western story for many years and um you know when the truth   right   oh well it always balances out one way or the other once you get the whole story but have you seen any other movies because you sound like you see a lot   umhum yeah well right i do im just out of school so ive seen a lot of   oh okay   i dont have a job so i shouldnt go see movies all th e time um i rented a good movie um called Cinema Paradeso which is an Italian movie   oh there you go oh oh   which is probably the best movie ive seen ever it was just wonderful its a uh story about a little boy in a Italian a little Italian village and he um   really   owns a um or he works in a a movie  theater and it it helps the projectionist theres a little oh an old man whos the projectionist and he befriends this old man and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years   oh   and its just i mean if you dont mind reading subtitles i thought i had to kind of get beyond that those little you know reading the little words at the bottom of the screen but um oh i just laughed and cried and     oh ill have to write that down   i really loved it that was a a great one and other than that i   wow have you have did you see Texasville are you into Larry McMurtry   no ive had i hadnt i had read um The Last Picture Show and but thats out on video now and i havent seen it but i was interested in reading Texasville before i saw the movie did you like it   yeah um i i read a lot of Larry McMurtry books and Texasville is just like that its like very peculiar circumstances and very peculiar   right umhum   things that people do with each other its its you know and its just sort of a
