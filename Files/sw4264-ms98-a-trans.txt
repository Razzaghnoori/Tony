        um       like i say im a im a uh a sort of an addict for uh current events and news so i read the paper almost everyday and um i also generally watch one of the national news casts   yeah i keep up with most of my stuff either by the news i dont get to read the paper everyday because i just dont have enough time but i read it on Sundays and then i always listen to the like six oclock or ten oclock news and then listen to the radio   uh my main problem is that um i i like to follow the national news   umhum   so im im really not very happy with local news cast and im uh i dont like the local paper paper very much either   well     especially since we dont have a choice anymore since Dallas lost its one paper that i   thats true   um um i usually read the front page and then the editorial page and uh im finding that i spend less and less time on the editorial page because the selection is so bad   yeah what about USA Today do you read that one   no uh i used to   nope   uh uh the New York Times is my favorite newspaper thats what i grew up with but uh i dont spend the money on it because i know i only get to spend five or ten minutes on it and have to   its not worth it   uh let it pile up   i like um USA Today   yeah   because i mean its not real thick but it gets most of the stuff in there thats current and going on   does it have editorial writers   um yeah   who are some of them   now that got got me i mean i dont read it everyday like whenever were on vacation or whenever i go on vacation or whatever i i get to keep up with it but thats like what once or twice a year   can you i wonder if they use their uh the same ones all the time or if they just grab uh the best of the Washington Post and the New York Times and they probably have a few syndicated columnists that they rotate   i think well i mean i dont know you know i really have never paid that much attention to that   thats thats what the Dallas Morning News does and they they they seem to select select them kind of irregularly and i um i dont think they do a very good job myself   yeah do you read the paper everyday   pretty much i guess i like i said i read the headlines and then i read the editorial page and then i check the uh local news thats the only thing i really rely on the paper for is the local news   yeah   but um i im finding that   McNeal Lehrer uh news hour is the TV program that i i like to watch the most they because they they dont give you these thirty seconds short shots of twenty different stories they usually spend about fifteen minutes or ten minutes on the story   oh really   yeah   now um when does that come on   ten oclock well its actually its on a couple of times its on channel two at seven i think and its on channel thirteen at uh ten oclock usually   yeah   so i try to watch that from ten to eleven unless unless something else is going on   the radio station that i listen to in the morning i mean theyre theyre real good about going over like whats going and i mean they talk about it like some of this like the major events that are going on   you ever listen to the public radio station   um no no well i mean i mayve just flipped through it why   KERA theyre quite yeah theyre quite good uh yeah i like them very much   oh really   thats thats what i tune to regularly um KRLD if i need to know what the traffics like   yeah   so   no the Eagle usually i mean theyll can tell you pretty much they go over the stuff they have a newscaster on there and they go i mean its short and sweet but i mean they keep you up to date on stuff   you spend a lot of time driving   yeah well yeah well i mean i always listen to the radio or the TV whenever im getting ready in the morning   yeah yeah im always listening to the news um when i drive but i dont drive i mean i my commute is only about five minutes so i i dont have to uh spend a lot of time in the car if i did i guess i would rely more on the radio more than i do on the TV   see you have a shorter commute so thats why you get to stay home and read the paper in the morning       me i just have to rely on the TV or the um the newspaper i mean the or the   right right yeah   radio station   yeah i i find that most of the TV coverage is too short and superficial so thats one one reason you have to have a newspaper so you can read something in depth   yeah well i used to work i worked for a newspaper for six and a half years   they did where   uh in well in Nacogdoches Texas which is real small town   oh uhhuh i know where it is yeah uhhuh   and oh really well um it was family owned and everything so we didnt like the the way a lot of the stuff was run there   was it a weekly   daily umhum   daily oh i wouldnt think a size town that size would have a daily newspaper   yep   huh   but they got bought out by Cox   uhhuh   so now a lot of things have changed or whatever   is it still a daily   yep   yeah is that where you grew up   yes actually   uhhuh uhhuh well thats   surprising surprising there was a a daily newspaper at a town that small   yeah like i said it was family owned and they pretty much i mean they were in the  i mean well they put in there what they published what they wanted to publish and stuff they didnt want to publish   yeah
