 Background Loss of Fhit protein is among the earliest known events in the development of a variety of the most common and lethal human malignancies 1 Loss of Fhit leads to cells that are deficient in programmed cell death and that form tumors in mice while Fhit reexpression in Fhit cancer cells reduces tumorigenicity and restores programmed cell death 2 3 4 5 6 Infection of Fhit mice with viruses that re express Fhit reduce cancer occurrence 7 apparently by killing pre neoplastic cells that have lost the wild type Fhit allele Human Fhit protein a member of the Fhit branch of the histidine triad superfamily of nucleotide binding proteins binds and hydrolyzes diadenosine polyphosphates such as ApppA and AppppA 1 into AMP plus ADP and ATP respectively 8 9 10 His96 which is responsible for covalent catalysis and more than 4 10 6 fold of rate enhancement in ApppA hydrolysis 9 11 12 13 is nonetheless dispensable for ApppA binding and tumor suppression suggesting that Fhit function in tumor suppression depends on formation of an E S complex 2 12 If Fhit substrate complexes promote tumor suppression by stimulating a pro apoptotic effector then Fhit inhibitors that resemble natural substrates may promote Fhit function Similarly Fhit inhibitors with normative features may antagonize Fhit function Either class of compounds may be important in dissecting Fhit cell biology and regulating apoptosis Making use of a synthesis strategy to link adenosine 5 O phosphates and phosphorothioates to short chain polyols 14 we evaluate four inhibitor parameters and obtain compounds inhibitory constants for which are as much as 70 fold lower than natural substrates Key features of the best candidate agonist compound 6b and candidate antagonist compound 12b are conservation of the length of the polyphosphate replacement use of 5 O phosphorothioadenosyl residues no replacement for oxygen at the location of the bridging oxygen and replacement of carbon for the phosphorus Compound 12b contains additional negatively charged substituents that may facilitate Fhit inhibition 15 while rendering the compound antagonistic to Fhit function in the cell Covalent structures of AppppA 1 and compounds 6b and 12b are provided in Figure 1 Results and Discussion A series of compounds 2 6 were synthesized and evaluated for Fhit inhibition that link two 5 O phosphorothioadenosyl or AMP groups with five reagents ranging in size from ethylene glycol to meso erythritol Sodium salts of each compound were titrated into assays of purified Fhit 16 with 1 8 M fluorescent substrate Appp S 4 4 difluoro 5 7 dimethyl 4 bora 3a 4a diaza s indacine 3 yl methylaminoacetyl ApppBODIPY 10 and competitive K i values were obtained by calculating the inhibitor concentration dependence in reduction of k cat K m apparent for substrate hydrolysis 10 As shown in Table 1 inhibitors 2b and 3b with two carbon diol linkers were either only as inhibitory as the natural substrate 1 or substantially less so Inhibitor 4b with a four carbon linker was as ineffective as 3b Inhibitors 5a and 6a that substitute a central CH 2 PO 2 CH 2 or CH 2 CH OH CH 2 for the PO 2 O PO 2 of 1 were as inhibitory as 1 is a good substrate The phosphorothioate analogs 5b and 6b bound approximately 10 and 75 times better to Fhit than 1 Thus conservation of bond lengths between adenylate moieties of 1 5 and 6 is conducive to binding Fhit Because phosphorothioate analogs of 5 and 6 were better inhibitors than the corresponding phosphates phosphorodithioate analog 6c was prepared together with five additional compounds as phosphates and phosphorothioates Phosphorodithioate 6c was a less effective inhibitor K i 8600 nM not shown in Tables than corresponding phosphate 6a and phosphorothioate 6b and as demonstrated in Tables 1and 2 the phosphorothioate congener of every compound made as a phosphate and a phosphorothioate had a lower K i value The contribution of particular P chiral phosphorothioate stereoisomers to inhibition has not been examined When diadenosine 5 5 P 1 P 2 methylene P 3 thio P 1 P 3 triphosphate 17 was crystallized with wild type and mutant Fhit the phosphorothioate group was found in the mutant but not wild type active site suggesting that phosphorothioate inhibitors may be slow substrates 12 Similarly Frey and co workers found that Fhit slowly cleaves both R p and S p stereoisomers of m nitrobenzyl adenosine 5 O l thiotriphosphate with modest and similar beneficial effects on K m as compared to the corresponding phosphate 13 Given the inhibitor activity of 6b the contribution of the oxygen in the position of the bridging oxygen of 1 was examined As can be seen in Table 2 comparison of 9b with 10b and 11b and of 15b with 16b indicated that imido or sulfur substitutions for oxygen reduce enzyme inhibition by an order of magnitude Derivatives of 6b with one or two additional functionalities on the central carbon were characterized Analysis of 9b indicated that loss of the polar hydroxyl group reduces inhibitory activity and analysis of 7b and 8b indicated that nearly isosteric groups that are nonisoelectronic are not tolerated The magnitude of these effects was surprising and may be related to altered conformations upon manganese coordination Earlier Blackburn and co workers made supercharged methane trisphosphonic acid AppppA analogs containing a central carbon from which three adenylate or phosphate moieties are bonded 15 In work presented here tripodal inhibitors 15a and 17a showed respectively micromolar and submicromolar efficacies while the phosphorothioate counterparts 15b and 17b showed 100 nM efficacy Derivatives of pentaerythritol tetrapodal compounds 12 13 and 14 were also evaluated for Fhit inhibition While compound 14b containing two phosphorothioylated branches without adenosine was barely a submicromolar inhibitor compounds 12b and 13b which contain respectively three and four CH 2 phosphorothioadenosyl groups bonded to the central carbon were 40 nM and 65 nM inhibitors Thus while the simplest compound 6b was initially rendered less inhibitory by modification because its central hydroxyl was important for inhibition addition of one or two CH 2 phosphorothioadenosyl groups restored inhibition We presume that compounds 6b 12b and 13b with 2 3 or 4 identical CH 2 phosphorothioadenosyl groups can present a manganese bound 6b like complex to Fhit in a similar manner On the basis that Fhit binds diadenosine polyphosphates with one AMP group buried and the other adenosine solvent exposed in a specific conformation 12 effective tri and tetrapodal inhibitors such as 12b 13b and HC ADP 3 15 may exist in solution predominantly in a conformation that resembles Fhit bound AppppA On the basis of observations 12 13 discussed above one would expect AppppA with two phosphorothioadenosyl substituents to be a slow substrate with a relatively low K m However carbon in place of the phosphorus for example in 6b would make the leaving group the alkoxide OCH 2 CH OH CH 2 O phosphorothioadenosyl rather than thio ATP Presumably because normal Fhit products are mononucleotides with low p K a values the enzyme does not have a group to protonate an alkoxide leaving group and thus substitution of carbon for the phosphorus turns a substrate into an inhibitor Conclusions Tumor suppression by Fhit is not destroyed by mutation of the nucleophilic His96 to Asn a mutation that specifically reduces k cat 2 12 Thus evidence suggests that the proapoptotic function of Fhit depends on formation of an E S complex If the substrate dependent signaling model is correct then compound 6b as a nearly isosteric AppppA analog with a low K i may promote Fhit signaling in Fhit cells Compound 12b which one would expect to bind Fhit with bulky phosphorothioate and phosphorothioadenosyl groups interfering with putative effector binding may consequently prove to be antagonistic to Fhit function Ongoing in vitro studies aim to evaluate the stereochemistry of phosphorothioyl binding to Fhit while in vivo studies test the effects of these compounds on programmed cell death Phosphorothioate analogs 6b and 12b that preserve the bridging oxygen but substitute carbon for the phosphorus achieving 65 to 75 fold binding advantages over AppppA are expected to be critical for cell biological characterization Materials and Methods
