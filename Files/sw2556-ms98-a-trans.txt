                uh are you big into lawn and garden work   well um i just bought a home so ive just now went out and purchased my brand new lawn mower and um so ive been assembling it and havent had a chance to get out there and and test it out     well do you is it a new house or   no its um uh its an older home and uh so it already has the the yards already been established um but there have like big oak trees in the front and so the grass is not growing out underneath the oak trees so im have to get out there and do something about that you know spread some seed and fertilizer and stuff   umhum okay i think one of the some of the problems with uh oak trees is their leaves tend to accumulate and they leach a lot of acid into the soil   oh uhhuh   so i found that when i had a uh wooded lot that i needed to put a lot of lime out   oh okay okay   to uh neutralize the uh the acid from the uh oak leaves   umhum uhhuh   but theres still a problem that uh the shade from the trees just uh grass cannot grow   right right right   and uh one of the things that uh we did uh just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees and planted uh pachysandra   umhum oh uhhuh   which is a a shade plant that seems to do well underneath the trees   hm thats an idea   yeah so that saved the bare spots and uh you know also eliminated mowing the uh that area of the lawn   umhum yeah thats true thats true yeah i have um in between the street and the sidewalk see are two of the oak trees   umhum   and then theres one uh sitting on the right uh facing the house on the right hand side in the middle of that whole section and then i have this whole section over there that has nothing in it at all but just just the grass so that may be an idea to do is uh because ive got that concentration of trees right there is to uh you know just do something like what you said was to put some kind of um uh little plants that does well in shade uh the shaded area and forget about you know trying to plant grass and stuff underneath that   umhum   the other thing too is that the oak trees have those acorns and i dont know if im uh going to have to go out there and if i can rake those up or if im going to have to pick them all up by hand or what   i dont think theres its its an impossible task   well i know but if you saw how many acorns were sitting up under there youd see it looks like an impossible task  but we have um um Texas has a lot of the um uh wooden fenced in back yards     umhum   for privacy fence so i did buy a a weed eater too and uh so i could get you know around uh around the wooden fences and um uh you know get all the weeds and stuff up out of there   yeah well one of the things you may need come fall is a leaf blower or a leaf vacuum   umhum umhum umhum   because ive you know my wooded lot at my previous house uh i didnt have to mow the lawn very often because it didnt grow that fast   right   but in the fall i had to spend a couple of weekends out there on you know two separate weekends just getting rid of leaves   umhum wow so what what did you did did you use do you have a blower or did you have the uh the vacuum   well i had a a leaf vacuum to pick them up and uh   umhum   in the front yard i would uh just drive up to the curb and drop them at the curb the uh county had a pickup service for leaves dropped at the curb   huh uhhuh umhum   and for the back i would uh vacuum them up and then put them on a tarp and drag the tarp out front to to dump them   uhhuh wow   and springtime you have to use bags to pack them   uhhuh uhhuh yeah that ive never i dont think ive ever seen um a a vacuum though for the for the lawn i know ive seen the blowers   yeah well uh Craftsman put out a uh leaf vacuum a few years back craftsman Sears and Roebuck   who was it oh Craftsman uhhuh   and uh i think it was about two hundred dollars or something like that it was a very powerful machine   huh   and it would have a tendency to pick up some of the uh acorns if they didnt get uh pressed into the ground   uhhuh ooh thatd be good i think thats thats my problem is i i couldnt believe uh uh because uh i guess the other people they werent really outdoor type people because the lawn really needs to be i have uh bushes and stuff that really need trimming and um so uh so im just thinking how in the world i was going to have to scrape up all those uh acorns that are sitting out there they even have some little trees growing   umhum   because they just left them the acorns i guess sit rather than raking them up um so you know im going to have to get out there and   yeah   but it was interesting i had to go buy a hoe and a rake i mean the whole works because ive ive lived in an apartment for so long ive never had that kind of equipment so that was that was interesting to go down there and and get all that kind of stuff   right yeah its especially delightful moving from an apartment to a house so that you you can have a little piece of turf you can call your own   yeah right right so this has been uh this has been an experience for me and uh uh but i i cant wait until we have uh uh some more time to get out there in the front yard and and really do uh you know a lot of landscaping   umhum   because i want to cut down all the the trees that they or the little shrubs that they have because some of them are like um they have the new uh green leaves i dont if its getting green up there where you are uh but theyre almost fully blossomed and but there are like sides of them where therere like whole dead uh portions of the shrubs   umhum   and uh so ive been debating of whether or not just to cut out the dead portions or you know just to take it all out and i think ive pretty well decided just to take it all out and start all over again   well you better price the new shrubs before you do that   im just going to get the little baby shrubs  the little baby ones you know take several years to grow  there um       umhum   well its not too bad i mean i i i thought they were pretty reasonable but i dont know i have nothing really to compare it with uh you know four or five dollars for a for a shrub   yeah   i dont know and uh i hadnt really wanted to get that many you know to put out there i i much prefer flowers   well my wife got carried away this past year and uh she cleared out a lot of the existing gardens and replanted with new things   umhum umhum   and i think she spent over a thousand dollars on plants and uh and fertilizers and mulch and everything else and its its not hard to go through the money doing that   wow umhum umhum wow its true its true just just picking up the equipment that i have you know and and and i didnt blink an eyelash thats what got to me when the man you know said and thatll be five hundred and something dollars you know with my my big new lawn mower and stuff i was just okay you know so yeah youre right youre right you can i think you can go through quite a bit of money i think it depends too where you buy it from if you buy it from a nursery or um we have like Home Depot here i dont know if you have that there is   umhum we dont have that here weve weve got some uh local nurseries that are pretty fair on price but still in the metropolitan area they they hold a gun to your head while they while you write out your check   yeah local uhhuh there you go thats right thats true i understand that       well it was nice talking to you   all right good luck with your new home   well thank you   and uh nice talking to you   oh okay talk to you bye   bye
