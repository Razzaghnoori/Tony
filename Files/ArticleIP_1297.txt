unsubstantiated rumors the sorts of secrets only supermarket tabloids covet Michiko Kakutani the New York Times Others yawn at Kelley s gossip including speculation that as a newlywed Queen Elizabeth was sex crazed T hose who hoped that the book would be like a royal mistress flirty flighty zesty yeasty will be disappointed Julian Barnes The New Yorker Unwittingly some say Kelley s dirt actually humanizes the starchy Windsors Underworld by Don DeLillo Scribner DeLillo s epic of Cold War America which juxtaposes Russia s atomic bomb with Bobby Thompson s Shot Heard Round the World a Lenny Bruce concert and a lost Sergei Eisenstein film is pronounced a masterwork Tom LeClair the Atlantic Monthly DeLillo wins praise for his witty prose and inventive historical fiction which includes such postwar celebrities as Frank Sinatra and J Edgar Hoover There s pleasure on every page of this pitch perfect evocation of a sour anxious half century Malcolm Jones Jr Newsweek Slate s Walter Kirn is virtually alone in finding the book indulgent and vapid Click here for an excerpt from Underworld Great Apes by Will Self Grove Atlantic Reviews of the latest farce from the British satirist both wince and smirk at its unrelenting scatological humor and unflattering sendups of authors Robert Hughes and Oliver Sacks The book s conceit an artist awakens in a world of monkeys that mirrors modern

Lee captures this garish and confused moment in history with surgical precision David Ansen Newsweek Performances by Kevin Kline Joan Allen and Sigourney Weaver are said to be so solid that they compensate for the unlikability of their characters Lee wins praise for his gently ironic touch in adapting a novel by Rick Moody and for being less interested in assigning blame for all the misery
