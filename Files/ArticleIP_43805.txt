 Machines in the Garden In the animated ecological epic Princess Mononoke the camera travels over landscapes with a clear steady gaze like a Zen hang glider The images have none of the comin at ya pop surrealism of American cartoons many of which have characters that spring out of the frame like jack in the boxes The Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki who spent three years on Princess Mononoke and is reported to have done 70 percent of its paintings himself seems to work from the outside in to begin with the curve of the earth then the mossy hills the watercolor foliage the nubby stones the whorls on the wood the meticulous carvings on a teacup He captures the texture of light and the currents of air You could almost settle down in this landscape A view of nature that some would call tree hugging doesn t feel softheaded when the trees are rendered in such brilliant and robust detail But then soft is not a word you can apply to Princess Mononoke however pantheistic its worldview The film which is rated PG 13 is full of splattery carnage If Miyazaki in long shot is contemplative in close up he s ferocious He s both inside and outside the action He knows when to rock your world and when to induce a state of sorrowful detachment According to the New York Times Toy Story animators screened reels of his work when their imaginations flagged and writers for Star Trek named an alien species after one of his features Watching Princess Mononoke which has been dubbed to Disney Miramax specifications by American and English stars but retains its two hour plus length its gory beheadings and its grim near apocalyptic finale you can understand their worship It isn t that Miyazaki s work is technically so dazzling in this age of digitized miracles it s that everything is sublimely in proportion The movie has a scope that makes Hollywood s homiletic follow your dream fables look even more solipsistic Miyazaki is after nothing less than the moment in our history the film is set in the 14 th and 15 th centuries when the power shifted from a natural world to one shaped by human technology It s the beginning of what Bill McKibben called the end of nature that is when nature became no longer an autonomous self regulating force but one touched and in Miyazaki s view poisoned by human industry The hero Ashitaka a warrior from the isolationist Emishi clan is forced in the first scene to kill a marauding boar a god turned into a demon covered in roiling corrosive worms by an iron ball lodged in its body Infected destined to be consumed by and to die of rage Ashitaka leaves his village in search of the iron ball s source He discovers a fortress cum arms manufacturing plant called Irontown presided over by one of the most complex villains in modern film the regal Lady Eboshi On one hand she s a benevolent industrialist who presides over a warmly matriarchal society on the other she wants to destroy the forest harness its resources and exterminate its animal deities chiefly the Spirit of the Forest a magnificent deer god whose touch brings instant life or death and who transforms at dusk into the towering Night Walker P rincess Mononoke builds to a full scale war between humans and the animal kingdom which does not by the way consist of your father s cartoon critters In fact the boars and apes have little patience with Ashitaka s call for nature and mankind to live together in harmony they d like to eat him The wolf god Moro is slightly more sympathetic but that s because her adopted daughter San a k a Princess Mononoke is human San is first seen sucking a wound of her huge wolf mother then as the gore drips from her mouth training her dark eyes on Ashitaka with feral hatred Her second appearance a lone attack on Irontown to assassinate Lady Eboshi is one of the movie s high points It s Miyazaki s use of sound and silence that takes your breath away the determined tap of the wolf princess s shoes as she scuttles over the fortress s rooftops the silence of Eboshi and her army as they stare at this tiny yet formidable tomboy against the black sky Their battle is so furious that the blades streak and lose definition it s almost subliminal It s a shame that the wolf princess warms up to Ashitaka and spends the rest of the film either saving him or being saved by him She loses that punk bitch allure The voice of Claire Danes doesn t help When Danes says I d do anything to get you humans out of my forest she sounds like a Valley Girl peeved over lack of parking spaces at the mall San needs a more ragged voice I d be interested to hear the original Japanese actress Billy Crudup is just as Disneyfied Miramaxed but that doesn t hurt as much because Ashitaka is conceived from the start as a rather bland ing nu Gillian Anderson s growling Moro sounds silly she doesn t have the breath control and the fey hick tones of Billy Bob Thornton are too recognizable as the Akim Tamiroff like mercenary Jigo But Minnie Driver coming off a triumphantly dizzy Jane in Tarzan once again provides a voice that the animators deserve Bring the strange ah to me late ah she commands in sexy Martian Queen cadences that will stir the loins of Flash Gordon fans everywhere I would like to thank him puh sonally The overfamiliar voices nudge Princess Mononoke closer to its American counterparts but not by a lot There s always something wondrously strange The kodamas are little tree spirits on doughboy bodies They cock their trapezoidal dice heads and emit a series of clicks then their heads pop back with a conclusive rattle Something about them seems just right I could watch them for hours Miyazaki limits their appearances to seconds he doesn t wear out their mystery the way that say George Lucas would And no Hollywood animated feature would end with such a powerful vision of apocalypse as the land is bestridden by a colossus dropping a thick caustic tarlike gel that recalls the post Hiroshima black rain Can you take the kids I think so As Miyazaki said at a New York Film Festival press conference Children understand intuitively that the world they have been born into is not a blessed world Princess Mononoke at least can tell them why A special smile a certain touch So begins the elevator music theme song of Music of the Heart I never had a lot that I loved so much The credits had just started and I was already looking for a barf bag Did Miramax and director Wes Craven have to work so hard to schlockify the story of Roberta Guaspari played here by Meryl Streep whose violin courses in East Harlem elementary schools have become a beacon for such programs nationwide A fabled taskmaster her story was told in the 1996 documentary Small Wonders Guaspari used music as a way to teach self discipline along with the healthy self respect that follows in its wake When the New York school board cut the funding for her program she proved a marvel of self promotion attracting features in all the major dailies and ending up along with her best students at Carnegie Hall for a benefit Fiddlefest along with Itzhak Perlman Isaac Stern and other legendary fiddlers Streep has said that she spent so much of the time on the set learning the violin she doesn t play any instruments that she didn t bring the full force of her acting technique to bear on Roberta Maybe that s why the performance seems so natural Let her always learn an instrument on the set Still she doesn t make much sense of Guaspari The script by Pamela Gray A Walk on the Moon has her students complain of her nastiness and perfectionism but Streep who has made herself look dumpy thick waisted and bedraggled is so busy telegraphing her vulnerability that all we get is dippy niceness Instead of a monument to an individual s iron will Music of the Heart becomes the story of a woman so helpless that she arouses the kindness of strangers Directors of violent genre pieces like Craven who got this mainstream gig in return for doing the Scream sequels or Carl Franklin or Sam Raimi sometimes want so badly to belong to Establishment Hollywood to go to the Academy Awards that they neuter themselves Bending over backward to show how sensitive they can be they forget that violence even if it s just emotional violence belongs in ordinary dramas too Craven does good work with the young actors in the classroom scenes but the film has a reticence common to most biopics and a mushy TV movie humanism that blands out its texture OK I was a puddle after some scenes like the one where Guaspari pushes a student to get her to improve her posture and discovers that the girl is wearing a leg brace But how much more emotional the Carnegie Hall climax would have been if instead of suddenly seeing these East Harlem kids on stage with Perlman Stern Joshua Bell etc we d seen them rehearsing first and struggling to keep up There s too much music of the heart and not enough music of the callused fingers In outline The Limey is a lean little B movie revenge melodrama about a felonious Brit Terence Stamp who s newly sprung from prison and flies to Southern California to get to the bottom of his beautiful daughter s death My name s Wilson Who dunnit The film directed by Steven Soderbergh would be worth seeing just for Stamp s performance at once rock hard and goofily blinkered and for Peter Fonda s wittily self parodic turn as the suspected killer a music producer who coasts on 60s counterculture easiness while his lackeys do the dirty work Oh man he says the fear finally seeping through the ether This is getting all too close to me But the picture s glory is its layered and intricate syntax The dialogue moves ahead there are great gobs of exposition but the images continually double back to Stamp and Lesley Ann Warren as his daughter s acting teacher simply gazing at each other or to Stamp sitting on a plane remembering his daughter as a girl on the beach the lens of his home movie camera creating an eerily bright almost supernatural spot that dances over her face The film s most violent act happens well off screen You hear the distant pop pop pop pop pop of the hero s gun The rest is only half glimpsed fantasized or saturated by memory or is the present the memory Is all of The Limey a temporal hiccup Some including the critic at Time have questioned Soderbergh s sanity But of course Soderbergh flouts time I see a method to his madness Less grandiosely than Harmony Korine in Julien Donkey Boy Soderbergh pores over every scene in search of its essential dramatic gesture He s saying This not all that other stuff is what s important He telegraphs the ending you know the Limey will somehow be at the root of his daughter s death but it s still an emotional wow The climax justifies the technique It says the point of this odyssey isn t revenge but regret for irredeemably blown chances and a tragic waste of love Soderbergh is one of those rare filmmakers who learn on the job Working within a tight genre structure he s discovering hundreds of ways of editing a given scene that can give it the richness of a novel Is he totally successful No he misses now and then which is why the technique sticks out But what a fantastic effort See it and weep for what s missing in most other movies
