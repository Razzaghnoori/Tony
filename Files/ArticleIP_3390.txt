 To Earthward By Robert Frost 1874 1963 posted Wednesday Aug 27 To hear Robert Pinsky read To Earthward click I suppose some readers will be surprised to find such a sexy delicately doom laden poem by Robert Frost as To Earthward In fact Frost is a powerfully erotic writer from early poems like Mowing and on through the disturbances of The Hill Wife The sensuality of To Earthward is acted out by its reaching lingering abrupt or stretched sentences as they tease and cavort with rhyme and line ending The poem is the best lesson I know in what a line of verse is Read it aloud letting your voice continue past the line ending when that is what the syntax wants to do Robert Pinsky Love at the lips was touchAs sweet as I could bear And once that seemed too much I lived on air That crossed me from sweet thingsThe flow of was it muskFrom hidden grapevine springsDown hill at dusk I had the swirl and ache From sprays of honeysuckleThat when they re gathered shakeDew on the knuckle I craved strong sweets but thoseSeemed strong when I was young The petal of the roseIt was that stung Now no joy but lacks saltThat is not dashed with painAnd weariness and fault I crave the stain Of tears the aftermarkOf almost too much love The sweet of bitter barkAnd burning clove When stiff and sore and scarredI take away my handFrom leaning on it hardIn grass and sand The hurt is not enough I long for weight and strengthTo feel the earth as roughTo all my length
