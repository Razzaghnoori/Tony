 Campaign Fund Raising Who s Worse By Franklin Foer Republicans have been making hay over revelations about Democratic fund raising President Clinton asserts that the Republicans have no right to talk They raise more money They raise more foreign money They raise more money in big contributions And we take all the heat It s a free ride Does he have a case The national Republican Party the Republican National Committee the Republican Senate Campaign Committee and the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee does out raise its Democratic counterparts In every two year campaign cycle since 1976 Republicans have brought in more total money During the last cycle through Nov 25 1996 the Republican Party pulled in 548 7 million to the Democrats 332 3 million Campaign finance laws break these contributions into two categories 1 Hard money donations that can be spent directly on candidates Under the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1974 there are strict limits on how much hard money individuals and political action committees can give Corporate and union hard money gifts are banned Here the Republicans have their biggest advantage Last campaign they out raised the Democrats 407 5 million to 210 million 2 Soft money The parties can accept unlimited contributions to pay for activities ambiguously called party building In 1979 legislation that authorized soft money party building referred literally to the cost of building and maintaining a party headquarters as well as general promotional activities for the party But recent court decisions and creative interpretations by the parties themselves have led to a much broader definition Parties now spend the soft money on funding TV ads voter registration drives and get out the vote campaigns Few distinctions remain between the application of hard and soft money The soft money can t be transferred directly into candidates coffers and the ads can t explicitly promote or denigrate a candidate which in practice just means no use of the words vote for or vote against In the last campaign the Democratic Party received 122 4 million in soft dollars and the Republicans received 141 2 million The Republicans edge in soft money reflects their greater success in raising big contributions Soft money is donated primarily by corporations and by individuals and PACs already maxed out on hard money According to the New York Times last year the Democrats had 45 soft money contributions over 250 000 while the Republicans had at least 75 However good government groups like Common Cause and the Center for Public Integrity emphasize that these figures based on reports filed with the Federal Election Commission are deceptive They exclude donations to state parties that are transferred to both federal and nonfederal candidates These donations can be substantial Last week the Washington Post reported that the former Democratic National Committee fund raiser John Huang raised 482 000 through various state parties and Rupert Murdoch donated 1 million to the California Republican Party Union Money Republicans argue that if you count the AFL CIO s spending on behalf of Democratic candidates the Democrats fund raising total surpasses its own Unions gave 4 7 million in soft money to the Democrats and just 800 000 to the Republicans But that is reflected in the soft money totals What isn t reflected is so called independent expenditures on behalf of Democratic candidates Under a 1976 Supreme Court ruling the First Amendment forbids any legal limits on such spending as long as it is truly independent of the candidates and the parties Independent expenditures are not reported to the FEC Republicans say that organized labor spent 200 million to 500 million promoting Democratic candidates last year They cite AFL CIO officials who claim the organization spent 35 million on a radio and television ad campaign alone In addition the unions sponsored voter guides and a get out the vote campaign AFL CIO officials deny spending anything close to the figures that Republicans estimate Similar independent expenditures benefited Republican candidates The U S Chamber of Commerce spent 7 million on advertising in support of GOP candidates the Christian Coalition spent 1 4 million on voter guides promoting conservative candidates and the National Rifle Association put up another 1 5 million that mostly helped Republicans Foreign money travels two routes into party coffers 1 direct contributions by foreign companies and individuals which are flatly illegal and 2 soft money contributions by American subsidiaries of foreign companies Last week the DNC announced that it would no longer accept either type of foreign money However there are currently no federal laws prohibiting the second category But what does Clinton mean when he says the Republicans raise more foreign money If the statement refers to illegal foreign money then his claim lacks evidence In the last campaign cycle Democrats returned 1 5 million in contributions because they may have come illegally from foreigners Republicans have only returned a single check for 15 000 As for legal donations by American subsidiaries Republicans lead in this category as in all corporate receipts But the data are incomplete A study by Common Cause of contributions through Oct 18 showed that the Republicans received 2 4 million from American subsidiaries of foreign companies and the Democrats took in 532 000 The Democrats new prohibition on such contributions is a definitional nightmare Is MCI now owned by British Telecommunications forbidden to give Is Honda of America which has 12 000 employees in Ohio allowed Republicans argue that even though they receive more big contributions the Democrats are more egregious about special favors for contributors The Clinton White House has offered big givers tennis matches with the president at least one coffee with a federal regulator Clinton has admitted that this one was wrong and most notoriously overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom However Republicans also sold social engagements with the president when they controlled the White House and have made a variety of explicit and implicit promises of access to policy makers For instance during the Bush years the RNC enticed donors by offering them rides on Air Force One with the president and Baseball Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams Also the New York Times recently reported on a fund raising letter sent out by the GOP last January guaranteeing 250 000 level donors access to Speaker Gingrich and Republican presidential candidates One party or the other may have a niche where it excels or is especially trouble prone but neither party can claim clear moral superiority
