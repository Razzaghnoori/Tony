 Background The Prisoner s Dilemma PD has generated many hundreds of publications 1 2 spanning the biology moral philosophy sociology economics and political science literature 1 3 4 5 6 It received special attention because it sets paradoxical conditions to examine how and when cooperation can evolve even when a rational player is bound to defect As a result a large body of literature has grown up around the problem of finding optimal strategies for playing the game but the preoccupation with new and improved strategies has sometimes distracted from the main point explaining animal cooperation 7 Recent publications have concentrated on how special conditions such as kin selection 3 iterated interactions 8 spatial structuring 9 or indirect reciprocity through reputation 10 can escape the paradox and lead to evolution of cooperation Other studies pushed the iterated PD concept further to identify optimal strategies when players decisions are not made simultaneously 11 12 13 or when players have payoffs that are not symmetrical 14 Our aim is not to criticise these theoretical developments at all Rather we suggest a reason for why PD may be relatively rare in the first place and therefore point out that such special conditions to permit cooperation despite the PD need not be invoked if the game is not common in nature anyway As Clements Stephens 7 wrote Understanding the ambiguities surrounding the Iterated Prisoner s Dilemma has stimulated 14 years of ingenious biological theorizing Yet despite this display of theoretical competence there is no empirical evidence of non kin cooperation in a situation natural or contrived where the payoffs are known to conform to a Prisoner s Dilemma These authors Clements Stephens were interested in suggesting mutualism as an alternative model of cooperative behaviour to the iterated Prisoner s Dilemma IPD after finding no empirical evidence for the latter in experimental settings Treatments of Prisoners Dilemma and many other types of games assume identical payoff matrices or expected utility for all players However in nature this is highly unlikely In humans for example various studies find outcomes of Prisoner s Dilemma to be dependent on subject to subject variation 2 15 including in personality traits 16 Among animals we expect similar variation to be dependent on expected reproductive consequences of certain outcomes which are of more or less value to individuals depending on their size age sex health condition social status coalition membership expected life span available mates food availability and so on We therefore suggest that the Prisoner s Dilemma may not be a valid model where individual variation in payoffs disrupts the essential structure of the game Our simulations in this paper test what degree of variation cause PD games to become rare Of course capturing the essence of complicated behaviour using simple models is an important step in theory development and it is easy to challenge such models by pointing out elements or complications that are missing However the Prisoner s Dilemma paradigm has become so prevalent in the cooperation literature that it has perhaps not been challenged enough The implicit assumption in the PD game that different individuals do not vary in their payoffs for certain interactions is so fundamentally important that we suggest it may pose a critical problem rather than just another complication for the Prisoner s Dilemma model Once varying payoffs in interactions are considered all such games can be seen to be various special cases of biological markets 17 a set of theories which describe the trade of commodities between individuals and importantly do not constrain utility functions across individuals Goods are commonly valued differently by each actor leading to the focus on zones of potential agreement in the economic literature where transactions occur within a region where individuals approach but do not reach their ideal payoff Indeed payoffs vary in time as well as between individuals cooperation may be the best option under certain circumstances but not under others Such variation is highly dependent on the state of the individual or in other words the identity of both you and your opponent As people for example we all have different utility functions depending on numerous biological and extraneous variables For instance a loan is typically more valuable to the borrower than the lender and in negotiating it the participants represent these highly asymmetrical payoff matrices The classical pay off matrix for the Prisoner s Dilemma defines values which satisfy the required inequality T R P S and R T S 2 18 19 20 The latter inequality is to prevent the possibility that players collude and split the payoffs This denotes the temptation to defect T which is the best option against the reward for mutual cooperation R which is in turn better than mutual defection P with the worst payoff coming from the Sucker s payoff S for cooperating when the opponent defects Hence rational players should always defect regardless of what the opponent does in both a one shot game and for predicted responses over repeated games due to backward induction from an expected final defection leading to the question of why cooperation emerges The game has attracted considerable attention because it seems useful to deduce why humans and animals cooperate in such games when the temptation to defect is the rational solution However before investigating this apparent paradox why should these inequalities of T R P and S and thus this particular game be particularly common If it is not then cooperation may not be surprising or paradoxical after all For example as soon as the sucker s payoff exceeds the punishment for mutual defection S P and everything else stays the same i e T R S P one enters a new game chicken also called the snowdrift or hawk dove game in which one no longer necessarily expects mutual defection 4 Indeed if R T and S P then the game becomes mutualism in which players are expected to cooperate all the time regardless of what the opponent does 7 In support of this view and despite the voluminous literature examples of Prisoner s Dilemma in nature are virtually non existent One of the heralded potential examples predator inspection in shoaling fish 21 has proved something of a controversy 20 Various authors have questioned whether the observed behaviour is cooperation maintained by reciprocity in a Prisoner s Dilemma at all rather than simple by product mutualism 22 or some other mechanism 23 24 In general other candidate models to explain altruism among non relatives have tended to be ignored 19 25 26 and the usefulness of Prisoner s Dilemma as a paradigm for the study of cooperation is beginning to be brought into question 27 Firstly then the particular inequalities of certain games may not be likely anyway But even where they are more importantly we show that variance in payoffs among individuals i e individual specific utility functions can in itself violate the pre requisite inequality of the payoffs in the matrix How high does this variation have to be before such prescribed games become unimportant Results and discussion Model of asymmetry in payoffs If a payoff has an expected mean value of p but residual error variance dependent on the player s utility function then the actual payoff p will be p p Here we assume a normal distribution of errors N 0 2 which means actual payoffs will also be normally distributed p N p 2 The two by two payoff matrix for examples of Prisoner s Dilemma and mutualism games are depicted below with a generic matrix involving T R P and S which will be used henceforth Table 1 The variance 2 for each of four payoff outcomes may vary independently as 2 T 2 R 2 P 2 S where 2 T is the variance of T for example Any one of these can destroy the special conditions for PD Thus PD occurs if and only if T R P S for all two way interactions when T R P S 0 as in previous literature or at least when those variances are small enough not violate the 1 ratios of T R R P and P S Now allowing variations in payoff the actual payoff is the expected payoff plus the variation in utility according to the individual So replacing T R P and S for unique payoff symbols that incorporate both the initial starting payoff and the payoff variance the PD with varying payoffs can be formalised using the variances as described above thus T T R R P P S S The variance in any one term can destroy the special conditions for PD as it could any other prescribed fixed payoff game It is clear then that depending on the relative values of the four payoffs some region of a 3 D phase space with dimensions T R R P and P S will describe valid PD games while other regions will describe other games such as mutualism However both are just certain regions within a larger universe of 24 possibilities in which various other types of symmetric games will be encountered 4 These other undefined regions all represent different potential games so the whole is best described as a market since different individuals meeting each other have different payoff matrices or values for tradable commodities obtained from cooperation or defection 17 28 Prices change according to the relative value to the buyer and investor and since these vary the interactions between members of any one population can move dynamically around the phase space sometimes in and out of special areas such as those defined as the Prisoner s Dilemma If such instances are rare though strategies based on those games are useless Analytical solutions to variations in payoffs A simple varying payoff structure can be analysed intuitively Consider 1000 payoff matrices with fixed payoffs plus normally distributed errors N 0 1 with variance equal to the spacing between the payoffs in an arbitrary PD matrix e g 3 4 5 6 Neighbouring payoffs will overlap and therefore destroy rankings for PD a predictable number of times according to the following logic A PD payoff matrix exists in which payoff X 1 must be ranked above payoff X 2 e g T and R or P and S If the distribution of the higher payoff X 1 is N 1 1 and the lower payoff X 2 N 0 1 then the probability of these two payoffs swapping rank is P X 2 X 1 0 Subtracting the two distributions X 1 X 2 gives another normal distribution X 1 2 N 1 2 means are subtracted variances summed according to standard theory 29 with which we can test the exact probability that payoffs X 1 and X 2 swap ranks This probability is P X 2 X 1 0 or equivalently P X 2 X 1 Since in a normal distribution the probability P X x P Z x where is the distribution mean the standard deviation and Z the standard normal variable 29 the probability the lower payoff is higher than the higher payoff when both vary as N 0 1 is 1 P Z 0 1 2 1 P Z 0 707 1 0 76 0 24 Thus any neighbouring pair of payoffs will overlap 24 of the time However since there are a total of four payoffs that can overlap in this way there are three separate inequalities where a rank change can occur Thus the value we want to know is the probability of at least one rank change occurring in a 2 2 matrix The solution to this turns out to be unattainable analytically since the probability of each rank change is not independent and thus it requires solving integrals for four distributions conditional on two unknowns An equation based on Bayes Theorem cannot therefore be solved However the solution can be found instead by simulation Simulations of variance in payoffs a Basic simulation To begin we consider a p p 1 p 2 p 3 matrix to equalise payoff intervals Each simulation drew 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 and added these as normally distributed random errors to the fixed payoffs in 1000 matrices Next we calculated all T R R P and P S values and determined the number of matrices which retained the correct rank structure for PD i e those in which all ratios 1 Means and standard deviations of valid PD matrices were calculated from 5 simulations of 1000 matrices per model The payoff ratios can be investigated graphically Figure 1 but only in 2 dimensions so two graphs are shown For PD a matrix must satisfy the requirement that all ratios are 1 There were only 376 valid PD matrices out of 1000 in this case 3 4 5 6 Thus only 37 6 of matrices were valid Prisoner s Dilemmas Figure 2 i e meeting the condition of all three inequalities We also simulated results for a typical payoff matrix that is often cited in the literature 0 1 3 5 1 30 Only 633 2 of the 1000 matrices 63 3 were valid Prisoner s Dilemmas b Simulations with different amounts of variation Different amounts of variation can be equated with changes in payoff intervals increasing the former is the same as decreasing the latter The more different payoffs are from each other the more random variation would be required to cause rank changes This is demonstrated in the simulations in which relative variation was increased on a base matrix of 3 4 5 6 through decreasing payoff intervals by 1 0 0 5 to 0 25 increments Figure 2 The percentage of valid PD cases decreased from 37 6 to 15 8 to 9 1 In other words a PD matrix occurs only 15 8 of the time when the variance is twice the payoff interval c Simulations with different linearity of payoffs intervals The effect is insensitive to changes in absolute values but not to the linearity of the payoff intervals In this simulation we varied one of the parameters the spacing between payoffs hereafter payoff interval As payoff intervals increase the variance of the normally distributed errors becomes relatively less important and cause less rank changes since overlaps are less likely when payoffs are more separated from each other Where this is manifested only at one end of the payoff ranking sequence i e where there is non linearity in payoff intervals such as 0 1 3 5 the largest intervals are more immune to rank changes relative to the more bunched up payoffs Therefore fewest rank changes will occur in linear sequences with large payoff intervals This is demonstrated in the simulations in which the linearity of payoffs was distorted Figure 2 This was simulated by increasing payoffs from intervals of all 1 0 matrix 3 4 5 6 to intervals of 1 0 2 0 2 0 matrix 0 1 3 5 and 3 4 6 8 and doubling the payoffs of the latter matrix to intervals of 5 0 4 0 4 0 matrix 3 8 12 16 The percentage of valid PD cases increased from 38 0 to 61 7 to 99 5 Conclusions Although people commonly look for or frame various observed scenarios within a Prisoner s Dilemma the game will not always occur unless variation in payoffs is low This assumption is rarely if ever tested We have demonstrated that starting from a common Prisoner s Dilemma payoff structure relatively small amounts of variation drastically reduce the proportion of matrices that still conform to Prisoner s Dilemma Moreover while variance in payoff can violate the required inequalities of payoffs for a valid PD matrix a PD game between two individuals is invalid if just a single individual has an invalid PD matrix Thus while we cited PD matrix violations valid PD games are even less likely still Figure 2 because they are the product of the independent probabilities of each individual having a PD matrix For example using the popular 0 1 3 5 matrix where the payoff variance is equal to the smallest payoff interval a proportion of only 0 633 2 0 400 games will be valid Prisoner s Dilemmas This effect is greatly enhanced in the 3 4 5 6 matrix where the proportion of valid games will be 0 376 2 0 141 Doubling the variance leaves only 0 158 2 0 025 of valid PD games Therefore relatively small variations may be enough to discard PD as a useful model to apply Certainly researchers may need to revise critical significance values in applying statistical methods to determine if PD occurs in a study population As an example animals which cooperate to remove ectoparasites from each other by allogrooming have formerly been thought to be in a Prisoner s Dilemma 31 32 However because ectoparasite burdens vary greatly among individuals in European badgers Meles meles some individuals are recorded as having no ectoparasites while others can have over 100 the relative payoffs for different strategies and therefore the game individuals find themselves in will depend on the relative differences between actors 33 In the case of the badgers ectoparasites carry lethal diseases so coming into contact to engage in cooperative allogrooming carries the risk of further contamination as well as the prospect of having one s own ectoparasites removed This suggests that one s relative ectoparasite burden in comparison to that of a potential partner in the game will determine the game and consequently whether one should cooperate or not 33 Other examples support the idea that payoff variation may be key to resolving the emergence of cooperation in supposed Prisoner s Dilemmas A recent study of cooperative territorial defence in lions Panthera leo described the correct ranking structure for a Prisoner s Dilemma 34 35 However cooperators did not retaliate against defectors Instead they carried on cooperating with them in future interactions ruling out the tit for tat or Pavlov strategies 8 and implying that they did not experience the Prisoner s Dilemma despite the apparent PD matrix 35 Interestingly individual strategies already varied between individuals in the population and furthermore experimental manipulation caused individuals to change their strategies in unpredictable ways That is they did not conform to the predictions of how they should have reacted according to the Prisoner s Dilemma Two other popular examples fit our implicit prediction that PD is more likely to occur if payoffs are fixed First the single uncontested example of PD in nature arises in the interactions of bacteriophages 36 37 simple RNA structures for which payoff variation among individuals is unlikely because of their uniform architecture uniform at least in comparison to higher organisms Second a famous example of PD comes from the trench warfare of World War I 1 in which opposing lines of troops preferred to cooperate in maintaining a local peace rather than risk death in mutual defection and reversion to reciprocated attacks Since payoffs for each individual were derived in terms of risk of death variation among soldiers preference orderings was unlikely But even if not this was essentially a game between groups not individuals so the payoff matrix is also for the group and should tend towards constant mean values due to the Central Limit Theorem It is interesting to briefly consider public goods games given that they are essentially a generalization of PD to several players in a group In such situations variation in payoffs among individual players is again likely to affect the outcome and the probability of cooperation On the negative side some individuals may not incur such a high cost for initiating widespread defection in subsequent games On the positive side other individuals may incur relatively lower costs in contributing to the public good resulting in a better overall outcome for the group even if some defectors persist Prisoner s Dilemmas could be argued to reemerge even where payoffs vary widely because of the fact that adjacent payoffs will sometimes turn out to be very far apart rather than being very close together and overlapping However this will not salvage the situation as a Prisoner s Dilemma game because the crucial criterion remains exclusively whether there are changes in the payoffs rank order Absolute values of payoffs will not alter the game itself Of course if certain payoffs were systematically very large and distant from other payoffs e g if there were a very large temptation to defect T relative to R then this may produce an enhanced selection pressure for strategies that perform as though they are within a Prisoner s Dilemma even if the game is not valid 100 of the time But this logic is unlikely to hold because if payoffs do indeed vary then the variation itself will prevent such events from being systematic In other words overlaps between payoffs will occur as often as large intervals between them but only the former alter the actual game experienced Furthermore simulations have shown that differing values of T do not influence dominant strategies 12 Further studies are needed to investigate what happens when variable matrices meet each other For example if rank changes are common do players playing one type of game in a population of mixed games tend overall to encourage or discourage cooperation in their neighbours Or since optimal choices would be highly dependent on the identity of players can single dominant strategies still be devised to deal effectively with opponents with variable payoffs and therefore with unpredictable strategies Indeed celebrated strategies such as tit for tat 1 or win stay lose shift 8 may not be robust enough to evolve wherever PD occurs in the best case in less than in 100 of the games played within a population We end by reiterating the sentiments of Clements Stephens 7 Mutualism and the Prisoner s Dilemma represent end points of a range of conceivable cooperative situations Perhaps it is time to explore the rich set of possibilities between mutualism and the Prisoner s Dilemma Certainly with all the intense research and enthusiastic application of PD to real world situations we may expect that we should have observed more convincing empirical support by now if it ever were to hold as a paradigm befitting to it s immense theoretical appeal We suggest that the concept of biological markets provides a good alternative framework for modelling variable games 1 17 28 38 At the least future studies should justify the assumption of zero payoff variation given the importance of its implications Finally while we have pointed out that the PD game can be upset by payoff variation it remains for future research to probe the question of whether and how noisy payoff
