 Flat Tax Flap Subject Pampering the wealthy No Fairness From Andrew Sullivan Re Date Fri Jan 14 It s a fair cop I think all taxpayers should pay the same rate of tax I also think that equal treatment by government is a useful idea in the resuscitation of liberalism Go figure But I m not a wealthy pamperer Because today s punitive tax system means you pay disproportionately more the richer you are simply moving to an equal system inevitably gives a break to the rich I didn t hide this in the New York Times Magazine piece I said so explicitly But that doesn t mean I give the rich special favors I give them the same favors as everyone else and by combining a flat tax with tax reform take away large numbers of their goodies for good measure Surowiecki is right in saying that technology makes complicated things simpler to enforce but it s also true that in our very complicated world the simple is beautiful mantra has increasing cultural appeal My point is not that the 40 000 page tax code isn t easier to enforce with technology It is My point is that the increasing cultural attractiveness of one click purchasing increases the cultural attractiveness of one rate taxation A subjective impression but a valid one I think If Surowiecki clambered out of his paleo liberal redistributist mindset he might get it To reply click here Andrew Sullivan is a senior editor at the New Republic and contributing editor to the New York Times Magazine Subject Re Pampering the Wealthy No Fairness From James Surowiecki Re Date Mon Jan 17 Sullivan invokes the mantra of equal treatment as if it s an argument ender But treating people unequally when they re not equal is you might say what social justice is all about Old people get Social Security and Medicare Poor people get Medicaid Young people get Head Start and free public school and free school lunches and later interest free college loans Workers at the bottom of the pay ladder are guaranteed a minimum wage Wage earners are paid overtime while salaried workers are not Unemployed people get unemployment insurance Perhaps Sullivan thinks all these too are examples of paleo liberalism I d say they re examples of liberal ideas that enjoy the support of the vast majority of Americans as does the progressive tax Most Americans believe that once you make a certain amount of money each additional dollar matters less and therefore society has a larger claim on it Most Americans think there s a difference between making 50K a year and making 2 million a year and that the state does well to recognize that difference Sullivan doesn t think this which is fine He just shouldn t pretend that the flat tax has anything to do with liberalism To reply click here James Surowiecki writes Moneybox To read an unedited

inconsistency of her own position Claiming that we are products not just of evolution but also of what we imagine ourselves to be Culturebox decries the classroom teaching of the evolutionary roots of rape even as a prelude to explaining the hows and whys of resisting those roots on the grounds that t he first message to be drilled into boys heads would be We believe you re genetically programmed to rape The inevitable consequence criminal lawyers composing their genetic determinist defenses Why even the state said he couldn t help himself Apparently in Culturebox s eyes if we imagine ourselves to be rational sensible creatures capable of distinguishing between biological drives and moral imperatives it won t help us one bit we ll still be compelled by our natures to view objective descriptions of those drives as moral justifications for giving in to them Now Culturebox may well be correct that hungry young males or hungry old defense attorneys or jurors of all ages and appetites are incapable of resisting the temptation of tout comprendre tout pardonner But if so then it is hardly a triumph for her preferred willed culture over the animal model rather it is a subtler richer application of the evolutionary psychologists fundamentally wise observation that social institutions fail unless they treat humans as the instinct driven creatures they are and avoid pretending that they are the self defining logical and aesthetic intellects that Culturebox would like them to be After all if we could truly will our culture to meet our ideals then we could tell our citizens the Darwinian truth and the moral Truth without fearing that human nature will inevitably confuse the two To reply click here Subject Re Culturebox Protects Us From Ourselves From Judith Shulevitz Re Date Fri Jan 14 Dan Simon misses my point I m arguing that by teaching boys about the so called evolutionary roots of rape we are not teaching them the truth We re teaching them a deliberately diminished view of human nature that has been useful in helping scientists establish long overdue connections between human and animal psychology but that is not the end all and be all of who we are what we do and why we do it In other words evolutionary psychology is a reductivist fiction good at helping scientists point out a few interesting and as yet not well understood analogies between animal and human behavior Teaching a bunch of unsophisticated boys that this helpful little fiction is the gospel truth that men are driven to rape because their genes tell them to as if we really knew why some men rape and others don t as if we were in possession of the complete truth about human motivation as if we had the information to say authoritatively X occurs because of Y is at best naive at worst arrogant and irresponsible To reply click here Judith Shulevitz is Slate s New York editor and writes Culturebox Subject The Sopranos Are Jerseyites Before Mobsters From Gerarld Marzorati Re Date Tue Jan 18 I was a little disappointed you two didn t get beyond the mob and move on to North Jersey which I think is close to the heart of what makes The Sopranos interesting There is something about the place that makes it special and not only because I grew up there It could be its long multi ethnic history it was polyglot even in colonial times It could be its strange and thick class co mingling wherein somebody in waste management gets to live in a town with country club types Where come summer everybody heads to the shore And can we get the Sopranos to the shore for an episode or two please But whatever the explanation North Jersey is a place where people wear their ethnic identity but lightly and where the working class has created such a strong pop culture of its own the football Giants the all night diners Springsteen the boardwalk at the shore that even those with money continue to cling to it rather than embrace elite culture They don t go to Martha s Vineyard they just get a bigger house at the shore So what I m saying is that The Sopranos is as much about Jersey as it is about the mob and if you don t like it hey who fuckin asked you anyway To
