        okay Howard what do you think of our space budget and should we go ahead and        and keep exploring or should we call a halt to it is it doing any good   i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country now i think what we made a major wrong turn we went into the uh to the current generation of space craft the reusable ones like they are now   umhum   because they have not proven as reliable as they should have and i think some of the earlier approaches were much more um much better in many ways however um you know weve gained an awful lot from the space program all the way from remote monitoring to Teflon to uh some new space age materials plastics and all that so i think its been a good investment uh somebody was telling me the return was about twenty five or thirty dollars for every dollar spent   oh really   which is amazing for any governmental financed program   i wish the post office just stop raising our rates um   oh yes wish our post office could do that thats right i wish theyd just deliver stuff   i think though that now that were finally starting to get over the fears and the uh oh i dont know the guilt that we had out of uh Challenger i think maybe we can pick up and go on now but   umhum   i i dont know i dont think were really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives   i agree   the space station is where we should go   i agree seems like that weve kind of gotten side tracked with   at this point   putting all these different things up there to monitor and  you know and im in favor of you know getting closer to seeing certain things but id like to see them also go you know go back up there see you know what they can do see about setting a a space station up im all in favor of the space program and i dont think we should stop and i dont think we should cut the money   well where do you think we ought to go with it   um   you talking about uh uh a a fully manned space station that well keep up there   yeah i would like id like to see that id like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and and see whats going on even if you know theres no life up there or anything you know but who knows and i would like to see them do something like that   well you   i i hate to see them just you know keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things and i think they i think they lose sight of of part of what theyre supposed to be doing   well i think about half the missions now are are military related are they not   yes yes   and uh   i believe they are   it seems like its that high a percentage   you know lets go back to our original thing with you know the right experiments and our uh you know our actual exploring of space and and all that and you know with with Russia uh seemingly not going to be as as big a threat   well they cant afford to   huhuh you know and have you gone out to uh Fort Worth to see the space Soviet space exhibit   no we were talking about that this weekend we its only going to be there a couple more weeks we need to go   umhum umhum we went uh we took our grandsons and went uh       the weekend before last and it is marvelous i mean its really neat how they they have done it they have done a beautiful job   have they   and they have a uh scaled down model showing how they you know fuel it or you know how they uh oh the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they uh all those things that are against the actual space mission uh space ship you know how they fall away from it and the loading and then and then its actually you know the smoke comes out like its taking off it is really interesting   oh yes well maybe i need to run out there this weekend   you really do it its well worth the time and effort we went uh early on Sunday we got out there about uh ten ten thirty and beat   now do you have to have tickets ahead excuse me   no we bought tickets there and if you have children if you go to McDonalds you could they have coupons or did have now they may be through with them now that uh buy one adult and one child gets in free     um i think both of both of my kids are too old for that   oh okay oh okay you have teenagers or something yes well i had grandchildren so three of them so between their mother and their grandfather and i because their dad was at work and uh   theyre both uh yes yes but you   but and the boys loved it you know they really did like it   its its very impressive im sure   uhhuh it is and i felt the uh six year old would you know that hed be kind of bored but he wasnt even the three year old enjoyed it because they had one of those had one of those moon vehicles   what umhum   and had it set up like it was on the moon and and showed it moving around and stuff so it was really neat   well see now thats something else the uh Russians have had space stations manned stations space stations for years now you you know they had the MIRV   umhum umhum   and see weve yet to keep anyone up over  over a week or ten days   right well in going through it i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead
