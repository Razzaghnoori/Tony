 Background Ribozymes whose activities are modulated by effector molecules have previously been engineered For example Herschlag and co workers have previously shown that a nucleobase could complement an abasic site within the hammerhead ribozyme restoring cleavage activity 1 Similarly Porta and Lizardi engineered a hammerhead ribozyme that assumed an inactive secondary structure upon the addition of an oligonucleotide that disrupted the engineered secondary structure the ribozyme was activated 2 More recently it has previously been shown that many selected nucleic acid binding species aptamers undergo conformational changes upon ligand binding 3 4 5 6 In addition when aptamers are conjoined to ribozymes the ligand induced conformational changes in the aptamers frequently modulate the structures and hence the activities of the ribozymes 7 8 9 For example binding of theophylline to the anti theophylline aptamer 10 modulates the conformation of residue 11 12 and the overall stability of the aptamer 10 13 Appending the anti theophylline aptamer to the hammerhead ribozyme allowed cleavage activity to be modulated by 110 fold by theophylline 13 Similarly appending the anti theophylline aptamer to a small ribozyme ligase L1 generated an aptazyme that was activated 1 600 fold by saturating theophylline concentrations 14 The methods for engineering and selecting Group I aptazymes appear to be generalizable to several different types of ribozymes Adjoining aptamers to the Group I self splicing intron would potentially allow the control of splicing not only in vitro but in vivo To this end we have attempted to generate and assay Group I aptazymes Results and Discussion Design of Group I aptazymes In order to convert the Group I self splicing intron to a regulatable aptazyme it was necessary to first identify sequences or structures in the ribozyme whose conformation might modulate splicing activity The structural and kinetic properties of the Group I self splicing intron from the thymidylate synthase td gene in bacteriophage T4 have been extensively studied In particular a series of nested deletions of the P6 stem loop have been shown to partially or completely compromise ribozyme activity 15 More importantly either magnesium or the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase from Neurospora mitochondria CYT18 can suppress many of these defects 16 17 Previous studies with other introns have also revealed that deletion of the P5 stem loop can modulate ribozyme activity 18 19 We hypothesized that sites where deletions modulated ribozyme activity might also prove to be sites where aptamer conformational changes would modulate ribozyme activity Based on these studies we designed a series of Group I aptazymes in which the anti theophylline aptamer was substituted for either a portion of P6 or P5 Figure 1 The anti theophylline aptamer was attached at the same point as had previously proven successful in the design of theophylline dependent cleavases and ligases 13 14 Activation in vitro The self splicing activities of the Group I aptazymes were examined in vitro using a standard splicing assay Table 1 Magnesium had previously been shown to suppress structural defects in the td intron and ligand induced suppressions of splicing defects were examined by carrying out splicing reactions at either low 3 mM stringent or high 8 mM permissive magnesium concentrations 15 Several of the constructs were either relatively inactive e g Th3P6 Th5P6 and Th6P6 or did not consistently show differential splicing activity e g Th4P6 and Th2P5 However four of the constructs Th1P6 Th2P6 Th3P6 and Th1P5 showed good activity 10 of wild type and increased self splicing in the presence of theophylline For example Th2P6 showed the greatest activation 8 fold at 8 mM MgCl 2 while Th1P5 showed low activation 1 2 fold at both magnesium concentrations For all of the aptazymes except Th3P6 the ligand induced splicing activity was greater in a standard assay at the more stringent 3 mM magnesium concentration Table 1 The construct Th3P6 was inactive at lower magnesium concentrations but underwent ligand induced splicing at the more permissive concentration 8 mM Interestingly those aptazyme constructs that showed ligand dependent activity closely resembled the original deletion variants that showed magnesium dependent recovery of splicing activity For example the junction between the aptamer and the Group I ribozyme in the aptazyme Th2P6 resembled the deletion variant td P6 6 the aptazyme was activated by theophylline while the splicing defect of the deletion variant at 3 mM magnesium was suppressed by 8 mM magnesium or by stabilization of a tetraloop sequence that capped the P6 helix 15 Defects that poise a ribozyme between active and inactive conformers have previously been used to engineer effector dependence 20 The kinetics of splicing of two of the most activated variants Th1P5 and Th2P6 were examined in the presence and absence of theophylline Figure 2 As in the single point assays the theophylline dependence of the engineered introns was readily apparent Figure 2a The time courses reveal that the extents of splicing of the aptazymes were significantly affected by the addition of theophylline Figures 2b 2c The aptazyme modified at P5 Th1P5 showed less theophylline dependent enhancement of the extent of reaction than the aptazyme modified at P6 Th2P6 consistent with the single point assays described above Th1P5 was activated 1 4 fold at 15 minutes Figure 2b while Th2P6 showed a 4 0 fold rate enhancement at 15 minutes Figure 2c These levels of ligand dependent activation were similar to those observed with the original hammerhead aptazyme constructs 21 and it may prove possible to use in vitro selection to further optimize activation 13 14 However when the time course data were fit with a single exponential equation the rates of the initial reactions turned out to be very similar in both the presence and absence of theophylline Table 2 Based on these results the primary mechanism of activation is likely the same as has been observed for other aptazymes ligand induced conformational changes that stabilize functional ribozyme sequences and structures However the Group I self splicing intron is a much more complicated ribozyme than either the hammerhead or the L1 ligase for example the tertiary structure of the Group I intron is established by a complicated folding pathway 22 23 24 25 26 Therefore it was possible that theophylline binding influenced the overall folding pathway of the engineered Group I aptazyme In order to assess this possibility we examined the theophylline dependence of Th2P6 splicing reactions in vitro following prolonged incubation 30 minutes to allow for re folding No significant change in the extent of ligand dependent activation was observed following pre incubation data not shown These results argue that both GTP and theophylline may need to be present to influence the folding pathway of the engineered Group I aptazymes These results are also consistent with previous physical 27 and kinetic 28 29 30 data that shows that the folding of the Group I intron is dependent in part upon GTP Gene regulation in vivo Each of the successful aptazyme constructs was subsequently cloned into an interrupted thymidylate synthase gene in place of the parental td self splicing intron The vectors were introduced into an E coli strain C600ThyA Kan R that lacked a functional thymidylate synthase gene and that was a thymidine auxotroph When bacteria grown in rich media were subsequently plated on minimal media lacking thymidine no colony growth was observed with the exception of Th1P5 However when theophylline 7 5 mM was included in the minimal media bacteria containing the intron Th2P6 formed colonies and bacteria containing the intron Th1P5 showed increased growth Figure 3 All introns that originally showed no or low splicing in vitro including Th3P6 could not rescue bacteria either in the presence or absence of theophylline Finally no growth was observed in a negative control that contained a non functional Group I intron B11 and no theophylline dependent changes in growth were observed in a negative control in which mutations were introduced into the aptazyme to abolish theophylline binding Th2P6 D Interestingly no growth was observed for bacteria harboring the intron Th1P6 despite the fact that this aptazyme showed the greatest activation by theophylline in vitro The plating results were consistent and reproducible over a variety of experiments To better characterize the influence of the effector on intron splicing we also carried out a series of growth experiments in liquid culture Figure 4a An overnight bacterial culture that contained the td gene divided by the aptazyme Th2P6 was inoculated into fresh minimal media effector was added and growth was continuously monitored As expected based on growth assays on solid media little growth was observed in the absence of theophylline However when theophylline 0 5 mM was added to liquid medium bacteria grew almost as well as a control in which the parental intron was inserted into the td gene Most importantly bacterial growth was not activated by the structurally related effector caffeine i e 7 methyltheophylline the anti theophylline aptamer is known to discriminate between caffeine and theophylline by a factor of 10 000 fold 10 No effector dependent growth differences were observed with cultures containing td genes divided by the non functional Group I intron B11 Similar results were obtained with cultures that contained the td gene divided by the aptazyme Th1P5 Figure 4b However in this instance there was some background growth of uninduced bacteria consistent with the higher level of background splicing activity in vitro If theophylline is regulating intron splicing in vivo then the extent of bacterial growth should be dependent upon the concentration of theophylline introduced into the media Figure 4c However theophylline was toxic to bacteria and caused a decrease in the growth of bacteria containing the parental td intron at concentrations greater than 0 5 mM Consistent with this observation low concentrations of theophylline progressively increased bacterial growth by activating the td intron while concentrations of theophylline above 2 mM progressively decreased bacterial growth although levels of growth were still well above background These results were all consistent with the hypothesis that theophylline regulates intron splicing in vivo To further probe whether this was in fact the case mRNA was isolated from E coli treated with theophylline or not and RT PCR was used to confirm the presence of spliced introns Figure 5 For each of the introns known to be responsive to theophylline in vivo Th2P6 and Th1P5 an increase in spliced mRNA was observed while most other introns that were not responsive to theophylline in vivo did not show an increase in the levels of spliced mRNA An exception to this was Th1P6 which originally showed theophylline dependent splicing in vitro and also showed theophylline dependent splicing in vivo However Th1P6 did not mediate theophylline dependent growth The bacterial mRNAs were extracted cloned and sequenced and half of them appeared to use a cryptic splice site Several discrepancies were noted between intron activation in vitro and effector dependent growth This is not surprising other studies have revealed that there is often little correlation between ribozyme activity in vitro and in vivo 31 However since it is known that relatively small changes in gene expression can greatly affect the metabolism of an organism another possible explanation for the apparent discrepancies is that relatively small modulations in intron splicing are amplified via cellular metabolism to yield growth phenotypes This would seem especially true in the current set of experiments since the modulation of Thymidylate Synthase expression is known to greatly affect thymidine levels and cell growth 32 For example E coli that are starved for thymine quickly die a phenomenon known as thymineless death 33 In this respect Group I aptazymes that may have yielded lower amounts of functional Thymidylate Synthase e g Th3P6 which was less active than Th2P6 or Th1P6 which mis spliced did not allow bacterial growth In contrast aptazymes that may have yielded even modestly greater amounts of functional Thymidylate Synthase e g Th1P5 which was both highly active and modestly activated in vitro allowed bacterial growth Effector specificity In order to examine effector specificity in vivo a new series of Group I aptazymes was constructed in which the anti theophylline aptamer was mutated to bind 3 methylxanthine 3MeX2P6 34 These variants proved to be responsive to 3 methylxanthine both in vitro and in vivo Figure 6a However the variants were no longer responsive to theophylline nor were they responsive to a variety of other analogues including caffeine 1 methylxanthine 7 methylxanthine 1 3 dimethyl urilic acid hypoxanthine xanthine and theobromine Figure 6b In contrast the original aptamer was known to also bind 3 methylxanthine and the original Group I aptazyme Th2P6 also proved to be responsive to 3 methylxanthine in vivo Figure 6c Thus the responsivity of the aptazymes in vivo appears to mirror their effector specificity in vitro Applications The ability to engineer Group I introns to be responsive to effector molecules has numerous potential applications For example it may prove possible to develop new gene therapies in which patients rely upon drugs that can differentially activate gene expression rather than having to rely upon a set level of endogenous expression of an introduced gene Similarly it may prove possible to use effector dependent splicing to more finely monitor gene expression in vivo A drug could be localized to particular organs cells or organelles and splicing of the aptazyme could be monitored via a reporter gene such as luciferase It is also possible to imagine that engineered introns introduced into reporter genes may find application in high throughput cell based screening assays that monitor drug uptake or efficacy These strategies should prove useful not only for self splicing introns activated by drugs but for introns activated by proteins or peptides In this regard it is notable that some natural Group I introns have proven to be highly dependent upon protein cofactors 35 and that Group I introns have been engineered whose tertiary structure and activity is dependent upon a peptide 36 Such applications could also be melded with other innovations dependent upon the Group I self splicing intron such as the introduction of a trans splicing intron that can potentially repair or modulate the expression of a given mRNA 37 38 39 Conclusions Group I aptazymes that were dependent upon theophylline both in vitro and in vivo were engineered by conjoining the thymidylate synthase td intron with an anti theophylline aptamer Although the in vitro activation of splicing was modest up to an 18 fold change in initial rate this change was more than enough to mediate the survival of a thymidine dependent E coli strain The ligand specificity of the anti theophylline aptamer carried over to the theophylline dependent aptazyme and no activation was seen with caffeine which differed by a single methyl group from theophylline The effector specificity could be rationally changed by changing the specificity of the conjoined aptamer when a mutation was introduced into the anti theophylline aptamer that led to discrimination against theophylline and in favor of 3 methylxanthine that also differed from theophylline by a single methyl group the aptamer became solely responsive to 3 methylxanthine in vivo Group I aptazymes may have a number of important biotechnology applications including use as in vivo real time reporters and as regulatable gene therapeutics Methods E
