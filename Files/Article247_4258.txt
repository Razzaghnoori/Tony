 Clich s of 1999 in Review Introduction Chatterbox s request that readers submit nominations for the First Annual Joseph Heller Memorial Clich Contest yielded a huge response What explains Web readers great interest in clich s Perhaps it s a rebellion against the printing press a technology whose usefulness is now being challenged by the Internet Clich which according to the Oxford English Dictionary is French for to click refers to the striking of melted lead in order to obtain a proof or cast That is it describes a process of printmaking in which a metal plate is cast from something else a woodcut a plaster mold and then used to make copies The English term for this process is stereotype which has acquired a similar pejorative meaning Of course Web aficionados should take care not to be too scornful of the old style printing press s capacity to reproduce images ad absurdum since the Web has vastly expanded it Indeed it s quite possible that in the next century the terms clich and stereotype will be supplanted by new terms derived from the Internet We may find ourselves saying I m sick to death of html like be there in a San Jose minute or Androids resent being homepaged as unfeeling simply because they re manufactured rather than born In the meantime clich obsessed readers may wish to consult the many clich oriented sites available on the Web These include the Clich Finder The Book of Clich s Cirque de Clich Steve s Clich s Sports Clich s Movie Clich s Dutch Clich s and the Web page of David Clich an official of Canada s Quebecois party A Word About Method Although some readers submitted citations along with their entries per Chatterbox s request most did not Also readers methods for counting citations varied greatly some used Nexis some used Dow Jones News Retrieval some used Yahoo and so on In the end Chatterbox took the advice of reader Josh Green a graduate of Northwestern s Medill School of Journalism which every summer calculates the year s biggest political clich by using the search engine for the Congressional Record Chatterbox took the better entries from readers and plugged them into the Record s search engine to see how often they were uttered in Congress between Jan 1 and Dec 27 1999 And the Winner Is Inappropriate submitted by Thomas E Ricks defense reporter for the Washington Post and author of Making the Corps This term made more appearances in the Congressional Record 382 than any other word or phrase nominated at least among the ones Chatterbox bothered to check Inappropriate easily outstripped evil a word that appeared in the Congressional Record a mere 250 times though William Bennett Gertrude Himmelfarb and other denouncers of moral relativism take note it still lagged behind wrong which appeared in excess of 999 times the CR search engine doesn t count beyond three digits What was inappropriate in 1999 The designation of several non emergency categories of spending as emergency spending according to a resolution submitted by Sens Phil Gramm Olympia Snowe and Russell Feingold proposed oil drilling along the California coast according to Rep Randy Duke Cunningham Bill Clinton s relationship with Monica Lewinsky according to a resolution submitted by several Democratic senators lots of arts funded by the National Endowment for the Arts according to Rep Ron Packard sex between children and adults according to a House resolution endorsed by just about everybody that apparently came out of a broadcast by radio therapist Dr Laura Schlessinger and many many other things It must be said however that the rate at which Congress is deeming things inappropriate is down slightly from the 1997 8 session when during a two year period the word inappropriate appeared in the CR 824 times To hold steady inappropriate would have had to appear 412 times Runners up At the end of the day is a phrase that drove several Slate readers bonkers this year Chatterbox had thought it old hat it dates back at least to the Bush administration but the phrase appeared 272 times in the CR database for 1999 ranking it second among all submissions That s an increase in its frequency of appearance over the previous congressional session when the word was uttered only 401 times during a two year period At this rate lawmakers will end up talking about the end of the day 544 times before the current session ends in Dec 2000 Many thanks to readers Bill Moran Darren Thorneycroft and Nicholas Lemann author of The Big Test for flagging this one Robust came in third among words and phrases submitted 220 citations in the CR and unlike the previous two it seems to be a genuinely new clich at any rate Chatterbox hadn t previously been aware of its overuse Like at the end of the day its use is on the upswing one might even call it robust with only 336 citations during the previous congressional session According to John Burke who submitted robust it is The most overused overworked hackneyed word in the cliche ridden vocabulary of pols and their speechwriters D C bureaucrats think tank thinkers pundits and even lowly working reporters condemned to write about legislation and policy making You know everything has to be robust now a robust foreign policy a robust national defense a robust air attack on Serbia a robust police crackdown a robust anti drug policy a robust investigation of abuses Most political activities are robust too a robust campaign a robust fundraising program a robust reponse to critics a robust position on you name it Agreed Clich s to watch in 2000 Many excellent nominations failed to garner as many CR citations as Chatterbox expected These include wake up call 46 above my pay grade 41 paralysis by analysis 2 new facts on the ground 1 and mano a mano 1 which as reader Jay Brida pointed out is always misused it s Spanish not for man to man but hand to hand These are all comers in Chatterbox s view Personal friend of
