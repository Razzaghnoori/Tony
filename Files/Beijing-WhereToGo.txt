 Where To Go Beijing has fascinating districts and neighborhoods to stroll However the main attractions are scattered throughout this sprawling city so you ll be taking frequent taxi bus or subway rides no matter where your hotel is located Following the ancient city plan we have divided the capital like a compass with the downtown sights in the center surrounded by quadrants to the north south east and west The main urban area of Beijing covers 750 sq km 290 sq miles with the Forbidden City and Tiananmen Square at the center Chang an Avenue bisects these two sites and forms the capital s long wide east west axis A north south axis runs 8 km 5 miles from the Temple of Heaven through the Forbidden City to the Drum and Bell towers Old Beijing once surrounded by massive city walls and nine towering gates is now encircled by a modern subway and a major expressway the Second Ring Road 231 2 km 141 2 miles around In turn a Third Ring Road 48 km 30 miles around encompasses most of

ensconced today strictly off limits to all visitors Beihai Park Beijing s oldest imperial garden Beihai Park Beihai Gongyuan was built on the capital s largest lake over 800 years ago Near the south entrance in the Round City Tuan Cheng is a large ceremonial vessel of green jade presented in 1265 to Kublai Khan who built a palace here and entertained Marco Polo on these lake shores in the 13th century Scenic Hortensia Island Qionghua Dao built from the soil excavated to create Beihai s lake is crowned by the White Pagoda Bai Ta one of Beijing s landmarks Tibetan in style this dagoba

Goddess of Mercy Guanyin in 1770 Tour boats depart the eastern shore from Five Dragons Pavilion to Hortensia Island Today Beihai lake is no longer restricted to the imperial court and it is the most popular spot in Beijing to rent a rowboat in the summer or to ice skate in the winter Back Lakes and Hutongs Central Beijing s three front lakes Nanhai Zhonghai and Beihai run along the west side of the Forbidden City from Chang an Avenue north to where they connect with the three Back Lakes Shi Sha Hai known as Qianhai Houhai and Xihai These lakes once comprised the route used to ship grain and luxuries via the Grand Canal to the Forbidden City Later this was the waterway employed by imperial barges when the emperor desired an outing These interconnected lakes are marvelous places to stroll The Back Lakes District contains many landmarks of old Beijing from princely mansions to old temples and gardens but it is best known for its colorful alleyways and traditional courtyard houses At the northern tip of the Back Lakes is Huifeng Temple Huifeng Si Perched on a tiny rocky isle in Xihai Lake it is a wonderful spot for a lake view and a picnic East of this temple on the north side of the

during the Cultural Revolution 1966 1976 Nearly two dozen monks reside here A few blocks east of the Guanghau Temple are Beijing s historic Drum Tower Gu Lou and Bell Tower Zhong Lou Both can be climbed for splendid views of the Back Lakes District The Drum Tower open 9am 4 30pm daily free is the more interesting of the two The capital s first Drum Tower from which the hours of the day were signaled with drums was built here by Kublai Khan in 1272 rebuilt by Ming Emperor Yongle in 1420 and renovated under the Qing emperors A side stairway leads to the balcony where one of the 24 original

father of China s last emperor Puyi occupied this estate in the mid 19th century making use of its 31 halls and pavilions as his private residence The estate contains numerous courtyards arched bridges ponds rock gardens and its own pagoda The neighborhoods of the Back Lakes District are filled with the hutongs alleys and siheyuans courtyard houses that were characteristic of urban Beijing during the Ming and Qing dynasties They are common even today with nearly half of the capital s population living in some form of rectangular courtyard compound Nevertheless hutongs and siheyuans are endangered symbols of Beijing s past constantly under threat of urban renewal Fewer than 2 000 courtyard dwellings are preserved in cultural protection zones Although it would have once been occupied by a single rich family plus servants a courtyard house today is shared by many families The hutongs can be toured on your own on foot by rented bicycle or by hiring one of the canopied pedicabs in the area But most visitors prefer a guided tour The Beijing Hutong Tourist Agency Tel 6615 9097 which books tours through hotel desks has a fleet of red canopied pedicabs led by an English speaking guide Its hutong tour combines many of the sights in the Back Lakes District with the opportunity to step inside a courtyard house and talk with its modern day residents Lama Temple and Confucius

the Third Ring Road both sections of the vast Chaoyang District have received the brunt of Beijing s modernization Here Chang an Avenue changes its name to Jianguomenwai Dajie the location of some of China s finest international hotels and Beijing s best shopping opportunities The same can be said for the northeast section of the Third Ring Road where major hotels and shopping plazas are also

West Beijing Two of Beijing s top attractions the Summer Palace and the Western Hills are located northwest of the capital s relentless urban sprawl This is the beautiful hilly countryside of the Haidian District home to China s top universities and computer technology developers And closer to city center the western precincts of Beijing are the site of four major temples the Beijing Art Museum and the Beijing Zoo Summer Palace The site of imperial palaces since the reign of Kublai Khan the Summer Palace Yi He Yuan achieved its present form during reconstructions from 1749 to 1764 Emperor Qianlong saw to the expansion of the park its hills and its lake and he added pavilions and halls that stand today The imperial court used the Summer Palace as its summer home escaping the heat of central Beijing and the Forbidden City Today it is the playground of locals and tourists alike Many say it is the most beautiful imperial garden in China a large scale garden equivalent to a park or estate The Summer Palace was twice destroyed after its expansion under the early Qing emperors In 1860 during the Second Opium War British and French troops invaded Beijing and ransacked and ruined many of the buildings Empress Dowager Cixi saw to a complete restoration in 1886 but the Western armies returned in 1900 in retaliation for the siege of the Foreign Legation during the Boxer Rebellion Undaunted the Empress Dowager completed a second restoration in 1903 The Summer Palace became her countryside version of the Forbidden City her residence of choice even when the heat of summer diminished Like the Forbidden City the Summer Palace was opened to the public in 1925 The 280 hectare 700 acre Summer Palace is dominated by Kunming Lake which itself is subdivided into West Lake and South Lake by several causeways Longevity Hill rises above the north shore Behind its peaks is a version of Beijing s Back Lakes created during the Qing Dynasty The main strolling area is along the north shore of Kunming Lake where the pavilions and courtyards are linked by the Long Corridor Chang Lang This covered promenade stretches 777 m 2 550 ft from the Eastern Halls west to the Marble Boat First built in 1750 it consists of 273 crossbeam sections and 4 pavilions Nearly every exposed portion of its beams panels and pillars is decorated with a painted scene from Chinese myth history literature or geography 10 000 brightly painted panels in all Among the important imperial buildings on the east side of the Long Corridor four are worth viewing The Hall of Benevolent Longevity Renshou Dian is where Empress Dowager Cixi received court members from her Dragon Throne which is still in place The Hall of Jade Ripples Yulan Dian is where Cixi confined her nephew Emperor Guangxu while she ruled in his place The Hall for Cultivating Happiness Yile Dian served as the Empress Dowager s private viewing box for performances in the adjacent three story theater which was built to honor her 60th birthday Cixi celebrated many of her birthdays at the Summer Palace and she was especially fond of theatrical performances in which she sometimes played a role This theater now contains some of her imperial garments jewelry and cosmetics as well as a Mercedes Benz said to be the first passenger car in China The Long Corridor begins at a fourth Qing building the Hall of Happiness and Longevity Leshou Tang where the Empress Dowager slept The curtained bed the lamps and most of the furniture are original Midway along the Long Corridor at the foot of Longevity Hill is the Hall of Dispelling Clouds Pai Yun Dian where Cixi held her birthday parties This hall now houses a collection of birthday gifts including the portrait of the Empress Dowager painted by Holland s Hubert Vos upon the occasion of her 70th birthday in 1905 The Long Corridor ends at the Pavilion for Listening to the Orioles Tingli Guan where there is now a restaurant serving Qing dynasty imperial dishes Just beyond this point is the most famous or perhaps notorious monument in the Summer Palace the Marble Boat known officially as the Boat of Purity and Ease To Beijingers it is China s ship of fools Rebuilt with lavish materials stone and stained glass by the Empress Dowager in 1893 this 36 m 118 ft statue of a boat was restored it is said with funds meant to shore up China s woeful navy but it was not long before Japan completely humiliated China in battles at sea Cixi has been blamed ever since for her profligate and selfish ways combined with her Machiavellian rise from concubine to Empress popularly held to be the cause of China s weakness and the fall of the last dynasty The Summer Palace remains as visible testimony to the extravagance of the late Qing Dynasty at the expense of China s freedom and prosperity at the beginning of the 20th century While many scholars doubt that Empress Dowager Cixi played such a villainous role her Summer Palace is undoubtedly lavish enough to have launched countless tales of luxury and decadence Even today the view of Longevity Hill and its scores of tile roofed pavilions and towers enjoyed from a pleasure barge drifting across Lake Kunming is a scene from a dream of old China in which emperors and empresses led lives in gardens of unimaginable splendor Here even the bridges connecting lake isles to the palace shores wouldn t be out of place in a Ming or Qing scroll painting particularly the celebrated Seventeen Arch Bridge Shiqi Kong Qiao 150 m 492 ft long and built of white marble Not far from the Summer Palace is the site of the Old Summer Palace Yuan Ming Yuan When Emperor Kangxi built this imperial park in the 18th century it had no equal However after its destruction in 1860 by French and British troops it was left to decay and the court s attention turned to restoring the new Summer Palace All that s left now in the Old Summer Palace are some of the most haunting ruins in China particularly in a section known as the Garden of Eternal Spring Changchun Yuan where European style halls marble fountains mazes and a concert stand are now a broken jumble of ornately carved columns and arches Every few years there are fresh announcements that the Old Summer Palace will be restored to its former glories For now it provides a quiet picnic grounds amidst the ruins of an empire Western Hills When China s rulers really wanted to escape the heat of the city they went farther west than the Summer Palace to the Western Hills Xi Shan romantically known today as Fragrant Hills Park Xiangshan Gong yuan Imperial villas first dotted these hillsides 27 km 17 miles from Beijing more than 800 years ago But it was the Qing Emperor Qianlong who converted the Western Hills into a formal mountain retreat for the enjoyment of the court complete with its own temples lakes gardens and even a zoo Late autumn is the favorite season for park visitors these days when leaves turn a fiery red However locals as well as tourists come to the Western Hills year round for the natural beauty and historic sites Two renowned temples still survive in the Western Hills Near the park s north gate are the four great halls of the Temple of the Sleeping Buddha Wo Fo Si In the final hall Wo Fo Dian there is a 5 m 16 ft lacquered statue of the reclining Buddha dated 1321 about to attain nirvana Inside the park s north gate is an even larger complex the Temple of the Azure Clouds Biyun Si which ascends the hillside The body of Sun Yat sen founder of the modern Chinese Republic once lay in state here before removal to Nanjing his hat coat and coffin are still at this temple So too is the fascinating Luohan Hall Luohans are followers of Buddha who achieve enlightenment but choose to stay on Earth to show others the way The 500 luohans portrayed in this temple s carved figures range from the ecstatic to the gruesome from the common to the surreal Topping the temple is the Diamond Throne Pagoda Jinggang Baozuo Ta built in 1748 in the Indian style with four pagodas and two stupas surrounding a 35 m 115 ft white pagoda The most popular site in the Western Hills is natural a summit known as Incense Burner Peak Xiang Lu Feng named for the image created when fog comes sweeping over it There is a winding path to the top known as Gui Jian Chou Even the Devil is Terrified as well as a chair lift 20 minutes each way At the 557 m 1 827 ft summit there are pavilions vendors and small paths into surrounding forests There are also fine views of the lakes temples pavilions and pagodas below which can be explored upon return On a clear day one is tempted to linger Here there s an emperor s view to the southeast commanding both the pavilions of the Summer Palace and the skyscrapers of downtown Beijing White Cloud Temple Beijing s most active Daoist complex Bai Yun Guan is better known as White Cloud Temple This is also the capital s most fascinating religious site a place of superstition and incense mystery and spirited worship As China s leading indigenous religion Daoism differs from Buddhism transplanted from India not so much in the architecture of its temples and the art of its statuary these are often quite similar in style as in its practices and beliefs Daoism emphasized nature the individual and the Way but in its organized form it relies on a huge pantheon of gods goddesses and supernatural icons promising miracles At Baiyunguan the first courtyard features the Wind Containing Bridge where visitors attempt to ensure their good fortune by striking a 17th century copper bell with coins In the Spring Hall for the Jade Emperor worshippers touch the golden feet of statues representing the gods of wealth In the side halls there are shrines where the devout can appeal to the proper god to cure eye problems ensure the birth of a son pass an examination get a good job and increase longevity Every one of these wishing halls is usually jammed with locals who are often dressed in their most expensive clothes for the tour Festivals on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month are especially lively times to visit At the rear of the complex there is a large rock garden a courtyard and classrooms where many novice monks are trained in Daoism Baiyunguan was founded in 739 and received its present name in 1394 Most of the halls date from the Qing Dynasty although Yuanchen Hall where visitors try to locate the deity on the zodiac of their birthday dates from the time of Kublai Khan Just south of this temple complex is Tianning Si Ta the Temple of Heavenly Tranquillity Pagoda built during the Liao Dynasty 907 1125 making it Beijing s oldest surviving building The 13 story tower is 58 m 190 ft high and is decorated with fine Buddhist carvings White Pagoda Temple Extensively renovated and enlarged in 1998 the White Pagoda Temple Bai Ta Si is renowned for its Tibetan style pagoda usually called a dagoba or stupa The white pagoda at this temple is larger than the more famous one in Beihai Park In fact it is the largest of its type in China built in 1279 during the reign of Kublai Khan The main gate of the White Pagoda Temple located on the north side of Fuchingmennei Dajie the first courtyard and the museum are new The museum houses many Buddhist artifacts and statues discovered on the temple grounds as well as a sutra copied out by Emperor Qianlong This rare manuscript unearthed in 1978 was composed in the emperor s own hand in 1753 Beyond the museum to the north are three finely restored prayer halls The Hall of the Great Enlightened Ones is stuffed with thousands of little Buddhas The white pagoda itself rising 51 m 167 ft is last and like most dagobas remains sealed its holy treasures and relics somewhere beneath or inside the imposing structure Five Pagoda Temple North of the Beijing Zoo across the Nanchang River is one of Beijing s most beautiful sights the Five Pagoda Temple Wu Ta Si Its singular main hall consists of a square stone building 71 2 m 25 ft high its outside walls decorated with one thousand niches each containing an engraved Buddha The hall is crowned with a cluster of five elaborate towering pagodas with stairs inside leading up to a view from the roof The five pagoda building is more Indian than Chinese in style It was built in 1473 during the early Ming Dynasty The temple was originally part of the larger Zhengjue Temple complex built during the reign of Ming Emperor Yongle in the 1420s and sacked by Western troops in 1860 and 1900 On the same grounds today is the Beijing Stone Engraving Art Museum an open air display of over 500 ancient stone carvings and inscribed stone pillars Big Bell Temple Big Bell Temple Da Zhong Si received its apt name in 1743 when the largest bronze bell in China was placed here This huge bell weighing 34 000 kg 46 tons and measuring 7 m 23 ft high was cast in 1420 just as the Forbidden City was finished It is on display in its own pavilion at the rear of the Big Bell Temple Locals often climb the stairs to the top of the big bell and drop coins through an opening for good luck a ritual that thousands of pilgrims in the past followed Since the early 1980s the Big Bell Temple has served as China s bell museum with over 700 bells in its collection A few of the bells are modern cast to commemorate recent events and some are from foreign countries but most are Chinese antiquities Among the bells displayed in the various halls and pavilions are some that are 4 000 years old For a small fee visitors can sound a set of stone chimes that date from the Warring States Period 475 221 b c Beijing Art Museum Doubling as museum and temple the Beijing Art Museum Zhongguo Meishuguan is housed in the halls of the Wanshou Temple the Temple of Longevity Although the temple renovated in 1761 by Emperor Qianlong is no longer active it contains many old structures including the bell and drum towers in the first courtyard which date from 1577 The Empress Dowager Cixi used to lodge overnight in this temple on her voyage by royal barge from the Forbidden City to the Summer Palace The large meditation hall at the center of the temple complex is now an art gallery containing modern Chinese oil paintings Side halls feature other art exhibits ceramics historic relics and artworks and crafts for sale At the rear of Wanshou Temple is a large rock garden with shrines to the gods of three of Buddhism s sacred mountains in China two pavilions built in 1761 one housing a stone tablet with the engraved signature of Emperor Qianlong and two arched gates constructed in the style of 18th century Europe Beijing Zoo The Beijing Zoo Beijing Dongwu Yuan is the creation of Empress Dowager Cixi who in 1908 converted this private Ming Dynasty garden estate into a preserve for some 700 exotic animals imported from Germany The entrance gate dates from the late Qing Dynasty and many of the exhibition halls seem nearly as old Even the outdoor pens seem quite dated With some 6 000 animals the zoo is the largest in China but despite its notable collection of giant pandas Siberian tigers golden monkeys and red crowned cranes the facility is in need of modernization Few foreign visitors are happy with the size and condition of the cages although the new Panda Garden featuring a half dozen adult pandas and twin babies is a bit more spacious and a step in the right direction Most of the zoo s recent major funding has gone to the creation of the adjacent Beijing Aquarium a state of the art marine park scheduled to have 50 000 aquatic species in residence Excursions The Great Wall is China s most popular attraction From Beijing splendid sections of the wall can be enjoyed at several locations Less visited and less crowded are two of China s greatest imperial cemeteries the Ming Tombs and the Eastern Qing Tombs Two other major excursions from Beijing are the Peking Man Museum at Zhoudian and the vast imperial retreat and temples of Chengde Great Wall Construction on the Great Wall began as long ago as the fifth century b c it winds across northern China for over 10 000 km 6 200 miles However the Great Wall Wanli Chang Cheng that most visitors see consists of a few beautifully restored segments near Beijing that were built extended or refortified during the Ming Dynasty a d 1368 1644 The Ming builders were the first to finish these massive earthen fortifications with brick They built a new section of the wall running for 630 km 390 miles just north of Beijing as a massive buffer and early warning system against invaders from the north This stratagem was to fail as the Manchus eventually broke through overthrew the Ming seized Beijing and established the Qing Dynasty in 1644 China s last imperial line Hundreds of thousands of laborers were conscripted over the centuries to extend and repair the Great Wall and many of them lie buried in its ruins In the seventh century a d over a million workers were said to be involved in this project but in the centuries since until the Ming Dynasty much of the wall fell into ruin Even today most of its length has not been kept up the earthen remnants barely visible While it is often reported that the Great Wall is the only manmade object visible from the moon the claim is dubious at best Still it is China s grandest achievement on par with Egypt s pyramids and a handful of other ancient wonders of the world The Great Wall is best appreciated at four main sites north of Beijing Badaling Mutianyu Simatai and Juyongguan Three of these four segments have been carefully refurbished with the exception of Simatai which is largely untouched since the days of the early Ming Dynasty The earthen foundations of the wall and watchtowers as well as much of the brick work are original most of it 300 to 500 years old although extensive remodeling and fresh materials have been added The look and the feel are authentic enough once one is on the wall itself out of sight of the shops vendors tour buses parking lots and cable cars below The hordes of tourists are another modern addition of course but it is possible at all these sites to walk beyond the crowds The steep mountain scenery is spectacular and the air is usually quite clear The sheer steepness of the wall s stone stairs and the precarious footing provided by the irregular treads are what most surprise first time visitors As it snakes up and down the peaks and ridges the wall conforms to a challenging topography one that leaves many tourists gasping for breath But the views from China s ancient Dragon of Stone make the journey unforgettable Carefully restored in 1957 the Great Wall at Badaling 67 km 42 miles northwest of Beijing is the most visited portion of the wall The mountain setting is spectacular and the wall rises and falls steeply as it winds up and down the ridges About 7 m 24 ft high and 5 m 18 ft wide this Ming Dynasty fortification is built of tamped earth stone and brick Beacon towers of stone and brick are mounted at regular intervals It is possible to walk the stairs of the restored section for about 2 km 11 2 miles before reaching the crumbling remains of the original wall on either end At the northern terminus there is a cable car connecting the wall to a parking lot below The parking lots at the base of the wall are filled with vendors stores restaurants and other modern attractions including a cinema and a KFC fast food outlet Badaling is crowded especially from June through September but it is quite beautiful Equally attractive is the second most visited section of the Great Wall at Mutianyu 88 km 55 miles northeast of Beijing Mutianyu was opened to tourists in 1986 to relieve the crowding at Badaling There is also a cable car at Mutianyu eliminating the 20 minute hike up to the wall and at the foot of the wall there is again a village of vendors shops and caf s Mutianyu is one of the oldest restored sections of the Great Wall in the Beijing area thought to have been built under the Ming rulers nearly 500 years ago Visitors can walk well over a kilometer nearly a mile atop these ramparts from watchtower to watchtower At either end you can view the crumbling wall running to the horizon broken but still visible In the early spring and late fall particularly on weekdays the Great Wall at Mutianya is not very crowded Surrounded by its renowned green forests it is a pleasant alternative to Badaling The Great Wall at Juyongguan 58 km 36 miles northwest of Beijing on the way to the Badaling section is the newest portion of the wall open to tourism 1998 and the nearest to the capital Juyongguan contains a massive guard tower marking one of the Great Wall s most celebrated mountain passes This guard tower built in 1345 is decorated in Buddhist carvings with inscriptions in Chinese Tibetan Sanskrit and languages of the northern tribes Some of the temples and parks clustered at the pass in the days of the Ming dynasty have also been restored here The wall can be walked for 4 km 21 2 miles as it winds over the peaks of the Taihang Mountains The least restored least crowded major segment of the Great Wall near Beijing is at Simatai 124 km 77 miles northeast of the capital Not only is Simatai rather far from the capital it is also quite uncrowded and unreconstructed Its stairways and watchtowers resemble those crumbling edifices one can only glimpse from Badaling Mutianyu and Juyongguan The natural scenery is dramatic and the ruined state of the wall gives Simatai a romantic feel although there is a cable car to the top It is also dangerous with broken stairways leading up some of the 70 degree inclines Other portions are in such ruins that one must walk along the outside of the wall on steep narrow paths where the footing is difficult From the village at the base of Simatai there is a half mile gravel path to the first stairway which skirts the small Simatai Reservoir The reservoir divides the Simatai wall from another section known as Jinshanling which adventurous hikers can also tackle Simatai consists of 14 beacon towers each about 400 m a quarter mile apart which were once used to transmit fire and smoke signals tower by tower to the Chinese armies encamped below should an enemy be sighted The highest of the beacon towers known as Wangjinglou stands at an elevation of 986 m 3 235 ft affording a grand view southwest toward Beijing Locals say the lights of the capital are visible on clear evenings from here Ming Tombs The valley of the Ming Tombs 50 km 31 miles northwest of Beijing is the final resting place of 13 of the 16 Ming emperors Courtyards and elaborate pavilions similar to those in the Forbidden City cap underground burial chambers where the emperor with his empress and concubines is entombed Here a Spirit Way Shen Dao 61 2 km 4 miles long the most renowned graveyard entrance in China forms a grand introduction to the valley It is lined with arching entrance gates and an avenue of stone animals 12 pairs of creatures including lions and elephants and court officials 6 pairs the statuary dating from 1435 Inside the Dragon Phoenix Gate are the tombs of which three have been restored and opened to visitors The tomb of Emperor Yongle Chang Ling is the largest although its underground palace where the emperor and his empress are buried has not been opened Nor have the 16 satellite vaults where Yongle s concubines are entombed The massive courtyards and pavilions above Yongle s burial chambers have been restored and they house some of the Ming Tombs excavated treasures including imperial armor The burial palace of Emperor Wanli Ding Ling honors the 13th Ming emperor who ruled from 1573 to 1620 His burial vaults 27 m 88 ft below ground are made of marble and cover 1 200 sq m 13 000 sq ft His white marble throne golden crown and red coffin along with the coffins of his wife and first concubine remain in the tomb The Zhao Ling tomb is also open but is less impressive The Ming Tombs were once a staple of tours to the Great Wall at Badaling but foreign tourists have seldom been impressed by the site finding it dank and poorly restored A more interesting imperial cemetery is the Eastern Qing Tomb site although it is located at a much greater distance from Beijing Eastern Qing Tombs Nearly as vast and monumental as the Forbidden City the Eastern Qing Tombs Dong Qing Ling 125 km 78 miles northeast of Beijing require a considerable daytrip to view The journey over country roads while scenic is slow Emperor Sun Zhi 1644 1911 the founder of the Qing Dynasty selected this remote spot in a large mountain valley while on a hunting expedition It is China s largest royal cemetery with the tombs of 5 emperors 15 empresses and over 100 members of the Qing court Three of China s most famous rulers are buried here including Emperor Qianlong 1711 1799 Emperor Kangxi 1654 1722 and the notorious Empress Dowager Cixi 1835 1908 Like the Ming Tombs the Eastern Qing Tombs are entered via a long Sacred Way lined with 18 pairs of stone animals and court officials The oldest tomb Xiao Ling is that of the founder of the Qing Dynasty Sun Zhi His tomb is unopened but the 28 pavilions and halls on the site can be visited The tomb of Emperor Kangxi Jing Ling is also unopened but its magnificent above ground halls contain many original imperial treasures including Kangxi s Dragon Throne The tomb of Emperor Qianlong Yu Ling is open Located 54 m 177 ft underground it consists of nine immense vaults and the marble coffins of the Manchu emperor and his five favorite consorts The most lavish tomb is that of Empress Dowager Cixi Above her underground palace inside a sacrificial hall is a wax museum showing Cixi in full regalia as Goddess of Mercy her favorite Buddhist deity The underground palace contains her double gold and lacquer coffin Unfortunately the coffin was desecrated in 1928 by a warlord who also plundered the tomb s treasures including 25 000 pearls and a burial quilt studded with rare pearls Many of Cixi s imperial treasures did survive and are now on display in the galleries above her tomb Peking Man Museum The Peking Man Museum is located 50 km 31 miles southwest of Beijing in the village of Zhoukoudian whose name has become synonymous with Chinese paleontology In the hills and caves of Zhoukoudian archaeologists found the skull of a new ancestral link to mankind Homo erectus pekinensis Peking Man This 1929 discovery suggested that man s closest ancestor might have lived in Asia as well as Africa Excavations of the site continued until 1937 when most of the fossils were carried out of war torn China by foreigners never to return The cave on Dragon Bone Hill where Peking Man lived 690 000 years ago showed evidence of a community numbering up to 40 individuals Nearby caves contained fossils and artifacts from more recent Stone Age settlements 20 000 to 50 000 years ago These caves may now be visited their treasures housed in the nearby Peking Man Museum Here there are molds of the missing skulls an array of stone tools the bones of prehistoric beasts some human fossils and a modern statue of Peking Man himself Chengde The small city of Chengde formerly known in the west as Jehol 250 km 155 miles northeast of Beijing requires an overnight stay for visitors based in the capital But it s worthwhile for anyone interested in seeing the monumental remains of the Qing Dynasty as well as its most spectacular Buddhist temples Chengde became the imperial resort of the Qing rulers who built a royal city and park here rivaling that of the Forbidden City and Summer Palace in Beijing The Qing rulers never forgot their nomadic Manchu roots and Emperor Kangxi developed this remote valley in the countryside as a summer court and hunting ground in 1703 It was here that Kangxi s grandson Emperor Qinalong received the first official delegation from the West ever to visit China a British team headed by Lord Macartney in 1793 And it was here that Lord Macartney refused to kow tow bow before the emperor ending any hopes for a peaceful opening of the door to trade in the 18th century The Chengde Summer Palace today is demarcated by a wall 91 2 km 6 miles around and its grounds comprise the largest surviving imperial garden in China Among the palaces and halls still in place are the Front Palace where the emperors conducted official court business and nine courtyard halls in plain rustic style Beyond this cluster of imperial halls and residences is a large park with lakes bridges pavilions rockeries and the grasslands and hills where the court enjoyed sports on horseback There are copies of famous Chinese gardens here as well as small temples and multilevel viewing pavilions Chengde s other main attractions are the temples in the hills outside the park Many of these Eight Outer Temples have a strong Tibetan flavor All were built under Emperor Qinalong between 1713 and 1779 The Mount Sumera Longevity and Happiness Temple Xumifushou Miao commemorates the Panchen Lama s visit to Chengde in 1779 A copy of the lama s residence in Shigatse Tibet it is crowned by a pagoda decorated in green and yellow tiles The Small Potala Temple Putuozongsheng Miao built in 1769 is even larger and more lavish covering 22 hectares 54 acres Its great red hall evokes the Potala Palace in Lhasa and the arcades within are filled with Buddhist treasures including sensual figures related to the esoteric Buddhism of the Red Hat sect Beyond these and the other temples is Hammer Rock Bangchui Shan a massive stone pinnacle that can be reached by ski lift or hiking trails The view from this 18 m 60 ft natural tower of the valley below the imperial park and the surrounding Buddhist temples reveals the wealth and scale of the Qing Dynasty at its height In 1820 this imperial summer villa was all but abandoned after Emperor Jiaqing was killed here by a bolt of lightning Less than a century later the Qing Dynasty itself was destroyed by Republican forces ending China s last period of imperial rule
