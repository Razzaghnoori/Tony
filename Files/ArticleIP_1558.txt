 A heat wave across the United States has killed more than 100 people mostly in Texas Dallas is beginning its third straight week of temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Death Valley has reached 124 Illegal immigrants homeless people and old folks who are stuck indoors without air conditioning are in the greatest danger Oklahomans have prayed for divine intervention to no avail The secular explanation meteorologists have offered for the heat wave a persistent anomaly is no more satisfying The bad news There s no relief in sight for the South The worse news The heat is spreading over the Northeast The good news We re doing a lot better than Papua New Guinea where a 23 foot tsunami killed an estimated 3 000 people July 17 and left their corpses to be devoured by crocodiles 7 20 98 Military officials have proposed to relax their policies against adultery The proposed changes prompted by embarrassment over the Kelly Flinn affair and other recent adultery scandals would reduce the number of prosecutions by prosecuting only those cases in which the adultery has demonstrably damaged troop morale and the severity of the discharge imposed on violators Analysts have identified four schools of thought in ascending order of laxity 1 The Marine Corps which is resisting the loosening of standards because in the words of a spokesman If you can t trust the Marine next to you to remain faithful how can you trust him on the battlefield 2 The Army which unlike the other services thinks officers should be allowed to fraternize with enlisted personnel who are not in their chain of command 3 Military law critics who prefer the civilian standard under which adultery is rarely prosecuted 4 President Clinton 7 20 98 The Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide as a treatment for leprosy complications Everyone assumes doctors will prescribe it more often for AIDS complications The real news isn t the approval which was decided upon months ago but the elaborate new regime of warnings and restrictions which are designed to prevent a recurrence of the birth defects thalidomide caused in the 1960s Analysts credit the new rules to collaboration between the drug s manufacturer Celgene and thalidomide victims Optimists call it a model of cooperation and prudent regulation The media are taking the opportunity to write once again about stumps and flippers 7 17 98 Lockheed Martin dropped its takeover of Northrop Grumman rather than continue to fight a federal antitrust suit The Justice and Defense departments had argued the merger would imperil national defense by reducing competition The charitable economic spin DOD has reversed its policy of encouraging defense industry mergers The cynical economic spin Thanks to DOD s encouragement every company small enough to merge legally has done so leaving a few behemoths The charitable political spin from the Washington Post It s a huge victory for the government s re energized antitrust efforts The cynical political spin from Lockheed s CEO Lockheed backed down from the fight not because it respects the government s authority but because the government is our biggest customer 7 17 98 Madison Square Garden hired Marv Albert as a radio and TV sportscaster Last year he pleaded guilty to assault for biting an ex lover whom he also allegedly forced to commit sodomy Albert had worked for MSG for two decades before going to NBC The spins in order of ascending cynicism 1 MSG is being loyal to Albert because Albert was loyal to MSG 2 Albert has paid his debt and acknowledged that what I did was wrong 3 As the Washington Post puts it The road to redemption is getting shorter and shorter 4 Redemption MSG president Dave Checketts suggested Albert s notoriety would boost the ratings 7 17 98 A jury ruled that the Rev Al Sharpton and two other advisers defamed former Prosecutor Steven Pagones by accusing him of raping Tawana Brawley in 1987 This confirms a 1988 grand jury report that exonerated Pagones and suggested the Brawley rape was a hoax Brawley and the advisers are black Pagones is white The advisers called the defamation case an attempt to silence those who challenge the white establishment and to punish three men who have clearly given their lives and their careers to help people who could not help themselves Editorialists called the verdict an affirmation that the truth matters more than 1 ideological fantasy and 2 self promotion camouflaged by ideological fantasy The softhearted spin Sharpton will suffer the worst damage because ironically he is the only one of the advisers to have sought to moderate his public image The hardhearted spin Sharpton continues to rationalize rather than recant or repent 7 15 98 The International Monetary Fund and other lenders agreed to add 17 billion to the Russian bailout In exchange Russia agreed to clean up its budget practices and reform its financial system to attract private investment News of the deal boosted Russian markets The spins in order of ascending cynicism 1 Russia has failed to deliver the reforms it promised in exchange for previous loans 2 If we don t lend the extra money there will be financial meltdown chaos and maybe a coup 3 That nightmare scenario is just what Yeltsin wants us to envision 4 Russia s Parliament is too irresponsible to approve the necessary reforms 5 The U S Congress is too irresponsible to extend further credit to the IMF to support the bailout 7 15 98 Linda Tripp resumed her testimony before the Lewinsky grand jury two days after Tripp s lawyers appeared on several weekend TV shows to portray their client as a good citizen who was forced to tell prosecutors about President Clinton s philandering and Lewinsky s efforts to cover it up For a
