 An Odd Request Or at least an odd place to put this request We are looking for Slate readers or potential Slate readers who have e mail but don t do the Web thing We suspect that a lot of people fall into this category and we would like to make sure they have the opportunity to sign up for our e mail delivery during the next couple of months while it s still free If you re reading these words on the Web you re clearly not one of those people but you may have friends or colleagues who are And many of you are reading this on a printout or our spies tell us on a photocopy or a hand me down of a printout We don t mind Be our guest until February If so you should sign yourself and or your friends up for e mail delivery of Slate What you get every Friday afternoon is a file nicely formatted and ready to be printed out on 8 x 11 paper But you can also read it on screen directly off your own hard disk as many choose to do Signing up is easy Just go to the Slate Help page or click here you lazy bum and type in your e mail address But if for any reason you cannot or would prefer not to perform this function as the flight attendants like to say just e mail us at slate msn com Say that you d like e mail delivery give us your e mail address essential obviously and the name of your service provider not essential but helpful in straightening out problems and we ll take it from there Paranoid considerations 1 You will not be billed now or in February when the free period ends unless you sign up all over again 2 You can cancel delivery at any time Every weekly delivery explains how Prominently It s easy Honest 3 We won t give your address to anyone else or abuse it ourselves 4 Bill Gates will not have you killed By the way e mail delivery of Slate makes a marvelous Christmas present No wrapping needed And you can t beat the price Slate Reader Survey On a scale of 1 to 5 in which 1 is not at all willing and 5 is desperately eager how willing are you to take a few minutes to fill out an online reader survey E mail Slate readers will get the survey by well obviously e mail If you are anything from mildly to extremely willing we d appreciate your input And you may even enjoy the exercise This survey consists of a few simple questions merely designed to strip you bare psychologically and to allow us to compile an exhaustive medical and financial dossier on you that could be used for unimaginable purposes You may wonder for example why we need to know the answer to Question 47b When was the last time you cut your toenails Or Part II Section 7 Line 3 Is Chekhov s Uncle Vanya a tragedy or a comedy The answer is nothing nefarious or mysterious It s simple morbid curiosity Our publisher Rogers Weed and isn t that a name you can trust has an insatiable desire for knowledge He watches tapes of old Bill Moyers programs in the shower His slogan is If you know it I d like to know it too So help him out and fill out the survey Actually it s completely harmless and fairly short Many thanks By Michael Kinsley
