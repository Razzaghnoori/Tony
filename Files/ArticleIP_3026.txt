 The People s Hitler It is one of the paradoxes of modern biography that Adolf Hitler who came frighteningly close to establishing his Thousand Year Reich has seldom been taken seriously as a political leader In Hitler s own day Churchill called him a guttersniper Brecht parodied him in the character of Arturo Ui a buffoonish thug implausibly thrust into power and Neville Chamberlain well enough said about Mr Chamberlain Afraid of being branded revisionists Hitler s biographers have been largely reluctant to acknowledge his political talents Thus have they given us Hitler as psychopathic god and unprincipled opportunist but never as statesman a title that even in the age of the Kissingers and the Pinochets has lost little of its luster But as the historian John Lukacs underscores in his study The Hitler of History the Nazi dictator was not simply the century s most murderous tyrant he was one of its most brilliant politicians Lukacs a distinguished historian of modern Europe has reflected perceptively in previous books on the Nazi leader s hypnotic allure In The Hitler of History Lukacs adopts a more historiographical approach examining comparing and correcting the interpretations of Hitler s biographers Lukacs courtly prose can mask the bold scope of his ambitions Besides critiquing Hitler biographies Lukacs is also advancing his own reading of Hitler Hitler says Lukacs was a peculiarly modern demagogue More than any of his peers including Mussolini he created an electrifying fusion of aggressive nationalism and populist rhetoric An early practitioner of McLuhanesque politics who was extraordinarily aware of his pictorial image Hitler understood the popular effect of the cult of the star on his fans the ordinary Germans who admired and even loved him If only the F hrer knew the cry of many ordinary Germans who felt betrayed by the Nazi regime suggests the depth of their affection Often dismissed as a poor military strategist intoxicated by quixotic ambitions Hitler was in fact extremely adept at sizing up his opponents weaknesses and understood acutely the supreme importance of land power with the motorization of military movement As a result he succeeded in less than a decade in making himself the ruler of Europe from the gates of Moscow to the English Channel Indeed until his obsessive vision of cleansing Europe of the Jews and conquering Soviet Russia overcame his pragmatic instincts Hitler did not make a wrong move His victories emboldened him and his National Socialist followers to visit untold misery upon their victims As Lukacs writes he left a more indelible mark upon the century than any other dictator a Lenin or a Stalin or a Mao Much of the writing about Hitler falls into the category of Hitlerology a form of insipid voyeurism similar to that surrounding Kennedy or perhaps closer to the point Jack the Ripper The details about Hitler s personality titillate but they rarely edify even though Hitler s fanatical devotion to his mother does provide a rather chilling rebuttal to a faith in family values Lukacs does not himself always resist the temptation of Hitlerology He tells of Hitler s love of romantic poetry and creamy Viennese cakes the only exceptions apparently to his unyielding asceticism and speculates in ponderous footnotes studded with citations from Kierkegaard on the theological nature of evil A Catholic writer Lukacs whitewashes the record of the church as the least compromised and sometimes even inspiring of institutions If so why has the church subsequently apologized for its cozying up to Hitler For the most part though Lukacs concentrates on the disturbing specter that has come to haunt Hitler scholarship Hitler s admirers and defenders open and hidden The most notorious Hitler apologist is the British Holocaust revisionist David Irving who has worked tirelessly to exculpate the F hrer while lashing out at his adversaries As Lukacs observes Irving has not scrupled to invent evidence that Stalin planned to attack Germany before Hitler s invasion and that Hitler again and again ordered the Jewish problem set aside until the war was won Since the mid 80s a subtler but arguably more insidious form of revisionism has come from such reputable German scholars as Ernest Nolte and the late Andreas Hillgruber both leading participants in the Historikerstreit a quarrel among German historians over the uniqueness and meaning of the Holocaust While rebuking Hitler for declaring war against the Western democracies Nolte offered an implicit justification of the Holocaust as an anxious reactive measure sparked by the previous practices and exterminations by the Russian Revolution For Nolte Stalin was the original sinner Hillgruber added his own provocative twist by proclaiming that German historians were obliged to identify with the German soldiers on the Eastern front who were protecting Germany from Bolshevism The thrust of such interpretations as Lukacs argues was to rehabilitate Hitler as a German patriot and anti Communist Although Lukacs has some in my view rather too much compassion for Nolte s and Hillgruber s bitterness against the anti nationalist consensus among German historians he concludes that their explanations amounted to a kind of relativization to the point of defending Hitler And yet that shrewd critique of revisionism notwithstanding Lukacs own corrections to Hitler history are idiosyncratic and often wrong For instance we are told that foreign policy was secondary to German unity in Hitler s intentions although Hitler saw these aims as inseparable invoking in Mein Kampf Germany s need for living space lebensraum and her moral right to acquire foreign land and soil Indeed as the self proclaimed imperial savior of an Aryan Europe weakened by Jews and socialism he exalted the quest for lebensraum as a struggle to the death No less questionable is Lukacs claim that Hitler for all his hatred of the inferior races was not a biological racist Lukacs gleans this insight from a solitary remark by Hitler in 1945 to the effect that from the genetic point of view there is no such thing as the Jewish race If Hitler was less a biological racist than an extreme nationalist as Lukacs asserts this was a distinction without a difference to the millions of Germans instructed in such particulars of Social Darwinist science as how to tell a Jewish skull from an Aryan one Why would Lukacs underplay Hitler the racist Because he is more intent upon painting Hitler as a populist a creature of the baleful age that wrested authority from responsible elites and enshrined popular sovereignty Lukacs who came of age in Hungary while Hitler was in power has long described himself as a reactionary not a Gingrichian rightist but a partisan of the patrician mores of pre World War I Europe Because Hitler took to the streets and disregarded the niceties of bourgeois politics Lukacs considers him an anti bourgeois revolutionary and a friend of the proletariat While Lukacs is right to point out that Hitler was contemptuous of the bourgeoisie s caution of their thrift of their desire for safety Hitler did not crush their political parties and send them in droves to labor camps this fate he reserved for the organized working class Nor did Hitler try to abolish capitalism as Lukacs suggests although like his adversary Roosevelt he did expand state supervision of private industry Despite his penchant for revolutionary rhetoric his inspired use of modern techniques of collective mobilization and his willingness to strike up a tactical alliance with Stalin Hitler remained a committed foe of what he called Jew Bolshevism and indeed of all leveling ideologies Lukacs often writes as though Hitler or rather Hitlerism triumphed in the war That s because for Lukacs the horror of Hitlerism is simply an expression of the horror of modern collectivism In one sense Hitler s vision survived him notes Lukacs During the twentieth century the compound of nationalism with socialism has become the nearly universal practice for all states w hether they call themselves socialist or not We are all national socialists now Does this mean that the difference between say Swedish social democracy and Nazi state capitalism is less significant than the similarities Or between Afrikaner white supremacism and post apartheid multiracial democracy Lukacs would not of course go that far But in using Hitler to illustrate the threat of power passing into the hands of the masses he ignores an important distinction between mass societies those ruled by charismatic dictators unchecked by popular representation and those governed by democratic institutions With some exceptions we are all democrats now Perverse as this may sound Hitler is one reason why
