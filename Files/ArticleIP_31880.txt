 A n t i c i p a t i o n When my friend Ralph Cohen announced that his wife was pregnant I asked what path he hoped his child would follow It doesn t matter said Ralph If he s happy I ll be happy Then after a thoughtful pause he added My personal preference is shortstop But anything he wants to do is fine with me Then after a longer pause As long as it s in the infield That s the difference between ordinary altruism where you care about other people s happiness though perhaps not as urgently as you care about your own and what I ll call imperfect altruism where you reserve the right to care about how others achieve their happiness We all feel altruistic toward our own future selves That s why we make current sacrifices for future rewards But which kind of altruists are we Traditional economic theory says we re the ordinary kind we want to be happy in the future though perhaps not as urgently as we want to be happy in the present David Laibson a professor of political economy at Harvard is one of a few iconoclasts who disagree Nobody doubts that we are imperfectly altruistic toward others Laibson argues that we can be imperfectly altruistic toward ourselves And just as imperfect altruism toward your children can cause conflict in your family imperfect altruism toward your future self can cause conflict in your soul Here s an example Everyone knows that a taste for expensive pleasures can ruin your life But a taste for anticipating expensive pleasures can ruin your life in a far more interesting way If your greatest joy in life is looking forward to tomorrow s extravagance you ve got a problem Tomorrow is a moving target On Monday you plan a lavish party for Tuesday when Tuesday arrives you indulge your preference for anticipation by postponing the party till Wednesday The postponements continue until you die and leave a large estate The tragedy here is not that you never get to spend your money The tragedy is that you never even get to anticipate spending your money because you re smart enough to foresee the whole sequence of events even before it unfolds If you love looking forward to parties and if you know you love looking forward to parties then you can never look forward to a party Maybe this was what Bertolt Brecht meant when he said his life had been ruined by intelligence The solution if you can manage it is to plan a party that can t be postponed Pay the caterer well in advance and be sure to choose one who will penalize you heavily for a last minute cancellation I suffer from a minor but aggravating form of this affliction I avoid reading really good books because it robs me of the pleasure of looking forward to them Of course knowing this about myself I never get to look forward to them either Air travel has been my salvation I force myself to read good books by trapping myself with them on airplanes If they ever upgrade those in flight magazines into a plausible reading alternative I ll be ruined My friend Ray Heitmann suffers from the equal and opposite problem Instead of looking forward to extravagance he likes to anticipate his own future frugality He particularly enjoys believing that after a certain age he won t spend resources to prolong his own life But he s painfully aware that the certain age keeps getting redefined so it s always safely in the future Therefore he s looking for ways to limit his own future freedom of choice If Ray cared only about his own future happiness or to put it another way if Ray were perfectly altruistic toward his future self then you could fairly accuse him of inconsistency Limiting your choices can t make you happier But Ray cares also about how he achieves his future happiness which makes him an imperfect altruist but a consistent one If your altruism is imperfect you can want your future self to throw a party or to read a book or to forgo expensive medical care or for that matter to save money or to quit smoking even though you know your future self would prefer otherwise When Dorothy Parker lamented that I hate writing but I love having written she was expressing the sort of routine tradeoff between current costs and future benefits that fits right into the traditional economic framework Laibson s imperfect altruists face a far subtler problem they re not just weighing costs and benefits they re engaged in games of strategy against their future selves That suggests a new answer to a question I raised in this space a few months ago namely My suggestion then was that the lock resolves a conflict between you who believe that a hot fudge sundae is worth the calories and your mate or potential mate who believes otherwise According to Laibson the conflict is not between you and your mate but between you today and you tomorrow I don t know which theory is right but I do know that the door locks remain inexplicable unless you are in conflict with someone If all you want for your future self is happiness and if there s no third party involved there can be no good reason to restrict your future options Professors Per Krusell and Anthony Smith point out that Laibson s theory makes some surprising predictions about the way people save Suppose you want to be frugal in the future If you re a pessimist and don t trust your future self to be frugal then you might as well spend all your money today so it doesn t fall into the hands of that future spendthrift But if you re an optimist and expect to practice future self control you ll be inclined to save your money and pass it along into your own future good hands Either behavior is self reinforcing from one year to the next So contrary to what we re told by orthodox economic theory two individuals with exactly the same preferences and exactly the same opportunities can adopt dramatically different attitudes toward saving If you enjoy contemplating your own future extravagance as opposed to frugality then Krusell Smith reasoning suggests something even more bizarre The more you expect to be extravagant in the future the more you ll save to finance that future extravagance But as soon as you realize you re a saver you ll lose confidence in your future extravagance and figure you might as well spend your money today At that point you realize you re a spender and you go back to saving Your expectations about the future and the behavior that stems from them could fluctuate wildly Why would human beings have Laibson style preferences in the first place Here s a wild speculation Laibson style preferences lead to visible attempts at self control and visible attempts at self control are reassuring to potential mates hence favored by natural selection If that speculation stands up to some reasonable tests say a computer simulation of resource competition among individuals with evolving preferences it could tie the two refrigerator lock theories together into a single neat package
