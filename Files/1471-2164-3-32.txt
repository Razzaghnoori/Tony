 Background Recent progress in genomic sequencing has led to the rapid enrichment of protein sequence databases Computational biology strives to extract the maximum possible information from these sequences by classifying them according to their homologous relationships Classical protein families are distinguished by members which exhibit sequence similarity a feature which can often be used to infer that the sequences are related evolutionarily as well as functionally One of the first goals of any genome sequencing project is to broadly classify as many genes and their products as possible into putative functional families Proteins are translated from their corresponding mRNAs Cellular mRNA levels are immensely informative about cell state and the activity of genes and in most cases changes in mRNA abundance are positively correlated with changes in protein abundance Co regulation of proteins often reflects that these proteins are involved in similar biological processes and have related functions 1 Therefore changes in the expression patterns of protein families under different experimental conditions can provide clues about regulatory mechanisms the relationships between broader cellular functions and biochemical pathways as well as interactions between different protein motifs 2 3 4 5 6 7 The advent of microarray technology has made simultaneous analysis of the gene expression profiles of tens of thousands of genes a practical reality 8 Availability of human genome sequences and massive high throughput data on their expression provides an opportunity to study regulatory relationships between gene families 9 10 Incyte s LifeExpress RNA Database is a gene expression database that contains raw and normalized data from hundreds of Incyte microarray experiments Using these large scale mRNA expression data we can infer the functional relationships between protein families by comparing the aggregated expression profiles of the members of each protein family Pfam is a functionally annotated database of protein domain families 11 In this study each member of Pfam families was mapped to Incyte clones which were presented in the Incyte microarray chips based on the sequence identity We then generated mRNA expression profiles for these Pfam family members using Incyte s LifeExpress RNA LE database Version 3 0 April 2001 release Incyte Genomics Inc We analyzed 135 Pfam families whose family members are well represented on the Incyte microarrays The expression data for various members of a single Pfam family in one experiment was first converted into binary digits and then summarized as the Family Regulation Ratio The set of Family Regulation Ratios for a particular Pfam family across multiple experiments is called a Family Regulation Profile By using Pearson Correlation we analyzed the similarities between these Family Regulation Profiles to impute functional relationships between the different families This method was validated by comparing Family Regulation Profiles generated based on two different randomly selected LE data subsets This study explores an approach to relate protein families based on quantitative comparison of the family mRNA expression profiles Analysis of the profiles may be useful to address what protein domain families are co regulated and possibly how they may interact physically or genetically with one another Results Clones mapped to multiple Pfam families Structural similarities between distinct proteins often involve only a portion of each protein sequence These conserved sub structures which often have readily identifiable boundaries may recur in a large number of different proteins in which they perform a similar function In addition many proteins consist of combinations of these recurrent substructures domains in which case the protein function can be economically annotated based on the presence of these domains Pfam is a domain based protein database Multi domain proteins can be classified into several Pfam families which in turns means that several Pfam families can share the same corresponding proteins Among 135 Pfam families discussed here there are 1647 clones mapped to more than one Pfam family and 346 Pfam families sharing more than one clone Multi domain proteins are the major reason for this observation i e PF00043 and PF02798 representing C domain and N domain of Glutathione S transferease respectively Non uniformity of Pfam classification and clone mapping may also cause clone sharing between Pfam families A table listing pairs of Pfam families that share more than 50 of their family members is provided as an additional file see Additional File 1 supp1 doc These Pfam family pairings may suggest that the two domains are associated with a

The list of the Pfam pairs which share more than 50 family members Click here for file Data cross validation Two independent sets of Family Regulation Profiles were constructed from the randomly selected non overlapping subsets of expression data S1 and S2 see Methods Separate Pearson Correlation Coefficients PCC1 and PCC2 were computed from these data subsets respectively The correlation between PCC1 and PCC2 was determined by calculating an Enrichment Factor EF that expresses the degree to which calculations based on one data subset were corroborated by calculations based on the other data subset First we selected Pfam pairs from S1 by screening for pairs where PCC1 is greater than 0 5 If PCC1 and PCC2 for a particular pair of Pfam models are positively correlated an increase in PCC2 cutoff should result in a greater likelihood of PCC1 falling above 0 5 i e EF should increase We calculated a series of EFs with the PCC2 cutoff increasing from 0 to 1 EF stayed around 1 for low PCC2 0 to 0 2 and gradually increased to as high as 4 2 when PCC2 0 8 Fig 3 EFs were also computed to compare PCC1 and PCC2 in the same cutoff range from 0 to 1 An EF greater than 1 indicates higher than background correlation between PCC1 and PCC2 The representation ratio predicted to occur if there is no correlation between PCC1 and PCC2 and the observed representation ratios were calculated as described in Methods The discrepancy between them was evaluated by determining the statistical variable chi square 2 and the corresponding p value The higher the chi square and the lower the p value the less likely the observed degree of correlation occurred by chance which implies that the observed relationship is biologically significant As shown in Table 2 both EF and 2analyses showed strong correlation between PCC1 and PCC2 with the p value less than 0 00001 The Pearson correlation coefficient between all PCC1 and PCC2 values was determined to be 0 76 showing that PCC1 and PCC2 were well correlated Our approach is validated by this consistency of Pfam correlations derived from randomly selected LE expression experiments S1 and S2 Discussion Expression monitoring on a genome wide scale was first successfully demonstrated in budding yeast 1 13 14 Whole genome expression profiles provide a rich source of information on protein function protein protein interactions and gene pathways and have been compared with data sets describing transcription factor binding sites protein families protein protein interactions and protein abundance 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 mainly in budding yeast In this study we used large scale human genome wide expression data to study the relationship between the expression patterns of different protein families We summarized the change in gene expression level for a set of protein family members as a binary code of regulated and unregulated A two fold change in expression level was chosen as a cutoff for categorizing a change in expression level as significant This cutoff is arbitrary but from our experience with Taqman confirmation data not shown a two fold change in expression level reliably distinguishes real signals from background noise for most expression experiments The gene regulation was then converted to a percentage for gene families to profile the regulation for each microarray experiment Since the mapping from Pfam families to Incyte microarray clones is through the Swissprot database Pfam family members that are not represented in the Swissprot database cannot be mapped to Incyte clones and are therefore not included in the Family Regulation Profile analysis That may be one source of false negatives Other factors such as sensitivity of the Incyte microarray technology the arbitrary twofold cutoff etc may also contribute to false negative results In order to reduce these types of errors we included in our analysis only those Pfam families that map to at least 10 Incyte clones Due to the fact that the domain hierarchy of Pfam classification is not perfectly reflected in the database multi domain proteins may fall into several Pfam members leading to a significant number of false positives To address this potential source of error we excluded from pair wise correlation analysis those Incyte clones shared by both Pfam families in the pair To validate relationships that are revealed by microarray expression profiling one direct way is to split all the experiments randomly into two non overlapping pools and derive the Pfam relationships independently from each of these pools The 555 LE experiment were divided into two data sets of S1 and S2 and the corresponding Pfam relationships were denoted as PCC1 and PCC2 The correlation coefficient for PCC1 and PCC2 of 0 76 indicates a high degree of correlation between two data sets In order to ensure the independence of the data we also performed another analysis where data were split into two sets based on the tissue type The Pfam relationships not shown derived from these latter data sets are consistent with each other and with those derived from the complete data pool further corroborating the observed relationships It is important to note that many of the protein family relationships based on co expression identified here are supported by functional links Taking the G protein coupled receptors GPCRs as an example after agonist action GPCRs activate G proteins and become phosphorylated by G protein coupled receptor kinases 23 This event promotes activation of effector enzymes and ion channels by the activated G GTP This GPCR mediated regulation of ion channels also depends on the coordination and parallel regulation of protein tyrosine kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase activities 24 GPCRs can also interact with the growing family of PDZ domain containing proteins 25 All of these relationships are reflected in our study by the strong correlation between 7 transmembrane receptors rhodopsin family PF00001 protein kinases PF00069 protein tyrosine phosphatases PF00102 ion transport proteins PF00520 and PDZ domain proteins PF00595 Our study revealed many intriguing links between protein families For example the link between homeobox proteins PF00046 and other protein families Homeobox proteins are a very important family of transcription factors According to our analysis homeobox proteins are involved in the regulation of or are regulated by many protein families such as GPCRs ion channels tyrosine phosphatases nuclear hormone receptors and protein kinases For example the cone rod homeobox Crx binds and transactivates the rhodopsin promoter 26 However it has not been determined whether other rhodopsin GPCRs are also regulated by homeobox proteins In C elegans it was reported that the homeobox gene lim 6 is required for distinct chemosensory representations ion sensing which is related to ion channel transportation mechanisms Again it has not been studied systematically whether homeobox proteins are important regulators of ion channel transporter Another example of an intriguing relationship revealed in the present study is between the PH domain the EGF domain and the immunoglobulin superfamily Pleckstrin homology PH domains are protein modules of approximately 120 amino acids found in a wide variety of signaling proteins in organisms ranging from yeasts to humans The EGF domain which often occurs as multiple tandem repeats is widely distributed among extracellular proteins involved in adhesion receptor ligand interactions extracellular matrix structure determination of cell fate and blood coagulation 27 Cell adhesion usually activates PI 3 kinase activity Many PH domain proteins bind with high affinity to specific phosphoinositides such as PI 4 5 P2 PI 3 4 P2 or PI 3 4 5 P3 which are generated by PI 3 kinase 28 This relationship was reflected by the high correlation coefficient 0 79 between the PH domain and the EGF domain seen in our analysis Furthermore another major cell adhesion molecular family is the immunoglobulin superfamily PF00047 Two immunoglobulins which are particularly important in the cell adhesion cascade are Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 ICAM 1 or CD54 and Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule 1 VCAM 1 The co expression that we observed in our analysis for the EGF like domains and immunoglobin superfamily suggested that they may cooperate with each other in the cell adhesion process Links between Pfam families like these suggest novel hypotheses about family interactions that may be further explored Conclusions Integrating genome wide expression information with protein functional classifications and genetic networks is a huge challenge Our model is based on the binary idealization of gene expression change to generate a Family Regulation Profile Although this model is simplified the abstraction may be useful for conceptualizing the nature of functional relationships between families of protein domains Methods Database resources Pfam is a large collection of multiple protein sequence alignments and Profile Hidden Markov Models covering

elements per chip LifeExpress RNA is a gene expression database which in Version 3 0 April 2000 release includes 6307 expression experiments performed using Incyte s Human Genome chip 1 5 Incyte Human Genome chip 1 HG1 contains 9766 cDNAs while HG2 containing 9612 cDNAs HG3 containing 9686 cDNAs HG4 containing 9249 cDNAs HG5 containing 9219 cDNAs In total the five arrays contain 46909 cDNAs which represent about 41296 unique genes These experiments encompass the therapy areas of Cancer Biology the Cardiovascular System Immunology and Inflammation Metabolism Neurobiology Toxicology and Body Map Selection of probe pairs in LifeExpress The LE database contains data points from a total of 976 probe pairs Note here the term of probe refers to fluorescent labeled total RNA sample used for microarray hybridization that have been hybridized to one or more Human Genome chips 1 5 266 of these probe pairs have been hybridized to all five chips Using data from all available probe pairs would reduce the number of genes that could be compared since many genes are not represented in all 976 experiments By contrast limiting oneself to only those probe pairs that have been run against all the chips would greatly reduce the number of experiments from which the data is drawn In order to optimize the amount of data that could be compared 555 probe pairs that were hybridized to the first 4 Human Genome chips HG1 HG2 HG3 and HG4 were used in this study Mapping Pfam to LifeExpress A total of 4935 Swiss Prot human sequences and 22208 TrEMBL human sequences are included in 1427 protein families covered by Pfam Version 6 3 Corresponding GenBank mRNA sequences for those protein records were identified from annotation present in Swiss Prot and TrEMBL sequence records and were assembled together with the clone sequences from LifeExpress Human Genome chips 1 4 using the PHRAP assembler threaded version 3 01 licensed from Southwest Parallel Software Inc http www spsoft com 4177 Incyte clones belonging to 1069 Pfam families were mapped to these sequences Pfam family PF00069 is most highly represented on the chips with 231 Incyte clones while 343 Pfam families are represented on the microarrays by only one family member In total 135 Pfam families are represented by more than ten clones on the microarrays There were 2644 clones that belonged to these largest families Data Processing One probe pair in LE could have been hybridized to the same Incyte Human Genome chip several times In these cases the average of the differential expression values fold difference for the different hybridizations was used in subsequent calculations For each gene the expression ratio for a particular probe pair was reduced to a binary variable regulated or unregulated rather than a continuous variable For each pair of experimental conditions a gene was considered to be regulated if it showed at least a two fold change in expression level either up or down regulated between conditions and unregulated if the expression ratio was less than two fold In order to analyze the expression profile for each Pfam family we calculated the Family Regulation Ratio FRR for each Pfam family as the percentage of its members which were regulated in a pair wise comparison and assigned the ratio to the Pfam ID for this probe pair For example 140 clones in the PF00001 family had been hybridized with the probe pair of PBMC Cells Untx 24 hr Dn4625 vs t 2 4 hr of which 28 clones 20 showed greater than two fold difference in the pair wise comparison This meant that 20 members in the family of PF00001 were regulated with this probe pair So the Family Regulation Ratio of 0 2 was assigned to PF00001 for this probe pair In order to reduce random noise we only studied the 135 Pfam families represented by more than ten clones on the microarrays Family Regulation Profiles were generated for each of these largest Pfam families by calculating the FRRs corresponding to 555 probe pairs Correlation measure Correlations between Family Regulation Profiles are measured with the standard Pearson Correlation Coefficient PCC The PCC between two profiles a b with k dimensions is calculated as where a i and b i represent the Family Regulated Ratios of Pfam a and Pfam b for the sample i and and indicate the respective means If a clone was mapped to both Pfam a and b the Family Regulation Profiles of a and b would be modified with the clone excluded In other words common clones between Pfam pairs made no contribution to the PCC calculation Cross validation with two independent subsets One way to validate our approach is to verify that the Pfam relationships based on our Family Regulation Profiles would be ubiquitous In other words different microarray experiment sets as long as the experiment resource is rich diverse and well represented enough should generate a similar result The 555 LE probe pairs were randomly divided into two data sets with one data set containing 278 probe pairs S1 and the other one containing 277 probe pairs S2 Based on these two data sets two Family Regulation Profiles for each Pfam were computed respectively Pearson Correlations among Family Regulation Profiles PCC1 and PCC2 were calculated using S1 and S2 respectively PCC1 and PCC2 should be positively correlated if the derived Pfam relationships are independent of the expression experiment selection The Enrichment Factor EF is a parameter that represents the extent to which the Pfam pairs identified by PCC1 within the cutoff range specified by C1 are over represented in pools of Pfam pairs that could be identified by PCC2 within the cutoff range specified by C2 The number of total Pfam pairs are indicated as G total while the number of Pfam pairs selected by PCC1 C1 and PCC2 C2 are indicated as G 1 and G 2 respectively The number of Pfam pairs common to both PCC1 C1 and PCC2 C2 is indicated as G both Therefore the expected background representation ratio or the random representation ratio for G 1 within G 2 is and the observed representation ratio for G 1 within G 2 is EF is then defined as with a value for EF 1 indicating higher than background representation ratio for G 1 within G 2 Take an example where G 1 is selected by PCC1 0 5 and G2 is selected by PCC2 0 8 Out of total 8968 Pfam pairs there are 2185 Pfam pairs with PCC1 0 5 so the ratio of R 0 can be calculated as 2185 8968 0 24 There are 20 Pfam pairs with PCC2 0 8 of which all 20 also have PCC1 0 5 The ratio of R 1 equals 20 20 1 therefore EF 1 0 24 4 2
