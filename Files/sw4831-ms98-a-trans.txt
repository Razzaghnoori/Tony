        see when when when youre with a big company or a big organization a lot of times uh you know the benefits are good and and you know the pays regular       but uh well you know sometimes you dont get tuned in to whats going on and i i i think the biggest benefit or the biggest benefit other than wages that that uh that uh anybody could get in uh in dealing in a with a large company is to be in a situation where you you get to know whats going on and maybe thats thats probably the toughest thing in the whole world to to do whats whats your feeling about benefits what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company   well since im kind of on the the older side you know i i i just feel like uh when i start talking about benefits i talk about im concerned about medical benefits um my um my husband works for McDonald Douglas and so my his benefits his medical benefits are so excellent you know thats really great   umhum   you know i work for um Western a bank Western Financial   umhum   and uh they dont let me know really about anything thats going on even some of the immediate things that i need to know i dont know it until the next hour and then all of a sudden we know weve gotten changes made were changing departments were changing policies were changing doing other kinds of things which to me is is disturbing i mean i feel like if i i dont necessarily need to uh be involved since im pretty much on a low level you are you are right there you know im pretty much on a low level as far as uh uh the company is concerned but i i do kind of like to know whats going on and whats happening and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if if i had a little bit more information along that line   well that i i well i i work for the government and uh actually i work for the FBI   oh my gosh   and uh and so well you know we we dont theres lots of things that we dont get told for good reason but uh but basically uh theres lots of things that that we should know about projects im an engineer   umhum   you know im im a COTR and sometimes and i worked in the same lab with a guy and we didnt really know that much about each others projects for two years and we shouldve you know were were now collaborating   oh   and it didnt for two years we didnt and which which was uh kind of stupid   and it it   but uh but uh our organization is doing something else tomorrow on Monday uh were having a for all unclassified programs were were having little tables put out in front of you know lab in the hallways and everybody all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do which i thought was kind of interesting and but   yeah that is interesting   but uh but that sort sort of thing but but if but just i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand whats going on   exactly   and and but of course most time most the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know and you know if you dont really count if youre not part of the program you might not get told for months or you might you know if it doesnt impact you directly or if your management doesnt think that but but regard to benefits you know most companies have most big organizations have decent you know benefits like retirement and that sort of thing in the private sector i would think that one of the major uh situations especially when you reach you know the the mid fifties was is keeping a job until you retire   hm ah right   uh and engineers are uh  are baggage to most uh uh as they get older to to most companies and uh its very much like the military it windows out you know you you think well boy im getting more money and im getting more responsibility im doing this but as you climb up that tree pretty soon youre the the the branches get smaller on the top of the tree   umhum   and pretty soon somebody falls off ive ive fallen off twice in my private sector   oh   and uh  and and you know i can get up   i know it it seem to be kind of kind of scary you know because you think of um see my sons eighteen right now and he hes uh he wants to go into engineering and the the the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now is kind of open and hes interested in basically three different areas but uh its difficult for me to  to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that he needs to do his own course investigation and and see what he can do because who knows whats going to happen in another thirty years   umhum yeah   and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical i mean my um brotherinlaw is like um i mean hes sixty hes not ready to retire but his company is is closing is um is uh closing up   umhum   and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he what he was working on hes getting cut back and hes not ready to retire   yeah he may be retired
