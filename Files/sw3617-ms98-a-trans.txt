                well i dont know what kind of exercise do you get involved in   well i basically do the Nautilus i work out at the Y um three times a week and um then i try to walk in between times so and ive found and i at the Y i ride a stationary bike and then i um and sometimes i will do Stairmaster and then then i use the Nautilus equipment and uh i basically like it a lot uh ive been doing it about a year and a half and and i really i really enjoy it i particularly like the machines um that that seems to have worked real well for me and then i do like to walk thats thats my um other exercise that i like to do so and you know i see i feel like i feel a lot better since ive uh started doing that seems to help me a lot     yeah i i used to run i ran for about twenty years but it takes  wear and tear on the joints so couple couple years ago i switched over to stationary bike and i   yeah   i do about fifty miles a week on a a stationary bike for to keep my lower body developed and then i work out three times a week with uh weights at home to you know keep the upper part of shoulders and you know arms that sort of thing so that seems between the two of them its seems to keep me i guess fairly fit   and you work out at home then   yeah basically i have i have a stationary bike at home have some weights at home that i use and then you know i try to supplement it periodically with you know some walking what have you   uhhuh yeah my husband uh ran for a while but it was just too hard on his knees he he just felt like it did his knees in so he went to um he walks and or does Stairmaster um you know depending on his schedule and the weather um but he felt like that was just too hard on his joints too so he he   uh the the running was just too hard on both my knees and my hips and the um stationary bike keeps you toned and is keeps the stress off of the joints   right right well we um the the place where i work out has just gotten all new equipment so im trying to get used to adjust adjusting to the new equipment but i do like it it it uh it seems to um do certain muscles much better i think it um you know works you out in a better place it doesnt uh bother your my back as much and but i its hard its like now you have to adjust to all this new stuff and it theres a lot of adjusting of each individual piece of equipment so i im in the process of trying to um  get adjusted to it but i think im going to like it um because it just isolates muscles so much better than the other   well i guess they went out and bought all that equipment just to keep you on your toes huh   yeah  i think well luckily the Y here i live real close to the Y in Plano and uh they are getting ready for major expansion so theyre going to theyre just going to open up were going to have bigger rooms and and more room to work out then theyve got new weights and and all this stuff so i go to the Y with a friend and that seems to help me stay motivated to to continue to work out   well i i just do the self motivation i can do my fifty miles a week on the bike thats four times a week and then the three times the weights some days i do both and then some days its one or the other just depending on how it goes i know on the weights and the bicycle like you know even even yesterday on Christmas day i was on the i did the the weights for a while and the bicycle but today i just do the bicycle because i can do the bicycle a couple of days in a row but the weights you have to do those every other day so   right now now do you watch television or do you just sit there and bicycle   um usually when im bicycling i listen to the uh listen to the radio uh just turn on some music and listen to the radio when i bike and   uhhuh   same thing while im using the weights and sometimes ill watch the news or whatever most of the time ill just listen to the radio though   now do you bike when you say fifty miles thats total a week   yeah um i do it in four thirty minute sessions   oh okay   so each each time i do it it its roughly twelve and a half miles per session and then i do four of those and that sums up being fifty miles   i see umhum umhum and what kind of a bike do you have what kind of stationary bike do you use   uh i dont even remember the name of it any more     but   but it it works pretty good it measures you know it measures your your pulse and and and your miles per hour and calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and so forth but i dont even remember the name of it any more   well the bikes ive used at the Y one of them i cant remember what they are right at the moment either but the the old ones were you pedalled sort of downward you know you were basically sitting pretty much like a standard
