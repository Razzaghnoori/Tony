                            Scientific truth is a moving target In the process of peer review authors reviewers        and editors work together to minimize the reporting of false results However even if one        assumes no bias wrongdoing or ignorance on the part of any of the individuals        involvedwhich is unrealistic no doubtchances are that some findings will turn out to be        false But is it inevitable as John Ioannidis argues in an Essay in this issue of         PLoS Medicine DOI journalpmed that the majority of        findings are actually false        Although his calculations are based on assumptions about complex scenarios that we do        not fully understandas is true for most research projectsIoannidis argues convincingly        that many published findings will turn out to be false        Ioannidis is not the first to raise some of these concerns Indeed there are already        initiatives under way that seek to address them Increasingly researchers design        individual studies systematic reviews and metaanalyses using Bayesian statistics in        which the issue of prestudy odds is taken into account And issues such as reducing        sources of bias when assessing evidence are addressed in the methodology used by the        Cochrane Collaboration in the production of its systematic reviews        Ioannidis doesnt define findings but it seems important to attempt to separate data        in this study  of people examined who lived in San Francisco from  developed        lung cancer compared with  of people studied who lived in Anchorage from conclusions        lung cancer rates are higher in Anchorage than San Francisco and hypotheses cold        weather exacerbates the consequences of smoking        Hypotheses will inevitably change as they depend not only on the study but also on the        context of other relevant research and knowledge Conclusions are also often based on        current knowledge and assumptions and thus subject to change The data should be more        robust for instance other researchers applying the same methods to study the same group        of patients at the same time should be able to generate the same data However research        progress depends on conclusions being tested elsewhere The major issue about the truth of        research findings would therefore seem to concern the conclusions and Ioannidiss claim        that most conclusions are false is probably correct Is that a problem Can it be        avoided        The possibility that most conclusions are false might be an inevitable part of the        research endeavor That said researchers and those involved in publication of research        must do what they can to reduce false conclusions        One way to do this is to delay publication until such a time when the chances that a        conclusion is true are sufficiently high If many published conclusions are false we        editors and reviewers need to ask ourselves whether we are setting the bar too low But        what is the consequence of setting it higher        Research progress depends on dissemination of results and journal articles are the most        effective tool we currently have to share them The answer therefore cannot be that we        wait until conclusions are proven beyond a doubt before we publish them Publication of        preliminary findings negative studies confirmations and refutations is an essential part        of the process of getting closer to the truth Everyone involved in the generation and        publication of research results needs to be openminded rigorous and honest in designing        experiments analyzing results reporting findings peerreviewing manuscripts providing        comments and accepting that uncertainty exists in research        Ioannidis suggests how studies could be designed from the outset to increase their        chances of producing true results He also gives some corollaries that allow readers to get        a sense of the extent of uncertainty for a particular study He stresses that reliable        evidence generally comes from several studies and from several teams of researchers and        that what matters is the totality of the evidence        What can editors do At highimpact journals such as         PLoS Medicine  we see it as our job to select important articles This        means the conclusions reported should be more rather than less likely to be true But        better measures of importance are that a study should address a substantial clinical or        public health question in as rigorous a way as possible and the findings should be        likely to have an effect on how other researchers think about the question In reporting        studies we ask that data are clearly delineated from conclusions and conclusions from        hypotheses In addition to individual studies editors should and at         PLoS Medicine we do ensure there is a place for articles that synthesize        evidence from different sources        Too often editors and reviewers reward only the cleanest results and the most        straightforward conclusions At         PLoS Medicine  we seek to create a publication environment that is        comfortable with uncertainty We encourage authors to discuss biases study limitations        and potential confounding factors We acknowledge that most studies published should be        viewed as hypothesisgenerating rather than conclusive And we publish highquality        negative and confirmatory studies        We also accept some responsibility for educating consumers of research about the        research process Consumers also need to become comfortable with uncertainty and        understand the strengths and weaknesses intrinsic to every study conducted and published        Besides selecting papers and influencing how results are reported we use the synopses and        patient summaries to highlight uncertainties in research papers We also encourage        contributions such as the essay by Ioannidis to our magazine section that will help        research producers and consumers to understand research findings in context
