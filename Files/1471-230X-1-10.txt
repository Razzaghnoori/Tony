 Introduction Cystic fibrosis CF is an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CFTR chloride channel 1 CFTR is known to possess multiple cellular functions beyond its role as an apical membrane chloride channel 2 For example regulation of other ion channels such as the epithelial sodium channel and the outwardly rectified chloride channel are well described functions of CFTR 3 4 Numerous other functions such as regulation of intracellular vesicular pH regulation of membrane recycling and regulation of mucin exocytosis are less firmly established Phenotypic expression in CF is variable with multiple organs affected The disease is commonly but variably expressed in the lungs the exocrine pancreas and the gastrointestinal mucosa 5 6 Significant intestinal malabsorption of various substrates including bile acids is a consistent finding in CF patients The total bile acid pool is contracted unless supplementation with pancreatic enzymes is provided In children bile acid losses can be so severe that a deficiency of the amino acid taurine can occur due to excessive losses of taurine conjugated bile acids 7 8 Bile acid malabsorption in CF has been attributed to an inhibitory effect of un hydrolyzed intraluminal triglycerides on the intestinal absorption of bile acids However in several studies the correlation between fecal fat excretion and fecal bile acid loss could not be demonstrated suggesting that additional factors are responsible for bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis 9 10 In vitro studies using brush border membrane vesicles or bathed tissue samples from patients with cystic fibrosis have shown that total ileal bile acid uptake is diminished 11 12 The present study was designed to determine if the activity and density of the ileal bile acid transporter IBAT is diminished in heterozygous and homozygous cftr knockout mice The results indicate that bile acid malabsorption in CF is not caused by a defect in sodium dependent bile acid transport at the brush border membrane suggesting another mechanism is operative Materials and Methods Animals Cftr knockout mice with targeted disruption of the cftr gene created at the University of North Carolina 13 were maintained at the University of Washington Animal Care Facility under the auspices of the UW Cystic Fibrosis Research Center Thirty five post weanling mice more than 20 days old strain V129Xl SvJ were used including 6 homozygous cftr 23 heterozygous cftr and 6 wild type cftr mice All mice had been kept on a standard liquid diet Peptamen Nestle Deerfield IL for 3 weeks until immediately prior to sacrifice On this diet the mice showed no evidence of obstruction Mice underwent inhalation anesthesia with 1 5 methoxyflurane Metophane Mallinckrodt Mundelein IL for the harvest of the intestines and were sacrificed subsequently by cervical dislocation under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Use Committee Geno typing was performed using DNA isolated from the mouse tails Following isolation of genomic DNA by standard techniques PCR was performed using primers specific for wild type mice and for cftr knockout mice The primer sets used and the expected size products were as follows WT CAGTGAAGCTGAGACTGTGA GCATAATCCAAGAAAATTGAG 1 1 kb CF CGGTTCTTTTTGTCAAGAC ATCCTCGCCGTCGGGCATGC 400 bp Wild type mice expressed cftr protein by immunoblotting while cftr did not 14 All chemicals were from Sigma unless otherwise stated Sigma Aldrich St Louis MO The investigators performing the uptake and immunohistochemistry experiments were blinded to the results of the geno typing Preparation of intestinal segments Mice were anesthetized and the abdomen opened A one cm segment of jejunum was resected at the ligament of Treitz The terminal 8 cm segment of ileum was removed and immediately transferred into 2 C cold mammalian Ringer solution 128 mM NaCl 4 7 mM KCl 2 5 mM CaCl 2 1 2 mM NaH 2 PO 4 1 2 mM MgSO 4 and 20 mM NaHCO 3 pH at 37 C 7 30 7 40 290 mosm gassed continuously with 95 O 2 5 CO 2 The intestinal length was measured and the tissue cut into 2 one cm segments 1 five cm segment and another one cm segment beginning distally The five cm gut segment located 2 cm to 7 cm proximal to ileocecal valve was used for uptake experiments The segment was cut into five one cm pieces These specimens were everted and the intestinal sleeves secured onto 1 mm diameter stainless steel rods using 3 0 silk ties as described previously 15 The distal ileal segments from 1 2 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve immediately adjacent to the tissue used in the uptake experiments and the jejunal segments were used for immunohistochemistry studies The ileal segments from 7 8 cm and 0 1 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve respectively from each animal were pooled and used for Western blots Uptake measurements All uptake measurements were performed between 1 and 2 hours after excision Samples were randomized into 2 groups Intestines from the first group were exposed to an identical radioactive taurocholate solution containing sodium Samples from the second group were exposed to a sodium free taurocholate solution Mounted tissues were preincubated for 5 min in 37 C warm oxygenated Ringer s solution Then rods were suspended with the tissue positioned 5 mm above stirring bars rotating at 1 200 rpm and uptake was measured for 2 min in 37 C warm oxygenated Ringer s solution with 1 mM taurocholate To the uptake solutions tracer amounts of radiolabeled sodium taurocholate 3H G sodium taurocholate 74 GBq mmol NEN Research Products Boston MA were added 1 2 14C polyethylene glycol MW 4000 Dalton 9 3 MBq mmol NEN Research Products Boston MA a marker substance not subject to carrier mediated transport and with a very low diffusion coefficient was added to these solutions to account for 3H radiotracer in the adherent fluid The incubation time was chosen based on validation experiments that showed that PEG equilibrated in the unstirred layer after two minutes In contrast taurocholate uptake rates remained linear for at least four minutes data not shown To measure Na independent uptake Na free Ringer s solution was prepared by replacing NaCl with Choline Cl and NaHCO 3 with KHCO 3 In the Na free solutions taurocholate was added as a potassium salt Potassium taurocholate was prepared by ion exchange of a 1 M solution Na taurocholate with potassium loaded AmberLyte Biorad Hercules CA The potassium salt was subsequently recrystallized Absence of sodium ions

intensity over background in circular image fields extending from the villus tip to the crypt base using an MS2 image analysis system Imaging Research St Catherines Ontario Canada Western blots Brush border membrane vesicles were prepared as described by deRooij 11 Briefly frozen ileal tissue fragments 20 25 mg were thawed and homogenized in 100 l of isotonic buffer 300 mM mannitol 12 mM Tris HCl pH 7 1 using a Polytron homogenizer Kinematica AG Littau Switzerland This suspension was cleared form debris and diluted with five volumes of ice cold water and MgCl 2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mM After 40 minutes this suspension was centrifuged at 3 000 g for 15 min The supernatant was decanted into another vial and stored at 4 C The pellet was resuspended in buffer and after 40 minutes this suspension was centrifuged as before The two supernatant fractions were combined and centrifuged for 30 min at 27 000 g to spin down the brush border membrane vesicles 10 l of

manufacturer Statistical Analysis All data were collected from individual tissues and processed as independent data points as well as grouped by their origin 2 cm 3 cm from the ileocecal valve etc Results were expressed as mean standard error of the mean SEM Comparisons were made between multiple groups using ANOVA and the unpaired student t test as a post hoc test Significance was assumed at p 0 05 Results Active rates of taurocholate uptake were twice as high in the heterozygous cftr mice n 23 compared to wild type mice n 6 average of all data points in the terminal ileum 109 8 vs 64 13 cm

to 7 cm from the ileocecal valve Fig 1a However only differences in the section at 2 and 3 cm reached a level of significance of p 0 05 Differences in rates of passive uptake of taurocholate were not statistically significant among groups Fig 1b Microscopic morphology of the mucosa was similar in the different study groups Prior to use for Western blotting brush border membrane vesicle suspensions were tested for enrichment of brush border enzymes and showed a 4 5 fold increase of alkaline phosphatase and a 10 11 fold increase in alpha glucosidase activity using standard methods 19 On densitometric evaluations of Western blots IBAT concentrations were twice as high in heterozygotes as in controls 17 3 vs 5 1 density units p 0 05 and four times as high in homozygotes 30 4 vs 5 1 density units p 0 05 Fig 2and 3 A similar relationship was found in intensity of IBAT immunostaining on examinations of microscopic sections treated with anti IBAT antibodies The highest increases in signal density were noted at the base of the crypts of cftr animals arrow in Fig 4 These unusual changes were never found in any jejunal samples and occurred only occasionally as weak signals in ileal samples from wild type animals Discussion Untreated children and adults with cystic fibrosis excrete amounts of fecal bile acids similar to patients with ileal resections 20 21 Based on kinetic studies this increased fecal loss appears to be secondary to an interrupted enterohepatic circulation of bile acids 20 21 Bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis appears to be due in part to diminished secretion of pancreatic enzymes and the presence of un hydrolyzed triglycerides Supplementation with pancreatic enzymes and a low fat diet can markedly reduce the fecal excretion of bile acids 9 10 20 23 Other evidence however suggests that a diminished capacity of the ileal mucosa for bile acid uptake plays a significant role in bile acid malabsorption associated with cystic fibrosis that is independent of triglyceride concentrations Findings supporting this notion include 1 The absence of a correlation between fecal fat excretion and fecal bile acid loss 2 The normal fecal bile acid losses in patients with liver disease compared to excessive losses in those without liver disease despite similar fecal fat excretion and 3 The finding that patients with almost normal fat excretion continue to lose large amounts of bile acids Based on these findings a defect in ileal bile acid transport mechanisms in cystic fibrosis has been suspected Data in support of this hypothesis are contradictory Fondacaro et al bathed ileal biopsies from CF patients in taurocholate solutions They found a decrease in total apical basolateral bile acid uptake compared to normal controls 12 and hypothesized that bile acid malabsorption in cystic fibrosis was due to a primary mucosal defect although they had not specifically studied apical Na dependent absorption De Rooij et al found significant decreases in active bile acid uptake when examining ileal brush border membrane vesicles 11 and proposed that altered viscosity of the ileal mucus was likely not a factor in ileal bile acid malabsorption associated with cystic fibrosis In another study using marker perfusions with taurocholate and glycocholate in three infants however the bile acid uptake rates with cystic fibrosis were similar to control subjects 24 The results from our study stand in contrast to these earlier studies We found a significant increase in bile acid transport in cftr and cftr mice This increase in IBAT function was paralleled by increases in IBAT protein concentrations Similar discrepancies between measurements of solute uptake with brush border membrane vesicles or tissue biopsies and in vivo experiments have been observed in studies examining sodium glucose cotransport in cystic fibrosis Jejunal glucose absorption was enhanced in patients with cystic fibrosis when measured with catheter perfusion techniques 25 Ussing chamber studies of intact CF biopsy specimens suggest that glucose and alanine uptake rates are markedly increased in cystic fibrosis 26 Taylor also studied intact jejunal biopsies and found that the rate of active sodium glucose transport approximately doubled in CF compared to normal jejunum 27 Contrary to these findings other investigations have been unable to demonstrate any changes in sodium glucose co transport when examining brush border membrane vesicles 28 The up regulation of intestinal sodium linked nutrient absorption by cftr may occur via a mechanism that does not involve changes of the brush border membrane but rather intracellular components 28 Intestinal sodium linked nutrient absorption would then be undetectable in brush border membrane vesicle studies However a number of studies using biopsies in Ussing chambers have also been unable to demonstrate enhanced glucose absorption in cystic fibrosis 29 30 31 Phenotypic expression is variable in patients carrying homozygous or heterozygous mutations of the CFTR gene The F508 mutation is the most common genetic disturbance affecting the CFTR gene F508 heterozygotes are affected to a lesser degree than are homozygotes In heterozygous infants with the WT F508 genotype sweat chloride excretion is elevated 1 5 fold over normal values compared to a tenfold increase in homozygous patients with the F508 F508 genotype 32 Adult heterozygous patients have fewer problems with respiratory infections compared to homozygotes 5 Our findings that bile acid absorption was moderately increased in heterozygotes and markedly increased in homozygotes were therefore not unexpected Heterozygotes are able to produce a limited number of intact correctly localized CFTR protein molecules resulting in partial phenotypic expression The correlation between zygosity and level of IBAT protein expression suggests a close relationship between the function of the CFTR chloride channel and the sodium dependent ileal bile acid transporter Our study is the first that correlates changes in function of another intestinal solute transporter with the expression level of CFTR Increased bile acid transport in cftr mice is associated with an increase in the abundance of IBAT protein in the brush border membrane Similar associations exist in normal rodents In hamsters rats and mice increases and decreases in bile acid absorption at the brush border membrane are mediated by an up or down regulation in IBAT gene transcription 33 34 In several rodent species including mice regulation of IBAT is clearly dependent on intraluminal bile acid concentrations and occurs via a negative feedback mechanism 33 34 35 Feeding of bile acids suppresses transcription of IBAT mRNA and reduces IBAT protein abundance feeding of the bile acid binder cholestyramine has the opposite effect In normal animals this negative feedback mechanism keeps the enterohepatic bile acid pool in equilibrium As bile acids are lost increased absorption by a greater number of transporters in combination with increased hepatic bile acid synthesis from cholesterol helps restore normal bile acid levels In contrast cftr mice may experience bile acid malabsorption even though their ileal mucosal cells express four fold more IBAT transporters than normal cells This apparently paradoxical finding would suggest a luminal factor that prevents bile acids from entering the mucosal cells in the ileum Based on this evidence we postulate that the more viscous mucus layer in the ileal crypts of individuals with cystic fibrosis limits access of luminal bile acids and micelles to the ileal crypt cells This may result in an altered programming of ileal stem cells and transit cells that give rise to absorptive enterocytes over expressing IBAT protein Further investigations are needed to corroborate this hypothesis Additional studies should examine changes in mucus layer thickness mucus viscosity and permeability for bile acids associated with hetero and homozygosity for CFTR mutations An alternative mechanism for the upregulation of IBAT in cystic fibrosis is that CFTR acts as a negative regulator of IBAT as it does for the epithelial sodium channel 36 As IBAT is a sodium dependent apical membrane transporter it might be regulated by CFTR as is the epithelial sodium channel ENaC present in the apical membrane of the ileal enterocyte CFTR regulation of ENaC has been described in the colon in humans 37 and in cftr knockout mice 37 Co localization of CFTR and ENaC suggests that direct protein protein interactions allow CFTR to closely regulate the activity of this channel 39 40 Our results suggest that knockout of CFTR leads to an analogous increase in expression and function of IBAT Of course a more widespread perturbation of ion channel regulation in the absence of CFTR is also a possibility as CFTR has been demonstrated to be a master regulator of such diverse proteins as the Na K pump 41 the basolateral Na K 2Cl co transporter 42 and the inducible nitric oxide synthase 43 Conclusions In summary in the widely studied cftr knockout mouse model which clearly demonstrates intestinal pathology the apical sodium dependent ileal bile acid transporter is expressed and functions at higher levels than in wild type animals with intermediate levels of IBAT expression and function in heterozygous cftr mice The results of this study open up further avenues of investigation with respect to the role of the mucus layer in causing a secondary up regulation of IBAT expression and function In addition IBAT may be yet another apical membrane transport protein that is regulated by CFTR Competing Interests None declared Grant Support Part of this work was
