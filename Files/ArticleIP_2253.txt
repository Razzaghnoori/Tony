 Clinton Turns Yellow By Jacob Weisberg I 531 words posted Friday Oct 25 to be composted Friday Nov 1 In a small office in the West Wing of the White House next to Press Secretary Mike McCurry sits an intense wiry political operative named Rahm Emanuel Though he is not among President Clinton s best known advisers Emanuel may be the administration s most diabolically effective tactician On the issue of crime in which he mostly specializes Emanuel has gotten celebrated victims like James Brady and Marc Klaas to appear in Democratic TV spots He is also largely responsible for moving the Clinton campaign beyond mere rapid response to pre emptive strikes engineering for instance Clinton s endorsement by the Fraternal Order of Police on the day Bob Dole was set to launch a major attack on the president s crime record So it wasn t hard to guess the origin of the president s latest little things proposal to require drug testing of teen agers who want a driver s license Dole s attack on Clinton for presiding over an increase in drug use by young people had the potential to bite by tossing out the drug testing idea Clinton could claim to be doing something about the problem Our message should be simple Clinton said in his Saturday radio address No drugs or no driver s license Clinton s simple proposal might be better described as simple minded not to mention impractical useless and offensive to notions of privacy and constitutional rights But the truth is that though Emanuel pushed the proposal along with domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed it can t be blamed on advisers or even laid at the doorstep of election year politics No one had to work very hard to talk Clinton into accepting yet another abridgment of individual freedom for the sake of political expediency What the drug testing proposal should remind us is not just that Clinton is an opportunist who with a 20 point lead is now pandering beyond the call of victory It should also put us on our guard about a man who if he is a liberal at all is a liberal of an odd sort One with no instinctive regard for civil liberties or the Bill of Rights Clinton s abysmal record on liberty goes back to his days as governor of Arkansas The low moment was in 1989 when under no pressure from anyone he proposed a law to ban desecration of both the American and Arkansas flags It was totally gratuitous says Joseph Jacobson who was director of the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union at the time Under a then recent Supreme Court decision It wasn t even in doubt that it was unconstitutional Clinton seemed more First Amendment friendly after he was elected president when he reversed himself and opposed amending the Constitution to ban flag burning But that stance turned out to be a false positive for the president on civil liberties Since then he has consistently insulted both the First and the Fourth amendments Some would say he has disregarded the Second Amendment too But that s a different discussion Clinton s First Amendment slovenliness first became apparent in 1993 when he boxed his own solicitor general on the ears for having been on the wrong side in the Knox case in which a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania was convicted for possessing videotapes of teen age girls wearing bikinis and underwear When the Supreme Court overturned the graduate student s conviction Clinton joined in the chorus condemning the court s decision You might grant Clinton that one as a necessary surrender no politician in his right mind wants to be allied with child pornographers But what Clinton did on the Communications Decency Act is truly unforgivable When Sen James Exon of Nebraska introduced a foolish bill which would have criminalized the transmission of indecent or patently offensive material via the Internet the administration backed it It was Republicans more than Democrats who tried unsuccessfully to derail the CDA in Congress One oddity of this political moment is that while our Democratic president has no special love of civil liberties civil libertarian sentiment is growing in the unlikely soil of the GOP where vilification of the American Civil Liberties Union has been campaign boilerplate at least until recently This surprising development is partly a matter of pandering to anti government paranoids in the gun lobby and militia movement partly anti Clinton opportunism partly explained at least in the CDA case by the interests of business but partly perhaps principled In the CDA debate Republican Rep Christopher Cox of California led the push for an alternative both Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey supported Cox s position But it was left to a three judge U S Court of Appeals panel in Philadelphia to throw out the law calling it profoundly repugnant Did Clinton learn his lesson Hardly The administration is appealing the decision to the Supreme Court And Clinton recently signed an immigration bill giving the government the power to exclude anyone who advocates terrorist activity This threatens to become a modern version of the McCarran Walter Act which was used during the Cold War to exclude lefty writers and intellectuals On Fourth Amendment rights Clinton has been no better In his crime bill passed in 1994 he went further than any Republican president would have dared to restrict habeas corpus the writ by which state prisoners including those on death row can get their cases reviewed by federal courts Under the immigration bill Clinton directed the Immigration and Naturalization Service to deport asylum seekers without giving them any opportunity to appear before a tribunal And in his most recent anti terrorism proposal which he tried to wing through Congress in the wake of the TWA 800 disaster Clinton requested vast new wiretapping powers for the FBI Once again it was primarily a few liberty loving Republicans who restrained him The drug testing proposal may be Clinton s most obnoxious gesture of all In the other instances there is at least a trade off posited between individual rights and competing public purposes like the protection of children In the case of drug testing however the proposed warrantless blanket invasions of privacy serve only a symbolic value A scheduled drug test is easily beaten you just need to stay clean for a short time before the test Then you can celebrate your license by getting high In answer to the objection that urine tests reveal only very recent use of hard drugs Bruce Reed says that before long drug testing technology will have advanced from urine to hair tests which may reveal chemical traces for up to a year But here the insult to civil liberties becomes staggering The explicit purpose becomes finding out who among the young has ever indulged in the kind of experiment that both members of the Democratic ticket have acknowledged participating in themselves Clinton made this purpose clear in his speech Thursday at Birmingham Southern College where he said the reason for the tests was to to find those kids and help them before they re in trouble and it s too late That Clinton simply has no conception of why such an intrusion might be worrisome was evident from that speech as it was from his radio address in which he compared his proposal to the requirement that parolees take drug tests Parolees are convicted criminals People applying for driver s licenses aren t even suspects of anything It has been suggested that Clinton limited his idea to under 18s in order to affront only people who cannot vote The more likely reason however is that if the idea is ultimately judged constitutional a big if this will only be because it applies to those who do not have the full legal rights of adults On top of this sorry civil liberties record are the misuse of the FBI in the White House s own original travel office investigation and what has come to be known as Filegate No one has yet traced these abuses to the president himself But there is something to the argument that his cavalier attitude about individual rights helped to create an atmosphere in which thuggish members of his administration could regard invasions of privacy very lightly Dole is hardly better than Clinton when it comes to the Bill of Rights and there are lots of Republicans like Bob Barr of Georgia who decry only those incursions that perturb the National Rifle Association But if Clinton sets the new Democratic standard the day may not be far off when some Democratic candidate accuses a Republican opponent of being a card carrying member of the ACLU and the Republican proudly admits it
