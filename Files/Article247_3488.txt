 Harry in Love Dear Tony You raise a truly terrifying specter romance Harry and Hermie sitting in a tree K I S S I N G Eight year olds around the world will turn queasy at the thought Of course we did get the first glimmerings of it in Chamber of Secrets when Hermione along with half the girls at Hogwarts and everybody s mom go all dewy eyed at the thought of Gilderoy Lockhart that god awful blowhard of a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher the one with the perfect profile Rowling please You re giving girlkind a bad name In Prisoner of Azkaban there are hints that Harry s sweet on Cho Chang who plays the same position he does on Ravenclaw s Quidditch team She s a fourth year which makes her an older woman Then there s the littlest Weasley Ginny who conceives a crush on Harry early in Book 1 It gets her into trouble in Book 2 evidently wanting to make a good impression on your beloved is another impulse that can inadvertently put you in the hands of darkness Is there more story to be milked there Ginny for example could turn into a knockout in Book 5 when she should be 14 or so winning too late the hitherto impermeable heart of Potter then extracting just revenge by scorning him utterly sending him off on a quixotic love quest just when he s most needed to save the world No I doubt it too but it s a thought I m more inclined to look for the sexpots of supernatural tradition sirens vampires various enchantresses those green ladies with rotten or serpentine lower bodies what are they called who show up in for example Coleridge s Christobel Can you see Harry and his rival Malfoy vying for the attentions of a mermaid Well whatever Rowling does with sexuality you can be sure it ll be funny We know that wizards date muggles from time to time I m pretty sure some of the kids are products of mixed marriages Can t remember who though That s an interesting idea Rowling could bring in a young muggle hero It needn t be a love interest it could just be someone with whom frustrated readers lacking all magical talents can identify Someone utterly unmagical who nevertheless enters the wizard world and makes a difference I agree with you that we all know ourselves to be misunderstood magicians trapped in a horribly mundane world This is particularly true in childhood but I m not over it yet are you Still there s that nasty inner voice that revels in whispering words of reason and I for one believe it too it makes a plausible case that you and I are ordinary people after all So Rowling might do us a service by writing a place for us Well me anyway You re clearly a real magician I ll be astonished though delighted if any of the characters turn out to be gay Bet you a silver sickle the homosexual themes are treated with sublimation and symbolism As far as Harry s being tempted by power I see what you mean but I don t really think that s where the series is headed We ve seen it so often before Saruman in Lord of the Rings Milton s irritating Satan even Voldemort himself and Harry isn t the type He s too ordinary Sure he loves winning at Quidditch but he s just not into power Or fame even really remember how grossed out he gets as does the reader when Gilderoy Lockhart gives him tips for grabbing the spotlight I say his failings will be less about power more about love In The Sorcerer s Stone he s tempted by a mirror that shows the viewer s heart s desire Gazing in it Harry sees his family for the first time his dead mother and father and a whole array ancestors He can hardly bring himself to turn away and sneaks back for another fix whenever he gets the chance I think he s more likely to be caught by that kind of temptation than by a hunger for power Voldemort could pose as the guardian of Harry s heritage as someone who loves him But you could be right about Harry s anger towards his parents they did leave him dramatically in the lurch after all despite saving his life I d sure be mad if I had to go live with that aunt uncle and cousin I m looking forward to learning more about the four houses that make up the school There are the ambitious Slytherins the brainy Ravenclaws the just and loyal Hufflepuffs and the house with all our heroes Gryffindor where dwell the brave at heart It s not immediately clear why the Sorting Hat puts people in the houses it chooses For example wouldn t you guess scholarly Hermione would belong in Ravenclaw And I m still waiting to find out what s so brave about poor Neville Longbottom who keeps losing his pet toad getting scolded by his grandmother and cowering in corridors What s he doing in Griffindor He does have a brave moment when he stands up to his friends he thinks they re up to no good but it s not quite enough So far we don t know many Ravenclaws or Hufflepuffs I d like to see a book in which Rowling calls upon the strengths of each house even Slytherin to aid Harry in his epic struggle What would you like to see Got any suggestions for the divine enchantress Best Polly
