 Boxes Within Boxes Boxes Within Boxes Reader discussion forums such as Slate s The Fray are one of the advantages of publishing on the Web But they also create a weird anomaly On the one hand the writings of professional journalists and others who appear in Slate at our request and get paid for it are put through an editorial process more or less like that of a traditional paper magazine which can take several hours to a week or more from manuscript to publication On the other hand any stranger anywhere in the world can have his or her words posted on our site instantaneously and with no editing at all except very occasionally after the fact Faced with this contradiction we decided not to start rigorous editing of the Fray It remains a place where Slate members can speak out unmolested by meddlesome editors wielding software programs such as Semicolon Killer TM and Shut Up Already 98 for Windows TM and Antitrust AutoPurge Pro TM which automatically erases any turn of phrase analyzed to agree with the Justice Department about anything Instead we have been experimenting cautiously with the opposite approach giving a few trusted writers the same freedom to publish in Slate that the readers enjoy Our first fraytech feature was Today s Papers To be honest this decision was based less on philosophical insight than on the fact that none of us wanted to be up every weeknight at 3 a m or so when Scott Shuger files his copy More recently we ve added Chatterbox political scuttlebutt and speculation and Culturebox insights and musings about culture high and low Both these departments are updated with new material two or three times a week very approximately on no set schedule and at no particular time of day or night From the author s laptop to Slate nonstop Now we are adding two more fraytech features Or rather two established Slate features are evolving in accord with the Web imperatives of frequency and speed The Motley Fool James Surowiecki s weekly column on business and finance becomes Moneybox still written by Jim but shorter takes more frequent and more timely We hope to continue our happy relationship with the Motley Fool shortly with a new feature Surowiecki has left the Fool to become a columnist for New York magazine The Gist our weekly background briefing on some issue in the news will become Explainer An explainer is journospeak for an article that um explains things he explained Our Explainer the person not the article will be standing by every weekday to explain things the newspapers and television and even news Web sites leave unclear It might be the historical background of some current news story It might be a straightforward rundown of the facts and arguments in a controversy that has been clouded by strong passions and flying sound bites Or it might be a snappy summary of some issue that would be clear enough if you actually read the entire five part Philadelphia Inquirer series which you re not about to do because life is short That s fine Explainer will read it for you Explainer is fully capable of finding news stories confusing or unclear without assistance but also welcomes suggestions from puzzled readers E mail explainer slate com any time day or night The Great Explanation begins around June 10 Now With Extra Spin There s also been a change in The Week The Spin that we hope you ll approve of It now
