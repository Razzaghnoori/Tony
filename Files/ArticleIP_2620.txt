 The Book on Cook It is easier to get out of bed in the morning if you know you are going to make 5 000 or 10 000 at the end of the day Most people I think would agree with this B uy stocks in companies that have a good chance of going up Again as opposed to the alternative this seems wise Finally Life is too fluid to predict Unless apparently you re predicting whether a company s stock will be going up enough to make you 10 000 in a day These trenchant statements of the obvious can be found in the collected works of Wade Cook former real estate prophet and current stock market guru Cook is chairman of the board of whose only business is marketing Cook s books his cassettes and his two day Wall Street Workshops in which you can enroll for the piddling sum of 2 500 He is also at last count author of four books on the New York Times business best seller list including the original classic Wall Street Money Machine and the recent Business Buy the Bible That is not a typo The books offer an almost self parodic mix of motivational rhetoric complete confidence that nothing will go wrong and an utter lack of anything like an understanding of economics Not coincidentally they also promise enormous returns fast returns of at the very least 20 percent to 40 percent a month and perhaps as much as between 600 percent and 800 percent a year I make millions Cook writes I ll teach you to do the same But Cook is more than just the Billy Sunday of the investing world He s also a cardinal example of the speculative mania that long bull markets often engender the froth that rises to the surface in turbulent times Even more importantly Cook s methods which in their essence rely on the purchase of options on margin underscore the almost complete divorce between American financial markets and American businesses After wading through Cook s texts you begin to understand why it seems so natural to call speculators parasitic Well yes I know you re saying but do his methods work What after all is the label parasite next to 2 million in the bank Cook s definition of being rich The short answer to the first question is Probably not Cook insists he s been inordinately successful with his strategies and his later books are filled with testimonials from people saying things like I just sold the calls at 13 50 It s only a 12 5 percent return but annualized it s 4 562 5 percent and I started with 50 000 and my account is now at 177 000 But he doesn t offer any systematic accounting of his trading record and we do not hear from those people who ended up gambling away their life savings I started with 50 000 and I now have 52 Thanks so much One also wonders why Cook spends so much time selling books and seminars if he can make 20 000 a day with just 15 minutes of work Actually we know the answer to that question His real passion is helping others improve their lives It would be easier to believe in both Cook s dedication to our well being and the truthfulness of his claims if his past record were more reassuring click for a look at that record When Cook s get rich quick in real estate promotions failed leaving investors in his American Business Alliance holding worthless paper Cook simply moved on to bigger things And Americans newfound passion for stock investing provided the perfect opportunity To seize that opportunity Cook counsels strategies that despite his simplistic truisms are both complicated and risky He recommends that investors leverage their existing capital so that more than half of their investments are purchased on margin that is loaned to them by their broker He urges investors to pay an inordinate amount of attention to companies that announce stock splits And most importantly he recommends buying and selling complex arrays of options often at the same time Whether or not this is really the best way to make money in the market it is certainly the best way to ensure a steady supply of customers for Cook s home study materials and workshops Of course as Cook says more than once actually he says it more than 25 times what s 2 500 for a workshop next to the veritable millions you ll make as soon as you ve learned the sure fire techniques of buying options on margin True enough But how do those techniques work Here s the very short version There are two kinds of options calls and puts both of which you can buy and sell When you buy a call you purchase the right to buy a stock at a given price If a stock is at 20 today and you buy November calls at 25 and the stock never gets to 25 your options expire worthless But if the stock gets to 35 you can make a nice profit Buying puts is the same only in reverse You buy the right to sell a stock obviously in the expectation that it will go down Cook though isn t really interested in exchanging the options for actual shares He just wants to buy and sell the options themselves because options are both cheaper and more volatile than stock and therefore offer the prospect of much larger gains But Cook s entire strategy is built on the principle that it s possible to predict in the short term when stocks will rise and fall A surer recipe for disaster has never been devised His strategy is also built on the assumption that if you ve got a sure thing you should bet the house on it which is why you buy on margin But he never makes clear that buying on margin means that you stand to lose a lot more when you make a mistake And because you re buying options you re left with nothing There are no shares of a stock that might someday come back just piles of options as worthless as those shares of Cook s American Business Alliance Click to read about Cook and ABA if you missed the previous link to it Cook refers to his strategies as evidence that the American dream is still alive But if so that dream has become the feeblest of ideals Stock options after all serve no useful purpose in the real economy Unlike commodity futures or even currency futures that allow farmers or companies to do a better job of projecting their future business stock options contribute nothing to the smooth functioning of capital markets The stock options market doesn t make it easier for companies to go public or for existing companies to raise money It s simply a big casino Cook might just as well be gambling on what color tie President Clinton will wear tomorrow In Stock Market Miracles Cook writes that the way to wealth is to enlarge the pie It s an odd maxim for a man whose work is dedicated to the idea that the way to amass wealth is to take it not create it
