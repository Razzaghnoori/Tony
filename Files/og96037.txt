UNDER 5 U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION ENTITLED POLICIES AND RULES CONCERNING CHILDREN S TELEVISION PROGRAMMING REVISION OF PROGRAMMING POLICIES FOR TELEVISION BROADCAST STATIONS FCC 96 335 MM Docket No 93 48 i Cost benefit analysis The Commission has advised our Office that it was not required to prepare and did not prepare a cost benefit analysis of the rule ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed rulemaking 60 Fed Reg 20590 April 26 1995 incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the expected impact on small entities The analysis included in the proposed rulemaking provides the information required by paragraphs 603 b 1 through 3 It describes the reasons for the proposed agency action and its objectives and legal basis It also describes the total number of entities of all sizes that may be affected by the rule See below The analysis also requests comments regarding the reporting and record keeping requirements of the proposed rule In accordance with paragraph 603 b 5 the Commission notes that the proposed rule does not duplicate overlap or conflict with any relevant federal rule Also it states that the proposed rule has been designed to minimize the impact on small entities while retaining the benefits of encouraging television broadcast programming that satisfies the requirements of the Children s Television Act of 1990 Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The preamble to the final rule includes the full text of the final regulatory flexibility analysis 61 Fed Reg 43992 The analysis includes the information required by paragraph 604 a by summarizing and evaluating relevant comments received A major portion of the analysis describes the steps the Commission took in attempting to determine the number of small entities affected by the rule based on GAO OGC 96 37 various criteria databases and Census Bureau information This was necessary because of the inadequacy of the Small Business Administration s definition for television broadcasting stations the annual receipt data collected by the Commission and the classification of stations with network affiliation Under various analyses the worst case scenario would be the application of the rule to a low of 771 commercial stations 68 percent of all stations to a high of 1 155 commercial and noncommercial stations 78 percent of all stations The Commission believes that these estimates greatly overstate the number of small entities affected and reserves the right to adopt a more suitable definition of small business as applied to television broadcast stations at a later date following the conclusion of several pending proceedings at the Commission seeking comment on the definition of and data relating to small businesses and compliance with section 601 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act The final analysis discusses the comments received and the alternatives considered and the steps taken to minimize the impact on small entities It appears that many of these changes will also reduce the burden on non small entities These steps include the deletion of the requirement in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that a broadcast station utilize an icon for the identification of core programming The method of identification is now at the discretion of the stations The Commission also rejected a proposal that stations consult with educational experts in order for a program to qualify as core programming Finally the Commission will issue a standardized reporting form for the quarterly children s programming report to ease the information collection burden on small entities The final analysis was forwarded to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration Section 605 Avoidance of duplicative or unnecessary analysis The Commission did not invoke any of the exemptions or special procedures authorized by section 605 in preparing its regulatory flexibility analysis Section 607 Preparation of Analysis The Commission s analysis used both quantifiable and general descriptions of the effects of the rule on small entities Section 609 Participation by small entities In addition to the actions required by 5 U S C 553 the Commission also made available a complete copy of the proposed and final rulemaking materials via the Internet Page 2 GAO OGC 96 37 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C
