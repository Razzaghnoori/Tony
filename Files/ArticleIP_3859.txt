Western Europe and their targets hail from around the globe While the CIA Bubba may prefer a cold Bud and softball over a weekend of Bondian play in St Moritz I defy Luttwak to demonstrate how the U S government can reliably use such experiences as winter holidays on Europe s slopes as screens for future success in gathering information on dangers such as nuclear or chemical proliferation threats in the Middle East or East Asia Leave charming the local intelligentsia to diplomats Spare us laments about the decline of Ivy League credentialism in government service We have the world s broadest based system of higher education and those state college alumni work at the CIA because they are smart and well educated Young caffeine and liquor free Mormons just happen to be because of their church s missionary zeal one of this country s richest veins of talent with foreign experience and skill in languages Odd as it may sound the average Brigham Young University graduate probably knows a lot more about the world than his counterpart at Georgetown or Princeton As for the CIA s personnel problems they seem to stem more from lack of accountability than from the basic nature of the agents Kevin Michael O Reilly Party Hack Hack Attacks by Bill Barnes was uncomfortably close to the Microsoft party line I was particularly bothered by a subtle attack on Java as vs ActiveX The article says several times that the Java approach is slower It later says that Java is unsuitable for high performance video games because of Java s slowness This is deceptive Technology has been commercially demonstrated that runs Java programs at very high speed e g Asymmetrix It simply isn t linked up to Internet Explorer and Netscape Navigator Communicator yet The Java byte code verifier imposes some performance cost but there s no reason Java code cannot be byte code verified once then translated to efficient machine code and then stored on your hard drive along with all your store bought applications The security approach of Java does restrict what an unsigned applet can do and those criticisms are fair But the criticism of Java on performance grounds as if the performance problems were inherent in the security model is not fair and is not accurate And because the question of Java vs ActiveX is a very hot topic in the industry now with lots of money riding on it it s impossible not to wonder whether Microsoft s influence on Slate had something to do with this unfairness Of course I don t believe Bill Gates ordered you to slander Java But Barnes presumably hangs around with a lot more Microsoft people than JavaSoft people and is likely to absorb their point of view as I m sure I would in the same circumstances The ultimate effect is that this article treads close to the danger zone Dan Weinreb Bill Barnes replies You re right of course that I tend to understand the Microsoft view more clearly just as you obviously do the JavaSoft view As with any religious war no one is neutral except the atheists Java is a great and very useful language but all the upcoming performance improvement technologies in the world won t help the people using today s browsers as you yourself admit Therefore I stand by the caveats I described Key Points Hack Attacks by Bill Barnes was generally excellent but I have a few criticisms Secret key cryptography single key in Barnes terminology is not bad for two way interactions In fact it s routinely used for that purpose But it s difficult to get the shared secret key to the other person or people in the first place Public key key exchange gets the secret key to its destination safely avoiding the chicken and egg problem of having to share a secret key already in order to share another key secretly Afterward secret key cryptography is normally used for efficiency reasons The reduced version of a long document is known as a digest not a signature It is a widely held but mistaken belief that a digital signature is the public key decryption private key encryption of a document s digest That s how RSA the most popular signature algorithm works because it happens to be both a signature algorithm and a public key encryption algorithm Barnes also might have mentioned one solution to the problem of the corruptible system administrator secret sharing It is possible to divide up secrets such as passwords among several people such that only a subset of them of a certain size a majority for instance can recover the original That way a single corrupt authority can t hurt you The last part of the article might have underplayed the security threats to users It s true that nothing serious has really happened yet but very little of value to a hacker is in people s computers these days That may change fast if desktop banking including check writing becomes widespread for example then the incentive for hackers to use their discoveries for something other than embarrassing Microsoft or causing general mischief increases dramatically Dan Simon Bill Barnes replies Dan Simon s technical nits are well taken However while I agree that security is a serious issue I reiterate that the hysterics with which security stories are played out in the media are generally overblown Breaking the Waves I enjoyed the Committee of Correspondence discussion Cycles Waves and Endings in History and I agree with those who say that the generational conflict is driving electoral politics and policy making Someone should interpret moves like cutting welfare as yet another symptom of baby boom me firstism And while I agree with Francis Fukuyama s optimism for democracy it s important to note that anti democratic movements have gained new strength in recent years in the United States and Western Europe and in some cases have gained power through the same systems they want to destroy The future of democracy through technological change is anything but assured Postindustrial extreme right movements know where to find the Web too Mark Hunter Is That a D Cup You re Wearing or Are You Just Glad to See Me Bra Story by Anne Hollander was a great contribution to the recent surge in chronicling the history of the unleashing of the female form in the 20 th century Her appreciation of the em bra d breast manages to be both appropriate and evocative if not titillating It may be some years more before the male version of this trend plays itself out thoroughly enough to merit similar discussion Some future male Madonna appearing onstage in his bullet jock will signal the pinnacle I suppose But the past decades have already seen the liberation of the family jewels The heterosexual world has embraced gay iconic sexuality consistently at a lag of five years or so From 1950s fitness magazines to Batman s crotch bulge in the 60s the International Male catalog in the 70s GQ in the early 80s and Marky Mark in his Calvins a few years ago the penis has gone from unspeakable to unavoidable And just take a look at the current Jockey underwear packaging if you need to confirm that circumcision is still being practiced in North America The sociological implications are huge Penis envy is spreading And surely there s a link between naked men on billboards hard core porn in the home video library and anything that can be attributed to largely male decision makers from corporate mergers to the end of the Cold War Robert Rothery The Odds on God Benjamin Wittes article Cracking God s Code must have been intended for April Fool s Day Wittes apparently believes that the discovery of statistically unlikely secret codes in the Torah proves the existence of God Even if we accept the dubious premise that the existence of God can be proven scientifically it is extremely naive to say that the occurrence of an unlikely event would do the trick I don t know which is more depressing the fact that some people s faith is so weak they seek scientific approval of their beliefs or the fact that they believe a supposedly all knowing all powerful God would choose to reveal himself through some inconsequential abnormality Mike Bohan Criminal Procedures Alan Dershowitz argues in a recent book review titled Crime and Truth that powerful procedural safeguards for defendants allow some guilty people to go free but that these procedures are justified to prevent miscarriages of justice and to deter misconduct among police He misses three essential points First these rules harden public attitudes toward everyone accused of a crime Second they feed into the corrosive cynicism within the justice system Since procedural niceties seem arbitrary and irrelevant to fact finding there is little motivation to enforce the rules and people often find ways of bending rules that they regard as arbitrary and silly For example as Dershowitz himself has written judges pretend to believe police who lie about illegal searches Third the most glaring injustice these days is not the wrongful conviction of the innocent It is the remarkably cruel treatment of some people who are actually guilty When a troubled and illiterate 19 year old can receive life imprisonment for committing three muggings it seems laughably irrelevant to focus on courtroom procedures Harold Pollack Sleepers As the father of two adopted boys 12 and 11 months I enjoyed reading Robert Wright s article Go Ahead Sleep With Your Kids I urge him to get back in touch and tell us if he winds up with a 10 year old and a 7 year old in bed with him now that s what I call birth control Brian Murphy Address your e
