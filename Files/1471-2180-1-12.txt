 Background Hepadnaviruses are small enveloped hepatotropic viruses which replicate by reverse transcription of a pregenomic RNA molecule 1 for reviews see 2 3 4 The replication of hepadnaviral DNA is initiated by the interaction of the viral reverse transcriptase P with an RNA stem loop within a terminal duplication of the pregenomic RNA P binds to the 5 copy of and then begins DNA synthesis using a tyrosine residue near its own amino terminus as a primer DNA synthesis arrests after 3 4 nucleotides and then the protein linked nascent minus strand DNA is transferred to the copy of direct repeat 1 DR1 within the 3 terminal duplication This nascent DNA then acts as a primer for the synthesis of full length minus strand DNA templated by the pregenomic RNA 5 6 7 8 9 10 During synthesis of the minus strand DNA the pregenomic RNA is degraded by the ribonuclease H RNAseH activity of P However the RNAseH activity does not digest the extreme 5 end of the template RNA and this 18 nucleotide capped RNA fragment is then transferred to direct repeat 2 DR2 where it acts as a primer for synthesis of plus strand DNA 11 12 The hepadnaviral P protein possesses many unique features relative to the better studied reverse transcriptases of the retroviruses i it uses its own amino terminal domain as a protein primer for initiation of DNA synthesis 7 9 10 ii it cannot be isolated in an active form from virions without partial proteolysis or denaturation 13 14 15 and iii under normal circumstances it is active only on the endogenous pregenomic RNA that is encapsidated with it in the viral cores 16 The mechanism of this template commitment is unknown although the covalent linkage between P and the viral DNA is likely to contribute to it RNAseH cleaves the RNA strand in a RNA DNA heteroduplex but it does not cleave DNA or RNA that is not hybridized to DNA The RNAseH activity of P is required to remove the RNA pregenome after it has been copied into DNA during reverse transcription If there is no RNAseH activity positive polarity DNA cannot be synthesized and no infectious virions are produced The hepadnaviral RNAseH activity has not yet been directly measured in viral core particles however its existence is inferred from four observations i Sequence alignment of P with known RNAseH enzymes reveals conserved motifs in P 17 18 19 20 ii Mutation of the putative RNAseH active site residues in both Hepatitis B Virus HBV and duck hepatitis B virus DHBV P blocks synthesis of mature hepadnaviral DNA and results in the expected RNA DNA heteroduplex 19 21 22 23 iii RNAseH activity has been detected for the human hepatitis B virus when the RNAseH domain was expressed as a fusion with the maltose binding protein 24 iv RNAseH activity has been detected in activity gels employing purified DHBV cores but the apparent molecular weight of the RNAseH was less than that of the native DHBV P indicating that P was either cleaved prior to the assay or that the signal came from a cellular RNAseH 25 In this study we attempted to directly detect the RNAseH activity of DHBV P within viral cores employing exogenous substrates Extensive efforts employing a wide range of conditions and substrates yielded no DHBV RNAseH activity Because genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that P possesses an intrinsic RNAseH activity we conclude that the hepadnaviral RNAseH activity is likely to be substrate committed in a manner similar to the template commitment observed for its DNA polymerase activity Results RNAseH activity on endogenous nucleic acids To demonstrate that the DHBV P protein possesses an RNAseH activity that is active on RNA DNA heteroduplexes generated during reverse transcription we altered P amino acid 715 from aspartic acid to valine D715V within the RNAseH domain of P and examined the effect of this mutation on reverse transcription in viral core particles Because no cell line exists that can be infected with DHBV viral core particles were produced by transfection of DHBV DNAs into LMH cells a chicken hepatoma cell line LMH cells transfected with the appropriate expression vectors e g D1 5G and its derivatives produce core particles competent for reverse transcription and also secrete infectious virions 26 Viral DNA was purified from intracellular core particles by proteinase K digestion phenol and chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation The DNAs were then examined by Southern analysis using strand specific RNAs as probes Figure 1shows the expected distribution of forms from cells transfected with wild type DHBV DNA lanes 2 and 6 As expected transfection of cells with DHBV DNA carrying the YMHA polymerase active site mutant ablated all DNA synthesis lanes 4 and 8 Transfection of cells with DNA carrying the D715V mutation inhibited DNA synthesis during minus strand DNA synthesis yielding immature minus polarity DNAs lane 3 and it also ablated positive polarity DNA synthesis lane 7 Analysis of the DNAs on denaturing gels revealed that the negative polarity DNA synthesized by the D715V mutant was annealed to a complementary strand 23 indicating that it was in an RNA DNA heteroduplex This is the predicted phenotype for an RNAseH deficient hepadnaviral P protein and it indicates that the P protein has an RNAseH activity that acts on endogenously synthesized RNA DNA heteroduplexes Oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assays To examine DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous substrates internally 32P labeled RNAs were synthesized in vitro and annealed to complementary DNA oligonucleotides RNAseH activity was detected as cleavage of the RNA at the position of the hybridized oligonucleotide The first region selected for this oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assay was positive sense RNA derived from DHBV nt 2401 to 2605 DRF which contains DR2 DR1 and the 5 half of This RNA was chosen as it contains the region where the DHBV RNAseH activity likely initiates during reverse transcription Oligonucleotide D2507 was annealed to DRF RNA and cleavage of this substrate by E coli RNAseH yielded products of 152 nt and 93 nt Fig 2lane 1 An overlapping oligonucleotide of positive polarity that cannot anneal to the DRF RNA D2526 was used as a negative control and no cleavage of the RNA was detected under these conditions lane 2 The detection limit of this assay was less than 0 00001 U E coli RNAseH data not shown Viral cores prepared from LMH cells transfected with DHBV DHBV D715V and DHBV YMHA were employed with DRF RNA in the oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assay in the first attempt to detect DHBV RNAseH activity on exogenous substrates The DHBV sample contained 8 10 9genome equivalents as determined by slot blot hybridization of core derived nucleic acids Because hepadnaviral core particles are impermeable to large molecules they were treated with low pH prior to the RNAseH assays to allow the substrate access to P within the cores 16 No RNAseH activity was detected with the viral cores in reactions containing the complementary negative polarity oligonucleotide Fig 2 lanes 3 5 7 As expected there was no cleavage in the negative control reactions employing the noncomplementary positive polarity oligonucleotide lanes 4 6 8 Five controls were performed to ensure that these negative results were not artifacts First to ensure the presence of enzymatically active DHBV P viral core particles were monitored for DNA polymerase activity on the endogenous nucleic acids within the core particles the endogenous polymerase assay Fig 3A Second to limit the possibility that the failure to detect RNAseH activity was due to insufficient number of viral core particles an RNAseH assay was performed with a 10 fold increase in cores Again no DHBV RNAseH activity was detected data not shown Third permeabilization of the cores was monitored by treating an aliquot of the permeabilized cores with micrococcal nuclease and then measuring DNA synthesis by the endogenous polymerase assay Micrococcal nuclease cannot gain access to the nucleic acids within unpermeabilized cores and hence DNA synthesis would be unaffected if the permeabilization failed However DNA synthesis was ablated by micrococcal nuclease treatment of permeabilized cores indicating that permeabilization was successful data not shown Fourth to control for possible inactivation of the RNAseH active site by low pH treatment cores were permeabilized by treatment with 1 M NaCl or 0 3 SDS 1 NP 40 16 again without yielding detectable RNAseH activity data not shown Finally the ability of the RNAseH substrate to access P within the viral cores was verified using the recently reported ability of DHBV P to synthesize limited amounts of DNA from an exogenous RNA following removal of the endogenous nucleic acids the trans reaction 27 The trans reaction is template dependent reverse transcription of the exogenous RNA that does not depend on the protein primed initiation mechanism of the hepadnaviruses 28 In the trans reaction the nucleic acids within permeabilized DHBV cores were degraded by micrococcal nuclease and then the nuclease was inactivated by addition of EGTA DRF RNA and radioactive dNTPs were added the mixture was incubated at 37 C to allow DNA synthesis and the products were purified and resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis The results Fig 3Blane 2 showed that DNA was synthesized by core particles employing DRF as a template indicating that the RNA had access to P within the particles The complementary oligonucleotide D2507 did not support DNA synthesis lane 3 The RNAseH substrate itself DRF RNA annealed to D2507 also supported DNA synthesis in the trans assay lane 4 as did the combination of DRF RNA and the non complementary oligonucleotide D2526 lane 5 The identity of the additional band at the bottom of Lane 4 that is absent from similar reactions lacking the complementary oligonucleotide Lanes 2 and 5 is unknown It is likely the result of an additional stop site for reverse transcription that is present when the oligonucleotide is bound to the RNA rather than extension from the oligonucleotide because we have never detected oligonucleotide dependent priming with the DHBV polymerase under any conditions The key feature of this important control is the detection of DNA synthesis using the RNAseH template as a substrate because it directly demonstrates that the substrate employed in these experiments could access the polymerase within the permeabilized viral core particles Survey of reaction conditions The initial RNAseH assays were performed under conditions optimized for the reverse transcriptase activity of recombinant DHBV P 29 These conditions were chosen because the RNAseH and polymerase activities function coordinately during reverse transcription and hence it is reasonable to assume they operate under similar conditions However because the initial assays failed to detect DHBV RNAseH activity the oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assay was performed with DHBV cores under a wide variety of conditions We first employed conditions optimized for human immunodeficiency virus RNAseH 30 RNAseH activity was detected using E coli RNAseH and AMV reverse transcriptase but it was not detected with the DHBV cores data not shown We then varied the pH from 7 0 to 8 5 E coli RNAseH was active at all pHs but no cleavage was found in reactions containing the permeabilized cores data not shown Negative results for DHBV RNAseH activity were also obtained when the RNAseH assay was performed at NaCl concentrations ranging from 50 150 mM although the E coli RNAseH was active in all these conditions data not shown To examine the effect of divalent cation composition 8 mM MnCl 2 was used instead of 10 mM MgCl 2 and again no RNAseH activity was detected data not shown We next examined cleavage with substrate amounts ranging from 50 ng to 5000 ng per reaction and with incubation times ranging from 1 h to 4 h DHBV RNAseH cleavage was not detected under any of these conditions although the E coli RNAseH activity was detected in all of them data not shown Since the body temperature of Pekin ducks is about 42 C an RNAseH assay was performed with DHBV cores at 42 C Again no RNAseH activity was observed data not shown ATP has been reported to increase the cleavage efficiency of RNAseH 31 Therefore 1 5 mM ATP was included in an RNAseH assay DHBV RNAseH cleavage was not detected within the cores under these conditions data not shown Similarly inclusion of 40 M each of the four dNTPs did not stimulate the RNAseH activity data not shown This suggests that i there is no obvious nucleotide requirement to activate the RNAseH activity and ii any DNA synthesis that may have occurred on the substrates during the reaction either primed by the oligonucleotide or produced by the trans reaction was insufficient to induce detectable RNAseH activity To detect DNA polymerization on exogenous RNA templates the trans reaction the endogenous nucleic acids are first removed with micrococcal nuclease To determine if a similar effect would be observed with the RNAseH activity an RNAseH assay was performed in permeabilized cores in which the nucleic acids had been removed with micrococcal nuclease The results Fig 4 showed that RNAseH activity was not detected in micrococcal nuclease treated cores lanes 3 to 6 Because the RNA stem loop induces a structural change in P that is required for DHBV DNA polymerase activity 27 28 we examined the possibility that may activate the RNAseH activity in micrococcal nuclease treated cores RNA was added in trans to micrococcal nuclease treated cores in the RNAseH assay and again DHBV RNAseH activity was not observed data not shown Oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assays with alternate substrates The above experiments suggest that the DHBV RNAseH may not be able to act on exogenous substrates To exclude the possibility that the DHBV RNAseH simply could not recognize the specific heteroduplex formed by DRF RNA and oligonucleotide D2507 a second pair oligonucleotides D2453 and D2543M Sal were employed with DRF RNA in oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assays employing permeabilized DHBV core particles Again no DHBV RNAseH activity was observed with the viral cores under any condition employed although E coli RNAseH recognized the substrate under all conditions employed data not shown To determine if the lack of success was specific to the DRF RNA a second RNA DXB DHBV nt 1358 1504 positive polarity annealed to the complementary oligonucleotide D1452 was employed in RNAseH assays Again no specific DHBV RNAseH cleavage was observed data not shown indicating that using different region of RNA from the DHBV genome did not affect the observation that the DHBV RNAseH could not engage an exogenous substrate Because the micrococcal nuclease treated cores may represent the best likelihood of observing RNAseH activity a titration of the substrate was performed employing 50 to 500 ng DXB RNA annealed to D1452 and nuclease treated DHBV core particles Again no DHBV specific cleavages were observed data not shown Alternate RNAseH assays Other assays to detect DHBV RNAseH activity were also employed Randomly initiated RNA synthesis by E coli RNA polymerase was used to make 32P RNA DNA substrates using synthetic homopolymers or DRF DNA 30 In these assays RNAseH activity is measured as a reduction in TCA precipitable radioactivity No viral RNAseH activity was detected in experiments with DHBV cores supporting the observation obtained with the oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assay data not shown Two different sources of recombinant enzymatically active DHBV P were also employed in the RNAseH assays without success DHBV P with reverse transcriptase activity can be produced in yeast within recombinant TY retrotransposnon particles as a fusion with yeast retrotransposon TY A protein 29 DHBV RNAseH activity could not be detected using yeast derived recombinant P in either the oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assay or the synthetic homopolymer assay although RNAseH activity of the wild type TY retrotransposon particles could be detected data not shown DHBV RNAseH activity also could not be detected with P translated in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysates although P expressed in this system possesses reverse transcriptase activity 7 Discussion The hepadnaviral DNA polymerase activity is strongly associated with the viral core structure and is normally unable to synthesize DNA from an exogenous template 16 The aim of this study was to determine if the DHBV RNAseH activity was similarly restricted to the endogenous heteroduplex substrate generated during reverse transcription Oligonucleotide directed RNAseH assays were performed with permeabilized viral cores under a wide variety of conditions Temperature pH cation composition salt concentration substrate concentration and inclusion of ATP and dNTPs were examined RNAseH assays were also carried out after removal of the endogenous nucleic acid and multiple RNA sequences and DNA oligonucleotide combinations were employed DHBV RNAseH activity was not detected under any of these conditions although E coli or AMV RNAseH activity could easily be detected under all of them Control experiments demonstrated that i the cores were permeabilized because the viral nucleic acids were sensitive to micrococcal nuclease following low pH treatment ii the RNAseH substrate could access the polymerase within the viral cores as determined by the trans reaction Fig 3B iii the DNA polymerase activity of the P survived the low pH treatment as measured by synthesis of viral DNA and iv the RNAseH substrates were suitable because they were degraded by E coli RNAseH and AMV reverse transcriptase and because the DHBV RNAseH activity can degrade these RNA sequences during reverse transcription the target RNAs were derived from the DHBV genome However the DHBV RNAseH activity could not degrade the same sequences when they were presented as exogenous heteroduplexes Therefore we feel the RNAseH activity is likely to be substrate committed in a manner analogous to the template commitment of the DNA polymerase activity This conclusion is subject to a number of caveats because it rests on negative data i e the failure to detect RNAseH activity There are at least three other potential causes for the failure to detect RNAseH activity that we cannot formally exclude The first possible cause is that the RNAseH activity in our core preparations may be too low to detect To evaluate this possibility it is useful to compare the enzymatic turnover number for the polymerase activity in the trans reaction with the turnover number for the RNAseH activity that would be needed to reach the detection limit in our assays Phosphorimage analysis of the radioactivity incorporated in a trans reaction employing 1 2 10 9core particles quantitated as genome equivalents of viral DNA by slot blot hybridization indicated that about 4 8 10 10nucleotides were incorporated into DNA in the reaction Assuming one polymerase molecule per core particle this gives a turnover rate of about 40 nucleotides per polymerase molecule in the trans reaction To maximize the possibility of detecting RNAseH cleavage products each RNAseH assay was exposed to film for up to a week to burn out the signal from the cleavage products that migrate below the input RNA on the gels Under these conditions our detection limit for the RNAseH assay was measured at 0 625 pg of internally 32P labeled RNA or about 7 5 10 6molecules of the 152 nt cleavage product To reach this detection limit with the 8 10 9polymerase molecules used in a typical RNAseH assay would require just a single catalytic cycle from 0 094 of the polymerase molecules in the reaction Therefore the turnover number for the RNAseH activity needed to reach the detection limit in our assays is about 43 000 fold less than the 40 cycles observed for the polymerase activity under very similar conditions This huge difference gives us confidence that our assays were sensitive enough to detect RNAseH activity if it were present The second alternative cause for our failure to detect RNAseH activity is that the RNAseH active site may be sterically blocked in core particles However recombinant P translated in vitro has reverse transcriptase activity outside core particles yet P expressed in this manner was still unable to degrade the exogenous RNAseH substrates Furthermore the DNA polymerase active site in permeabilized core particles is accessible to the exogenous RNAseH substrates Fig 3B The RNAseH active site must be in very close proximity to the polymerase site and be oriented in such a manner that it can access heteroduplexes within 18 base pairs of the 3 end of the growing DNA chain and hence steric occlusion seems to be unlikely The third alternative explanation for our negative data is that the DHBV RNAseH activity may have been inactivated by the low pH pulse used to permeabilize the cores To control for this possibility we employed three different permeabilization methods low pH high salt and detergent None of these conditions inactivated the DNA polymerase activity yet we were unable to detect RNAseH activity in cores permeabilized by any of these methods Furthermore DHBV RNAseH activity could not be detected with recombinant P TY particles purified from yeast although TY RNAseH activity could be detected from non recombinant TY particles TY particles are naturally porous and do not require permeabilization for access of substrate This allowed us to assay enzymatically active recombinant DHBV polymerase for RNAseH activity on exogenous substrates without permeabilization Together these extensive controls lead us to believe that the simplest explanation of our data e g that the RNAseH activity is substrate committed is most probably correct The two enzymatic active sites of DHBV P are likely to interact with the viral nucleic acids through a single binding interaction because they are very close to each other and because other reverse transcriptases such as that of HIV bind to the RNA DNA heteroduplex as a single protein entity 32 Therefore our data imply that the template substrate commitment of the DHBV reverse transcriptase may be a feature of that common interaction rather than a feature of the polymerase active site alone This hypothesis is consistent with the recent production of enzymatically active HBV RNAseH as a fusion protein in E coli 24 because the fusion protein did not contain the polymerase domain and it was not substrate committed Because one biochemical feature e g substrate commitment of this recombinant HBV RNAseH enzyme may be altered relative to the properties of the native enzyme the possibility that other biochemical parameters of the recombinant enzyme may differ from those of the native enzyme should be considered The molecular mechanism of this probable template substrate commitment is unclear We speculate that the covalent linkage of the viral DNA to P or an unusually tight association between P and the viral nucleic acids may contribute to the commitment However this cannot entirely account for the substrate commitment because removal of endogenous nucleic acid with micrococcal nuclease only partially relieves the template commitment of the DNA polymerase activity and it did not relieve the apparent restriction on the RNAseH activity Understanding the mechanism of the template substrate commitment of the hepadnaviral reverse transcriptase may need to wait until a three dimensional structure of the polymerase bound to a nucleic acid primer template is obtained Conclusions DHBV RNAseH activity could be detected on RNA DNA heteroduplexes synthesized within DHBV core particles in the process of viral reverse transcription but no RNAseH activity could be detected exogenously provided RNA DNA heteroduplexes Extensive controls lead us to believe that the RNAseH active site is most probably substrate committed in a manner similar to the template commitment of the reverse transcriptase activity We acknowledge that we have not formally proven this conclusion but at a minimum we have demonstrated that the DHBV RNAseH activity cannot degrade exogenous substrates under a very wide variety of conditions that support vigorous activity by the associated DNA
