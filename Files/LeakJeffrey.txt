 Resident with me and the most from my childhood was ah the story about my grandmother My mother I m I m from Charlotte and my mother was from here as well she died in 1992 yeah December 1992 and she the only girl of 10 kids She had nine brothers I had nine uncles Three of them are still living Uh but one of the stories uh my grandmother was born in 1898 yeah 1898 and she lived to be ah 102 So she had 10 kids and of course her parents had been slaves Uh huh So um my mother grew up out near the airport near in the Steele Creek community and um my grandmother for all those years all the 20th century basically lived out in the country until the last three years of her life She came and lived with us But she had her leg amputated so she moved in with us and we took care of her Uh but before that she was in the country and so my mom use to talk about how as the only girl she would have to wash dishes and do the domestic things so even at dinner Sunday dinner if their were a chicken if they had fried chicken my mother had to wait for her brothers to eat the choice pieces of chicken and then she could eat a wing or a back or a neck and to the day she died that s how she was If she fried some chicken for us she d always eat the smallest pieces The meager looking pieces So my mother use to sit back in her chair in the den and talk about how one Saturday Granny uh had decided she was going to go to town and you know back then you re talking oh probably 1930s early 1930s uh my mother would ve been 10 or 12 somewhere around there and Granny uh went to the train track to get on the little trolley train whatever they had at that time to come downtown Uh huh Well during her absence my mom was suppose to clean the house and probably prepared dinner and stuff like that This was a Saturday Well my mom thinking Oh Mom s gone all day She s gone hang out a little bit Well after about I don t know about two hours two and a half hours I think my mom said Granny came back and she was quite upset One Mama hadn t done any work she was suppose to do and she got a beat down all right and two Granny had sat about two hours at the um train stop and she hadn t noticed the tracks had been moved Uh huh So there was no longer a train that ran there and so I don t know what the um I don t know what the rationale was for all of that I guess they just changed the route and what not but uh she laughed about that all the time my mom did she didn t laugh at the time she was getting beat ah but she use to always tell us that was really the only time that she got beat Uh huh by Granny and and she never beat her boys because her boys could did no wrong in her mind So that s probably my favorite story about uh or from my mom that I recall I believe yeah And then hum there s another story well this is a this is not a this is not a story she passed down this is a story of mine I guess Uh huh That happened with Mama and Granny and my sister Reda OK Now bear in mind that I told you Granny moved in with us um towards the later years of her life and when she moved in with us I was in the 10th grade so I was just starting high school Um you know going through puberty and dating and playing basketball and stuff like that That that was my favorite sport So my senior year I went to the health department to get a physical That s required for those who are playing sports Yeah You got to have a physical No problem I was up on Beatties Ford Road Everybody knows where the health department is there Well standard procedure back then I don t know what it is now is that you come in someone comes in and they give you now I don t if it s like this now but back then they would give you a bag of prophylactics condoms all right So they gave me a bag and I didn t really you know pay any attention to it So I said OK fine and I actually put them in my trunk trunk of my car Uh huh This was like a Monday or a Tuesday Now my mother never drove her entire life she never drove so I took her wherever she went Uh huh Took her to the grocery store took her to church stuff like that My grandmother never drove either even before she had her leg amputated So Sunday comes around and this particular Sunday we re taking Granny to her home church Uh huh Out in the Steele Creek area out past the airport And that s fine you know I m driving I got ah at that point I was driving an Oldsmobile Delta 88 It was a diesel And so this Sunday morning we had eaten breakfast and we re getting Granny situated in her wheelchair and everything and that was pretty much my job and I told my mom and my sister to go out to the car and open the trunk And my sister Rita did that All of a sudden we hear these yells Uh huh Oh my goodness something s happened Mama Come back here I m thinking they found a dead dog or you know something in the driveway backyard Then Mama goes uh Oh Lord help me I say What is the problem And so Jeff Jeff get out here right now I mean everybody in the neighborhood I mean it s Sunday morning and this is an old black neighborhood everybody knows everybody And so I take Granny out wheel her out through the front door I said Well I say Granny Mama s calling me Something s wrong but let s go on out and I ll get you situated in the car And um get her in there and around to the back Explain this and I said Explain what I just told you to open the trunk Well low and behold the condoms which are multi colored had fallen out the bag So they spread out all over the trunk red green blue whatever And it s Sunday morning we re on our way to church I m like Well I m speechless what am I going to say they already convicted me now my mother and my sister So needless to say that that ride to church was very quiet and they said Excuse me this afternoon you and your nephews my sister s kids who are my age uh we re going to have a talk after dinner And so we had the birds and the bees talk after dinner Uh huh Now remember my mother was at that point at that point she was probably she had me when she was 46 so she was close to 60 yeah she was close to 60 at that point And it s hard enough talking to your parents about sex if they re fairly young It s definitely hard getting it from a 60 year old Uh huh Now of course my dad never talked to me about any of that stuff but that s another story So we had Sunday dinner and we went through the do s and don ts of sexuality Needless to say my nephews and I were quite embarrassed and didn t want to be there But they were just convinced that they were getting ready to just ruin our lives but some women were going get us to do some stuff they didn t need to do and we were going be some baby s daddy and Lord and that s my story in terms of um um something we still laugh about my sister and I yeah Thank you That will work
