 The Great Panda Debate Subject Plotz the Panda Poacher From THesse Re Date Wed Dec 1 You are a poor excuse for a human being While I understand and respect the meaning of the 1 st Amendment I think you take it to an unacceptable level You see my 9 year old daughter read your article and could not fathom how or why a supposed intelligent adult could possibly say those things It upset her greatly She has never seen a panda in person and while they are not the liveliest animals I know her eyes would light up and her smile would be from ear to ear at being able to view one for herself I believe you need to grow up and start looking at the positive things in the world You have got to be the saddest thing I have ever encountered To reply click here Subject Fluffiness Is Fur Deep From Jerry

the developing countries who tolerate less than ideal environmental standards and child forced sweatshop labor the multinational companies that take advantage of those conditions or the consumers who happily buy the merchandise despite its questionable origin My college son developed a problem for an ethics class that revolved around a wrenchingly poor fictional country that proposed to enable slavery in return for economic development The country would allow corporations to buy citizens for labor as long as they provided decent housing food and medical treatment In return the country would enforce the property rights with the nation s police power Since famine was endemic in this country it is probable that the slaves would have a higher standard of living than would be available to them in the free sector The corporation would have the advantage of a stable workforce that could be trained and experienced with no threat of the employee jumping to the competitor Would your company take such a deal Would you buy products produced under such a system To reply click here Subject AmeriCorps Let Charities Call the Shots From Leslie Lenkowsky Re Date Mon Dec 6 Both Doug Bandow and Harris Wofford are friends And I both serve on the Board of the Corporation on National Service and have been a critic of government involvement with non profits for longer than I care to remember So what side should I take in this interesting dialogue To Doug I d say that most of the largest non profits have long since signed on to the Federal gravy train About a third of their revenues on average now come from the US Treasury or its state equivalents along with lots of strings that significantly compromise their independence And I have not run across any of them that would prefer an end to these arrangements One now even finds conservatives and libertarians proposing to expand them under the headings of charitable choice and school vouchers So the real issue is not whether AmeriCorps somehow violates the integrity of the nation s voluntary associations but whether it offers any advantages over our current ways of doing so I think it does On balance I d rather offer to the nation s charities people to do their bidding than grants to do government s bidding That s probably cheaper too To Harris I would say that large numbers of AmeriCorps participants do not a successful program make Nor do the records of their accomplishments which the Corporation scrupulously collects since such studies do not usually reveal if these results might have occurred anyway i e through other sources of volunteers or how valuable or long lasting they are And while Harris is undoubtedly sincere in saying the Corporation tries to be the junior partner in its relationship with its grantees long experience watching non profits pursue government support makes me more than a little skeptical I think AmeriCorps is valuable because it offers people especially our nation s young people an opportunity to devote an intensive period of their lives to giving something back to their society and learning the civic skills upon which our voluntary tradition relies Even with volunteering at record levels 56 percent of Americans say they are so engaged according to the latest Gallup survey I think we have to take steps to ensure that the spirit upon which it and much else that s worthwhile depends is transmitted from generation to generation AmeriCorps is one way of doing this and by no means the only one and can be redesigned so that both Doug and Harris would feel more comfortable that charities not government are really calling the shots To reply click here Subject Aussies Ain t Gents From Robert Thomson Re Date Mon Dec 6 As the Robert Thomson mentioned in
