 Citizen or Consumer Dear Peggy You of course get right to the heart of the matter A good teacher never follows a method to the letter And if you re the parent of a child who s lucky enough to have a good teacher you rarely find yourself worrying about whether the method being employed is traditional or progressive whether there s enough breadth or enough depth What s more neither do your fellow parents even if their kids are not at all the kinds of students yours are Good teachers seem to manage to find ways to fit the needs of many different sorts of students in the same class It s during the lousy years with weak teachers that we parents suddenly find ourselves being led from our particular complaints to ask bigger questions about the whole approach of a school and being tempted to think in unduly polarized terms as if there was some clear cut choice between constructivist and more teacher directed learning I suppose an important question to ask which is not at all the focus of Bennett s book but should presumably be part of the debate about curricular reform is what sort of guidance proves most helpful to teachers and most conducive to attracting good ones to the profession Do you for example think the Core lesson plans could be useful background material for a teacher who felt free to take half a year or more to do her own version of what Hirsch allotted say 13 days to cover I couldn t tell from my quick peek what the quality of the bibliographies was We all hear constantly that strong principals play a large part in creating strong schools but I was struck that Bennett had very little to say about them and their role except as the last resort for disgruntled parents What do the best of them do to help set a school s academic direction This book has notably little to say about what sort of changes could help most to raise the quality of teachers and principals which they evidently consider to be pretty low But if anything is to be accomplished it s clear they think school choice is the way Bennett et al are in favor of a voucher plan that would allow parents to choose among not just public schools but private and parochial and charter schools as well In fact the program of constant oversight and pressure this book advocates almost doesn t make sense or is merely a recipe for frustration if there isn t school choice Start hunting for a different school they urge parents whose complaints haven t born fruit But what do you do if you can t afford or get your kid into a private school and don t want him to attend parochial school If you don t have at least some public school alternatives to consider you stew It does seem somewhat surprising though to hear these authors defend their voucher plan on the grounds that it fosters pluralism in schooling after pushing a shared curriculum as hard as they do I haven t thought as much as I should have about school choice but the parents I know who have been able to pick from a variety of public schools have been glad of it and have stuck with the public school system when they otherwise would have left As a spur to improvements in the system given the slow pace of top down efforts at reform it seems worth trying out in different ways but it shouldn t be considered a cure all especially for the worst off schools Nor as James Traub pointed out in the New York Times Magazine last weekend are schools themselves a cure all for poverty But if the result of school choice is to isolate failing schools even further than they already are from pressures that might lead to improving them it would be a failure for reform This book has the unintended effect of exposing the unappealing side of the school choice crusade The ideal parent of these pages does not remind me much of an upstanding civic minded citizen the kind of patriot Bennett presumably admires Instead the micromanaging mother and father conjured up here resemble demanding consumers obsessed with promoting their child s future and convinced that school and teacher should revolve around their needs and demands What kind of respect for our common culture is that For old fashioned honor thy father and teacher and country types the authors convey a surprisingly ruthless 90s get ahead attitude Do you agree The message to parents makes me more tired than I already am of marketplace values Along with that moral compass Bennett has urged it seems we better whip out our Palm Pilots and fast You must be the chief coach trainer coordinator and role model This has been fun and you ve made me think that what I d really like to have on my shelf and read is the teacher s guide for parents Ann
