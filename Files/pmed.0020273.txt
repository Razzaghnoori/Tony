                            Inflammatory bowel disease IBD is the term that encompasses chronic relapsing diseases        characterized by inflammation of the bowel specifically ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn        disease CD They are common disorders in the UK for example together they affect about        one person in every  amounting to a total of  cases of UC and  of CD with         new cases of UC and  new cases of CD every year Current estimates total at more        than  million cases in the US and Europe The symptoms for both these conditionswhich        suggest an abnormal immune response at the intestinal mucosainclude abdominal pain        diarrhea fever severe fatigue and weight loss Current understanding of disease        pathogenesis suggests a complex action of multiple environmental factors that trigger        disease in individuals with a susceptible genetic background        Today finding genes that have a role in diseases has been made easier by the sequencing        of the human genome and creation of an expressed sequence tag clone database Previous        positional cloning studies have revealed three genes associated with IBD that carry        variants with a causative role Another of the tools for analyzing genes is microarray        technology in which the expression of transcripts of thousands of genes can be        investigated simultaneously This approach offers an insight into disease        pathophysiology        In a research article published in         PLoS Medicine  Christine Costello and colleagues have gone further with        cDNA microarrays to attempt to decipher gene regulatory events and identify genes that        might be involved in the pathophysiology of these IBD They found  genes that were        differentially regulated between normal control individuals and the individuals with one of        the two IBD subtypes In fact  and  differentially regulated transcripts were        identified between control individuals and patients with CD and UC respectively There was        an imbalance between over and underexpressed genes in the IBD subtypes In CD        approximately  of differentially expressed genes were found to be downregulated        compared with  of genes in UC However the authors caution that this finding was highly        influenced by the types and numbers of genes present on any microarray system in addition        none of the  differentially expressed genes in CD and UC was overexpressed in one        disease and underexpressed in the other These observations support the notion of a shared        general inflammatory profile underlying each form of IBD with more specific events in the        pathophysiological cascade being diseasespecific        In a second part of the study the team tried to interpret the functional consequences        of changes in gene expression observed in the microarray analysis They used an        annotationbased pathway database which classified differentially expressed genes into        three major groups immune and inflammatory response oncogenesis cell proliferation and        growth or structure and permeability For immune and inflammatory response the team        identified many genes associated with aberrant immune response it is not surprising        perhaps to find a general upregulation of immune response and antigen presentation in        IBD Several genes associated with cell growth and proliferation were upregulated in UCa        finding similar to previous microarray studies that had reported involvement of        cancerrelated genes in IBD although the altered genes were different There was also an        enrichment of genes associated with structure and permeability in this class several genes        were ubiquitously altered in both IBD and nonIBD samples reflecting dysregulation of        genes for paracellular permeability degradation of extracellular matrix and barrier        protection against bacterial invasion of the epithelial surface        Ultimately this study highlights the complex pathogenesis of UC and CD and indicates        some possible future avenues for research of mucosal diseases in general It demonstrates        that genomic technologies are suitable to directly dissect human pathophysiology
