                            I am a clone That is I am a colony of cells that developed from a single fertilized        egg cell Most animals are clones like me It is a slight oversimplification to say that        all of an animals cells are genetically identical to each other Some cells have        mutations In mammals some cells red blood cells lack a nuclear genome entirely Some        cells have virusesand when its in a cell a virus is basically a genethat other cells        lack But a typical animal is a clone in the sense that all its cells arise from that        single fertilized egg cell        Not all animals however are clones Sometimes two tiny embryos developing inside their        mother will fuse together into a single embryo and continue developing The resulting        animal is not a clone but a chimera a conglomeration of two different cell lineages into        a single organism Some species of monkeys marmosets typically have chimeric blood from        having shared a blood supply with a twin in utero Haig  and rare cases of accidental        chimerism are known from many animal species Tremblay and Caltagirone  van Dijk et        al  In marine invertebrates chimeric individuals often arise from the fusion of        individuals later in development Buss  Here I want to draw attention to a remarkable        form of chimerism found in armored scale insects These insects Figure  always develop        not from a single fertilized egg but from two genetically different cells One of these        cells develops into a special organ the bacteriome which houses symbiotic bacteria that        has a nuclear genome different from that found in the rest of the body        Obligate chimerismthe presence of two genetically distinct cell lineages in every        individual at each life stageis found in a few families of scale insects but nowhere else        in nature The avid naturalist wants to understand this sort of deep oddity for its own        sake but such understanding might have broader implications as well For instance        although humans are not usually chimeras we do have a quasichimeric phase in our life        cycle pregnancy Some diseases of pregnancy are apparently due to conflicts between the        genetically nonidentical tissues of mother and fetus Haig  And the main things that        humans eat are also quasichimeras the seeds of flowering plants In a grain of wheat for        instance the germ the endosperm and the bran have three different nuclear genomes and        the conflicts between them may be similar in some ways to the conflicts seen in human        pregnancy Alleman and Doctor  Santiago and Goodrich  Ultimately we might learn        something about the general principles of conflict and cooperation between maternal and        embryonic tissues that govern these cases if we can understand the uniquely stable and        intimate chimerism of armored scale insects                    Two Different Cell Lineages        In all sexual animals and plants production of an egg cell involves meiosis the        complex cellular process involving DNA replication recombination and two nuclear        divisions whereby one diploid nucleus with two copies of each chromosome becomes four        genetically different haploid nuclei each with one copy of each chromosome Only one of        these four haploid nuclei becomes the egg cell oocyte In ordinary animals the other        three nuclei the polar bodies degeneratethey never divide again and are lost or        destroyedand the oocyte is the single maternal cell that after fusion with a single        paternal cell the spermatocyte develops into the embryo But in armored scales the polar        bodies fuse together into a triploid cell with three copies of each chromosome and this        triploid cell also winds up in the embryo Figure  The triploid cell derived from the        polar bodies fuses with one cell from the embryo to become a pentaploid cell with five        copies of each chromosome This pentaploid cell then proliferates to form the bacteriome        of the embryo Brown  Each cell in the bacteriome thus contains two copies of the        mothers complete genome in addition to the same haploid paternal genome as the rest of        the embryo In contrast the rest of the embryo contains just one copy of half of the        mothers genome The apparent function of the bacteriome is to house intracellular        bacteria During embryonic development bacteria move from the mothers bacteriome into the        cells of the embryos bacteriome The precise role of the bacteria is not known but it is        thought that they synthesize essential nutrients Tremblay  as they do in scale        insects close relatives the aphids Shigenobu et al         Now the story gets even stranger If the individual is a male then the genetic        difference between his bacteriome and the rest of his tissues becomes even greater as he        develops This is because most armored scale insects have an unusual genetic system called        embryonic paternal genome elimination Herrick and Seger  In males the paternal        genome is completely eliminated from most tissues very early in developmentbut it is never        eliminated from the bacteriome As a result most of a male armored scale insects tissues        including his sperm have one copy of half of the mothers genome the same genome as the        oocyte from which he developed but his bacteriome has two complete copies of the mothers        genome and also has a paternal genome Thus  three of five of the gene copies in the        males bacteriome are absent from the rest of the male Figure                     Chimerism and Sibling Rivalry        What could possibly be going on here Why should scale insects of all creatures have        obligate chimerism involving activated polar bodies Essentially we have no idea largely        because no one has even ventured a serious guess When the phenomena were discovered early        in the th century the theoretical tools for making sense of them were unavailable One        such tool is W D Hamiltons a theory of inclusive fitness which holds that the        degree of cooperation between two organisms or tissues must depend upon their degree of        genetic relatedness But the rise of Hamiltonian thinking coincided with the eclipse of        classical cytogenetics in favor of the molecular biology of model organisms and these        remarkable little chimeras have languished in undeserved obscurity Perhaps merely by        looking at them with a modern eye we can turn up some plausible hypotheses        Consider the special theoretical difficulty posed by chimerism between tissues derived        from the oocyte and those derived from the polar bodies ejected by it during meiosis Two        siblings will typically exhibit some degree of sibling rivalrytheir interests are not        identical If an individual were a chimera comprising fullsibling tissues identical        across approximately half of their genomes there might be conflict between the two        nonidentical cell lineages as there is between the tissues of a mother mammal and her        fetus also identical across half of their genomes during pregnancy Haig  This may        explain why obligate sibling chimerism never evolves except perhaps in the very limited        case of blood cells between sibling marmosets But the problem of cooperation between        tissues that derive from the oocyte and those that derive from the polar bodies is if        anything even greater The oocyte and the polar bodies are         less closely related than two siblings would be because the polar bodies        are enriched for chromosome regions         not present in the oocyte        If there were no crossing over between homologous chromosomes during meiosis then the        first meiotic division would consistently separate the chromosomes derived from the        mothers mother from the chromosomes derived from the mothers father producing two cells        that are not related to each other         at all or more precisely exactly as closely related to each other as        the mothers mother was to the mothers father Crossing over prevents this creating a        mosaic of related and unrelated chromosome regions between the products of the first        meiotic division and uncertain relationships between the final four meiotic products        Nonetheless the consistently depressed relatedness between the oocyte and the polar bodies        may help to explain why polar bodies are almost always eliminatedsibling rivalry might be        even greater if some siblings were derived from each others polar bodies                    Towards an Explanation        So how and why did two families of scale insects tame and domesticate their potentially        fractious polar bodies rather than killing them like normal animals do There are at least        three lines of thinking that seem promising for unraveling this mystery                  Histological eusociality and relatedness          There are interesting parallels between on the one hand the chimerism seen in          armored scale insects and on the other hand the eusociality true sociality seen in          ants and honeybees In ants and honeybees sterile individuals workers provide          nutrition to their potentially fertile siblings In armored scale insects a genetically          distinct but ultimately sterile cell lineage the bacteriome provides nutrition to its          potentially fertile sibling cell lineage the rest of the scale insectthough of          course polar bodyderived cells are sibling in a strange special sense Like ants and          bees armored scale insects are effectively haplodiploid males transmit only the          chromosomes they inherited from their mother and all of a males sperm are identical to          each other This clonality of sperm boosts the relatedness between sisters and          Hamilton b pointed out that this high relatedness can explain the high level of          cooperation between sisters seen in eusocial ants and honeybees High levels of          cooperation between sisters have since been found in haplodiploid thrips as well Crespi           It is tempting to speculate that similar explanations can be applied to          histological eusociality seen in the cooperation between related tissues in scale          insects          This temptation increases when we consider another case from the old cytogenetics          literature of apparent histological eusociality though not of true permanent chimerism          This occurs in a few families of parasitoid wasps Tremblay and Caltagirone  Strand          and Grbic  in which cells derived from polar bodies form a membrane around the          yolkless egg that is deposited in the wasps insect host which is often a scale          insect Similar to the worker ant and the scale insect bacteriome this membrane is          thought to mediate nutrition of the developing embryo and similar to ants honeybees          and scale insects these wasps are haplodiploid          But although it is tempting to conclude that haplodiploidy plays the same role in          promoting histological eusociality as it does in promoting organismal eusociality the          temptation should probably be resisted In the case of the parasitoid wasps the polar          bodyderived tissue has no paternal genome so the clonality of sperm cannot boost its          relatedness to anything In the case of armored scale insect chimerism the bacteriome          does have a copy of the paternal genome and that copy is identical to the paternal          genome in the rest of the embryo so in that sense the two tissues do have a high          relatedness similar to the high relatedness of full siblings under haplodiploidy But the          scale insect bacteriome gets its copy of the paternal genome directly from the embryo so          the clonality of sperm the source of elevated relatedness between haplodiploid sisters          apparently has nothing to do with it Some other explanation is probably needed                          Maternal interests          Note that whatever the relationship between the polar bodyderived tissues and the          rest of the insect the polar bodies contain the mothers complete genome And while your          polar bodies may be           less related to you on average than your siblings are they are           more related to your siblings and of course to your mother than          they are to you Perhaps the polar bodies function to somehow enforce some maternal or          family interest nipping in the bud some sibling rivalry that would otherwise suppress          the familys fitness In haplodiploid groups females are more closely related to their          full sisters with whom they share threequarters of their gene copies than to their          brothers with whom they share only onequarter of their gene copies So if there is          competition between siblings for resources females are expected to behave more          antagonistically towards brothers and more cooperatively towards sisters In contrast a          female is equally related to a son as she is to a daughter each carries half of her gene          copies These asymmetries in relatedness lead to struggles in haplodiploid social          groups with a mother seeking to direct more resources towards sons and with sisters          seeking to direct more resources away from their brothers and towards each other Seger          and Stubblefield           It is difficult to see how such a struggle might play itself out in scale insects          which are hardly social insects The only motile stage in a females life is the first          instar crawler after which she settles in one spot permanently The male is slightly          more mobile having a motile usually winged adult form Nonetheless  the low          motility of females and the fact that they live mostly on longlived woody plants means          that maternal kin may interact over long timescales as in social insects  some scale          insects appear to make relatively sophisticated social decisions about where to settle          settling nearer to and thus possibly competing more closely with nonkin than kin          Kasuya   although most scale insects use phloem sap an almost inexhaustible          resource armored scales use parenchyma tissues Rosen  which may be locally          exhausted and therefore may compete against neighbors for food Thus it is conceivable          that females may compete against brothers and sisters for resources that they may make          decisions that affect the intensity of that competition and that such decisions may have          different optima from the perspectives of maternal versus paternal genes Possibly the          presence of a massive contingent of maternal genes a double dose of the complete          maternal genome in a nutritionally significant tissue like the bacteriome might somehow          affect such decisions in ways favorable to maternal interests Proximal mechanisms might          include effects on signals or perceptions related to relatedness gender site quality          or satiety          Similar manipulation of intersibling interaction might be going on in the case of the          parasitoid wasps that have polar bodyderived membranes around their eggs Sometimes          these wasps lay a single unfertilized male egg and a single fertilized female egg          into the same host Both eggs divide to form embryos which divide into a clone of many          embryos Some of the embryos become sterile precocious larvae that can apparently          attack other larvae trying to use the same hostincluding potentially their own          siblings Ode and Hunter  Here is a situation in which the polar body genes in the          membranes surrounding the proliferating embryos might have very different selective          optima for levels of betweensibling aggressivenessand even for rates of          developmentthan the genes in the embryos they surround and because they apparently          mediate the nutrition of the embryos they might be able to influence how the embryos          develop                          Gender crypsis          The endosymbiotic bacteria that dwell in the scale insects bacteriomes are maternally          inherited Thus from the perspective of the bacteria male insects are deadends Many          maternally inherited bacteria have evolved to manipulate the hosts genetic system for          their own advantage Some bacterial lineages induce parthenogenesis or feminize males          Bacteria may even evolve to suicidally kill male embryos that they find themselves in if          the death of the male frees up resources that his sisters can use Majerus  In          order to do this bacteria must respond to some cue that indicates the gender of the          individual they are in Potentially a host could evolve resistance to such manipulation          by maternally inherited bacteria by depriving those bacteria of cues indicating gender          In armored scales the bacteriome has exactly the same genome two complete copies of the          mothers diploid genome and one complete copy of the fathers genome in all full          siblings whether they are male or female and the same is usually true in mealybugs          This might explain why the bacteriome is the only tissue in which the fathers genome          remains present and active in both males and females                            Prospects        Scale insects and their bacteriomes challenge our notion of what an individual is Is a        scale insects bacteriome a kind of sibling Is it half sibling half self Is it a sterile        slave under control Is it an extension of the mother exerting control In all other        organisms chimeras are temporary and unstable How have scale insects suppressed the        conflicts that normally tear chimeras apart To approach such questions well have to        revive the empirical study of scale insect bacteriomes combining approaches from recent        studies of aphid bacteriomes Braendle et al  and of human pregnancy Haig  We        can better understand the nature of genetic conflicts in scale insects by studies of the        genetic structure of scale insect populations together with studies of sex ratio variation        and the proximate mechanisms of sex determination For simplicity I have described only        the most common of the huge variety of very different scale insect genetic systems and        modes of bacteriome development Tremblay   Nur  This diversity greater        than for the comparable cases of mammalian placentas and floweringplant endosperms means        there is a huge scope for comparative ecological and genetic studies that could help        elucidate general principles The study of truly strange creatures can tell us what kinds        of things are possible Thats why we will be so interested in any life found on another        planet and why in the meantime we should take a close look at scale insects
