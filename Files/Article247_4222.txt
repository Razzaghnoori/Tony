                                 Body and Soul                        Guys            One last thing if you can bear with me Ive been meaning all week to mountthe case for The Sixth Sense  a film audiences loved and critics likedsortakinda but seemed to worry about liking too much In my opinion TheSixth Sense is every bit as ambitious and provocative and in some waysmore fully realized than Three Kings  Lets start with the small giftsof this movie the little things it attempts that so few American movies everbother with The urban backdrop Tak Fujimotos sublimely subtle atmosphericcinematography made Philadelphia look ancient decadent wellworn rarely doesan American film setting feel so saturated with the past and teeming with thefootprints left by earlier generations Then theres the lowkey honesty aboutclassthe contrast between Bruce Williss psychologist a posterboy gentrifierin a townhouse stuffed with antiques and the wonderful Toni Colettesstruggling mom With just a few quick strokes writerdirector M N Shyamalanpaints a totally authenticfeeling picture of yuppiedomits decent intentionscomplacency and lonelinessand I didnt see a less whitewashed or sensationalportrait of workingclass family life this year As opposed to the voyeuristicRosetta  where the camera pants after the poor heroine cornering herlike a pig in a pen and treating her vulnerability as a turnonan occasionfor a kind of arthouse porn As for the famous trick ending it is not atrick so much as the solution to a problem the film has been posing all alongThe film has such a fragmented point of view its like a rigorously workedoutcubist canvas except that unlike a cubist Shyamalan moves through thefragments to a new level of clarity I may be jumping to conclusions based onthe fact that Shayamalan is IndianAmerican but The Sixth Sense strikesme as philosophically rather complicated and possibly in dialogue with somenonWestern ideas you dont get to see too often in films unless theyreuttered in egregiously bad faith by a wisecracking turbanwearing showboatlike Whoopi Goldberg or Robin Williams Many critics felt that toward the endthe ghosts became too unthreatening too adorableand here I admit they had apoint On the other hand I dont think this was just pandering Death iseverywhere in The Sixth Sense  the point of the film unusually wise fora blockbuster is that death is inevitable and not an enemy            I wanted to thank you David for passing the piece byDaniel Menaker It was as excellent as promisedand yet the pace of changethese days is quick Even since he wrote that piece a few months ago BeingJohn Malkovich has come out and Boys Dont Cry  and a few othermovies which taken together suggest that breaking through to the real isno longer such a priority Compared with these films The Truman Show with its paranoid and simplistic pursuit of innocence already feels  yearsold In fact the best films this year no longer placed much stock in realityat all They leapt into gray areas where human beings behaved like machines The Matrix  and machines demonstrated human potential Im thinking ofThe Iron Giant  and his talent for sculpture They leapt suddenlyfrom one plane of reality to another the freeze frames on Tracy Flicksdeformed midmotion face in Election  the sudden abstracted shots inThree Kings where a body ceased to be a person and became the pathwayfor a bullet and a haven for microbes and disease They explored the problemof two souls same model body the duplicate Buzz Lightyears in Toy Story  and one soul too many bodies  Being John Malkovich  Theyexplored the problem of a soul attempting to will its wishes into being evenwhen the body cant easily accommodate them  Boys Dont Cry  TheSixth Sense  Body and soul This it seems to me is the problem thatinspired the best moments in the best films of  This was fun Idespecially like to thank you Davidthe most generous and stimulating ofhosts
