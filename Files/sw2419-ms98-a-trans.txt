 hey Dick who s your favorite team i think i m going to have to go with the Chicago Bears oh how come well i like Mike Ditka oh yeah and um of course i used to like Jim McMahon and you know uh Walter Payton yeah but they got rid of them but i still like Ditka and i think they ve got still got a pretty good team if they could just find a real good quarterback yeah they really uh uh they found out that all the guys that were backing up uh McMahon when they got to be the first guys weren t all that good after all yeah i was kind of i was i was disappointed they came along pretty good but but they just didn t have anybody that could actually go in there and win the game yeah Tomczak was was trying hard but he just can t do it yeah and or they found that Tomczak really wasn t a he was a good backup quarterback was what he was he s not a starter yeah yeah he wasn t the guy to take them take them to the championship so i m hoping maybe they ll draft a good quarterback this year i don t know who they re gonna get but i hope yeah i don t i don t know what s out there for quarterbacks and they ve got a what about a mid a mid first round choice i think yeah they don t have much in the way of rounds but who knows if they don t get one maybe they can trade for one after all you know i New Orleans picked up uh old uh Steve Montana or Walsh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah Steve Walsh who s your favorite team yeah he had had had sort of mixed success with them uh when he was there but i think he ll be okay once he gets on well i i think once he goes into training camp with them and gets a full year at uh to do it it it ll work out okay for him i uh you know i uh he didn t have a chance here in Dallas because my gosh Aikman was the number one choice number one draft choice uh and with a long term six year contract and a bunch of and a bunch of money oh yeah and they were paying him a lot of money so Walsh yeah Walsh didn t have that much uh well as you probably guessed i m a Cowboy fan uh more or less gee that s too bad and well it s hard uh because that s too bad it must get a long time between thrills yeah uh i was here in nineteen sixty well i got to go back that i moved down from Pittsburgh in in fifty nine and uh in fifty eight i really became a pro football fan went to all the Steelers home games uh huh and they finished second that year i guess and it was Bobby Lane s first it was the year that Bobby Lane got traded to them two games into the season uh huh uh so that s where i started cutting my teeth on the NFL and then i got to Dallas and we didn t have any NFL in fifty nine so i sat and watched uh watched it on television then at the end of the fifty nine season when they announced we re gonna get a team in sixty i went out and bought two season tickets and i was in the first twelve season ticket holders good grief for the Cowboys you still got them uh yeah except i don t use them well uh then what happened so we go a little bit further than that uh and i uh uh i was single then later i got married and i had my two season tickets and they were in the Cotton Bowl in the first row in the upper deck on the fifty yard line uh which was really nice and uh in the early days uh you know ten twelve fourteen thousand people i m talking about sixty through about sixty four uh huh yeah uh was what we got i also bought season tickets to the Dallas Texans football team which is now the Kansas City Chiefs ah the old Kansas City Chiefs yeah and i and i may have been the only one that did both because the mentality in Dallas was that you couldn t like both you had to like one and hate the other oh yeah and and it was interesting because the AFL uh when when the Chiefs when the Texans were playing they would give the scores of the Cowboy games and the NFL games but the NFL refused to admit they existed so when the Cowboys were playing you never got the scores of their games huh and it you know it was the Lamar Hunt crowd versus the Clint Murchison crowd and uh and the the popular joke around Dallas was that after the sixty two season uh in fact i went down to Houston in sixty two and watched them win the AFL championship uh after the sixty two season Murchison and Hunt got together and flipped a coin and the loser had to stay and uh then in uh uh sixty uh uh let s see sixty nine when they decided to build the new stadium in Irving uh they let the uh uh they let the fans build it i mean it wasn t built with any tax payer money uh they floated bonds that the that the season ticket holders had to buy to maintain their status as season ticket holders so what was neat is you got to choose the tickets based on your seniority as a season ticket holder and uh so i had a first choice and uh i got in the upper tier uh well actually there was two types of seats there were two hundred and fifty dollar bonds and thousand dollar bonds that you had to buy good grief and so i got the first choice of the two hundred and fifty dollar bonds so i was in the upper deck in the twelfth row on the fifty yard line i wonder if that guy that s in the eleventh row see he bought thousand dollar bonds huh that guy so uh that happened then uh ultimately i had uh i got transferred overseas by TI i m with TI and i got transferred overseas yeah uh through most of the eighties so i each each year i just sold my tickets i had some people take custody of my tickets for me i served uh three years four years in Malaysia and three in the Philippines huh and uh now i got back i got kids in college and gosh i can t afford that price so i still keep them in my name but the guy who takes them calls me every year and says can i have the tickets one more year i say yeah fine take them so i still hold them but i don t go oh that s too bad but uh the the funny thing about the Cowboys is is that everybody is really enthused because we ve got all these umpteen jillion draft choices and uh but when you look back on the team uh uh except for probably Emmett Smith nobody that s been drafted in the last twelve years is a starter no i m kind of uh actually uh i think they ve got the draft choices to make to make a good run at it but i i m not sure how well they ll draft well if you don t make smart selections it doesn t do any good or if you make smart selections and they and you can t sign them yeah they re they re having trouble doing a little bit of both yeah well i heard Jerry Jones say something interesting and i and i it must border on legality or ethnicity on draft day he s got about thirty people that are going out to their potential players and when it comes their time to choose they get thirty minutes or so these people will negotiate with the players and get them to sign a contract and if they won t sign a contract they won t draft them huh and and they will take the time allotted to make their choices to do that so you you got thirty minutes to make your decision then and uh uh yeah because see last year their first two draft choices were uh Alex uh Emmett Smith and Alexander Wright and they didn t get either of them until half way through the season and they didn t get to go through training camp with them yeah well Smith came on pretty good Wright was yeah Smith came on pretty good Wright is is still in the in the potential category Wright didn t do much everybody likes his speed but he can t catch the ball and it doesn t do him much good to run down field if he can t catch the ball no no no but but you know that s where Bob Hayes was in his early days too so i ll be interested to see how they do of course actually i was in Dallas in of course i worked for TI too for a while hum and i left them i guess in eighty two but i was in Dallas there when uh Roger Staubach and oh yeah all the bunches up there and yeah well those were the glory years the seventies were absolutely and uh i got so tired i i guess i just got so tired of hearing about the Dallas Cowboys and and you know whatever whatever the Cowboys did that day that it just kind of turned me against them yeah yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team s emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to Texas Stadium uh huh uh and the movement to Texas Stadium came along about the fifth game of uh of the seventy one season and that was the year they went to the Super Bowl and beat Miami yeah in the Super Bowl the previous year that they d finished in the Cotton Bowl they did go to the Super Bowl and got beat by Baltimore in in the in the last second or two but uh i mean in the seventies it was play offs every year i had some friends of mine well i guess it s it s some friends of my parents uh lived in Dallas and of course they re avid you know just avid Cowboys fans and uh they have this uh little mini Winnebago that they take out there on game day oh yeah there s so many people do that and uh we used and uh we used to uh my first wife and i used to go out with them all the time because every Sunday you know the yeah Cowboys there they had like four tickets yeah they they they had four tickets because their kids were there of course their kids came and went yeah but uh every time the kids didn t go we d go and we d go out there and just you know at at like ten o clock in the morning and set up and there would be all these people gathered around that you know all the tailgaters and stuff and then everybody would wander into the stadium you know well i own four tickets i might i told you i had two i actually own four and in seventy one the year they moved into the stadium i bought two more because i had uh two children and they were very little and we just ended up taking the neighbors kids who were teenagers because our i thought that ultimately my own would want to go and the way the stadium was selling out in season tickets it might be totally sold out which it never did but uh uh at twenty nine dollars a pop now let s see six four s is uh huh that s a hundred and sixteen dollars is it that much four hundred dollars goodness damn and another five for parking so that s a hundred and twenty one dollars and with two kids in college and the potential of having three there next September uh i you know i m going to watch them on television for a few years uh yeah i would imagine speaking of that what are your Cowboys going to do for backup quarterback uh boy they don t have one uh we sure figured out that old Babe Wassenberg didn t make it yeah they they sure they sure found out in a hurry that Babe Wassenberg wasn t it didn t they yeah he was pretty good staying on the sidelines with his clipboard but he wasn t he wasn t worth a damn in the game yeah but you know it s it s interesting because old uh uh you know everybody said when they signed Steve Wal boy they re going to have to trade him they re going to have to trade him but you cannot seriously contend uh in the league without two front line quarterbacks you know and and and you know the years that we were good we had Staubach and Morton are you up there too now the one that wasn t playing the one that wasn t playing was pissed off most of the time but nevertheless in in over three or four seasons both those guys went down with with severe injuries and the other guy stepped in and they didn t never lost a lick uh huh but they were still bet your money paid if somebody sent me you know i i guess being an athlete of course i played in high school and college yeah yeah and i can understand you know wanting to play but of course as i get more seniority on earth huh i kind of wonder you know gosh if i could sit on the bench and earn five hundred thousand dollars a year i d just be happy to sit there yeah yeah and uh that last championship they won in the Super Bowl Craig Martin was the only guy in the entire squad that did not get in the game but he got his winner s share
