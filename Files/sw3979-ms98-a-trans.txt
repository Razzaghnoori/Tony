        afternoon Doug it certainly is uh going to be a pleasure to chat with you     uhhuh   and im uh certainly was surprised to uh to hear from you normally i talk to people in Plano Texas   yeah me too   how did you get on this list   uh through Nancy Dalgren she um she had somehow gotten the information from TI and was distributing it around   oh okay all righty well now what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy do what ideas do you have on that Doug   um see im not sure that i dont think theyre necessarily widespread in this country but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for um people to invade your privacy when they want to i think its um   in what in what manner   well its certainly not that difficult to tap a phone its completely trivial to for instance listen in on someones car phone or walk around phone since theyre just radio signals  its um   umhum   and lets see well whats the first thing that comes to your mind   well the thing that i thought they were uh concerned about was was people calling calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something   uhhuh   and in reality in many cases they knew or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations and i thought that was uh beginning to invade the privacy of people because the things about where you live and and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business and they in return come back and try to sell you something with this uh additional knowledge to me thats an invasion of privacy   yeah i agree with you there for sure um and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get you know its possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history for instance if they just um twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when theyre calling the credit company   uhhuh   its you know possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history not to mention change it if he wants to   you mean your history in regards to uh the charge card company or something like that   well um well yes well for instance yes um and theyll probably goes into other things like you know your records with the government or utility companies or anything   do you consider these serious uh problems   since um uh not not yet anyways because i dont think theyre widespread enough but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems   umhum well what should we do about it or what could be done about it do you think to correct it   um im not really sure because the i mean society is going more and more electronic and there are certainly benefits to its doing so and its hard to hard to say whether the um risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not and im not sure what can be done to ensure that they dont um uh why do you see any out for us   well i would think that uh information held on records uh by any company or charge card dealer or or person should be absolutely private private and and not be allowed to be uh to given out by those companies   uhhuh   i mean it it should be made a a uh national or a state law to protect people so that uh you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies   uhhuh   in other words if you call the company yourself directly uh and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else uh you know from the outside so to speak then youd   uhhuh   youd feel more free to uh to go into detail with them   yeah i suppose   but but we have no control of that now and then uh you youre when youre talking with them you really dont want to tell them everything thats on your mind because you you feel that it someday might be used against you   uhhuh
