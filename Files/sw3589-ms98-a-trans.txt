        well my view i work for a financial institution and     oh boy   yeah and i love my credit card uh you end up with more consumer rights by using credit cards than   what do you mean by that   uh what i mean is say you pay for something with a check your check clears youre out the bucks   umhum   you pay for something with a credit card you dissatisfied are dissatisfied with it you take it back and they say sorry we you cant take it back if you know you can leave it there and then just have your Visa charged back   oh whats your favorite credit card do you use Visa how come   get your money back Visa well thats the kind we offer   oh thats a good reason thats a good reason   and uh were just offering a a new card that gives you one up to one percent back of all the charges that you make   now   cash back you know like Discovers   i was gonna say i know Discover does that   yep and were starting to do that   Visas gonna do it too   we are   who all right who puts out your Visa card   uh we do  America First Credit Union   who is we America First Credit Union and youre gonna offer the cash back just like Discover does huh well i ill tell you that works because i use my Discover card more than any other credit card for that sole reason   yeah did you get much back   hm  yeah  unfortunately i use my Discover card more than i ought to not a great deal i get i get about a check for about fifty some bucks at the end of the year usually   well good for you that must mean and its one percent so you spend about five thousand   i shouldnt tell that to you   thats pretty good well i i do better than that everything goes on mine and then ive got a business too that i use it for charging computers on   well i tell you then then i have an exact account of everything ive bought its all printed out   it is nice yep   and as long as you keep your statements then you know exactly what youve spent and if you know when you bought something because often i wont remember and i can go back you know ill remember the month so i can go back to my my credit card invoice and there it is it tells me the exact date and everything   well how many cards have you got   well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a Visa um but my Visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my   uhhuh uhhuh a debit card yes i dont like those   yeah and so i dont either because its gone although they dont debit it until the end of the month yeah   oh really thats interesting   um but it still automatically comes off that month if i time it right then any like  my my date is the twelfth so if i charge something on the thirteenth then i dont get that bill till the end of the month and its not due till before the twelfth of the next month so i can put off paying for something for free for two months   uhhuh   with a debit card   no not with a debit card with my Discover card i can and and i use Discover more than any other because of the cash back   oh credit oh okay   i have MasterCard and then i have all the different department stores but i just really never use them and i try desperately hard to pay it off each month   yes   because the the cost to use it is terrific     is it twenty percent interest   uh it varies from eighteen and a half to twenty one percent   wow   and thats thats tremendous amount   our cards thirteen and a half   oh youre kidding me   uh with a ten dollar annual fee   how do you get one of yours   well you have to be a member of our credit union   and what credit union is that   America First its were the   oh but see youre in Utah yeah   yeah and youd have to be a resident of the state   oh okay i was thinking about your brother he said Jack and hell do that but thats youre nowhere near us wow  thats a neat idea though perhaps some other people around here will catch on and do it too   uh do you have Mervyns and all those have you noticed that they all have started issuing their own credit cards   oh yeah oh yeah they have for years but you can still use the three big ones MasterCard Visa and now Discover you can still use those three um at almost any department store   what do you think of Discover uh Sears not taking anyone but theirs   they have not done that for years   yeah do you like that or do you think thats fair or   i dont know i used when i was a a kid  i worked for Sears   oh   and it im just  im so used to them not taking anybody but theirs theyll take Discover but see they back Discover too so it doesnt bother me because i use Discover most of the time   yeah yeah its theirs ah okay lets see do you think that uh the move towards plastic is a good thing   i think i
