                so David uh what are the capital punishment laws down in the state of Florida   they have the electric chair i believe remember Ted Bundy   oh thats right   couple years ago they were all down there saying fry him   oh so the laws are still intact then   oh yeah they yeah they use that all the time well not all the time is you know it it its always backlogged it usually takes a guy usually a guy sits on death row for three or four years at least before they put him you know in the actual actual electric chair   umhum and i imagine that costs a small bundle too   yeah he always gets all these appeals and everything   go through the court process   he gets all these appeals and everything uh as far as it being a deterrent to people i dont think its a deterrent a deterrent uh i think its i think its more for the families more than anything the families probably get some justification out of it   umhum   but uh as far as it deterring anybody from committing murder or something like that i dont think it really does   no but i think it does serve a valuable purpose in the sense that the victims get some sort of satisfaction the community doesnt pay for the burden of having a   the victims can   a prisoner in jail for twenty years   thats right thats right   you know and having to supply them with a color TV and um books and education so forth   right i mean what is it how much is it a year to keep a prisoner its like twenty thousand a year to food and clothe a prisoner some ridiculous price   and i imagine it probably costs a great deal amount of money to to even go through the process of trying to electrocute someone   yeah   to the court proceum i mean it tying up attorneys time uh times the court system   yeah i dont know how many appeals Ted Bundy had uh they just keep appealing it and appealing it to the next higher next higher you know just keeps they keep going higher and higher up and uh you know it does take a long time it takes money of course to do that so and its a public defender most of the time so   umhum well how do you feel about that do you are you in favor of capital punishment as a   yeah yes i am i am in favor of it but as far as it being an actual deterrent to crime i dont think it is like i said its mostly for the families benefit i think or the victims   umhum   uh the you know the family of the victims do you guys have it up there where whered you say you were from   yeah im from New Hampshire   okay New Hampshire they have it up there   yeah as far as i remember we dont have it um        i know there hasnt been anyone executed up here probably in about thirty forty years which is ironic because we come from very conservative state uh very strong on on punishment and crime um it uh during one thing we dont really have that that much crime up here when we do have a celebrated case like Pamela Smart i dont know if you heard about that   thats the schoolteacher one   right   i saw the movie about that   yeah thats a case where um shes probably guilty i dont think theres enough evidence there to convict her i mean to uh execute her   umhum   i think if because once you execute someone the the the decision the decision is final you cant really reverse the process um   well that is the bad thing about it and im im sure that back in the old days they they put to death a couple innocent ones during the process but theyre but theyre uh opinion was well if you got few few innocent people have to die to protect the majority then thats okay you know i dont i dont necessarily agree with that   umhum yeah i dont agree with that either i think if you kill someone whos innocent thats uh   it screwed up the whole thing in my opinion yeah i agree with you there   somebody you cant even live with if they you you really need to you know case where John Hinkley tried to assassinate the President uh   thats pretty obvious thats open and shut isnt it   right and if he had succeeded uh uh without a doubt he should be executed executed   thats right   uh whether hes insane or not   thats right   same thing with Dahlmer i mean he killed seventeen people   right   uh its its a shame that were gonna have to pay for him   now in his case now is that thats Minnesota right   whats that   is that Minnesota   i think  uh Michigan or somewhere somewhere around there   or Wisconsin or ah maybe its Wisconsin yeah they they might have capital punishment the thing with people like that they like to take and study them put them in jail and do studies on them like that so thats they can try to get a profile of his personality i think you know and i guess in states where they dont have capital punishment thats the kind of stuff they do but i think in his case they will put him to death because all the all the kids you know all the families and stuff arent going to tolerate it   yeah but i thought he he received his sentence um remember maybe what the what the final turnout was   what is the final uh is he still going to trial for that   i thought he went to rehabilitation rehabilitation mean they they were going to put him in rehabilitation for a few years then prison for the rest of his life   thats right because hes definitely insane i think they proved that he was insane and maybe thats maybe that was uh what got him off or made him uh not get the death penalty because they can prove that hes insane then i i dont think you get the death penalty but the the but the uh prosecution was trying to uh say that he was sane when he committed them so they could but they they were going for the death penalty i think thats what they were trying to uh i mean the they knew he did it that he was guilty it was just a matter of was he going to get the death penalty or life in prison   umhum   yeah i think the families wanted him to get death   yeah i think thats a a case where there really needs to be some change in the laws to allow for flexibility i think if one person kills another person out of
