                 okay go ahead and uh tell me what youre looking for in a job now   oh one thing that i look for is um well maybe not the most most important thing but benefits like um health insurance for my family   okay   and another thing would be um reasonable reasonable work hours uh good working environment um right now i think its were supposed to talk about uh our current situation im a post doctoral fellow and   a a what   a post doctoral  fellow um i   okay   im its for the training beyond your doctorate degree   okay   and        i get the same benefits as the  staff at the university i work at the University of Iowa and i i like i like working at the University one of the benefits there is you get a lot of flexibility in when you work and when you wanna take time off for example this Christmas i have about three weeks that i get to go out west to visit my family and so thats pretty good you it would probably be hard to have something like that in another type of job   so you like having having the flexibility to be able to take off time when you want to thats important to you   oh yeah besides just some besides some semester breaks the there is also other um  other times too um  like during the summer and things like that   does uh recognition from others and a sense of contributing to the organizations success does that rank pretty high for you   oh yes and thats one of the reasons i like the University too because you do get credit for your own work um my advisor my mentor here especially especially he used to work in industry but he couldnt stand it because um  he felt like that his boss at uh at this aerospace place space company where he worked uh his supervisor got credit for all the um achievements that he made so thats why he came back to the University   yeah thats thats kind of a rip when you feel that way   and so i think at the University you get often get credit for more you know your name gets on what you do like when you publish articles and things like that   hey David whats your doctorate in   um  its in physics however um you know there is several several branches within physics i i studied sound acoustics and the subject for that is called acoustics   sure   and im specifically interested in the acoustics of speech im working now at the National National Center for Voice and Speech thats located here at the University of Iowa   so youre kind of interested in this thing that  were participating in then   oh i found out about it because i attended um  a conference for the Acoustical Society of America in Texas and uh  the chairman of the session where i presented a paper um um was it Mister Godfrey he um was uh  he he he gave me a a thing and said to try and find others to help join for this project   hm and so youre enjoying all the benefits that a professor would  at the moment is there   oh i couldnt say that   well i meant as health and uh   um i i dont get a the salary for one thing   oh yeah   nor the job stability post a post post doctoral fellow is only for two years but the ultimate goal usually of a post doctoral fellowship is probably to go on and accept a position at a University so this is um  you know the economy with the Gulf War and everything um last year around the time i was graduating um there was just were not very many opportunities available so this was the best thing because um my post doctoral fellowship like this um um is a good thing on your resume for when you apply to be a professor or something like that   okay uh David is one of the things that i i suppose so you dont want to be out in the weather and uh the environment like construction workers for you its better to be inside airconditioned warm warm   uh yeah especially uh with the humidity here in Iowa yes i i i would uh definitely want a indoors job um  do you have a um   i work as a EDP auditor yeah yeah and ive got a degree and a bunch of different certifications that go along with
