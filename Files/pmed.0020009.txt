                    Ross McKinneys Viewpoint Universities Should Be Allowed Provided the Trial Is        Approved by an External Review Board        One of the principal missions of an academic health center is to advance the        understanding and treatment of disease through clinical research In this pursuit there is        a need for checks and balances When Jesse Gelsinger a relatively healthy young adult        died in Philadelphia during a clinical trial of a novel adenovirusbased genetic therapy        for ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency it was a tragedy  In retrospect there were        many clues that there were problems with the adenovirus vector clues that neither the        investigator nor the institution pursued        Attorney Alan Milstein made the case that the investigator and institution were both        blinded to these problems by their heavy financial investment in the technology an        investment worth millions of dollars  Though the legal case was settled out of court        it created a de facto standard that institutions with commercial rights in a new drug or        technology should not be allowed to pursue clinical trials involving that new technology I        do not believe that such a blanket prohibition is necessary        At its core the issue revolves around conflicts of interest In clinical research the        investigator should be primarily an advocate for the patient or volunteer The core reason        to perform clinical research is to create generalizable knowledge about a therapy patient        population or a disease process with the longterm intent of improving human health The        interests of the patient and investigator should be fully aligned However most physicians        in clinical research have other more personal motivations intermixed with the desire for        progress Successful research projects can lead to publications promotions grant        renewals and per case clinical trial enrollment fees Some investigators have intellectual        property rights that may have very substantial financial value if the drug or device        reaches the level of approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration These        investigators stand to gain personally if the clinical trial is successful a situation        that has the potential to distort the investigators objectivity and may lead to a less        honest relationship with study volunteers        In order to ensure that investigators are honest with potential research volunteers the        system of institutional review boards IRBs evolved The IRB approves the informed consent        document which should describe the clinical experiment in a clear and dispassionate way to        patients and their families IRBs are largely made up of faculty and staff from the        institution although there are also public members and nonscientists on most IRB panels        The IRB must remain autonomous and be able to hold up or stop an investigation There is an        obligation that the IRB first and foremost think about patient rights and safety        The passage of the BayhDole Act in  enabled universities to license inventions for        commercial development  The closer to Food and Drug Administration approval the drug or        technology is at the time of licensure the more valuable it becomes Therefore        universities have an incentive to advance the clinical development of inventions by their        faculty In this regard they are very much like corporate sponsors of research subject to        the same Food and Drug Administration oversight as corporations        In terms of performing clinical trials using new technologies in which it has a        financial interest how is a university different from a corporate sponsor In regard to        patient safety one primary distinction rests with the IRB The corporate sponsor will        present the research protocol to an independent commercial IRB the university to its own        IRB Yet in both cases there are potential conflicts of interest The university IRB        members will have a conflict of interest between the investments of their employer and the        rights of the research volunteers Independent commercial IRBs depend on pleasing corporate        customers for their continued existence and there is an unstated expectation that they        will both be fast and produce rulings consistent with corporate expectations which in most        cases include a desire to do the research ethically        At the university level a logical and conservative solution to the problem of        institutional conflicts is to require that an IRB from outside the institution become the        IRB of record when such a conflict arises This external IRB could be either an independent        commercial IRB or one of another university The key is to grant the IRB independence and        the authority to provide real oversight        There are other elements of conflicts of interest that need to be considered when the        institution has a commercial interest but most have more to do with the management of        personal conflicts than institutional conflicts The institution needs to assure the        presence of an independent data safety monitoring board thorough audits of good clinical        practice and a publications committee that will ensure submission of all meaningful study        results whether positive negative or neutral Anyone subjectively evaluating patient        data should be as free of conflicts as possible These steps can be formulaically required        which should allow for performance of clinical research despite the presence of        institutional commercial interests                    David Korns Viewpoint Academic Biomedical Research Must Be Free from the Taint of        Financial Compromise        United States research universities and especially their academic medical centers have        greatly benefited from their uniquely privileged status in our society That status is        rooted in public confidence and trust that these institutions and their faculties will be        independent and impartial in fulfilling both their academic mission to create transmit        and preserve knowledge and their duty to the general society to serve as credible        trustworthy arbiters of knowledge One important mark of this status has been the        remarkably consistent generosity of public support for biomedical research Another has        been the noteworthy deference of the federal government to university autonomy and the        light hand with which the sponsoring agencies historically have overseen the conduct of        university research        When federal interposition occurred it typically responded to widely publicized        episodes of research misconduct sometimes intertwined with egregious financial self        interests of investigators these episodes legitimately questioned the effectiveness of        institutional oversight Nevertheless regulations consistently focused more on defining        the metes and bounds of the permissible than on prescriptive mandates and their        implementation was effected largely through the mechanism of assurancescommitments that        institutions would faithfully safeguard the specified perimeters of acceptable conduct        Awardee institutions thus bear primary responsibility for assuring the credibility and        integrity of federally sponsored research Public confidence in the trustworthiness of        these institutions is critical and yet nowhere is it more fragile than in biomedical        research involving human participants That confidence eroded in the s and s        because of reports of scientific misconduct and of individual and institutional financial        self interests in clinical trials Scathing reports from federal oversight agencies and        angry congressional hearings questioned whether financially selfinterested institutions        could any longer be trusted to guard the welfare of research participants or the integrity        of clinical research        In  the Association of American Medical Colleges convened a task force to examine        and make recommendations on individual and institutional financial self interests in        clinical research The task force began by recognizing four important trends over the past        three decades First the nature and culture of academic biomedical research have changed        bringing the potential of commercial relevance even to the most fundamental of scientific        discoveries Second there has been enormous growth in the extent and depth of interactions        between research universities and industry especially in biomedicine Third the public        has become increasingly impatient that its extraordinary investments in research yield more        effective disease preventions and therapies Fourth the involvement of academic        researchers in the translation of their discoveries has been essential in bringing those        discoveries to market and to the benefit of public health        But the task force in its two reports asserted that both individual and institutional        financial conflicts of interest in clinical research could be problematic  It        recommended urgent and substantial refinement and strengthening of institutional policies        and practices for monitoring managing andwhen necessaryextinguishing such        conflicts        Both reports rest on a common set of core principles The most important is that        institutions should regard all significant financial interests in research involving human        participants as potentially problematic Where such interests exist there should be a        rebuttable presumption that the concerned individual or institution should not conduct the        research absent compelling circumstances Importantly the task force after intense        debate rejected categorical prohibitions lest they unintentionally impede the translation        of research discoveries into tangible public benefits        The task force acknowledged that the issue of institutional financial self interests is        extraordinarily complex and sensitive since it touches the very core of institutional        autonomy But the fact that an institution has a financial interest per se should raise a        strong presumption against its participation in the clinical testing of that product        Public accountability and scientific integrity require that all research results emanating        from academic medicine be as free as possible from the taint of financial compromise        Adding human participants to the research mix should raise the barrier to the highest level        and require compelling justification for any participation by a financially selfinterested        institution        The task force did not define compelling believing that each institution should make        that determination based on disinterested scrutiny of the facts and circumstances of each        case For example there may exist in a given institution a unique capability without        which the proposed research involving human participants could not be conducted as        effectively or safely or at all In these instances the public and science deserve access        to that capability provided the necessary safeguards are put in place to mediate the        conflicting interests In all such instances protection of scientific integrity and the        welfare of research participants must remain the foremost priority of both investigator and        institution        This narrow window avoids absolute prohibition while striving to prevent institutional        participation where credible alternatives exist Only by such stringent selfpolicing can        we sustain the trustworthiness and credibility of biomedical research researchers and        their institutions while continuing vigorously to promote the translation of biomedical        discovery for the publics benefit                    Ross McKinneys Response to David Korns Viewpoint        The public has every right to expect that academic institutions are working first for        the publics interest This value is even codified in the laws granting these institutions        taxexempt status The public also expects that new more effective therapies will be        developed swiftly as a consequence of its support for academic research        The inventor of a new technology is always more motivated to see it through to        widespread use than anyone else This motivation which may be as simple and benign as        curiosity or as easy to understand as a financial incentive is a powerful force driving        human research This force can be disciplined and controlled by the IRB and policies on        conflicts of interest Personal investment in research is nevertheless an important        driver of scientific progress        When society makes an unnecessarily broad assumption that nearly all research with        financial implications for investigators or their institution is potentially corrupted a        brake is placed on progress Society will be better served by establishing clear guidelines        and formalizing oversight of the research process than by rigidly limiting clinical        research affected by conflict of interest As examples clinical trials should have        independent data safety monitoring boards charged to review the study design execution        data analysis and publication of results The IRB system should be strengthened in its        independence through the use of community members And to be certain that institutional        conflict of interest is avoided an IRB from outside the institution in most cases will be        preferable        Society wants better treatments The fact that an inventor has mixed motives for        developing a new treatment has always been acknowledged The need to carefully manage the        experimental process in human studies has always been understood However when rules        minimize the role of inventors at academic centers by forcing trials of their new ideas to        go to outside institutions society loses more than it gains The incremental gain in        safety is likely to be small particularly if oversight is well established while the        decrease in speed of development will be significant                    David Korns Response to Ross McKinneys Viewpoint        There are many similarities between the position espoused by Ross McKinney and my        position Most saliently we both recognize the critically important role played by        academic biomedical scientists in making discoveries and in facilitating their efficient        translation into beneficial products Neither of us proposes that academic investigators        or their institutions should be flatly prohibited from trying to foster that translation        in the presence of financial self interests        But there is an important difference McKinneys approach for dealing with institutional        conflicts of interest depends critically on the engagement of external agents to monitor        closely both scientific integrity and the welfare of human participants That in my view        would require such deep interposition of those agents into the conduct of academic research        as to be not only unprecedented but unfeasible Beyond that the approach falls short with        respect to the maintenance of institutional trustworthiness and protection of public        trust        Routine clinical assessment of technologies by financially interested institutions        fosters public cynicism and distrust of the motives of academic biomedical researchers The        protective mechanisms recommended by McKinney are opaque to the public and reflect a        business as usual image that fails fully to account for the markedly changed        circumstances and perceptions of academic biomedical research Most important the        mechanisms appear to be aimed primarily at protecting institutions financial        interests        By contrast the American Association of Medical Colleges formulation urges that any        institutional involvement in clinical research involving human participants in the presence        of financial conflicts must be predicated on the presence or absence within the institution        of demonstrably unique capability This approach offers a much higher and more credible        standard that aims to protect not only participant wellbeing and scientific integrity but        also institutional trustworthiness and public trust
