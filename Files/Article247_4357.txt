 That Ain t Synergy My Friend What follows is a short rant Apologies in advance for the strident tone But this has to stop From an article in Salon com today about what else AOL s acquisition of Time Warner Not that synergy in its old fashioned sense doesn t continue to play a part As the cable ad exec noted MovieFone is now part of AOL So you can call MovieFone and book your seat for the latest Warner release Hey This is not freakin synergy in its old fashioned sense or otherwise Guess what I can call MovieFone right now and book my seat for the latest Warner release and AOL will make some money off that and Time Warner will make some money off that and between the two of them they will make just as much money off my phone call to MovieFone as they would have if they were part of the same company Where is the synergy What s next People use credit cards to buy tickets over MovieFone so AOL should buy Visa Once and for all not really since I m sure I ll be writing about this again soon synergy only exists when putting assets under one corporate umbrella creates more value than those assets would have produced on their own So if you could convince me that AOL is going to rig MovieFone to make me want to go see Warner Bros movies and that it couldn t have been convinced to do that through a licensing or contract deal then I might say there s synergy Or if you could convince me that just being in the same company as Internet guys is going to make Wolf Blitzer a more productive White House correspondent then I might say there s synergy The most amazing thing about all of this is that the guy who was quoted unfortunately anonymously is a cable advertising executive I wonder if he s in there right now trying to convince the network he works for that it should just buy TV Guide Hey people can use TV Guide to find our shows So if we owned it there d be synergy
