 hi Diana hi have y all been able to do much as a family these days pardon me have y all been able to do much as a as a full family these days all of you oh yes we ve um been um we ve gone other you know all kinds of places we go out to dinner we take the kids to the park and um yeah you know whenever we he my husband has time off or something we take them to the zoo or we you know we we do everything we can possibly as a family do you work outside the home no i don t yeah i don t either it makes a little bit easier i think that way yeah it does and and then uh you know my husband enjoys spending time with the kids you know he ll he ll take them out just to be with them so he they can have time with him and yeah so you have a break too right so and we uh we try to teach our kids as much as we can at home you know we have we try to spend like Monday nights we call it family home evening and uh huh have our kids um you know have little lessons with them and you know just see count see how things are going in our family and you know teach them about their grandparents or something like that bring out pictures of them so they get to know them and we just do all kinds of fun things like that and uh we have family that s far away it sounds like you might too yeah we do so they you know the only way they know their grandparents is by pictures so yeah right and um and phone calls that s about about it yeah right and uh you know they we you know we go to the park or we go in the backyard and sit down and that s what yeah that s what we mostly do pretty simple things especially since my youngest one is excuse me only fourteen months she she s really getting to the age where she s playing and likes to go places yeah right uh huh yeah and with you know me being at home and just having the one income you know you don t have this lot of extra money to to do a lot of you know extra things so you you make more fun than you know you know the kids just think it s wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or that that s right oh that s a big thrill for them yeah or um you know go get a bag of M and M s or something like that they they think that s a lot of fun so we just we try to spend as much time as we can we you know our whole our whole weekends are divided are devoted to our children except for we might go out you know one evening or something but yeah during the day you know it s all devoted to our kids and they come go to church with us and yeah that s true so yeah so have um have you ever been to the Science no it s called the Science Place yes yes that s what we just we haven t lived here too long we went there couple weeks ago uh huh the kids thought that was wonderful and uh oh yeah we i guess there s Science Place One and Science Place Two we ve only been in i think it s Science Place Two i is i m not sure which one we went into it was about a year or so ago when we went the one we went in had um the thing that sticks out most in my mind is a like a kids place area that really seemed i mean they really seemed to go wild in there uh huh yeah yeah yeah they had a lot of fun in there and um there s uh there s some petting you know like uh uh i think it s Owens Country Farms has a free petting you know like a farm that you can go to and the kids can pet animals and stuff where s that that s on Plano Road um it s like in Richardson you go up Plano Road it s like a little bit past Campbell on Plano Road uh huh uh huh and that s a lot of fun they have tours going through there and oh yeah um the kids think that was a lot of fun too and oh that does sound like fun it s a little bit of a ways we take you know whenever we take them to Showbiz or they think it s wonderful just to go to McDonald s you know they don t go for the food they go for the to play around and oh that s right there s another place in Mesquite called Monkey Business uh huh and it s a indoor fun park and it has a bunch of different rides for kids that sounds fun too and parents get in free and it s like during the week it s like five dollars admission for child all day and and you said about about Plano and Campbell is the petting the petting farm yeah that sounds fun i think maybe we ll try to do that yeah yeah and the one in Mesquite is um Scyene exit uh huh and it it s uh the kids just had a wonderful time there they you know you just pay that admission and then all the the the rides are free you know they of course they have all the little video games and you know those little quarter rides you know to and stuff like that but they thought that was a lot of fun you can have birthday parties there and yeah i think that was better than like Showbiz Pizza because there s more for them to do because they can just do you don t have to have tokens for everything yeah yeah right so they had a lot of fun that does sound like fun well i ve gotten some good ideas from you yeah i we try to do a lot of things as a family and you know inexpensively as possible so definitely yeah well i think i don t know if we ve done five minutes but i m sure that ll be yeah that ll be good yeah well it s good talking to you be good was it good talking to you i had a good i really appreciate your suggestions oh no problem well take care bye bye okay bye bye
