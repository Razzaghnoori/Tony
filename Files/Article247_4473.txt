 Retooling the Sports Scene Hi Chris Had to laugh at that image you conjured up of Michael Jordan sitting in the Washington Wizards locker room by himself dressed and ready for practice long before anyone else on his newly purchased team showed up There s a bit of a geek factor there isn t there Something that s not usually associated with Jordan even though he always tells those stories about not being able to get a date in high school But I do hope that your characterization of Jordan as the wily veteran who takes a wrecking ball to today s 20 something multi millionaire What Me practice sports world is what happens But I wonder Magic Johnson didn t have that impact when he briefly tried coaching the Lakers a few years ago He found many of the players incorrigibly apathetic or self absorbed He quit in disgust Now he s playing in Sweden honest to God against whom I don t know The Flying IKEAs The Stockholm Saunas Who And what do they give away at halftime snow blowers And did you see yesterday that Dennis Rodman said he s interested in joining the Dallas Mavericks but quote his calendar is booked through this weekend Essentially Rodman would love to join the Mavericks but playing those pesky games just gets in the way Clearly the whole sports scene needs some retooling The tabloids here in New York have dubbed this Sunday s Super Bowl the Mayflower Bowl because both teams St Louis and Tennessee deserted their original homes Word just got out that Sebastian Janikowski the pudgy Polish born kicker at Florida State may be deported if he s convicted of trying to bribe police to get a friend released from jail Even the Olympics which we both consider the most wonderful stirring spectacular sports event there is was tainted by that payola scandal last year Remember Representatives from the host city wannabes were funneling payoffs and jobs to International Olympic Committee voters What astounded me most was the cheesy stuff the voters requested Lawn equipment A 524 violin A pair of AKC registered bulldogs or 673 worth of door knobs I m not making this up Arrangements were made for the pianist daughter of IOC vice president Kim Un Yong to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic when Berlin was seeking the 2000 Games Though described as only modestly talented Kim s daughter also performed with the Melbourne Symphony in 1990 when that city was chasing the Olympics and with the Utah Symphony in 95 The Utahans even paid her 5 000 Presumably to go away How many times can you hear Chopsticks Still the undisputed king of graft seems to have been Jean Claude Ganga an influential IOC member from the Republic of Congo who asked for medical treatment for himself and a free knee replacement for his mother in law His wife Eugenie received free cosmetic surgery Now seriously Chris if you had a bunch of well heeled businessmen ready to fulfill your every whim wouldn t you ask for something better than a titanium knee or a riding mower Whatever ever happened to craving a Porsche A speedboat A villa on the coast of Spain How about a Matisse I m ranting I know Perhaps this is just bitterness on my part When I read about Eugenie s cosmetic surgery I was stricken by a thought You mean IOC members can demand just about anything in exchange for their votes on an Olympic host city and I chose to be a sportswriter I ve settled for the Rangers pre game buffet all these years when I could ve had a free nose job instead What was I thinking Johnette
