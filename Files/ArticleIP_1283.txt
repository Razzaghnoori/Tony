out a record setting amount of money on opening weekend in this case 92 7 million Essentially a digital version of your basic primeval BOO flick says Jack Kroll in Newsweek Yet even the skeptics love the dinosaurs The Lost World is the very essence of a thrill ride shamelessly designed but there s some passion in the action a lilt to the chases a fluid lyricism in the way the beasts move across hapless humans who cross their paths Joe Morgenstern the Wall Street Journal See David Edelstein s review in Slate and The Lost World site Addicted to Love Warner Bros The critical consensus on this romantic comedy more sadism than laughs Director Griffin Dunne and actors Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick meant to turn the darker sides of voyeurism and revenge into lighthearted fare critics say they failed It gives us the impression that we re supposed to take drastic irrational revenge as a larky laff riot says the Los Angeles Times Kevin Thomas Pans also for the normally sunny Ryan miscast here as a leather clad bitch bent on punishing her ex The same way a Care Bear is a teeth baring grizzly Susan Wloszczyna USA Today The Addicted to Love site has a plot summary as well as stills and clips

he seemed in the 70s and 80s He is the keeper of the Beatles flame says the New York Times Bob Spitz and has handled megastardom with level headedness and acumen The new album which is rife with unabashed Fab Four nostalgia draws warm praise The old bloke sounds more inspired and well less goofy than he has in years Elysa Gardner the Los Angeles Times However a few critics call the songs more Wings than Beatles He has done some sucky stuff in his long and partially illustrious career but it has to be said that overall McCartney has never sounded less necessary Andy Gill the Independent See
