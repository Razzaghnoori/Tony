 Artless Heiress Integrity can be a drag in an actor as Jennifer Jason Leigh who plays Catherine Sloper the heroine of the new adaptation of Henry James Washington Square has so often and so vividly demonstrated When Leigh plays unpleasant characters as in Georgia 1995 and Kansas City 1996 she is as unpleasant as all get out When she played Dorothy Parker in Mrs Parker and the Vicious Circle 1994 she faithfully reproduced the writer s vocal cadences at the expense of such trifles as variety and intelligibility Her work can be unleavened by imagination Compare her turn as a government agent in Rush 1991 to Jodie Foster s the same year in The Silence of the Lambs Foster revealed her character s vulnerability by indirection by how hard the young woman labored to project strength Leigh chose to telegraph the vulnerability She was such a radiant mess that no superior in his right mind would have sent her undercover I interviewed Leigh for Vogue eight years ago before her acting went to hell I liked her as a person and admired her gutsiness her willingness to work without a net to throw herself headlong into a part even if it meant falling a great distance onto her face But a weird masochistic streak has emerged in her performances She now makes a fetish of falling on her face She might even want to be loved for falling on her face As Catherine James plain artless heiress to whom life has simultaneously dealt a very good and a very bad hand Leigh is so busy projecting her plainness and artlessness that she neglects for most of the film to pull the audience in Her Catherine has no center of gravity She doesn t walk when she can lurch weave or collide with objects her balance shifting precariously Her responses meanwhile are queerly private as if she were unsure of how to act out her own emotions All this is by design of course and in an era when You like me You really like me is the mantra of most actors that design can seem brave and original What isn t by design is the mass of neurotic actressy mannerisms which function like layer upon layer of wax buildup You can t see into Catherine s soul like water on wax your gaze beads In part this is the fault of the director Agnieszka Holland Like her star Holland has done everything right on paper In Washington Square the early 19 th century American trappings never smack of the sound stage and each scene is judiciously weighted Holland has expunged much of the melodrama that marked the war horse dramatization The Heiress made into a 1949 film with Olivia de Havilland directed by William Wyler and has even corrected a problem that irked James years after publication when he reread his early novel and declined to revise it for reprinting that Morris Townsend Catherine s fortune hunting suitor was too much of a one dimensional lout But The Heiress for all its un Jamesian blood and thunder remains the truer adaptation Holland s tone is detached to the point of having no discernible point of view She seems to have confused James irony with distance when in truth few authors in history have achieved such pitiless and devastating intimacy For the first two thirds of the film Holland barely even lingers on her heroine s features This remote objective Washington Square carries little wattage Under the novel s sometimes placid surface is a tug of war which Wyler made palpable but which Holland must think will dramatize itself One of James trademark innocents Catherine is acted upon by three titanic forces her father Dr Sloper Albert Finney whose express desire to protect a daughter he considers ugly and witless takes the form of ruthless repression her aunt Maggie Smith who wishes to weave out of her niece s life a breathlessly melodramatic romance and Morris Townsend Ben Chaplin the playboy who has squandered a modest inheritance and now seeks salvation in the form of this unloved unlovely and affluent young woman Each of these characters comes with the trappings of civilization and high society but it is the natural untutored Catherine who proves the superior if ultimately woebegone force Holland s one innovation is in her handling of Townsend The scene in which Dr Sloper pays a visit to the young suitor s sister to pry from her a confirmation of his suspicions about her brother s character no longer climaxes with the woman s expulsive warning to keep Catherine from marrying him There are still plenty of reasons to think Townsend would be a less than exemplary husband but fewer to think he d be a monstrous one Indeed Chaplin never signals the man s duplicity and one wonders if his Townsend has even fully admitted to himself that his motives are impure He might love Catherine for her money but at least he could love her whereas her father clearly could not The performance is complex shaded irreducible Jamesian And Chaplin makes a marvelous partner for Smith s vivaciously silly Mrs Penniman all shiny eyed with vicarious pleasure and perfumed by her own cheap romanticism You ll have to excuse me Mr Townsend she tells the lovers she s supposed to be chaperoning as she flits to the door I have the most fortuitous headache Finney plays Dr Sloper as a sour and grave man in whom all feeling has been deadened since his wife died giving birth to Catherine He is clearly the villain of the piece a man who deprives his daughter of happiness not simply because he believes Townsend intends to but because he feels that unhappiness is her due It might be however that his contempt is too much on the surface so that his bitterly conclusive outburst to his daughter on a mountaintop in Switzerland feels less than earthshaking There is so little intimacy between father and daughter that Catherine s life changing realization that Sloper despises her is old news Leigh does keep something up her sleeve however Upon hearing the contents of her father s sadistic will she lets out a musical laugh that is probably the purest note she has sounded on screen It was reported that Leigh s own father Vic Morrow inexplicably slighted her in his will and you can t hear that sound in Washington Square without knowing in your bones where it came from It s the sound of genuine catharsis of poison being expelled into the air of bottomless anguish and joyous liberation If Washington Square is underripe U Turn and Devil s Advocate are rotting The former is noir camp another acid and amphetamine soaked foray into Oliver Stone s America full of pixilated brutality and meaningless montage fractured zooms black and white scudding clouds close ups of carrion and stuffed mountain lions Like Nicolas Cage in the more sedate Red Rock West Sean Penn stumbles into a town of desert predators where women lull men leggily into the fires of hell not so much out of guile as instinct Stone doesn t have a political ax to grind this time out and he lets the actors make whoopie I don t know whom I adored more Billy Bob Thornton as a greasy hick with a whiff of Tales From the Crypt style demonism Nick Nolte as a skeletal gravel voiced albino who could be John Huston after a decade of being eaten by worms or Jon Voight as a blind half Indian whose portentous utterances are both full of crap and eerily abstruse I do know that I could see every plot turn dragging its limp maggoty carcass across the desert from miles away The only surprise about U Turn is the good reviews it got from people who should know better It is not a surprise either that Al Pacino chews the scenery in Devil s Advocate And the idea that if the devil showed up on Earth he d be running a New York corporate law firm is also to say the least pre chewed But there are scenery chewers and there are Michelin gourmet scenery chewers and Pacino has a three star feast Waxy lean and lupine in his black Zegna suits he sports what appear to be false front choppers and masticates his dumb satanic monologues with Shavian relish It seems you ve already departed Dr Sloper Finney and Catherine Sloper Leigh in Washington Square 63 seconds Are you insulting me Darrell Thornton and Bobby Cooper Penn in U Turn 75 seconds
