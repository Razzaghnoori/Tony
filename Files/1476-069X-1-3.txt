 Background The majority of studies of indoor environmental quality and health outcomes focus primarily on the office environment and sick building syndrome symptoms or rare illnesses such as hypersensitivity pneumonitis Very few studies have attempted to determine the effects of ventilation on short term sick leave absences caused by respiratory infections Several studies have however made links between ventilation and respiratory illness 1 2 3 4 Two of these studies were conducted in military settings In a study at Army training centers Brundage and colleagues detected significantly higher rates of febrile respiratory illness among building occupants housed in modern barracks with low outdoor air ventilation rates as compared to soldiers housed in older barracks with higher ventilation rates 2 In a study conducted during the Gulf War Richards and his colleagues concluded that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in troops housed in air conditioned barracks when compared to those that were housed in non air conditioned barracks open warehouses or tents 3 In a hospital based study an outbreak of varicella virus was explained by airflow studies which demonstrated the spread of airborne virus from an infected patient housed in an isolation room to 15 other patients 1 In a study conducted during a pneumococcal disease epidemic in a crowded jail it was shown that attack rates were 95 higher in cells with the lowest volume of air supply per person 4 Two studies have suggested a relationship between respiratory infections and office environments In a study first published in 1960 Gwaltney and his colleagues conducted an extensive study at a large insurance company Their results suggested that working adults were responsible for introducing 32 of the colds their families contracted 5 6 7 More recently a study of Finnish office workers suggested that workers who share offices are at increased risk of colds although this study failed to conclude if the infections were transmitted as airborne infections or were transmitted by either large droplets or direct contact 8 An underutilized method of evaluating building occupant health which is particularly useful in office settings is sick leave data Sick leave data has been used for a variety of purposes such as to evaluate health promotion programs 9 10 and to assess the efficacy of influenza vaccination 11 In general a large fraction of sick leave is caused by respiratory illness 11 12 13 In a study conducted by Nichol et al upper respiratory infections accounted for approximately 65 of sick leave days among working adults 11 In a study of military aircrews respiratory infections accounted for 70 of the total number of days the crews were grounded 12 In a study conducted on government employees in the United Kingdom respiratory infections and gastroenteritis accounted for over half of all absences 13 Milton et al 14 used sick leave data to identify an association between outdoor air supply levels and sick leave among office workers The results indicated that lower levels of outdoor air supply in office buildings were associated with increased sick leave This association was seen in both crude analyses of annual total absence and in an analysis of short term absences This association between ventilation and absences occurred at ventilation levels that have not often been associated with non specific symptoms or with building related complaints 14 Because of this the authors speculated that the observed association between indoor carbon dioxide CO 2 levels and sick leave might have been due to the increased spread of respiratory illness from either airborne spread of infection or increased susceptibility 15 To determine whether a causal association could be confirmed we conducted an experimental intervention study of indoor CO 2 levels used as a surrogate for the concentration of viable airborne microorganisms capable of causing a respiratory infection and sick leave among hourly office workers at Polaroid Corporation Methods Study design We conducted a blinded experimental intervention study to determine the effect indoor CO 2 concentrations on sick leave absences among hourly office workers in selected areas of two office buildings To increase the range of CO 2 concentrations the outdoor air supply dampers were adjusted to fixed positions that alternately reduced or increased the outdoor air supply We attempted to increase the outdoor air supply only during periods in which the economizer function of the heating ventilation and air conditioning HVAC units would generally decrease the amount of outdoor air such as during the heating and cooling seasons of summer and winter In general we tried to obtain CO 2 concentrations in the range of 100 250 ppm above background levels during high ventilation intervention cycles and 350 500 ppm above background in low ventilation intervention cycles All CO 2 concentrations were less than the American Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers ASHRAE guidelines Each intervention cycle lasted approximately three months The study design was reviewed and approved by the Harvard School of Public Health Human Subjects Committee Office buildings and study population The office buildings used for the study were owned and occupied by Polaroid Corporation All were located in suburban Boston Massachusetts were open plan offices with cubicles and were mechanically ventilated without humidification Building 1 was ventilated with a variable air volume system while Building 2 had a constant air volume system The variable air volume system in Building 1 was overridden during the study thereby effectively running the system as a constant air volume system The study buildings had a high outside air ventilation capacity either by design or because they were remodeled from manufacturing spaces Building 1 was studied from November 1999 to June 2001 and Building 2 was studied from November 2000 to June 2001 Two other buildings were studied but eventually proved unsuitable Building 3 was withdrawn because few of the occupants were hourly workers and other means of acquiring accurate attendance data proved to be inadequate Building was 4 dropped because outdoor air supply rates could not be adequately controlled To determine the number of occupants in the buildings headcounts were taken either at 10 a m or 2 p m on randomly selected days throughout the study Table 1describes specific information regarding the study buildings and study population Ventilation and CO 2measurements To alter the levels of fresh air entering the buildings the dampers on the air intakes were locked into fixed positions at each cycle of the intervention To determine the air changes per hour in the buildings we conducted tracer gas tests periodically Sulfur hexafluoride SF 6 was used to generate a tracer gas decay curve We injected SF 6 into the fresh air plenum followed by measurements in work areas and in the main return air duct with photoacoustic gas monitors Bruel Kjaer Naerum Denmark with a SF 6 filter Model 1302 Carbon dioxide concentrations in the study areas were measured once every 10 min with Vaisala monitors model GMD20 Woburn Massachusetts attached to data loggers HOBO H08 004 02 Onset Computer Corp Bourne MA We calibrated each monitor with three known CO 2 concentrations covering the range of 0 1000 ppm at least once per intervention cycle We placed at least two centrally located monitors in each study area approximately 1 1 2 m above the floor In addition we located monitors out of doors on the roofs of study buildings Our primary exposure measure was the CO 2 concentration above background in each building This CO 2 differential is used as a marker for the amount of air that has been previously breathed by building occupants Rebreathed air potentially contains respiratory pathogens from infectious occupants To determine the differential we first averaged the workday 9 a m to 5 p m CO 2 concentration and subtracted the average CO 2 concentration 1 a m 3 a m measured on the same date by the same monitor The 1 a m 3 a m concentration measured by the same monitor was used rather than the outdoor CO 2 concentration because the CO 2 monitors tend to exhibit baseline drift The average CO 2 differential for the day was computed as the average across all monitors in the study area We then averaged the daily CO 2 differentials to compute a weekly average CO 2 concentration differential Bioaerosol and particulate sampling We sampled for airborne endotoxin and particulate in each building during each intervention cycle Samples were collected on 37 mm diameter 0 4 m pore diameter polycarbonate membrane filters Whatman Nucleopore Filtration Products Clifton New Jersey in closed face polystyrene cassettes Millipore Bedford Massachusetts at 4 liters per minute l min using sampling pumps in acoustic foam insulated boxes We extracted the filters in phosphate triethylamine buffer pH 7 5 and assayed the filter extracts for endotoxin levels using the kinetic limulus assay with resistant parallel line estimation KLARE method 16 17 Endotoxin levels are reported as endotoxin units per cubic meter of air EU m 3 Particulate samples were collected with Harvard Impactors 18 on 41 mm diameter 2 0 m Teflo filters Pall Gelman Ann Arbor Michigan at 4 l min Both endotoxin and PM 2 5 samples were collected for three consecutive days during working hours 9 a m to 5 p m from the breathing zone of seated building occupants in the same location during each sampling period Sampling took place over two weeks In addition we inspected each building for possible bioaerosol sources prior to its entry into the study and again periodically throughout the study We conducted a thorough building walk through looking at the building exterior and surroundings air intakes HVAC system mechanical rooms occupied space storage areas and any other areas which might contain bioaerosol reservoirs Special attention was given to air handling units and any other areas where excessive moisture is likely to accumulate Attendance data Hourly attendance and demographic data for the study were collected using corporate databases The Information Technology Department provided attendance data from the payroll records for hourly employees Workers in the hourly payroll system completed weekly time cards that contained information on hours worked and time claimed for various leave categories including sick time vacation and personal leave Demographic data was provided from the Human Resources Department all employees database Available demographic variables included employee ID number seniority information start termination retirement dates etc race gender age disability and various job and departmental classifications Final analytic data sets were produced with one record per week per hourly employee with demographic data appended to each record Data analysis We analyzed the relationship between CO 2 exposure in the previous week and absence in the current week using a generalized additive mixed model 19 with a logit link A model employing continuous exposure was chosen a priori over a simple model categorizing intervention intervals as high and low outdoor air supply because a continuous model with appropriate lags does not require elimination of data from wash out periods at the start of each interval and allows for differences between successive high or low interventions The model used extends multiple logistic regression with an estimated over dispersion parameter in two ways 20 First it allows the relationship between the covariates and input to the logit link to follow a smooth not necessarily linear curve The specific shape of the curve is modeled with a spline a flexible model that essentially allows the data to determine the shape of the relationship This feature of the model is necessary in our study since there is a markedly nonlinear relationship between CO 2 exposure and the logit of absence probability The second way this model extends multiple logistic regression is that it accounts for the correlation within the repeated measures on individuals using individual specific random effects 21 As discussed in Ruppert et al 22 we estimate the parameters in this model using the pseudo likelihood method implemented by the SAS macro GLIMMIX 23 Results A total of 294 hourly workers whose characteristics are shown in Table 2 worked in the two buildings and were included in the final analysis Although each study area had both salaried and hourly employees only hourly employees were considered in the data analysis because of the accuracy of records of their attendance data and because they spend the majority of their work hours in their assigned offices The hourly workforce was very transient which accounts for the large number of study subjects compared to the average number of occupants in the buildings The majority of the study subjects did not reside in the study buildings for the entire study period The study included a total of approximately 49804 scheduled workdays and a total of 4405 6 hours of sick leave The CO 2 data over the course of the study is summarized in Table 3 Outdoor CO 2 measurements confirmed that the indoor CO 2 concentrations returned to outdoor background concentrations each evening The average weekly outdoor CO 2 concentration for Building 1 was 417 ppm Range 324 497 ppm and 450 ppm Range 327 549 ppm for Building 2 Figure 1displays the weekly CO 2 concentration differential and the weekly sick leave rates for the two buildings included in the final analysis Data gaps in Figure 1represent time periods when CO 2 data was unavailable or HVAC dampers were being reset The average CO 2 differential air exchange rate and sick leave rates for each intervention cycle are displayed in Table 4 The CO 2 differential is well correlated with the outdoor ventilation rates indicating that CO 2 differential is an adequate surrogate of outdoor ventilation rates We were unable to achieve the desired CO 2 differentials of 350 500 ppm during low ventilation periods Although we attempted to alter the CO 2 concentrations by locking the outdoor air dampers to fixed positions in some cases the dampers did not remain in position This resulted in less control over the air supply rates than we had hoped Additionally during December 2000 the chiller unit in Building 1 was turned off and as a result the outdoor dampers were set to open automatically when the outdoor temperature was over 0 C The loss of control over the damper settings resulted in uncontrolled rates of outdoor air supply in Building 1 after December 2000 The measured air exchange rates Table 4 support this conclusion During the first two high ventilation cycles in Building 1 the air exchange rates were measured at above 2 per hour while during the first low ventilation cycle the outdoor air supply was measured at less than 1 air change per hour ACH After the dampers were adjusted in December 2000 the ACH and CO 2 differentials were uncorrelated with the desired intervention throughout the remainder of the study Although we were able to manipulate the HVAC system in Building 2 it appears that we were never able to alter the CO 2 concentrations in the building To determine if the number of occupants was driving the levels of CO 2 in the buildings random headcounts were taken throughout the study to approximate the total population of the buildings The number of occupants was weakly correlated with the average CO 2 differential from same day in each building Building 1 r 0 08 Building 2 r 0 2 Air sampling for endotoxin and PM 2 5 was conducted on four occasions in Building 1 and once in Building 2 Table 5 the levels were well below those thought to be associated with symptoms Samples were collected only once in Building 2 because we were unable to alter the CO 2 concentrations and therefore we considered the entire time period that Building 2 was under study as one cycle Generalized additive mixed models with logit links were fit for the individual buildings We modeled the probability of an occupant having any absences during a week dependent on the CO 2 differential from the previous week one week lag Models with no lag and two week lags were also fit CO 2 differential was modeled as a continuous predictor because merely comparing the intervention periods would not have allowed for differences between intervals assigned to the high ventilation condition and similarly each low ventilation interval Poisson models were also constructed with days of absence during the week as the dependent variable The Poisson models gave fits similar to those obtained from the logistic models Final models contained covariates for gender race age and individual random effects which allow for correlation of absence rates within individuals Table 6 A smooth term for time was included to control for unexplained trends in absence and the seasonality of absence When the smooth term for time was not included the shape of the curves did not change considerably although the pointwise standard errors around the estimated curve increased substantially Age which was modeled as a continuous variable was not significant in the models while gender was significant in the Building 1 model and race was significant in the Building 2 model We did not observe a consistent association between CO 2 differential and absence at the levels of CO 2 under study Figure 2 In general portions of the fitted smooth curves are significantly different from zero if the curve and the confidence interval curves are all above or below zero When data from the two buildings were combined no association was observed between CO 2 concentrations above background and sick leave Discussion In this intervention study of sick leave absences among hourly employees at Polaroid Corporation offices in suburban Boston Massachusetts we did not find a consistent positive relationship between indoor CO 2 concentrations and sick leave This result is in contrast to the results of our earlier observational study at Polaroid which found a significant association of outdoor air supply rates and sick leave 15 In the earlier study we used a larger number of work areas 115 including areas with lower ventilation and higher CO 2 concentrations than were available for this intervention study However the previous study relied on a small number of CO 2 measurements and primarily used expert judgment of an industrial hygienist blinded to absence rates to assign outdoor air supply rates to buildings Thus the intervention study was undertaken to confirm and extend the earlier findings In the earlier study estimated outdoor air supply rates ranged from 12 24 liters per second l s per person In the current study we can calculate the outdoor air supply rates if we assume a steady state CO 2 concentration in the study buildings although this assumption is questionable Using the steady state equation relating CO 2 levels and outdoor air supply rates we calculate outdoor air supply rates that are nearly double that of the previous study with the average daily outdoor supply rate of approximately 45 l s per person for Building 1 and approximately 40 l s per person for Building 2 as estimated from average CO 2 concentrations We attempted to control indoor CO 2 concentrations by adjusting the supply of outside air supply but the buildings available for the intervention study had an excess of ventilation capacity relative to the volume of office space and number of office workers While these characteristics were advantageous for obtaining low CO 2 concentrations relative to background it was difficult to increase the concentrations of CO 2 substantially above background ASHRAE standards allow for up to 700 ppm CO 2 above background in office buildings 24 while the maximum CO 2 concentration above background in our buildings was 312 ppm the average was less than half that This study showed that at high outdoor air supply rates sufficient to give weekly average indoor CO 2 concentrations in the range of 50 to 200 ppm above background sick leave is not associated with outdoor air supply rates However this study does not address the question of whether outdoor air supply rates resulting in CO 2 concentrations between 200 and 700 ppm above background can be experimentally shown to drive changes in sick leave rates as suggested by observational data While this result is of interest to large highly ventilated corporate offices it cannot be extrapolated to buildings with lower rates of outdoor air supply Abbreviations ACH Air changes per hour ASHRAE American Society of
