 Unforgiven What the agony of Jesus on the cross is to Christians the Holocaust is to Jews Except that the massacre of millions whose only crime was to be born Jewish has no transcendent meaning no sacred closure To theologize the Holocaust is meaningless even to the super Orthodox who accept everything as God s will To secular skeptical Jews the horror is still just another episode though the worst in the unending suspicion and hatred of the Jews What some piously accept and others try to explain is to Aharon Appelfeld a central event in many people s lives that has become a metaphor for our century There cannot be an end to speaking and writing about it Appelfeld a survivor from Czernowitz in Austrian Galicia whose first language was German now lives in Jerusalem and writes in Hebrew He is the most telling novelist of the Holocaust for he has no need to describe it directly He has put his own suffering as a boy he saw a Nazi kill his mother into short narratives of self absorbed Jewish life before the war that are so ominously toneless artfully simple and repetitious deceptively compressed in feeling that the reader aware of the horror about to descend on these people feels like screaming but knows he will not be heard The best known of these narratives are Badenheim 1939 1980 and To the Land of the Cattails 1986 In The Iron Tracks Appelfeld has reversed his usual strategy The war ended long ago but for Erwin Siegelbaum who at 15 saw the Nazi officer Nachtigel murder his parents the war has never ended For 40 years he has been living on trains that remind him of the train on which he was once deported His purpose is to find Nachtigel and kill him This is mad but it signifies the depth at which the Holocaust can enter a Jew s soul Since the end of the war I have been on this line as they say a long twisted line stretching from Naples to the cold north a line of locals trams taxis and carriages The seasons shift before my eyes like an illusion I have learned this route with my body Now I know every hostel and every inn every restaurant and buffet the vehicles that bring you to the remotest corners Boarding still another train he gets a sort of constant renewal One can live on trains The officials now know him so well that they drop the loud jangling popular music he detests on the loudspeaker and put on chamber music Shaving on a train gives him a new start in life There is one station where he is met by a regular driver now a sort of friend There are two stations on his route for which he has love stations he can return to knowing he will be able to refresh himself with a solid meal and a cup of really good coffee But for the most part I live by signs by codes whose meaning I alone know There was even a terrible moment when he spent two weeks in bed because it seemed to me that a new war had started I confess I have no faith in anyone outside the train He is so frozen inside that he remains completely detached from the occasional woman on board who attracts him There is nothing like love on a train Sometimes it lasts only a station or two The main thing is that you ll never see the woman again Of course sometimes you get entangled and you suddenly have aside from your valise a sluggish creature who keeps demanding coffee and cigarettes Thus I repeat to myself love for two stations and no more In his apathy he remembers the farce lived by Jewish orators and organizers such as his Communist parents They were always moving about depriving him of a proper home and always resolute They could not take in the fact that their comrades disliked them for being Jews My memory is my downfall It is a sealed well that doesn t lose a drop to use an old expression Nothing can deplete it My memory is a powerful machine that stores and constantly discharges lost years and faces In the past I believed that travel would blunt my memory I was wrong Over the years I must admit it has only grown stronger Were it not for my memory my life would be different better I assume My memory fills me up until I choke on a stream of daydreams But in recent years I have learned to overcome this A glass of cognac for instance separates me from my memory for a while Where does he find the funds for this endless life on trains This is one of the subtlest issues in the book He lives by buying up old ceremonial objects retrieved from synagogues nearly destroyed by the Nazis And in this merchandising of the once sacred there is no relief for him no peace He has competitors also searching for these objects and what is more they too are looking for Nachtigel in order to avenge themselves The peasants and army veterans Siegelbaum encounters think favorably of the war An innkeeper who lost his hearing at Stalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaum s saying Hitler deceived the world Not true he replied without hesitation Why Hitler wanted to destroy the Jews and indeed he destroyed them he explained When I didn t answer he added in big letters It was a great mission and it succeeded But they still exist I couldn t refrain from writing to him A mistake he didn t hesitate to reply Siegelbaum wants to kill the man for revealing his hidden desire I ought to have killed him There is nothing simpler than killing a man and yet for some reason I cannot do it Eventually he does locate Nachtigel and after some false pleasantries he shoots him The event leaves him pretty much as he was before The Jewish need to find an answer to the Holocaust is not forthcoming It would have to be as monumental and world shattering as the terror itself In the face of prosperous postwar Germany retribution is a joke When Siegelbaum finally cries out Why can t I pray he cannot find an answer within himself His melancholy is a well known Jewish disease The Communist leaders he knew even spoke grandly of a war against melancholy Its real name is despair that central human emotion in the face of overwhelming odds of which tragedy is made There are no accommodating solutions after the fact There is no forgiveness for so much pain and no one to reconcile with But a story as piercing as this goes to the heart of the matter for it embodies the terrible event in such a way that it steals up on us and will haunt us in our sleep
