                um i kept a monthly budget for so long i dont have one now but i sort of know where it is i know where my expenses are and how much i have to cover them how about you     well i dont have anything um a budget written down per se but however i i know exactly where my money goes for the most part as far as expenses yes umhum   uhhuh yeah do you do   oh yeah i think in this day and time we need something like that dont we   yes i keep hearing that were supposed to pay ourselves first and set aside our savings first are you are you able to do that   umhum   that helps doesnt it   yes it does   back when we were im i take it you may be past raising a family is that true   yes   that back in those other days we couldnt do that could we   no other things came took priority     like doctor bills and things like that   umhum thats for sure   yeah um are you planning ahead for retirement through your your uh savings and things   yes you know thats interesting because i was talking at someone in the office just this morning about the retirement and what we would like to have when we retire and how were going to get there   yes   its really hard to anticipate in advance what you think youre going to need okay and then try and plan now   umhum   because things come up   umhum   but i think now were at the age where its really very important   well one of the things that my husband has he he works with financial things and uh hes been trying to   you know   he keeps saying well we need to sit and find out how much we want and and i think thats true but like you said its hard to do   umhum   one of the things that weve done towards that is um buy nursing home insurance have you all thought of that   oh no i hadnt even thought about that we have investments to uh alleviate some of the cost of our old age hopefully in in terms of uh an apartment complex   umhum umhum   weve been partnership with uh some other people   oh thats sounds that sounds good   but its not going to provide a whole bunch of money i mean it it might might pay the utilities   umhum umhum   you know at at that point in time uh and hopefully our investments with TI will help our retirement our retirement years   well the uh if you have the retirement fund at place like that theyre usually fairly good   umhum   i know mine im weve gone through some mergers and my retirement has has ended uh the plan has ended three different times this year   is that right   so   thats not very encouraging is it   uh no because uh of the changes that came about in the government requirements and then in uh in merger requirements   umhum   but um my husband was looking into the nursing home insurance is its its really is an investment you hope you never have you use but uh you have to be so careful of what it will pay and what it wont pay   when you buy something like that in advance how can you be sure that well i guess you dont really buy into the nursing home do you   oh no no its an insurance policy   you buy its a policy that will pay for your nursing home should you need it   umhum it pays a set amount     hum   and uh and you talk to your insurance agent about theres special companies now that are doing it   umhum   and they set them up i know ours is a set amount each year and it has a maximum amount over a thirty month period and uh it you know it has you need to read the policy and look into what it covers   umhum   i guess im conscious of that because my mothers in a nursing home       and uh i think we we learn from our experiences   oh i think thats very true and that brings it more to home when it happens close to home   yeah it does   umhum   but uh i think one of the main things that we in the past always talked about was not having any major expenses to budget for when we do retire   umhum and if you got that covered i want to travel personally and i want to be able to get around   oh yes oh yes   dont we all right   at least two three trips including a cruise every year   at least   at least   at least     you know   well it sounds like we have some good plans anyway   it would sounds like we do   umhum   and uh youre youre leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then   right i dont know how sound that is perhaps your way is is a is a more sound proposition you know   well we do that too you know you cant then the insurance policies are just things to kind of buffer in case of unexpected things   umhum umhum and that will always happen   oh yes but uh the investments are something that you have to plan for and get your there was some new things
