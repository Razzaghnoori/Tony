Executioners his review of my A Nation on Trial hereafter ANOT Adam Shatz suggests that I am a mirror image of Daniel Goldhagen My essay is equally biased and inflammatory he writes and whereas Goldhagen delivered a fierce attack on the Germans my own essay is effectively an apologia for them Before turning to Shatz s specific criticisms I want to remind readers of the approach I adopted in my analysis of Goldhagen s book Throughout I simply juxtapose Goldhagen s claims against the sources he cites or compare his claims to the standard mainstream scholarly findings Until Shatz s review no one disputed my account of the scholarly record Indeed his vehement criticisms of my essay notwithstanding Goldhagen himself does not accuse me of misrepresenting current scholarly wisdom Thus Shatz s altogether novel critique merits close scrutiny Shatz reports that Finkelstein acknowledges the Nazi state was a brutal dictatorship but he glosses over its disturbingly popular character What can Shatz possibly mean Goldhagen claims that the Nazi regime was on the whole consensual and that Germans generally accepted the system and Hitler s authority as desirable and legitimate I report that according to Goldhagen s own main authority Robert Gellately fear was prevalent among the German people and that to pretend otherwise is foolish ANOT 37 Clearly the principal question however is how central was anti Semitism to what Shatz calls the disturbingly popular character of the Nazi state I quote this typical passage from Goldhagen s main source Ian Kershaw Anti Semitism despite its pivotal place in Hitler s world view was of only secondary importance in cementing the bonds between Fuhrer and people which provided the Third Reich with its popular legitimation and basis of plebiscitary acclamation At the same time the principle of excluding the Jews from German society was itself widely and increasingly popular and Hitler s hatred of the Jews baleful in its threats but linked to the condoning of lawful rational action not the unpopular crude violence and brutality of the Party s gutter elements was certainly an acceptable component of his popular image even if it was an element taken on board rather than forming a centrally motivating factor for most Germans I add that according to Kershaw during the 1930s when his popularity was soaring to dizzy heights Hitler was extremely careful to avoid public association with the generally unpopular pogrom type anti Semitic outrages ANOT 31 Shatz is surely within his right to question these findings But he ought to have directed his ire not at me but at the leading authorities on the subject Gellately who was just appointed to the Holocaust chair at Clark University and Kershaw author of the forthcoming two volume biography of Hitler Shatz alleges that anti Semitism permeated Nazi ideology and Finkelstein is deaf to its nuances Thus he proposes that anti Semitism was crucial to Hitler s rise to power Citing a raft of scholarly studies I report the consensus that anti Semitism did not figure centrally in Hitler s electoral successes in 1930 and thereafter ANOT 31 2 I also note the scholarly consensus that beginning in the 1930s to quote Saul Friedlander in his authoritative study Nazi Germany and the Jews the Jewish theme did become less frequent in Hitler s rhetoric Finally I report that a careful review of Max Domarus standard collection of Hitler s public pronouncements and speeches shows that during these years the main negative theme was anti Marxism and anti Social Democracy ANOT 29 32 Shatz seems to believe that he has scooped all the experts in the field with his clever insight that the Nazis perceived Social Democracy as a Jewish party and Marxism as a Jewish creed The scholarly question however is why did Hitler tone down the explicitly Jewish theme if not because it didn t resonate well with the German public Shatz doesn t answer this question indeed he can t even comprehend it To Goldhagen s credit he never gainsays this commonplace of the scholarly literature Unlike Shatz he is familiar enough with the discipline to know that it would be preposterous to do so According to Shatz Finkelstein deduces from some Germans disgust at the destruction of Jewish lives and property during Nazi sponsored pogroms such as Kristallnacht that Germans overwhelmingly condemned the Nazi anti Semitic atrocities If they did they gave new meaning to the term silent majority Of all Shatz s distortions this is the most outrageous Where does he get his reading of Kristallnacht Here s where mine comes from In assessing the popular German reaction to Nazi violence generally and Kristallnacht in particular I quoted Goldhagen s authoritative scholarly source Israeli historian David Bankier as well as Kershaw During the first years of Nazi anti Semitic incitement says Bankier most Germans large sectors the bulk sizable parts found the form of persecution abhorrent expressed misgivings about the brutal methods employed remained on the sidelines severely condemned the persecution etc With the revival of Nazi anti Semitic terror in 1935 large sections of the population were repelled by the Sturmer methods and refused to comply with demands to take action against the Jews Indeed the vast majority of the population approved the Nuremberg laws not only because they identified with the racialist policy but especially because a permanent framework of discrimination had been created that would end the reign of terror and set precise limits to antisemitic activities Sturmer methods and the violence in the years 1936 37 met with the same disapproval as in the past The overwhelming majority approved social segregation and economic destruction of the Jews on the eve of Kristallnacht in 1938 but not the outbursts of brute force I t was not Jew hatred in the Nazi sense All sections of the population Bankier further reports reacted with shock to Kristallnacht There were few occasions if any in the Third Reich Kershaw similarly recalls which produced such a widespread wave of revulsion reaching deep into the ranks of the Nazi party itself The motives behind these outpourings of popular disgust to be sure were not unalloyed Some Germans evinced moral outrage Some recoiled from the sheer brutality of the violence which also defaced Germany s image Some opposed the destruction only because it squandered material resources ANOT 44 The opinions Shatz ascribes to me are simply the scholarly consensus Significantly he adduces not a jot of counterevidence for his novel claim that only some Germans opposed Kristallnacht Alas there is none Shatz also violently dissents from the scholarly consensus on civilian German attitudes toward Jews during World War II Yet again however he cites precisely zero evidence to support his objections To sustain his claim that my essay is effectively an apologia Shatz substitutes appeals to popular prejudice for scholarship Shatz calls me Goldhagen s doppelganger It would seem that this honorific more properly belongs to him Norman G Finkelstein Brooklyn N Y Adam Shatz replies In his reply Norman Finkelstein s modus operandi is to cite authority and where he cannot hide behind authority he distorts the points I made in my review He insinuates that I m a friend of Daniel Goldhagen even though I made my hostility to Goldhagen s views amply clear elsewhere in the review But Finkelstein s attempt to tar me with the brush of Goldhagenism is telling To Finkelstein anyone who views German anti Semitism as in any way significant to the history of National Socialism is an accomplice of Goldhagen 1 Nowhere in my review do I argue that anti Semitism was crucial to Hitler s rise to power Rather I argue that it cannot be blithely discounted as is Finkelstein s wont In wooing German voters the Nazis did tone down their anti Semitism emphasizing instead their nationalist and anti Bolshevik credentials But unlike Finkelstein I see a change in degree not in kind Anti Semitism remained a constant theme of Nazi ideology which associated Jews with the ills of modern capitalism internationalism socialism and the Versailles Treaty While it s true that Germans were often alienated by violent expressions of anti Semitism enough of them were willing to look past Nazi rhetoric about the Jewish problem to make the Nazis Germany s most significant mass party As Ian Kershaw writes in the passage cited by Finkelstein anti Semitism was an acceptable component of Hitler s popular image In recent years a similar development has occurred in France where Jean Marie Le Pen of the National Front has softened his anti Arab racism in order to attract more votes Employing Finkelstein s logic one would have to argue racism hasn t really figured in Le Pen s surge in popularity But it s a distinction without a difference more and more voters are backing a party known for its racist program It s a wonder that Finkelstein doesn t see how damning this is But then Finkelstein finds reassurance in Goldhagen s observation that 19 of 51 anti Semitic ideologues advocated the annihilation of the Jews One would perhaps also want to note that an overwhelming majority did not Finkelstein writes 2 Finkelstein s interpretation of Kristallnacht is not simply the scholarly consensus While evoking German outrage at such state sponsored pogroms the historians David Bankier and Kershaw do not conclude that the Germans overwhelmingly condemned the Nazi anti Semitic atrocities Where does Finkelstein find evidence of such condemnation Were there such protests as later surrounded the euthanasia programs for the retarded Were Germans moved to speak out against the popular legal restrictions on Jewish rights In a study much cited by Finkelstein Hitler Germans and the Jewish Question historian Sarah Gordon writes that Most Germans were apathetic to the persecution of the Jews and no study past or future can ever change that fact One does not have to accept Goldhagen s views to see that the Germans disgust at Kristallnacht seldom resulted in action on behalf of their Jewish neighbors 3 Finally does Finkelstein suppose that a brutal dictatorship cannot also be a popular one As most historians have recognized Hitler s triumphs in foreign policy and the economy earned him the admiration of many if not most Germans If the Nazi state had rested only on coercion it s doubtful that Hitler could have persuaded millions of Germans to remain loyal to him and to fight heroically to the end of the war As Kershaw writes in the passage quoted by Finkelstein the Nazi state enjoyed a certain popular legitimation and basis of plebiscitary acclamation Although anti Semitism was less significant than nationalism and anti Bolshevism to the Nazis mass appeal Hitler and his peers were able to execute the Final Solution because they could count on the allegiance and sometimes even the love of the German people To be sure Goldhagen s vision of a consensual dictatorship glosses over the repression of the labor movement the killing and imprisonment of Hitler s opponents But Finkelstein s view of a Nazi terror state forcing its programs on a helpless people is equally one sided The Nazis were homegrown populists even if their wish to murder Jews was not widely shared by Germans and the Germans must in turn bear some of the responsibility for the horrors the Nazis inflicted Editor s note Goldhagen s Willing Executioners incorrectly stated that the Canadian Jewish Congress is trying to have Ruth Bettina Birn co author of A Nation on Trial The Goldhagen Thesis and Historical Truth removed from her job at the war crimes division at the Canadian Department of Justice The Canadian Jewish Congress did contact the department with its concerns about Birn s involvement in the book But the CJC has lodged no formal complaint against Birn Gross Monica Product In Monica and Me Herbert Stein wrote I wonder if the work of these photographers watching for Monica Lewinsky is in the GDP Of course it wouldn t be They are an input The output will be a shot on television of Monica and the value of that will be in the GDP No Mr Stein The shot on television of Monica Lewinsky will not be in the GDP at least it will not be in the GDP if the shot is on network television You see no one pays for network television No one spends money to see Lewinsky coming out of the Watergate Instead businesses spend money to show commercials on network television The picture of Lewinsky is just an input into the provision of advertising services that corporations are willing to pay for But wait Advertising services are not an output but an input Businesses pay for advertising services as a way of moving their products Advertising services are an input to the cost of production of whatever is being advertised The photographer s work will make it into the GDP only when someone buys a bottle of Tylenol or a Buick or whatever is advertised on the news show in which the picture of Lewinsky is shown Brad DeLong Herbert Stein replies Professor DeLong is right and I thank him for the correction I also thank him for leaving me a tiny out in those cases where Monica is seen on cable Not Hip to Skip Thanks for your article on Henry Louis Gates
