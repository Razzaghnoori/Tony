 Rap Victoriana What hip hop and parlor music have in common By Mark Steyn 1242 words posted Monday July 1 to be composted Monday July 8 Just over a century ago at 207 Grand Avenue Milwaukee a cocky teen ager hung a shingle outside his door Begin block quote here CHARLES K HARRIS BANJOIST AND SONGWRITER SONGS WRITTEN TO ORDER End block quote here And with those four stigmatic words the music business was born There d been music before but with Harris it s the business that impresses His first effort was the prototype pop hit After The Ball which 104 years later you can still hear every night of the week in the current Broadway revival of Show Boat Back then it began earning him 25 000 per week almost immediately and went on to sell 5 million copies of sheet music This was 1892 remember when 25 000 bucks was still 25 000 bucks and you didn t have to split it with accountants managers coke dealers and any traumatized ex catamite whose father has a smart lawyer We ve come a long way since then ragtime and radio hillbilly and race records big bands and showtoons 45s and triple concept albums MTV and CDs and horror core You re not hep to horror core Let Ronin Ro whose book Gangsta comes out next month explain Horror core he writes was to hip hop what death metal is to Brahms or Mozart To be honest I think Ro is indulging in a little rhetorical exaggeration here I suspect horror core is a lot closer to hip hop than death metal is to Brahms or Mozart Come to think of it Brahms isn t that close to Mozart But pop music has always had a hazy grasp of perspective As David Bowie said on the 1977 Bing Crosby Christmas Show when the host asked him if he liked any of the older songs Oh sure I love Harry Nilsson But even rappers are getting into the nostalgia act these days They re on the new West Side Story recording where Salt N Pepa Def Jef and others do Gee Officer Krupke and between choruses add their own machine gun interpolations beginning with BLOCK QUOTE SINGLE SPACE THE ITALICIZED LINES THAT FOLLOW Music by Bernstein Lyrics by Sondheim I m talkin bout West Side Story it s before my time So don t criticize the way that I party This ain t Broadway we learned it the hard way NOTE WE RE SENDING YOU THE CD OF THIS WE SHOULD PUT IN AN AUDIO LINK HERE END BLOCK QUOTE HERE It s a cute joke but the cockiness and special pleading remind us how things have changed In 1957 the Sharks and Jets cool was parodic and laughable in the 96 version these gangs are cool for real Their braggadocio is a clich even in Britain where according to record industry statistics Doris Day reissues outsell all American rap You remember the old Weber and Fields joke BLOCK QUOTE SINGLE SPACE THE LINES THAT FOLLOW Who was that lady I saw you with last night That was no lady that was my wife END BLOCK QUOTE HERE The British magazine Private Eye updated it for two gangsta rappers BLOCK QUOTE SINGLE SPACE THE LINES THAT FOLLOW Who was that ho I saw you with last night That was no ho that was my bitch END BLOCK QUOTE HERE Which reworking of the protean vaudeville gag prompts a thought Maybe after a century s rise and fall rap is the final ebbing of commercial pop back to its 1890s origins Even as William Bennett and the National Political Congress of Black Women renew their assault on companies that profit from gangsta rap and claim that it marks a shameful new low in American pop culture and even as its defenders assert as Chuck D does that it s a counter CNN for the disenfranchised gangsta rap is merely the wheel coming full circle back to Charles Harris and After The Ball If the defense is that 1990s rap is documentary the authentic sound of the streets well so were those verse and chorus ballads of the 1890s These were the first songs of the American cities cautionary tales of the vicissitudes of urban life Mother was a Lady She is More to be Pitied Than Censured Harris hits were as TV movies say based on a true story like his grisly ballad of an orphan girl asking the telephone operator to be put through to her dead mother Hello Central Give Me Heaven My personal favorite is a pop hit of 1898 by the black writer Gussie Lord Davis about an overnight train full of passengers irritated by a sobbing infant and demanding to know where the mother is As the child s young father explains mother is in a mahogany casket In the Baggage Coach Ahead If you think that sounds a little lurid that s the whole point These were ripe metropolitan melodramas served up for the genteel piano parlors of the suburbs Same with rap For all it s hailed as the voice of the urban poor 70 percent of its sales are to suburban whites for whom Public Enemy s 911 is a Joke or Niggaz Wit Attitude s Fuck tha Police offer the delicious voyeuristic frisson of life in Compton or the South Bronx without actually having to live there For most songwriters after After The Ball for everyone from Irving Berlin to Carole King lyric writing was an exercise in compression Rap returns us to the same sprawling prolixity as 1890s ballads and 12 verse story songs whether they re lilting waltzes or numbingly hard core are rarely distinguished as music Almost all turn of the century blockbusters have the simplest of tonal structures Similarly rap is the logical consequence of pop s 30 year promotion of street cred over music the reduction of the tune to a banal pneumatic backing track the debasement of lyric writing to a formless laundry list of half baked hoodlum exhibitionism 1990s gangsta rap is rhythmically simple and harmonically negligible 1890s ballads are melodically simple and harmonically negligible but the effect is the same Even as the subject matter in each case proclaims its modernity railroads and telephone on the one hand guns and crack on the other in both cases the music underneath belies it There is one major difference of course Charles K Harris just opened the newspaper found a suitable story and wrote it up Gangsta rappers have eliminated the middleman They are the stories in the papers Half of em wind up getting shot Ol Dirty Bastard liver blown away Tupac Shakur half of his groin blown away Randy Weaver producer of Strictly 4 My N I G G A Z everything blown away The other half take pre emptive action Slick Rick recorded his last album while serving time for attempted murder Snoop Doggy Dogg was acquitted on technical grounds Out here it s not just about making the records one rapper tells Ronin Ro in Gangsta It s about staying alive after they re released Rappers says Ro battle over who drinks more 40s kills more niggaz jacks more cars slaps more hos and all for the amusement of those white burb kids in the reverse baseball caps Pop music is mostly minstrelsy Following After The Ball while black ragtime composers starved white Tin Pan Alley hacks stuck rag in the titles of their novelty songs and sold millions Today we can see Michael Jackson s ever more bleached complexion as a shorthand for pop s history He s the first black singer to become his own white cover version to start out as Little Richard and transmogrify into Pat Boone But gangsta rap is something else You ll hear nothing of W C Handy or Ellington or Stevie Wonder in rap it s a negation of a century of black music Instead in its principles in its forms in its opportunism in its willingness to pass off individual pain as mass entertainment it returns us to the 1890s to the whitest popular music we ve known in this country Gangsta rap is the whitest black music there is At last reverse minstrelsy
