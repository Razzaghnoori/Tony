 Matisse vs Picasso The relationship between the artists Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso is the subject of a new exhibition at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth Texas called Matisse and Picasso A Gentle Rivalry The theme of this show and of the book that accompanies it by the Harvard art historian Yve Alain Bois is that the two masters of modern painting were playing a kind of chess game all their lives Picasso the younger artist was constantly trying to get Matisse s attention by showing off stealing from his work and rudely parodying him Matisse envious of Picasso s success tried to ignore him until the 1930s when he needed Picasso s influence to bring himself out of an artistic funk After that they traded paintings visits and little notes But they were too competitive to really be friends I don t think Bois takes this implication of this creative tension quite far enough The Matisse Picasso rivalry is more than just the great artistic competition of the 20 th century It s a scheme for dividing all art into two parts Side by side a Matisse and a Picasso can look amazingly similar Yet at a deeper level they are fundamentally radically incompatible Although it s possible to admire both artists something impels you to choose sides At the end of the day everyone is either a Matisse person or a Picasso person Matisse is a cool calm Northern European artist Picasso is a hot temperamental Spaniard Matisse famously said that a painting should be like a comfortable armchair His paintings are harmonious luxurious and soothing Picasso can virtually copy a Matisse tableau without producing anything like the same effect In his rendition the same fruit on a pedestal contains an element of dissonance disturbance and even violence Where Matisse is sensuous Picasso is sexual Matisse loves fabric Picasso loves flesh The division seems like a version of the one drawn by Friedrich Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy between Apollonian and Dionysian art The Apollonian comes from the Greek god Apollo the god of light who was associated with rationality and its subspecialties law medicine and philosophy The Dionysian comes from Dionysius the god of wine and fertility who was worshipped with drunken orgies in the woods at which nonparticipants were ripped to pieces The Apollonian spirit is one of measure reason and control the Dionysian is one of abandon irrationality and ecstatic release The clash between the two principles was what produced Greek tragedy according to Nietzsche That Matisse is essentially an Apollonian artist and Picasso a Dionysian is evident even from the backhanded compliments they paid each other Matisse called Picasso capricious and unpredictable Picasso described Matisse s paintings as beautiful and elegant In dividing all art into two categories Nietzsche rendered the service of coming up with one of the great intellectual parlor games of all time Critics love to devise variations for their fields Richard Martin the director of the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City divides the world into Giorgio Armani vs Gianni Versace Armani with his serene muted tones and clean lines is the Apollonian designer The late Versace with his Miami colors outrageous impracticality and explicit sexuality is the Dionysian And it s true The models in Armani ads look like Greek statues In Versace ads they look like drugged bacchants The Apollonian spirit is about good taste elegance and beauty The Dionysian mixes bad taste with good taste pain with pleasure You can apply Nietzsche s dichotomy to just about any set of contemporaries or creative rivals With artists you might start with Leonardo vs Michelangelo Leonardo the scientific rationalist and inventor is an Apollonian his work is owned by among others the archrationalist Bill Gates Michelangelo though he worked principally in the Apollonian medium of marble expresses a more animalistic violence and passion work owned by the pope Mark Rothko is a Matisse type Jackson Pollock is a Picasso type The Beatles with their well crafted melodies are the Apollonians The Rolling Stones darker more subterranean and with a deeper rhythm section are more in touch with Dionysius Only Dionysians have sympathy for the devil You might like both bands but ultimately you re with one or the other You re either a Beatles person or a Stones person just like you re either a Matisse person or a Picasso person In American literature Phillip Rahv devised the classic division into two categories in a famous essay titled Paleface and Redskin American writers were either Europeanized literary wimps like Henry James or celebrants of the native animalistic spirits like Mark Twain The Apollonian line begins with Washington Irving the Dionysian with James Fenimore Cooper In the Apollo Matisse Armani Beatles column we find Emily Dickinson Opposite her in the Dionysius Picasso Versace Stones column is Walt Whitman Nathaniel Hawthorne is a Matisse Herman Melville is a Picasso In the 20 th century we come to F Scott Fitzgerald Matisse vs Ernest Hemingway Picasso and John Updike Matisse vs Norman Mailer who wrote a biography of Picasso You can in fact apply the division to just about any natural pairing and then use that pairing to redivide the world Of course you can Who s going to arrest you I ve been soliciting examples
