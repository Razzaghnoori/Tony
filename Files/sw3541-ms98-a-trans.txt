            okay you think youre getting your moneys worth   uh never   i   uh the only thing im im thankful of is that we dont have to pay any income tax here in in Texas   well thats probably the next years agenda   yeah boy i tell you what i sure hope they dont pass something like that   oh yeah theyre finding the way the tax you every time you turn around and i i think one way or the other were gonna pay for the bureaucracy i guess and uh its one area thats uh really i i think hurting the economy more than anything i think the taxes have just every time you turn around they they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products and i i i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now   well i i tell you um i remember every time it seems like we turned around theyre adding another nickel or a few more cents onto the price of gasoline   thats right thats right   and  actually that one the the the taxes on gasoline dont dont bug me as much as uh uh what are we eight and a quarter percent sales tax   yep thats right   and every time you go to buy anything now uh even though you know they they tax food thats the one that really kind of bothers me   well i think that uh that the problem with the sales tax of course is its an unfair tax across the board uh as far as ability to pay which allegedly allegedly allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards but uh now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of you know taxes on everything they buy and where people that make you know two hundred three hundred thousand dollars a year certainly a portion of that they arent going to be paying taxes on you know and uh thats the unfair equity inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue but i dont think it is anymore not in Texas anyway   oh i got you because people that uh dont make very much money wind up spending it all   thats right thats right   and whatever they spent it on they have to pay tax on   thats right thats right and thats the unfairness of the thing but uh i think taxes generally are unfair   what what do you think of that new luxury car tax anything over ten thousand or thirty thousand dollars   well you know like other things if they dont affect you you dont worry about them too much       i i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still so uh it doesnt i i think uh uh you know generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line which is uh you know and uh   oh sure   i guess if people got thirty forty thousand bucks to spend on a car uh thats their prerogative you know  i i i dont have a whole lot of sympathy on that you you maybe you buy that you know and i dont mean to be knocking uh   no uh no i havent but it it to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax uh on top of it and theres an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand   yeah there are there are and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that i guess you know unless they really want it buy something that you know more well it its just like having taxes on or exemptions for kids you know its a way of increasing the population that that was one of the initial ideas of you know giving exemptions on kids on on federal taxes   yeah   and where you exempt things like uh uh one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy someone brilliant deductor probably Lloyd Bentsen said that all you know if they gave back the ah deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes people would probably be you know spending more money using their credit cards   right right   now i dont know if thats true or not but if you look on all interest things not just credit cards but on your cars and you know any any kind of interest that youre paying from a personal point of view that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchases   sure   so thats a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go you know tax things that they dont you know to a degree well like booze you know example they keep raising the taxes on booze it gets to the point you know it makes drunks sober you know they quit buying anything   well what what about the taxes on cigarettes
