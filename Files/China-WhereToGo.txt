 Where to Go The 32 most visited cities and sights in China described in detail in this section are arranged in alphabetical order This conveniently puts the capital Beijing first The names of the cities are given in official Pinyin spelling To the right of each place name we also provide the spelling by which it was known in the old Wade Giles system of romanization for example Peking instead of Beijing The authentic Chinese characters for each place name are provided in a list at the back of this guide along with pronunciation guides see page 251 At the end of this extended gazetteer we provide Briefings on 24 additional cities and sights that are less frequently visited on typical tours Planning Your Trip Choosing an itinerary can be a difficult task for China is too big to be covered in any reasonable amount of time An excessively hasty week might take in Beijing the Ming Tombs and the Great Wall the archaeological marvels of Xi an the romantic scenery of Guilin and a glimpse of bustling Shanghai or Guangzhou Canton This sort of trip though you leap around more often than is convenient takes you to the top attractions Less taxing would be a week in and around Shanghai emphasizing the legendary charms of Wuxi Suzhou and Hangzhou All three towns are on the historic Grand Canal If you go inland you can still take the celebrated four day boat trip between Wuhan and Chongqing through the Yangzi Yangtze River gorges before they are swallowed up by a massive dam project to be completed after 2009 and from there fly to Beijing Shanghai or Guangzhou for sightseeing shopping and gourmet dining Silk Road enthusiasts fly from Beijing or Xi an to Urumqi in the far west returning via the exotic desert oases of Turpan and Dunhuang for the Buddhist cave treasures and camel rides to sand locked lakes Another western China adventure is a visit to Yunnan Province whose capital Kunming is home to members of most of China s minority groups Near Kunming are the Stone Forest a natural monument of bizarre formations and to the northwest near the Tibetan border the dazzling minority villages of Dali and Lijiang If you prefer to stay close to Beijing the better part of a varied week could profitably be spent investigating the carvings of the Buddhist caves near Datong visiting the Mongolian lands of Hohhot and viewing the Chinese and Tibetan temples of Chengde Any two of these week long segments can be combined for a fortnight s touring The most popular itineraries invariably include Beijing Xi an Guilin and Shanghai each city providing a glimpse of China past and present Beijing Peking A visit to the medieval and modern capital of China is an exhausting though rewarding round of palaces and museums temples and monuments and streets and stores a jolting juxtaposition of imperial pomp and contemporary energy Beijing has a population of over 12 million but it is spread over a huge area calculated at a staggering 16 800 square km about 6 500 square miles Many neighborhoods are lined with old hutongs alleyways alongside traditional one and two story courtyard houses where life has changed little since the days of the Qing Dynasty Around the corner from these fast disappearing cozy alleys are new housing projects offices modern shopping plazas and open air markets This is a metropolis in the throes of modernization Mostly the city is flat which is a mercy for the millions who bicycle to work in the world s most unlikely rush hour a chaos of buses and trucks and more bikes than you ve seen in your whole life In 1998 Beijing took the unthinkable step of actually banning bikes from one street Xisidonglu where bicycle flow had reached more than 100 per minute In the Middle Ages the emperors decided to do something about the capital s unrelieved flatness They ordered hills to be artificially constructed just north of the Forbidden City so they could go up and in total privacy enjoy a summer breeze and a bird s eye view over the curved tile roofs of their imperial compound Try it yourself perhaps at dawn when a thin haze drapes itself over the pavilions redefining yet softening the features of this storybook skyline You ll see why the emperors wanted it all for themselves Beijing in History Not far from the present day suburbs of Beijing was the habitat of Peking Man the startling anthropological discovery of the 1920s A cave near the town of Zhoukoudian held the skull of a small brained but upright ancestor of mankind who lived half a million years ago Scientists are still sifting for the bones and visitors can tour the dig themselves Recent excavations in downtown Beijing show that it was inhabited over 20 000 years ago but the place made little stir until the Warring States period fifth to third centuries b c when known as Jicheng it became the capital of the Kingdom of Yan Renamed Yanjing the town served as capital for the Liao Dynasty in the tenth century a d The Jin Chin Dynasty of the 12th century called it Zhongdu Central Capital and built an imperial palace as well as the Lugou Bridge known abroad as the Marco Polo Bridge it is still in use Genghis Khan s Mongol armies leveled Zhongdu in the 13th century then rebuilt it under the name Dadu Great Capital By the time Marco Polo arrived the city outshone the capitals of Europe The Ming Dynasty transferred most of the imperial pomp south to Nanjing in the 14th century Predictably Dadu received yet another name Beiping Northern Peace but had to wait more than 50 years to win back its imperial status and a fresh name This one Beijing Northern Capital is still around So happily are the Ming palaces and temples At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty Beijing prospered New palaces and gardens were laid out and scholarship flourished But during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 European armies wrought havoc in the city in retaliation for the siege of their embassies This was only the first of many crises which were to rock Beijing the fall of the empire the foundation of the Chinese Republic two world wars and civil war In 1949 Beijing became the capital of the new People s Republic of China Sightseeing The historic heart of Beijing consists of three concentric cities rectangular and symmetrical and a fourth Outer City to the south Most of the miles of walls that protected each of the four cities have been lost to progress but the innermost Forbidden City still glitters behind its original fortifications The elegance of this city plan basically 700 years old has never been surpassed A precise north south axis links the main elements from the Bell Tower all the way to the gate of the Outer City 8 km 5 miles to the south At the center of it all is the Forbidden City imperial heart of the Middle Kingdom Tiananmen Square Called the biggest plaza on earth Tiananmen Square covers 40 hectares 100 acres in the very center of Beijing The square was the center of world attention during the student demonstrations of 1989 and their tragic aftermath In contrast it is now the site of frequent festivities with magnificent flower displays and sparkling fountains At the time of the emperors the square was only about one fourth its present size In the old less expansive square Mao Zedong first raised the flag of the new nation on 1 October 1949 On 1 October 1999 the People s Republic celebrated its golden anniversary each of the square s concrete blocks freshly replaced by stately granite The newest building on the square called the Chairman Mao Zedong Memorial Hall contains the embalmed body of the man who led the People s Republic for its first 27 years The mausoleum which is bigger than Lenin s tomb in Moscow s Red Square is open to a procession of tourists who are allowed only a few minutes inside A grandiose building on the west side of the square the Great Hall of the People Renmin Dahuitang erected in 1959 is the meeting place of the National People s Congress the Great Hall offers tours At the heart of the square is the Monument to the People s Heroes a granite obelisk where the democracy movement was headquartered in 1989 Far across the plaza two courtyard museums in one building cover the history of China In the Museum of Chinese History are 9 000 items from prehistoric fossils to breathtaking pottery and bronzes The Museum of the Chinese Revolution houses Communist Party documents and displays The explanations are in Chinese only but you can buy an illustrated guide in English from the bookstall to the left of the entrance North across Changan Avenue from Tiananmen Square and leading to the Forbidden City is the Gate of Heavenly Peace with its famous portrait of Chairman Mao Atop this formidable stone wall is a rostrum for reviewing parades and behind it a massive wooden gate tower with a double roof The original 15th century gate complex was rebuilt in 1651 Tourists are now allowed to survey the square from atop the gate a vantage point once reserved for emperors and rulers Forbidden City Gu Gong Beijing is too sprawling a town for strolling around so you can forget the sort of browsing that some European cities offer Among several exceptions though is the Forbidden City Here you will find more than 72 hectares 175 acres of grandeur with palaces courtyards and gardens It is a walled rectangular island within a massive moat wide enough for naval engagements The Forbidden City so described because it was off limits to ordinary people for nearly 500 years is now called the Palace Museum Designed to contain the auspicious number of 9 999 rooms its scale is overwhelming and leaves many visitors bewildered Built in the years 1406 1420 it was the residence of 24 emperors for nearly seven centuries Tourists normally enter the Forbidden City from the south after a long walk along a cobbled roadway from the Gate of Heavenly Peace The main entrance to the compound Meridian Gate Wumen was designed in the 15th century Officials used the left portal members of the imperial family the right Next comes another ceremonial gate the Gate of Supreme Harmony Taihemen first erected in 1420 A pair of monumental bronze lions stand guard Beyond this powerful defense line stands China s supreme ensemble of ancient architecture First and foremost is the Hall of Great Harmony Taihedian popularly called the Hall of the Imperial Throne This is the biggest building in the Forbidden City and one of China s most beautiful wooden structures For hundreds of years during the Ming and Qing dynasties this was the tallest building in all Beijing by law no house could rise higher Counting the hall s upswept roof decorations that meant the limit was approximately 371 2 m or 123 ft Inside on a raised platform the Son of Heaven sat on his Dragon Throne surrounded by symbols of longevity and power and cowering acolytes all covered in a fog of incense To the tune of gongs and chimes visitors knelt to kowtow nine times Less formal occasions took place in the smaller golden roofed Hall of Central Harmony Zhonghedian behind the Hall of Great Harmony A third hall in this series the Hall of Preserving Harmony Baohedian was used among other things for the palace examinations which were the world s first civil service tests Behind this hall in the center of a stairway is a ramp full of sculptured dragons carved from a single slab of marble weighing more than 200 tons It was reserved for the emperor s sedan chair Thousands of laborers worked to pull the block to this site from the quarry 48 km 30 miles away ingeniously the operation was scheduled for deepest winter so that the load could be slid along specially iced roads From here to the north the density of structures in the Forbidden City increases markedly as one passes from the Outer Court where official business was conducted to the halls and pavilions of the Inner Court where the emperor the imperial family and court members lived Many of the old palaces and halls are now used to display the artwork and more prosaic belongings of the emperors The Hall of Clocks and Hall of Jewelry collections of gifts to the emperors are worth a detour to the right as is the Nine Dragon Screen Jiulongbi carved in 1775 The rear northern section of the Forbidden City contains the pavilions where the imperial family resided and ends at the Imperial Gardens Yuhuayuan with magnificent stone rockeries site of a Daoist temple that dates back to the completion of the Forbidden City itself under the Ming emperors in 1420 Two Parks Just north of the Forbidden City complex along the main imperial axis is Jingshan Park better known as Coal Hill Meishan The highest point of old Beijing the hill was created from earth that was removed to form the moat system around the Forbidden City Each of the five artificial peaks was provided with a romantically designed pavilion The three tiered Pavilion of Ten Thousand Springs Wanchunting on the middle peak offers an inspiring view over the glistening rooftops of the Imperial City with the modern capital beyond Beihai Park Beijing s favorite has been a beauty spot for many hundreds of years Its lake which young couples now explore in rented rowing boats was created in the 12th century The graceful Bridge of Eternal Peace Yonganqiao leads to an artificial island a mile in circumference with a long covered corridor that sweeps along the northern shore On a hill in the center of the isle is situated a Tibetan style tower the White Dagoba Baita at the back of Yongan Temple In springtime the dagoba seems to burst from waves of green leaves In summer and fall this is the most beautiful and lively park to stroll through in the capital Temple of Heaven Park Tiantan Park known to foreigners as Temple of Heaven Park is the biggest of Beijing s parks celebrated for its assembly of thrilling 15th century architecture The highlight is the circular blue tile roofed Hall of Prayer for Good Harvest Qiniandian This marvel of geometry art and engineering built without a single nail measures 371 2 m 123 ft to the gilded orb on its topmost roof In 1889 the masterpiece was struck by lightning and burned almost to the ground Fortunately the ruin was quickly restored to its original resplendent state The emperor was carried here in a procession in the first lunar month of each year to pray for a bountiful harvest The floor plan of the hall provides the key to the building s function The four central columns represent the seasons then come two concentric rings of 12 columns each representing the months and the dozen two hour periods into which the day was divided and 28 hardwood pillars symbolize the constellations Although tourists can no longer enter this monument its colorful interiors can still be glimpsed from outside Other attractions at the park include the Round Altar Haunqiutan and Echo Wall where whispered secrets ricochet and are mysteriously magnified crossing an immense courtyard without benefit of modern technology Top Temples Beijing s most popular temple is a 17th century Lamasery the Palace of Harmony and Peace Yonghegong popularly known as the Lama Temple It was originally the palace of the prince who became the Emperor Yongzheng The stately complex of wooden buildings containing nearly 1 000 rooms has been painstakingly restored The temple recalls 18th century efforts to unify China Mongolia and Tibet Across the street and down a narrow street from the Lama Temple is Beijing s most serene place of worship the Temple of Confucius Kongzimiao with statues and stone tablets honoring the ancient sage Other temples of significant interest and variety are Big Bell Temple Dazhongsi with China s leading collection of antique bells Temple of the White Pagoda Baitasi with its newly renovated 13th century Tibetan stupa China s largest Five Pagoda Temple Wutasi decorated with Indian influenced sculptures and White Clouds Daoist Temple Baiyuanguan where Beijingers of all ages crowd in to pray for good fortune at a variety of most unusual shrines An Observatory a Zoo and an Aquarium The Ancient Beijing Observatory Guguanxiangtai built in 1442 stands atop a remnant of the old city wall on the busiest street in central Beijing Jianguomenwaidajie Many of the bronze instruments sundials and sextants on display inside and on the roof of the observatory were gifts from Jesuit missionaries who lived in the capital during the 17th century China s largest zoo in the northwestern sector of Beijing now includes a separate indoor outdoor pavilion for its lovable giant pandas The older buildings dating back to the Qing Dynasty house Manchurian tigers Tibetan yaks snow leopards and P re David s deer known to the Chinese as the quadruple unlikeness sibuxiang because it has characteristics of the deer the reindeer the ox and the donkey The zoo is popular with local children but most foreign visitors find the facilities too antiquated and its conditions poor Rather than upgrade its aged facilities Beijing Zoo has just opened the Beijing Aquarium China s largest on adjacent property Home to whales dolphins and 50 000 fish the huge conch shaped facility features a Touch Tidepool sea mammal shows and some of the world s largest acrylic viewing panels Hutongs and Courtyards Growing in popularity in the face of extinction by bulldozer the hutongs traditional alleyways and courtyard houses of Beijing are worth a visit Every year these old neighborhoods are reduced as the capital relentlessly reconstructs itself but it s still possible to book a guided pedicab tour of the hutongs Wandering the backstreets in the old lake district north of Beihai Park these pedicab caravans make stops at the ancient Drum Tower for panoramic views at Prince Gong s Palace Gongwangfu for tea and sometimes opera in a lavish grand Ming Dynasty estate and at a typical courtyard home in a hutong neighborhood for a chance to meet and talk with Beijing residents If time allows for further exploration of these old neighborhoods poke around Qianhai and Houhai lakes for weekend street markets Here you ll find Songqingling Guzhu the former residence of Soong Ching ling wife of modern China s founder Dr Sun Yat sen who lived in this courtyard mansion after the revolution It is now a family museum Shopping Districts Some of Beijing s few walkable areas are its chief shopping streets and markets Wangfujing running north a few blocks east of the Forbidden City is the capital s primary shopping street lined with upscale boutiques and glittering shopping plazas although a few venerable arts and crafts shops small galleries and old department stores still survive South of Tiananmen Square Liulichang Street has been restored to its Ming Dynasty appearance and is a shopper s delight Liulichang Beijing s premier antiques market extends eastward into Dazhalan Street a pedestrian mall famous for silk and jewelry shops Outdoor markets where visitors must bargain at length are another walking adventure Silk Alley the most famous and most overpriced specializes in designer fashions More clothes and furs are found at Yabao Market near Ritan Park popularly known as the Russian Market The Hongxiao Market near the Temple of Heaven features clothing crafts and freshwater pearls The most colorful market is Panjiayuan know as the Dirt Market starting at sunrise every Sunday with its stalls of collectibles antiques family treasures tomb art Tibetan rugs furniture and Mao memorabilia Summer Palace The Chinese name for this convergence of natural and man made beauty is Yiheyuan the Park of Nurtured Harmony Foreigners call this 280 hectare 700 acre imperial estate the Summer Palace In actual fact the 250 year old palaces pavilions temples and halls occupy only a small part of the dreamily landscaped area By far the largest feature of the park is Kunming Lake Contemporary Chinese historians wax indignant that under the Qing Dynasty funds appropriated for the imperial navy were in fact siphoned off to make Yiheyuan an increasingly luxurious private park Perhaps the most astonishing of the items on which the Empress Dowager Cixi squandered the naval budget is a double decker Marble Boat beached at the edge of the lake You can view this monument to royal folly but you can no longer board it Among the outstanding structures in the park are the Hall of Joyful Longevity Leshoutang and the Seventeen Arch Bridge but the most magnificent structure is the Long Corridor a wooden gallery 728 m nearly half a mile in length This covered way which is interrupted by octagonal pavilions is decorated with landscape paintings and depictions of Chinese legends It s like a long unfolding wooden scroll of Old Cathay a lakeside gallery recording all that was once the Middle Kingdom Not far from the Summer Palace is the Old Summer Palace Yuanmingyuan once the emperor s summer retreat In 1860 British and French soldiers razed most of the grand buildings including a complex modeled after Versailles The ghostly ruins make an idyllic picnic ground Excursions from Beijing The Great Wall It s about 80 km 50 miles from the center of Beijing northwest to the most visited stretch of the Great Wall of China at Badaling The trip telescopes history from the modern capital through the outskirts where donkey carts and cargo carrying bicycles share the road past farms where nothing seems to have changed for centuries to a harsh mountain range where nearly one million workers walled in an empire Like all the real wonders of the world this one is more awesome when visited in person than it is in any film or book The first elements of the wall system were built more than 2 000 years ago but the expansion and consolidation of the project near Beijing began under the Ming Dynasty in the 14th century The serpentine stone bulwark and elevated highway became Wanlichangcheng The Wall Ten Thousand Li Long about 6 000 km 3 700 miles The restored section of the wall at Badaling undulating up the unexpectedly steep hillsides can be a test of a tourist s endurance It is far steeper and more formidable than it looks in any tourist brochure Out of breath many visitors exchange sympathetic smiles along the way as they ascend to one or another of the towers If you walk far enough west you come upon unrestored sections of the wall at the edge of the Gobi Desert The Badaling section is often overcrowded these days Two other sections now provide relatively easy access to tourists the Great Wall at Mutianyu as beautiful as the section at Badaling but a little less steep and the Great Wall at Simatai more distant from Beijing than other sections but virtually unrestored Simatai is the least crowded and most original of the Great Wall sites Although it too has a cable car concession Simatai bills itself as the most dangerous section of the Great Wall The Ming Tombs On the way to the Great Wall is the peaceful valley the Ming emperors chose as their burial ground In 1407 the Emperor Yongle ordered a search for a suitable burial place with auspicious wind and water conditions as well as appropriate grandeur This site proved so perfect that all but three of the succeeding Ming rulers were entombed in the same valley The Sacred Way to the Ming Tombs begins at a great marble gateway more than four centuries old Beyond this is the main gate with three archways the middle arch was used only once in each reign for the delivery of the emperor s remains to his tomb Then comes the Avenue of the Animals which is lined with massive statues of real and mythical beasts The largest tomb Changling belonged to Yongle himself Its Hall of Eminent Favors Lingendian is among the largest wooden buildings in China The 32 gilded pillars supporting the coffered ceiling were fashioned from a huge tree that took more than five years to ship here from southwest China Ninety one steps take you down below ground level to Dingling the tomb of the Emperor Wanli whose reigned from 1573 to 1620 It took 30 000 workers six years to build this underground palace Most of the regalia and artifacts on display including the red wooden coffin containers in the burial vault are copies of the items discovered during excavations in the 1950s The Qing Tombs While many visitors to the Ming Tombs find the site crowded and uninspiring there is a fascinating alternative The Eastern Qing Tombs Dongqingling mimic the older Ming architecture but are grander and more effectively restored They are also more than twice as far from Beijing 125 km 78 miles to the east on slow but interesting roads Of the nine tombs open to view those of two most powerful Manchu emperors Qianlong and Kangxi are impressive and that of Empress Dowager Cixi 1835 1911 is as elaborate as it is strange Changsha If you go to Changsha by train you will arrive at the second biggest railway station in China a distinction quite out of proportion to the amount of rail traffic or the size of the city The explanation is that until the late 1970s legions of pilgrims converged on this provincial capital in search of the roots of Chairman Mao Zedong Now that the cult of Mao has faded in glory the stations and the shrines are uncrowded and Changsha has returned to its age old role as a rather prosaic regional center of trade and culture However the surrounding fertile countryside is attractive the spicy Hunan cuisine is worth trying the scenic mountain areas of the province are outstanding and the archaeological displays are stunning The capital of Hunan Province Changsha lies along the Xiang River a wide and often turbulent stream that flows into the Yangzi The long thin strip of Orange Island Juzizhou rich in oranges among other crops bisects the river and in the early 20th century was home to a small band of Western traders and missionaries From the pavilion at the southern tip there is an engrossing view of sampans barge trains and passenger ships On the far side of the river fragrant forests climb the slopes of Yuelu Hill a favorite escape from the subtropical heat of the city in summer One of the evergreen trees in the mountainside Lushan Temple is more than 1 700 years old The Qing Dynasty pavilion on top Yunlugong affords a fine panorama For most tourists the prime attraction of the region is found in the northeast part of town the Hunan Provincial Museum with its renowned relics of the Han Dynasty including silks ceramics and lacquerware of unbelievable sophistication as well as alluring figurines and musical instruments All these artifacts survived because they were buried in coffins within coffins in subterranean royal tombs These beautiful wooden boxes come from the royal graves at Mawangdui as does the museum s show stopper the remarkably well preserved silk wrapped mummy of the Marquis of Dai s wife Tohou who died at age 50 in 186 b c Nearly 2 200 years later her hair is still on her head and her expression is unchanged from the moment of her last breath Tourists in Changsha are sometimes taken to visit the local embroidery factory where Hunan s handicraft tradition has flourished for 2 000 years Staff artists paint original designs usually of landscapes animals birds or flowers which the artisans reproduce stitch by microscopic stitch in colorful silk The workers here are proudest of the double faced embroidery with a different picture on each side Changsha also features sites linked with Chairman Mao and the revolution Foremost is Hunan s first Teachers Training School Diyishifan Reconstructed in 1968 it resembles a European monastery with arcades and gardens During the Cultural Revolution visitors thronged the institution every day for this is where Mao Zedong studied from 1913 to 1918 and later taught The classroom of 30 desks where Mao sat and the crowded dormitory where he slept under a mosquito net are on view Since the 100th anniversary of Mao s birth 1893 millions of visitors have been to the village of Shaoshan Mao s birthplace two hours by bus from Changsha The principal sights are the house where he was born quite roomy by local standards and a museum with all the exhibits in duplicate filling two mirror image wings designed to double the crowd capacity Excursions in Hunan Outdoor enthusiasts and independent travelers might have time to explore two of Hunan s most spectacular natural attractions The Southern Heng Mountain Hengshannan also called Nanyue one of China s Five Sacred Mountains in the ancient Daoist pantheon is 112 km 70 miles south of Changsha Its temples monasteries and misty vistas are well worth a day s hike Wulingyuan a large nature preserve better known to the Chinese as Zhangjiajie is 350 km 217 miles west of Changsha Known as China s Yellowstone this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a remote park of spectacular and uncanny quartz labyrinths and pinnacles massive limestone caves white water rapids steep hiking trails and minority villages Chengde Jehol In summer the trip to Chengde about 250 km 150 miles northeast of Beijing might well be one of the prettiest anywhere in China Fertile fields alternate with stony hills miraculously sprouting trees and wildflowers In the hamlets along the way trim houses are roofed with thatch or traditional tile with winged projections In the fields the labor is done mostly by hand and when animals are not available even the heavy plowing is done by men in harness Chengde itself looks at first glance like any other northern Chinese industrial town but the dreariness is interspersed with beautifully sited old temples and an imperial pleasure ground big enough to be protected by a wall 10 km 6 miles long The palaces and gardens of Chengde provided summertime escape for the imperial courts of the Qing Dynasty beginning with Emperor Kangxi who created the halls lakes and hunting grounds here as a second summer palace in 1703 Kangxi called these royal parklands Bishushanzhuang or Mountain Villa for Escaping the Summer Heat Indeed its altitude at about 350 m more than 1 100 ft above sea level provides relief from the summer heat as do the surrounding mountains forests and rivers Visitors enter this royal resort at the ceremonial Lizheng Gate flanked by two marble lions The old palace and royal halls now serve as museums Among the exhibits are bows and arrows and Chinese flintlocks rare jade and porcelain and the sedan chairs in which the emperors were transported all the way from Beijing The emperor s bedroom is located in the Refreshing Mist Veiled Waters Pavilion The halls and courtyards are eminently regal yet they also inspire a feeling of relaxation appropriate to the setting The plain wooden corridors connecting the buildings contrast with the illustrated passageways of Beijing s Summer Palace which occupies but half the space of the Chengde retreat The landscape beyond the palace compound features many of the romantic elements of Chinese tradition interconnected lakes and lotus ponds forests causeways and arched bridges ornate pavilions and towering pagodas The Tower of Mist and Rain Yanyulou a two story lakeside pavilion in the southern style was favored by emperors for its foggy views resembling those of an old Chinese painting Tourists can cross the lakes in hand poled ferryboats or drift at their own pace in a rowing boat North of the lakes there are hiking trails in the Garden of Ten Thousand Trees Wanahuyuan where Emperor Qianlong gave an audience in 1793 to the first British ambassador to set foot in China Lord Macartney The meeting did not go well Beyond the wall surrounding the palace and its gardens rise the exotic roofs of the Eight Outer Temples built by the emperors between 1713 and 1779 to honor and influence Tibetans Kazakhs and other northern peoples All are open to tourists The two grandest temples are Tibetan in style The Mount Sumera Longevity and Happiness Temple Xumifushoumiao is a copy of the sixth Panchen Lama s residence in Shigatse Tibet The high red walls surround a pavilion with a roof gilded in a ton of gold A mile east the Small Potala Temple Putuozongshengmiao the largest at Chengde evokes the Dalai Lama s Potala Palace in Lhasa and is so steep a climb 164 steps that sedan chair carriers do a brisk trade with weary tourists Chengdu Chengtu Balmy and often misty weather keeps Chengdu green and full of flowers year round It s the climate in which bamboo thrives and bamboo is the staple of the giant panda The best place to spot these cuddly looking beasts in something resembling the wilds is at the China Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding 11 km 7 miles northeast of downtown Chengdu where a dozen pandas have free run of some 30 hectares 80 acres of bamboo groves There s a panda museum here too In closer confines the Chengdu Zoo has more resident pandas about a dozen than does any other zoo in the world The thin bamboo stalks they find so delicious are grown right in the grounds Because they are the stars of this attraction the giant pandas are assigned high ceilinged spacious cages and outdoor play areas Chengdu is the capital city of Sichuan Szechuan Province the natural habitat for eighty percent of the world s 1 000 giant pandas But Chengdu has other attractions as well some of them historical some of them spiritual and some of them edible At the time of the era of the Three Kingdoms in the third century Chengdu was capital of the feudal Kingdom of Shu and politics not pandas was the prime attraction The principal monument from that era is the Temple of Marquis Wu Wuhouci a complex of halls and gardens in the southern suburbs built to commemorate the kingdom s prime minister Known in his lifetime a d 181 234 as Zhugeliang he was posthumously ennobled for his role in unifying the region and developing its economy and culture In the main hall built in the Tang Dynasty there are gilt statues of Zhugeliang his son and his grandson the latter died in battle at the age of 14 Chinese literary pilgrims are drawn to another of Chengdu s historic sites the thatched cottage of Dufu Dufucaotang a shrine museum and park at the spot where the poet of the Tang Dynasty lived in exile from the capital for several years Dufu formerly spelled Tufu lived from 712 to 770 and wrote more than 1 400 poems many of them regarded as the greatest in the Chinese canon Chengdu s most popular Daoist temple Qingyanggong Green Goat Temple is a lively garish complex where two bronze good luck goats at the main altar have been rubbed smooth by worshippers seeking their fortunes Not far away is the center of Zen Chan Buddhism in Sichuan the 1 300 year old Wenshu Temple which maintains its own company of woodcarvers as well as a vegetarian restaurant and outdoor teahouse Chengdu s largest and most renowned religious monument located 28 km 17 miles north of the city is the Divine Light Monastery Baoguangsi The most photographed element of this vast establishment is the stupa a slightly crooked 13 level pagoda It was built of stone at the end of the Tang Dynasty replacing an ancient wooden pagoda on the same spot The five main halls of the monastery are filled with works of art including Buddhist sculptures religious and landscape paintings and examples of many schools of calligraphy One 19th century hall contains 500 larger than life sized statues of Buddhist saints The Ancestor Garden formerly reserved for retired monks has been appropriated for the use of foreign tourists only as a tearoom By long tradition Chengdu is China s preeminent city of teahouses Many still operate along the north bank of the Jin Brocade River serving covered cups of flower tea Customers linger at courtyard tables watching trinket vendors and pipe and tobacco salesmen ply their trade along the river promenade Another restful spot is the River Viewing Pavilion Wangjianglou in a park along the south bank of the Jin River More than 100 kinds of bamboo grow here As in other traditional Chengdu parks there are pavilions and towers rock gardens ponds and shady paths River viewing of a different type is recommended at the site of the Dujiangyan Irrigation System 57 km 35 miles northwest of Chengdu This ambitious irrigation and flood control project built in the third century b c is still in use The lush hills along the shore provide a poetic setting for an engineering wonder In the center of town some neighborhoods retain a medieval look Two story shophouses some sagging with age line the narrow streets They have stores on the ground floor and living quarters above with wooden balconies and distinctive carved designs But progress is inevitable On the site of the ancient viceroy s palace in the very center of Chengdu stands a heavy columned socialist realist building a giant statue of Mao Zedong graces the entrance The edifice is now a department store In the main hall shoppers are inspired by portraits of Mao Marx Engels Lenin and Stalin A special department catering to tourists features such local specialties as Shu embroidery toy pandas made of rabbit fur pottery and bamboo ware By way of local color you shouldn t turn down a chance to see Sichuan Opera To make things more challenging it s all sung in the local dialect but you can just relax and watch the spectacle of mime dance and acrobatics Backstage tours are arranged these days by private tour operators Sichuan cuisine one of the four great schools of Chinese cooking produces such imaginative creations as abalone and chrysanthemums peonies and butterflies and stewed bear s trotters in brown sauce One of the most famous dishes mapo dofu consists of beancurd infused with chili peppers in a manner that numbs the tongue upon impact For the more adventurous Chengdu is the gateway to the Great Buddha at Leshan and Mt Emei see page 136 Chongqing Chungking Although the city s history goes back thousands of years Chongqing was never a cultural center and it isn t today It cannot offer spectacular temples palaces or archaeological sites Rather it is a place to see the daily life of a major Chinese industrial city and to begin some outstanding excursions on the legendary Yangzi River In the Qin Dynasty in the third century b c the city was the capital of the dreamily named Kingdom of Ba Its present name Chongqing means Double Jubilation dates from the medieval period commemorating a lucky streak in the life of the local prince Until the last few years it was spelled Chungking by which name the city was best known in the West as the political and military capital of the Nationalist government from 1939 to 1945 the wartime redoubt of Chiang Kai shek Although Chongqing is physically located in subtropical Sichuan Szechuan Province since March 1997 it has been an autonomous governmental unit as are Beijing Shanghai and Tianjin with a staggering metropolitan population of over 30 million people Set on a promontory where the Yangzi and Jialing rivers converge this starkly industrial city of smokestacks is crucial to transportation and commerce in southwest China It presides over the portion of the Yangzi upstream from the massive Three Gorges Dam project which sometime between the years 2009 and 2013 will create an immense reservoir and drown the most scenic section of the river The sightseeing you remember best might be the lively free market lining the hundreds of steps that descend higgledy piggledy from the hills of central Chongqing to the river Hustling bustling peasants hawk the rich harvest of the surrounding farming country cabbages and oranges eggs and live chickens they are weighed while flapping river fish and squirming eels and table after table of the most fragrant spices while stalls and hole in the wall caf s heat up the city s number one dish the Sichuan hotpot Leading down to the river s edge the steep stone stairway known as the Gate to the Sky Chaotianmen which appears not to have been cleaned since the Ming Dynasty is treacherously overlaid with mud and muck so wear your safest shoes and walk with care Happily at the bottom of this long descent there is a terminal for the funicular that returns you to the top of this town which is so hilly bicycles are almost unknown Sights worth seeing in town include the Chongqing People s Hall built in 1953 to serve as a 4 000 seat conference hall and hotel It blends the styles of the Ming and Qing dynasties with the needs of a modern conference hall The Chongqing Museum while poorly lit and aging does contain a collection of dinosaur eggs and two 3 000 year old wooden boats that suspended from the cliffs of the Yangzi served as caskets for nobles in the days of the Ba Kingdom Perhaps the liveliest sight in Chongqing is the 1 000 year old Luohan Temple where blind fortune tellers and devoted followers of Buddha converge from dawn to dusk In the domain of darker political history two former Nationalist prisons outside town are open as monuments to the Revolutionary cause The US Chiang Kai shek Criminal Acts Exhibition Hall so goes the catchy title includes cells and torture chambers Western visitors are not usually shown around unless they specifically request it This is largely in deference to the sensitivities of Europeans and Americans who are blamed for collusion with the Nationalists in the excesses of their anticommunist struggle Because of Chongqing s notoriously torrid summer weather it s known as one of the ovens of China hills and parks are a very welcome refuge here Loquat Hill Pipashan the city s highest spot has gardens a teahouse Hongxing and some splendid panoramas The Northern and Southern Hot Springs parks Beiwenquan and Nanwenquan are also popular gathering places with well kept public gardens A typical Chongqing method of escaping the heat is to take refuge in a cool cave During the years of Japanese air raids hundreds of air raid shelters were dug into the mountains here and some have been turned into caf s and restaurants Even in the heat of summer however the most popular dish remains the Sichuan hotpot a bowl of seething oils into which the diner dips and boils to perfection a selection of meats vegetables and beancurd much like fighting fire with fire Excursions from Chongqing Yangzi River Cruise China s most exciting boat trip is the Yangzi River cruise through the spectacular Three Gorges Sanxia It takes at least three days to go downriver from Chongqing to Wuhan and as many as five days in the reverse direction bucking the considerable tide Until relatively recently the trip was considered an extended risky adventure The most awesome scenery is concentrated between the Sichuan city of Baidi and Nanjin Pass in Hubei Province The sight of the Yangzi water rushing between the sheer walls and evocative rock formations never fails to stir the traveler s spirit In 1992 the National People s Congress passed a resolution to launch the massive Three Gorges Hydropower Project including the construction of a huge dam and a reservoir slated for completion sometime after the year 2009 which will submerge the most scenic sections of the river Tourists can choose between ordinary Chinese passenger ships or more deluxe luxury cruise ships that cater to overseas visitors The river boats that the Chinese use lack frills amenities and guides The luxury craft charge much more but offer a good range of tourist services including decent meals Often reserved in part for package tours these ships are also open to independent travelers and staterooms can even be booked in advance overseas with such lines as Victoria Cruises Dazu Stone Sculptures One of China s great artistic wonders rated on par with the Mogao Caves on the Silk Road in Dunhuang is the Buddhist sculptural treasure of Dazu This district northwest of Chongqing was so inaccessible in earlier times that many thousands of statues were never exposed to pillage Today it still takes three hours to cover the 112 km 70 miles from Chongqing even via the new Chengyu Expressway The stone carvings of Dazu were begun late in the ninth century during the Tang Dynasty the work lasted well into the Southern Song period hundreds of years later Although Buddhism is their central theme there are also sculptures representing historical and human interest subjects Northern Hill Beishan situated only a couple of kilometers north of Dazu begins with a Buddhist temple and a big animated square The wide rocky valley below is filled with sculpture every inch of stone seems to have been carved Among the perfectly preserved figures in The Wheel of the Universe in Grotto 136 are the statues of two holy women the Bodhisattvas Manjusri and Samatabhadra who triumphed over evil Helping to make Northern Hill an overwhelming experience is the presence of Buddhist pilgrims who still call upon these ancient shrines Even more magnificent is Treasure Peak Baodingshan Its sculptures are located in a natural arc of stone known as the Great Buddha Crescent carved over a 70 year span by Buddhist monks during the Southern Song Dynasty 1127 1279 The biggest single work an immense reclining Buddha 29 m 96 ft long is surrounded by the infinitely smaller statues of lifelike disciples Whereas grotto sculpture in China is usually laid out more or less spontaneously the caves here were apparently all planned to the last detail before the first stone was chipped thus eliminating any repetition Dazu represents the last great period of Buddhist cave sculpture in China and a long day s journey out and back from Chongqing to this stone crescent is unforgettable Dali In Yunnan Province about 250 km 155 miles northwest of its capital Kunming along the historic Burma Road route is the scenic village of Dali a favorite of independent backpackers The surroundings could hardly be more spectacular with Erhai Ear Sea Lake to the east and the steep Cangshan mountain range to the west Best of all are the people of Dali mostly members of the Bai minority outgoing people who treat Western travelers with wonderful hospitality The town capital of the Bai Autonomous Region has sections of a medieval wall with formal gates on the north and south ends Within the walls are a few intersecting main streets whose tile roofed shops and houses now serve as souvenir shops private travel agencies hostels and above all small intimate friendly caf s serving a truly international mix of inexpensive dishes The caf life in Dali is one of its chief delights Caf s are perfect spots to wile away the sunny hours over coffee or beer or to meet local Bai people as well as other travelers Perhaps the most famous of the dozens of caf s is Mr China Son s Cultural Exchange Caf run by Uncle Li Heliyi the first Bai in history to go abroad His autobiography on sale at his caf is an epic soap opera Dali also has sights and attractions well worth attending to when the caf and bistro scene begins to pale Erhai Lake is a 30 minute walk from town and its main village Caicun is a maze of unpaved alleys and mud houses Ferries cross the lake to even more remote villages including the temple dedicated to Guanyin goddess of mercy on Putuo Island Any of dozens of local travel agents can quickly arrange an excursion to lakeside villages including the market at Wase One popular diversion is the Monday morning outdoor market at Shaping 30 minutes up the eucalyptus lined road by minibus from Dali It s a vast market of country wares batik and horse trading with hundreds of locals dressed in their traditional bright Bai jackets tunics and plumed caps The chief monument at Dali is the Temple of the Three Pagodas Santasi founded in 825 The tallest of the three towers all sealed up rises to 16 tiers The complex is ringed by hundreds of stalls many of them selling specimens of the local marble There are also temples and pagodas in the steep foothills of the Cangshan Green Mountain range Although seldom open they provide the perfect ornaments for a day s hike from vista to vista over this long narrow valley that reaches west to Tibet While young adventurous travelers still flock to Dali the opening of several new hotels and a modern airport an hour away has brought this exquisite little Chinese Shangri La within any visitor s reach As Dali is discovered by more and more tourists travelers are heading out into even more remote regions of northwestern Yunnan Particularly recommended is the village of Lijiang 150 km 95 miles north of Dali under the shadow of the 5 500 m 18 000 ft Jade Dragon Snow Mountain Yulong Xue Shan The old town section recently restored after a serious earthquake is even more quaint than downtown Dali the local Naxi people are warm and open and the nearby monasteries are intriguing From Lijiang one can journey still farther into China s ultimate outback to Leaping Tiger Gorge Xutiaoxia Lugu Lake and villages on the Sichuan and Tibetan borders Datong Tatung It takes about seven hours by train from Beijing to reach Datong to the west in Shanxi Shansi Province The trip through some gorgeous mountain country is a favorite of train enthusiasts who are drawn to Datong to see the quaint steam locomotives still at work in the center of China s richest coal mining region Coal was the logical fuel for the long trains carrying coal to the rest of the country and Datong became the major steam locomotive manufacturer for China The Datong Locomotive Works could turn out a locomotive every working day This factory now makes diesel engines only but it is open for tours highlighted by a ride on one of the old steam locomotives Datong itself is a rather poor coal mining and industrial city somewhat behind the times set on a loess plateau 1 000 m 3 280 ft above sea level The summers are short here on the edge of Inner Mongolia and winters are glacial It s not the sort of place poets would eulogize yet for nearly a century 398 494 it served as the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty Three monasteries and a famous dragon screen recall Datong s once stately history The Nine Dragon Wall Jiulongbi a Ming landmark 1392 stands in the old part of town among the narrow streets lined by single story houses This is said to be the largest and oldest screen of its type anywhere in China at 457 m 150 ft certainly longer than the more famous version in the Forbidden City The ceramic mural shows nine dragons each in a different dynamic pose When the sun reflects on the pool that runs along the base of the wall the glazed tile figures flash to life The Huayan Monastery built under the Liao Dynasty in the 11th century was finished by the Jin Dynasty rulers in 1140 The monastery faces east and not as was customary in China south The main building the Great Treasure Hall Daxiongbaodian is one of the two biggest Buddhist halls still standing in China The fine ceiling comprises 749 illustrated squares no two the same In the center are enthroned the Five Buddhas of the Five Directions relics of the Ming Dynasty The other big temple in town Shanhua Monastery faces the old city wall which is undergoing renovation The monastery dates from the Tang Dynasty but it was largely rebuilt after a fire Standing in the grand red walled pavilion are 24 celestial guardians each of distinct mien A circular moon gate in the side wall of the monastery leads to the Five Dragon Wall Wulongbi transplanted here from a former Confucian temple This ceramic screen resembles the lavish Nine Dragon Wall in the town center but here the middle dragon terrifyingly faces forward A major attraction near Datong is the Temple Suspended Over the Void Xuankongsi situated a two hour drive south through a barren sandstone plateau Tours usually stop along the way at one of the area s cave houses where residents are happy to show off their hand dug quarters The sixth century temple is spectacular with over 40 halls and pavilions which are joined by ornate catwalks suspended as if by magic on the face of a sheer limestone cliff Yungang Caves Most tourists head for Datong in pursuit of history and art and they are not disappointed The city is best known for the Yungang Caves which are 16 km 10 miles west of Datong and contain one of China s most treasured displays of ancient Buddhist sculpture When the pious project was undertaken 1 500 years ago about 100 000 statues were carved into the walls of the rock temples dug into the cliff About 50 000 statues remain from the size of a postage stamp to the height of a five story house despite the rigors of time the weather and marauders Visitors enter the caves through a monastery where 2 000 monks once lived A wooden structure four stories high built in the Ming Dynasty blocks the winds that blast the caves Carvings of the fanciful Third Son of the Dragon protect the building from fire Tours normally begin at Cave No 5 which contains a seated Buddha figure that is 17 m 56 ft high The gold plating an afterthought was added in the Qing Dynasty As in most of the caves the walls are filled with niches and small statues In Cave No 6 nearly square in plan a pagoda reaches to the ceiling The life of the Buddha from birth to the attainment of nirvana is illustrated in an intricately carved frieze running around the pagoda walls and the sides of the cave The decoration in this cave is considered the supreme achievement of Yungang Cave No 7 is notable for its beautifully carved ceiling At the entrance to Cave No 8 graceful Indian style statues face each other Cave No 9 contains the smallest of all Buddha figures here only 2 cm less than 1 inch high In Cave No 10 note the Greek influence in the headdress of the guardian figure carved at the entrance Cave No 11 is said to contain some 12 000 Buddha figures more than any other cave high up on the wall is a tablet reporting that 83 artists worked for six years to complete the carvings in this one grotto In Cave No 12 heavenly musicians carved over the entrance are playing 12 different ancient instruments Notice an unusual feature of the giant statue in Cave No 13 the Buddha s right wrist is supported by the small figure of a four armed sportsman Cave No 14 has suffered severe damage In general the wind has eroded the outward facing walls in most of the caves the best preserved carvings tend to be on the opposite walls The Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas is the name of Cave No 15 the figures in this cave are arranged in a pigeonhole grid pattern The oldest caves of the whole complex dating from the fifth century are numbered 16 to 20 The currently used east to west numbering scheme was inaugurated in modern times and bears little resemblance to the system used in earlier centuries In Cave No 16 are three holes pierced through the outer wall showing the original positions of three Buddhas appropriated by foreign collectors tour guides here say they are now in New York s Metropolitan Museum Cave No 17 like its neighbors on either side has an oval floor plan The Buddha s upper arms sport Greek style armbands The giant standing Buddha in Cave No 18 wears a strange vestment called the Thousand Buddha Robe on the front of the garment the sculptor has carved a throng of mini Buddha figures Cave No 20 the last one carved while Datong was the capital of the Northern Wei Dynasty is occupied by a giant seated Buddha It s all the more dramatic since the front wall crumbled away leaving the statue open to the sky Dunhuang Tunhuang It used to take 24 hours by train plus a cruel two or three hour bus or jeep journey to reach the sleepy desert town of Dunhuang in Gansu province Now it s an easy airplane ride from Xi an Dunhuang has come a long way since the days when the Silk Road camel trains stopped here Camels still work in and around Dunhuang pulling plows or transporting cargo If you ve just come from overpopulated eastern China you might feel all but alone in a town of only 10 000 Although some donkey carts and bicycles occasionally impinge on the tranquillity of the main street the townsfolk have plenty of time to stand around and gossip In China even provincial museums can be treasure troves The Dunhuang County Museum in the center of the town overflows with Silk Road relics from works of art to 2 000 year old chopsticks The first hall is devoted to calligraphic rarities found in Cave No 17 of the Mogao Grottoes Paper documents have survived for a thousand years in the dry climate of the cave In the second room sacrificial objects unearthed in ancient tombs are shown alongside pots a plow and armor Ancient handicrafts displayed in the third hall include a Tang Dynasty chess set a present from the governor to the emperor Mogao Caves In spite of the difficulties tourists still head for this 2 000 year old town to see China s most magnificent ancient murals and painted statues Since you ve come this far they re worth another 25 km 15 miles The Mogao Caves hewn from a desert cliffside tell the story of the great flowering of Buddhist art in China Begun in the fourth century they were created in fits and starts over the next thousand years Statistics aren t everything but consider that there are 45 000 sq m 484 000 sq ft of mural paintings They cover the walls and ceilings with brightly colored pictures of men and gods and speculations about eternity And in the same caves stand more than 2 000 painted sculptures realistic or fantastic Of the several hundred grottoes still intact only a few dozen are open to the public And even these are kept locked so that visits can be supervised The outer walls of the caves have been reinforced with walkways added Tours cover various itineraries Here are some highlights Northern Wei Dynasty 386 534 Statues with Persian or Indian faces Graceful lifelike animal paintings with three dimensional effects Sui Dynasty 581 618 Illustrations of religious stories Notice the emotions revealed in the characters faces also Chinese robes have replaced foreign dress Tang Dynasty 618 907 Don t miss Cave No 96 a nine tiered temple from the seventh century The seated Buddha statue inside has toes as long as your arm Cave No 158 is filled with a statue of the reclining Buddha the face unusually peaceful and godly when seen from the far left You ll be struck by the imagination life and color of the Tang wall paintings Later dynasties Murals from the tenth century onward provide valuable details of everyday life in medieval China Crescent Moon Lake Most of the desert is grey and menacing a sea of gravel out of which stark rocky mountains occasionally appear But everybody s dream desert can be seen a few kilometers south of Dunhuang With oases in sight awesome dunes rise in waves to 250 m 800 ft crests As the sun and clouds move the colors and textures of the sand hills change Hidden between the hills is a small clear lake Crescent Moon Lake Yueyahu It s not a mirage Reeds grow at the edge of this cool blue spring and tiny fish swim in it You can reach the lake from the edge of the desert on the back of a camel or if you like walking in sand on foot Twenty minutes each way should do it Beside the pool is a magnificent pavilion tower with a teahouse For a rare desert experience climb to the top of a dune and listen to the musical or thunderous sound as the sand slides down This is the same sound Marco Polo heard when he passed this way on his own camel caravan 700 years ago Guangzhou Canton Foreigners have been turning up in Guangzhou for a couple of thousand years for it was China s first major seaport This has made for such dramatic historical incidents as the Opium Wars which broke out when the authorities cracked down on the opium trade here This crowded city has maintained its gateway role Ever since 1957 the biannual Canton Trade Fair has attracted throngs of international business people Even in the years of political upheaval Guangzhou kept open the nation s ties with foreign countries and with overseas Chinese millions of whom have their roots here in Guangdong Province Guangzhou straddles the Pearl River China s fifth longest river which links the metropolis to the South China Sea The waterway provides a good deal of charm and excitement The daily drama of ferryboats freighters junks with dirty grey sails low lying sampans even small tankers and big gunboats unfolds right in the center of town The river is also used to irrigate the surrounding farmlands which yield a cornucopia of rice fruit and vegetables With a population above 6 million Guangzhou is primarily an industrial city of more than 3 200 factories Production lines turn out buses ships agricultural machinery chemicals and sewing machines It is one of China s richest cities with new skyscrapers expressways and fashionable shopping centers to prove it Although the economy has changed radically in recent years many local traditions live on including the love of flowers Cantonese Opera and the local dialect incomprehensible to fellow Chinese And then there is Cantonese food some say the world s greatest cuisine much appreciated in its adaptations internationally but unexcelled when created in its home kitchen Guangzhou in History In the third century b c the founder of the Qin Dynasty annexed the remote Guangzhou area thus furnishing China with its first major seaport By the end of the Han Dynasty foreign trade linked the port with other areas of Asia as well as with the Roman Empire The name Guangzhou was bestowed during the Kingdom of Wu third century a d but foreigners came to call it Canton As commerce expanded so did the foreign population of the port By the ninth century a large colony of Arabs Jews Persians and others had settled here They traded in tea silk and porcelain all in constant demand abroad It was to be another seven centuries before Europeans established themselves in Canton The Portuguese were first followed by Spaniards Dutch and English The Chinese authorities tried to keep the foreigners at arm s length limiting their activities to certain districts and seasons The expansion of trade did eventually bring conflict because China would accept nothing less than silver bullion in payment for its exports However the wily British soon thought of an alternative commodity opium see page 41 The Opium Wars ended in 1842 with the Treaty of Nanking later denounced as unequal Under the terms of the treaty China was compelled to open Canton and four other ports to foreign penetration The ever shakier Manchu Dynasty fell in 1911 to be replaced by the Chinese Republic founded by Guangdong s most famous native son Dr Sun Yat sen In 1927 the Communist led forces who established the Guangzhou Commune were wiped out by the troops of Chiang Kai shek During World War II the Japanese occupied Guangzhou In the subsequent civil war Guangzhou briefly served as the Nationalist capital before the Communists captured the city and gained power nationwide in 1949 Sightseeing Guangzhou can t claim to compete with Beijing or Xi an when it comes to sightseeing attractions But its monuments and parks are well worth visiting not least for the chance to mingle with the Cantonese people themselves Yue Xiu Park near the Trade Fair in the northern part of the city covers a 93 hectare 230 acre site In addition to its pretty gardens lakes pavilions and sports facilities Guangzhou s largest park also contains the city s oldest building the red Tower Overlooking the Sea Zhenhailou Actually tower is a misleading description for this building of five stories Built in 1380 it now houses the municipal museum Guangzhou Bowuguan With signs in English and Chinese the museum is quite interesting and includes artifacts and displays recording the city s contacts with the West from Bibles to radios The top floor of this watchtower museum is now a charming teahouse An equally famous but modern landmark in the park is a granite sculptural representation of five handsome rams based on the legend of Guangzhou s founding It is said that five gods descended from heaven riding rams holding sprigs of rice in their mouths The celestial visitors distributed the rice blessing the local people with eternal freedom from famine The gods thereupon disappeared according to the story but the five rice bearing rams turned to stone And here they are or at least their replicas giving Guangzhou its nickname City of Rams Dr Sun Yat sen 1866 1925 who began his political career in the city is honored in Yuexiu Park by an obelisk 30 m about 100 ft tall South of the park is an even more impressive monument to the statesman the Sun Yat sen Memorial Hall built in 1931 This vast modern version of a traditional Chinese building with its sweeping blue tile roofs contains an auditorium big enough to seat nearly 5 000 people Guangzhou s prime Buddhist monument the Temple of the Six Banyan Trees Liurongsi was founded over 1 400 years ago The trees that inspired the 11th century poet and calligrapher Su Dongpo to name the temple have died but the often restored complex remains a focus of local Buddhist activities Overlooking it all is the Flower Pagoda Huata a slender relic of the Song Dynasty From the outside the pagoda appears to be nine tiers high but there are really 17 floors inside Adjacent is an unusual death hall where the departed their pictures posted on the walls are remembered in daily prayers for a fee of course In the early medieval period Guangzhou had a significant Muslim population as a result of trade with the Near East This is how it came to pass that the city has what is said to be the oldest mosque in China the Huaisheng Mosque built in 627 Its white minaret can be climbed via a spiral staircase for a view of the courtyards gardens and Guangzhou s modern skyscrapers The city s leading tribute to the days of imperial splendor is the Chen Family Temple Chenjiaci a memorial to members of a large merchant clan from all over China This sprawling compound of courtyards and showy 19th century pavilions is decorated in a pantheon of finely carved friezes gates and gold leaf tableaux depicting scenes of Chinese myth and romance The atmosphere of 19th century colonial Canton is best evoked by Shamian Island in the Pearl River linked to central Guangzhou by two bridges This small residential enclave shaded by banyan trees was the closed community of the foreign colony in the era of the Western concessions The stately European style buildings including old banks factories and churches have been spruced up Sidewalk caf s boutiques traditional craft shops and the stunning White Swan Hotel make this Guangzhou s leading place for a stroll Across from Shamian Island is China s most notorious and colorful marketplace Qingping A maze of alleys crammed with stalls Qingping offers up acres of herbs spices jade antiques memorabilia goldfish songbirds and a sometimes nightmarish display of live animals destined for the kitchen including dogs cats and rare species Among modern attractions the flashiest is Oriental Studio 2000 Guangzhou s answer to Hollywood s Universal City where daily shows are staged on two movie sets one evoking notorious Shanghai in the 1930s the other a traditional courtyard in the throes of a kungfu battle No visit to Guangzhou is complete without indulging in its famous cuisine particularly its fresh seafood and delicate dim sum Two of the best dining spots are its traditional garden restaurants Beiyuan and Banxi Beiyuan consists of over 40 dining pavilions and tearooms each decorated in intricate latticework Banxi on the shores of Liwan Lake also has a classic d cor with etched glass from the Qing Dynasty and delicacies to match The availability and proximity of fresh ingredients is one good reason why Cantonese food tastes so special in its native city almost unrecognizable from many of the simulations so prevalent abroad Guilin Kweilin China s most famous landscapes the subjects of thousands of paintings are to be found in Guilin The finest mountains and rivers under heaven are so inspiring that poets artists and tourists have made this China s number one natural attraction The climate is subtropical with an annual rainfall of 190 cm 75 inches so avoid the rainiest season from April through July An additional incentive for visiting in autumn is the sight and fragrance of osmanthus cassia blossoms all over town in fact the name Guilin means Cassia Woods Tourists are so numerous in the otherwise relaxed shopping district of Guilin that the pedestrian crossings have signs in English as well as Chinese Another cosmopolitan influence comes from the area s many minority peoples Guilin is part of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region which borders Vietnam The proliferation of so called Muslim restaurants is explained by the presence here of thousands of people of the traditionally Muslim Zhuang nationality China s largest minority group The geological history of Guilin the key to the wonder of its moody mountains and caves goes back several hundred million years The area was under the sea when an upheaval raised it to the status of terra firma Later it was flooded then lifted again in further cataclysmic events The alternation of sea water and air through the millennia created limestone formations called karst which eroded into pinnacles mounds and peaks that captivate the imagination Guilin was settled more than 2 000 years ago when the Ling canal was built effectively linking the great Yangzi and Pearl rivers Guilin s connection with one of mankind s most ambitious engineering projects was important but otherwise little was heard from the town It served as provincial capital for several hundred years and in modern times thanks to the profusion of caves to hide in Guilin was a center for resistance during the war with Japan Today rebuilt from the rubble of war the city is thriving thanks in large measure to its spectacular scenery On the River The transcendent tourist experience of Guilin and perhaps of all China is a boat trip on the Li River The karst scenery could hardly be more romantic But life along the river is also fascinating washerwomen squatting on the shore water buffalo ambling down for a dip the improvised ferryboats and the captive cormorant birds their necks ringed to prevent them from swallowing all their catch waiting for orders to go fishing from bamboo rafts Large flat bottomed tour boats usually leave early in the morning from the quay near the Liberation Bridge in central Guilin In the dry season when the river is at its lowest the first part of the journey must be undertaken by coach With room for more than 100 passengers each most of these vessels are quiet and serve a lunch cooked en route Even before leaving town the spectacle begins On the right bank is Elephant Trunk Hill the first of many peaks that romantics have endowed with animal or supernatural identities It takes no great imagination to see the resemblance of this outcrop to an elephant drinking in the river the space between the trunk and the body has been hollowed through The river traffic meanwhile keeps amateur photographers snapping in all directions at flat bottomed tubs hand poled bamboo rafts sampans and towboats Images unroll before the eye like a painted scroll as your boat continues downstream Tunneled Hill Pagoda Hill also known as Battleship Hill Washing Vase Hill and Fighting Cocks Hills facing each other from opposite banks of the river A large village on the left bank Dragon Gate Village is noted for water chestnuts and its thousand year old banyan tree To the south is a much larger village Daxu with a high bridge from the Ming period called Longevity Bridge Here and elsewhere the rich flat land produces the ingredients for a formidable fruit salad oranges and grapefruit chestnuts and persimmons plus exotic tropical delicacies all but unknown outside Asia Adding to the entrancing beauty of the scene great stands of a feathery variety of bamboo grow along the riverbanks forming huge cascades of green Beyond the village of Yangdi unfolds the uncanny scenery that prompted a Chinese poet more than a thousand years ago to write The river is a green silk belt the mountains emerald hairpins Peaks and pinnacles crowd the river white goats pose on steep mountainsides and an eagle soars above the cliffs The river itself flows green and transparent Credit for this limpid rarity goes not only to the strict antipollution standards to protect the River Li but also to nature itself which endows the water with a high content of carbonic acid Mural Hill is so called because the sheer cliff face comprises so many patches of color that it might be a fresco In the lights and shadows of the cliff the shapes of nine different horses can be discerned hence the cliff s alternate name Nine Horse Hill Near the end of the voyage the village of Xinping comes into view on the left bank surrounded by magical scenery landmarks with names like Snail Hill Five Fingers Hill and Carp Hill The boat trips end at the county town of Yangshuo a favorite of poets and painters and a destination in its own right The distance traversed by river is a mere 83 km 52 miles but there is no river trip like it The trip back to Guilin by bus provides yet another facet to the soaring scenery Sightseeing in Guilin It s not only the river journey that makes a visit here so rewarding The town itself also has much to offer Hills and Parks The best way to appreciate Guilin s unique setting is to climb to the summit of one of its limestone pinnacles for example the hill called Diecaishan on the north side of town The name means Piled Silk Hill or Folded Brocade Hill a metaphor suggested by the layers of rock Hiking to the lookout point at the top is strenuous but catching your breath is only one of the good reasons for stopping along the way For instance there is Breezy Cave which cuts through the hill from south to north It is permanently cooled by a refreshing breeze to the great relief of grateful crowds on hot summer days The many inscriptions carved into the cave walls over the centuries are much admired by connoisseurs of calligraphy At the summit where the altitude is 223 m 732 ft the charmingly named Catch Cloud Pavilion Nayunting provides a 360 degree panorama The view is worth savoring the winding river the tile roofed cityscape the green flat farmland and the surreal hills forever popping up near and far Closer to the city center is Fuboshan Whirlpool Hill another natural stone tower with a view as well as other distractions According to legend a General Fubo who passed this way 2 000 years ago tested his sword in the Sword Testing Stone a stalactite formation that comes down to within inches of the ground Further on the Thousand Buddha Cliff is carved with several hundred figures dating from the Tang and Song dynasties The District of the Two Lakes in the southern part of town has been made into a delightful public park with gardens walkways and pagodas Originally Banyan Tree Lake Ronghu and Fir Tree Lake Shahu were a single expanse forming part of the moat which protected the city wall The Song Dynasty era Green Belt Bridge across the middle created the two lakes Caves Around Guilin you ll find caves of every size and mood gloomy inspiring immense or coy Most tourist itineraries take in one of the two best known caves Reed Flute or Seven Star on opposite sides of town Reed Flute Cave Ludiyan burrows deep into a hill while on the surface grow reeds suitable for making flutes The visions within are strange indeed and benefit from good lighting effects As in most other caverns certain formations have been given poetic names Apart from Virgin Forest and Giant Lion there is one huge rock that suggests the form of an Old Scholar seated in contemplation of a simulated waterfall across the way According to legend a scholar tried to write a poem worthy of the cave s beauty but before he could find adequate words he had turned to stone The cave s largest chamber called the Crystal Palace can accommodate a thousand people Bats inhabit the darker recesses but the eerie waters that flow through the cave have no fish Seven Star Cave Qixingyan is a mere million years old and has been a tourist attraction for more than a thousand years Some of the scenic formations of stalactites and stalagmites have names like Old Banyan Tree Welcoming Guests and Dragon Splashing Water providing an idea of the poetic license enjoyed by Chinese cave explorers The round trip tour of this cave is considerably longer than the itinerary in the Reed Flute Cave Both underworlds have constant comfortable temperatures year round but they are dripping with a humidity that makes the going slippery Another attraction of Seven Star Park is its Forest of Steles a cliff where poems and pictures have been carved into rock over the past 1 500 years An Amusement Park One of Guilin s newer attractions is the Minorities Cultural Park Fengqingyuan on the eastern shore of the Li River This ethnic amusement park where members of the Zhuang Dong and Miao minorities in traditional costumes display their native cultures is as educational as it is entertaining Hangzhou Hangchow Several dozen lakes in China are named West Lake but only one is so celebrated that it needs no further identification It is West Lake Xihu in Hangzhou on China s east coast The Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo likened West Lake to one of ancient China s greatest beauties Xizi who was also calm soft delicate and enchanting The girls of Hangzhou are still famous for their light clear complexion which is attributed to the mild humid climate But Hangzhou has more than scenery The capital of Zhejiang Province Hangzhou is 189 km 117 miles from Shanghai about three hours by train and two hours by bus or car on the new toll road A city of over a million people rich in historic and cultural monuments it also offers some educational outings Here you can see how two of China s major inventions silk and tea are produced Historically Hangzhou enjoyed 237 years of imperial glory from the ninth century onward In all 14 kings and emperors held court here When Marco Polo visited in the 13th century he pronounced the city superior to all others in the world in grandeur and beauty as well as its abundant delights which might lead an inhabitant to imagine himself in paradise Hangzhou is the southern terminus of the world s first canal the Grand Canal which is still in use It is said that the emperor extended it to Hangzhou so that he could choose concubines from among the city s most beautiful women West Lake For a full panorama of West Lake and the city go up to the viewing platforms at a pavilion atop Wu Hill Wushan south of the lake The hilltop is richly forested with gingko maple and camphor trees Another vista spot is located on the summit of the hill on the north side of the lake where the hauntingly beautiful Baochu Pagoda stands But the beauty of the lake can best be appreciated at close range from the deck of a sightseeing boat or from the paths and causeways along its shore The lake edge is abundantly supplied with flowers trees and unusual in China secluded places where lovers can find privacy The highlight of a boat trip across West Lake is the largest of three man made islands a small fairy island known as Three Pools Mirroring the Moon Santan Yinyue The island created in the Ming Dynasty was ingeniously provided with an island of its own in the center of its own lake A zigzag bridge will get you there Three small stone pagodas rebuilt in the 17th century rise from the main lake just south of the isle On the night of the Moon Festival candles are placed inside the pagodas The flickering light emanating from the small round windows gives the lake 15 reflections imitating the real moon Solitary Hill Gushan in the northern part of the lake is reached from the city by a causeway named after a Tang Dynasty poet Baijuyi In the ninth century he was demoted from a high imperial post to the job of governor of Hangzhou because he wrote poems satirizing the court This made him popular with the ordinary people The hillsides are brightened by trees and flowers and pavilions The Zhejiang Provincial Museum on Solitary Hill contains the oldest grains of cultivated rice in the world harvested 7 000 years ago From Monastery to Plantation One of the country s best known Buddhist monasteries Hangzhou s Lingyin Temple Spirits Retreat west of West Lake attracts crowds of Chinese tourists and believers The monks for this is a working monastery are kept busy supplying joss incense sticks to devout or merely fun loving visitors The main hall contains a statue of the Buddha seated on a lotus leaf Carved of camphorwood it is 191 2 m 64 ft high and thought to be the largest such sculpture in China Nearby the Peak That Flew from Afar Feilaifeng shelters 380 Buddhist stone carvings created during the Yuan Dynasty and four sacred caves The most famous sculpture is of the Laughing Buddha with a bulging belly an animated figure fashioned about a thousand years ago Further southwest into the lush West Lake hills is the village of Dragon Well where Hangzhou s celebrated Longjing tea is cultivated The villagers welcome visitors who arrive by local bus or bicycle sharing cups of tea and selling the precious leaves On the way it s worth a stop at the China Tea Museum a recently expanded attraction with displays of ceremonial tea implements and its own model teahouses Hangzhou is also renowned for its silks The Hangzhou Silk and Satin Printing and Dyeing Complex is the largest in China Tours follow the production process from the sorting of cocoons which arrive by barge in 20 kg 44 pound sacks to the silk screen printing stage At the end of the line is a shop where foreign visitors exploiting their newly gained expertise browse through the bolts of silk Other museums with tours and shops are devoted to traditional Chinese medicines and pottery The lakeside promenade also provides plenty of shopping and small restaurants But the essence of Hangzhou is its scenery The lake and hills afford some of the most scenic walking and bicycling of any city in China Harbin Only an Eskimo you would think could survive winter in Harbin the capital of China s northeastern most province Heilongjiang The average temperature stays below freezing five months of the year and in January the mercury has been known to descend to 38 C 36 F In a country of ancient cities Harbin is an anomaly Until the 20th century it never amounted to more than a fishing village Then the Manchu Dynasty agreed to let Czarist Russia build a branch of the Trans Siberian Railway through Harbin Russians and other foreigners peopled the fast growing transportation hub which soon boasted hotels and banks bars and gambling houses With the Bolshevik revolution of 1917 perhaps half a million Russian migr s fled through Siberia to Harbin consolidating the Russian appearance of the city with more pastel colored stucco houses and churches with onion domes From 1932 to 1945 Harbin was under Japanese occupation followed by one year under the Soviet army In 1946 the Chinese Communists took control of the city Under the People s Republic Harbin has become an important industrial center as well as the heart of a rich grain producing area At the Lunar New Year or Spring Festival in late January or early February Harbin puts on its keystone event a spectacular show to rival the Snow Festival of its sister city in Japan Sapporo While the rest of China is celebrating with paper lanterns Harbin is showing off with lanterns carved out of ice in its Ice Lantern Festival held downtown in Zhaolin Park Delicate sculptures and whole buildings made of ice are brilliantly illuminated It s so festive you might forget the cold The mighty Songhua River running through Harbin from west to east inevitably attracts tourists In summer months there are sightseeing launches and for the brave swimming On the south bank Stalin Park Jiangpan Gongyuan is a wide inviting promenade with its Flood Control Monument the chief focal point for visitors and vendors Visible from shore is Sun Island Tai Yangdao in the middle of the river a mixture of health resorts beach installations and gardens It now boasts Siberia Tiger Park a large animal preserve where endangered tigers dodging tourist buses train to hunt live prey before their release into the wild The main walking district the cobblestone Daoli Old Town bordered by Stalin Park retains much of Harbin s Russian heritage in its onion domed architecture Other attractions include the inactive but spectacular Santa Sophia Church and two active temples Sixth century stone tablets grace Wenmiao Harbin s temple to Confucius while Jilesi the Temple of Bliss the largest in the province hosts an active community of monks and nuns and opens onto a large lively street market One of the darker attractions is the Exhibition Hall for the Ruins of the Japanese Troops Invading China site of a secret biological warfare center set up by the occupying Japanese forces in 1939 Its existence was hidden until the 1980s A brighter site is Harbin s Children s Park where there is a miniature railway operated by children the only one of its kind in China Small trains carry passengers of all ages from Harbin Station to Beijing Station a distance of 2 km just over a mile here but in reality 1 388 km 862 miles Hohhot Huhehot The capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Hohhot is a sprawling booming city with a metropolitan population of more than one million The center of town looks to the future with new official buildings housing blocks and wide avenues but the traffic evokes nostalgia with its parade of donkey carts ox carts pony carts and farm tractors plus the usual proliferation of bicycles It might come as a surprise that Mongolians are only a small minority here Most of the residents of Hohhot are Han ethnic Chinese and Inner Mongolia s close connection with China dates back several centuries For tourists in search of the exotic though Hohhot and vicinity offer many opportunities to make contact with Mongolian traditions You can drink butter tea with millet and sleep in a yurt a felt covered circular tent A quite unexpected feature of Hohhot is its modern racecourse Under the sky blue domes of the reviewing stand visitors are often treated to a Mongolian rodeo of racing and trick riding and perhaps a procession of two humped camels Another lively spot is Xinhua Square where half the town seems to exercise and play before work returning each evening to sample the kebabs and other Muslim fare from dozens of food stalls Along nearby streets peddlers shout out their wares with equal enthusiasm whether they re selling shirts vegetables or sunglasses Cobblers work hand cranked sewing machines in the open air A bard banging a cymbal chants a story while his partner a trained monkey dons the masks and hats of various Chinese opera characters mesmerizing the crowd The Inner Mongolia Museum Nei Mengu Bowuguan has an ample display of native yurts and riding gear as well as China s largest dinosaur skeleton Among sacred sites the Xiletuzhao Temple stands out It is an active Lamaist Buddhist shrine with many Tibetan trappings Attractive to photographers is the aptly named Five Pagodas Temple Wutasi a striking 18th century structure capped with five towers Buddhist scriptures are inscribed on the outer wall in Sanskrit Tibetan and Mongolian along with carvings of 1 600 figures The Great Mosque Qingzhen Dasi built in the Ming Dynasty serves the large Hui Muslim population that lives in the neighborhood The mosque has a minaret that culminates in a Chinese style temple roof topped by a crescent The front of the prayer hall is adorned with Arabic inscriptions and ceramic abstractions Hohhot s oldest historical site situated 17 km 11 miles southwest of town is the Tomb of Princess Zhaojun Zhaojunmu In 33 b c at the age of 18 this famous Chinese beauty married a tribal chief thus bringing about what is now hailed as peace among the nationalities You can take a stroll to the top of the 33 m 98 ft earthen pyramid built above her grave and from here look out over the endless flat farmland Southeast of Hohhot is the 12th century White Pagoda known in Chinese as Wanbuhua Yanjingta the Pagoda of the Ten Thousand Scriptures The seven tier octagonal structure standing all alone in farmland was constructed of brick about 900 years ago and recently restored The Grasslands The most memorable aspect of a visit to Hohhot is likely to be an excursion to the grasslands across the desolate Daqing Mountains where horseback riding is a way of life among Mongolians A good paved road eases the strain of the zigzag climb that continues up approximately 2 000 m more than 6 500 ft above sea level Most visitors end up at either Xilamuren or Gegentala At these tourist camps guests sleep in wool felt yurts with quilts hot water flasks and electric lights Bathing facilities and dining halls are often in separate buildings Daily activities can include archery Mongolian wrestling visits to local villages and horseback riding on the celebrated grasslands Folk dancing and singing provide evening entertainment Visitors might also be treated to an informal rodeo in which Mongolian horsemen race their energetic ponies Disarmingly the cowboys are dressed like ordinary Chinese farmers Tourists are then offered the chance to ride camels stepladders are provided for mounting these mild mannered animals and ponies Travelers with more time can venture deeper into the wilderness grasslands where there is a better chance of sleeping in a real yurt not one specially furnished for foreign visitors Other popular destinations west of Hohhot are the Genghis Khan Mausoleum in the Ordoes Highlands actually built in 1954 and recently augmented with a reconstructed Yuan Dynasty village and the nearby Resonant Sand Gorge and Wudang Lama Temple Huangshan Hwang Shan Although Yellow Mountain is the literal translation of Huangshan which is not one mountain but a range of dozens of peaks yellow is not the color that first comes to mind when describing this romantic site that has been the subject of Chinese poetry and painting for centuries In reality green is the color of the stunted pines clinging to purple cliff faces Pink are the wildflowers blue the sky and white the sea of clouds that rolls in beneath the rocky pinnacles Huangshan is the only region of eastern China s Anhui Province that appears on major tourist itineraries Trains and planes link Shanghai with a terminus at the foot of the mountains where coaches continue the journey The scenic mountain resort now has hotel facilities from extremely basic to comfortable Chinese tourists and poets might spend a week or more exploring the mountains but foreign visitors try to squeeze it all into a day or two The weather can be a critical factor in the pleasure of mountain rambles and sightseeing On average mid July to the end of September is considered the most dependable time of year because of the mild temperatures and relatively restrained rainfall Drizzle rather than heavy rain generally falls from late May to late June when the spring flowers burst forth but temperatures are brisk Mist and fog often enhance the views Huangshan has many peaks that are well known by name in China often through thousands of poems describing these as China s most beautiful mountains The three principal summits are Lotus Flower Peak Lianhuafeng Bright Summit Guangmingding and the Heavenly Capital Peak Tiandufeng All are over 1 800 m 6 000 ft and all can be climbed via endless stone stairs some as steep as ladders Climbs begin on the east side of the range at Yungu Temple where a cable car whisks some visitors to the summit while most begin an 8 km 5 mile hike At the twin summits the Northern and Western Sea of Clouds there are a large hotel and smaller inns the place to get some rest before viewing the sunrise The descent on the west side is longer with up to 14 km 9 miles of paths and stairs When hiking becomes too strenuous Huangshan visitors can recuperate in a hot spring resort between Purple Cloud Peak Ziyunfeng and Peach Blossom Peak Taohuafeng Here piping hot water with a curative mineral content bubbles from the spring year round You can drink it bathe in it or both The Huangshan phenomenon that has most inspired painters and photographers is the sight of cottony clouds nuzzling the mountainsides The peaks and pinnacles jutting above the clouds in the early morning sky look like islets in a celestial sea If there s a single source for classic Chinese landscape painting it s surely Huangshan Jinan Tsinan Sweet water gushes from more than 100 springs within the city limits of Jinan the capital of Shandong Shantung Province The water enhances agriculture and industry and even turns this City of Springs into a tourist attraction And thanks to nature s generosity Jinan is the only city in China where you can safely drink the tap water Even so most visitors only pass through Jinan on their way to such traditional sights of Shandong as the holy mountain Taishan see page 163 and Qufu the birthplace of Confucius see page 195 The Jinan area seems to have been inhabited since the New Stone Age More than 2 500 years ago a town wall was built Jinan has been a prosperous provincial capital since the medieval period At the turn of the 20th century the Manchu Dynasty granted foreign concessions in Jinan prompting an influx of Europeans The city was a focus of bitter fighting during the Chinese Civil War Today more than a million people live in the city Sightseeing starts among the weeping willows along the shores of the Lake of Great Light Daminghu in the northern part of the old city In recent years the lake has been dredged and stone embankments built All around it are parks playgrounds and pavilions Southeast of the city is Thousand Buddha Mountain Qianfoshan but instead of a thousand Buddha images you ll find a hundred today And at only 280 m about 900 ft above sea level it is more a hill than a mountain But a hike up the hill and down again permits a close look at old temples grottoes with Buddhist statues and refreshing forests Of all the springs in Jinan the one with the most historical associations is the Jet Spring Baotuquan It was from this spring in the 17th century that the Qing Dynasty Emperor Kangxi took a swig and pronounced it the First Spring Under Heaven It is now surrounded by a carefully landscaped park A short walk away is Black Tiger Spring Heihuquan its sweet water roaring from the mouths of three tigers carved in a black stone cliffside As the provincial capital Jinan is the site of the Shandong Provincial Museum where more than 400 000 items illustrate local history and nature The highlight of the collection is an exhibition of Longshan Black Pottery found near Jinan an elegant delicate ware fired 4 000 years ago Kaifeng The ancient walled city of Kaifeng located in eastern Henan Honan Province lies near enough to the unpredictable Yellow River to have known more than its share of catastrophes and when it wasn t being flooded it was being pillaged The most terrible of the invasions in the 12th century ended the dreams of the Northern Song Dynasty and left Kaifeng in ruins All things considered it s almost miraculous that several historic buildings have survived to this day So remarkably has much of the city s old imperial dignity Kaifeng rose to fame more than 2 000 years ago during the Warring States period when it was capital of the Kingdom of Wei 220 265 The city s most prosperous and glorious era was between the years 960 and 1127 when it was the Eastern Capital of the Northern Song Dynasty The Iron Pagoda Tieta Kaifeng s best known symbol only looks as if it s made of iron The exterior walls are faced with glazed bricks and tiles of an iron like hue Built in 1049 and restored in modern times it is a lucky 13 tiers tall It was originally part of a sixth century monastery complex but the other buildings were washed away in one of the great floods of the 19th century Another relic of the Song Dynasty the square and imposing Pota Pagoda of the Po Family reveals none of the high flying grace of the Iron Pagoda This might be excused by the fact that the top three tiers of the building collapsed several hundred years ago In the northwest quarter of the city the Imperial Way of the Song emperors has been reconstructed Tile roofed shops line the street for three blocks terminating at the entrance to Dragon Pavilion Park Longtingyuan Its double decker central pavilion with upswept golden roofs was reconstructed in the 17th century West from Dragon Pavilion Park along the lakeshore is the Stele Forest of the Imperial Academy an outdoor arena with over 3 000 ancient carved tablets Nearby is Kaifeng s newest tourist attraction the Qingming Park Up the River a theme park modeled after a 12th century scroll picturing festive and imperial Kaifeng At the center of Kaifeng the main attraction is the Xiangguo Monastery founded in the sixth century Inside is the gilded statue of the Thousand Armed and Thousand Eyed Buddha which incredibly has more than the advertised number of arms and eyes Outside the temple is a the city s liveliest and largest open air market complete with dancing monkeys A community of Jews migrated to Kaifeng in about the tenth century They established a synagogue in 1163 and maintained a community until the great flood of 1852 Although assimilated as many as a hundred Kaifeng residents still claim Jewish heritage Stone tablets recording the history of Jews in Kaifeng are stored in the Kaifeng Museum The grounds of the Purity and Truth Synagogue Qingzhensi north of a Catholic church and east of a mosque can still be located with the help of local guides Kunming Flights into Kunming the capital of Yunnan Province land on an unexpectedly long runway that has a dramatic history commemorated neither by plaques nor monuments This was once the end of the line for the Flying Tigers the American pilots who supplied China in World War II Kunming was also the Chinese terminus for supplies traveling down the tortuous Burma Road milestone 0 otherwise unmarked can be seen on the right side of the road 21 km 13 miles from the center of Kunming on the edge of the Western Hills One of Kunming s best attractions is its benign climate At an altitude of 1 894 m more than 6 200 ft temperatures are pleasantly mild producing what is described as perpetual springtime During one season or another the camellia azalea magnolia and begonia are in flower and the region is renowned as China s pharmacopoeia The thatched roofs of farmhouses are draped with drying corn and chili peppers The total metropolitan population stands at 2 million of which half live in the city proper To make it all the more exotic a high proportion of the citizens belong to minority nationalities and often appear in ethnic costumes The city s leading university the Institute for Nationalities enrolls over 20 000 minority students Downtown Kunming has modernized rapidly but there are still a few touches of the old the exotic and the scenic a colorful bird and flower market the Nancheng Ancient Mosque the blind masseurs who work outside in the public square at the Workers Cultural Hall A few charming older neighborhoods remain around the city s main park Green Lake Cuihui and the lake is charming too particularly on a Sunday when families visit and in winter when the laughing gulls stop over on their way from Siberia Then there s Kunming s most interesting temple Qiongzhusi the Bamboo Temple 13 km 8 miles northwest of downtown It houses the surreal work of a 19th century sculptor who created a version of the 500 arhats followers of the Buddha unequaled at any other Buddhist temple in China Kunming s prime scenic and recreational area is at Lake Dian China s sixth largest Tour boats cruise the crystal waters Grand View Park Daguan Gongyuan on one shore provides the flowers for which Kunming is famous along with arched bridges and pavilions On the opposite shore the rich green slopes of the Western Hills Xishan rise abruptly One newer attraction on Lake Dian is the Yunnan Nationalities Village an ethnic theme park exhibiting 24 minority mini villages probably the best such park in China A strenuous climb up the sheer face of the Western Hills via tunnels and stair treads carved from stone ultimately leads to Dragon s Gate Longmen During the Ming Dynasty the emperor was carried all the way up from the lakeside by four bearers There are several excellent places to stop and catch your breath on the way up including a teahouse a former concubines residence and an emperor s temporary living quarters The gate itself is wide enough for only one person to pass through at a time Caves painstakingly cut into the mountainside contain colorful painted carvings all the work of a single minded Daoist monk of the 18th century and his followers The Stone Forest Shilin From Kunming it s just 80 km 50 miles southeast to Yunnan s most popular scenic attraction the Stone Forest This is an otherworldly fantasy of twisted limestone hundreds of millions of years old the world s largest natural stone maze Geologists say this wonder originated 200 million years ago with the interaction of limestone sea water rainwater and seismic upheavals The bizarre pinnacles that resulted are of the distinctive type of limestone called karst the same geology one finds in Guilin The Stone Forest covers about 26 000 hectares 64 000 acres of Yunnan Province but most tourists confine themselves to a manageable area of concentrated wonders Here there are paved paths protective railings and a few painted signs but it is indeed possible to lose one s way inside this massive labyrinth Near the starting point women from the neighboring village members of the Sani tribe of the Yi nationality sell embroidered blouses bags and assorted knickknacks The Sani also work as freelance guides In an open area beyond a grove of giant bamboo is the formal entrance to the forest a wall carved with the Chinese characters for Shilin Many of the formations resemble particular animals plants buildings and characters out of Chinese classics You will find one pinnacle in the image of an Elephant on a Stone Terrace and another like a Rhinoceros Looking at the Moon At one point in the maze you must squeeze through the Narrowest Pass doing so according to Sani legend adds ten years to your life From Peak Viewing Pavilion the highest point in the Stone Forest there s a comprehensive view of this great thicket of jagged rocks thrusting skyward The biggest open space in the Stone Forest a lawn surrounded by cherry trees is the site of a Sani festival each June For 48 continuous hours the tribesmen devote themselves to singing and dancing wrestling matches bullfights actually water buffalo fighting each other feasting and romancing Many of the celebrants come from Five Tree Village Wukeshu across Shilin Lake from the hotel This community of several thousand Sani residents shelters water buffalo pigs goats and dogs The Sani themselves live in thatched roof mud and wattle houses Those who stay the night in the Stone Forest are usually entertained with a Sani folklore show Among the instruments in the orchestra are flutes zithers and a giant banjo with a hollow bottom Women dancers wear red white and black conical hats while the men sport floppy black turbans Through song and mime they recount the legends that link their people to the otherworldly presence of the Stone Forest Lanzhou Lanchow Two legendary thoroughfares pass through Lanzhou the broad powerful Yellow River and the ancient trade route known as the Silk Road Today the big busy city boasts broad new boulevards as well as intriguing old streets of shops and houses Adding local color members of minority nationalities mostly Muslim Hui people and Tibetans contribute their own customs costumes and cuisine to the cosmopolitan mix In some neighborhoods the pavements are crowded with free market peddlers and artisans Lanzhou is the capital of Gansu Kansu Province which extends from the farmland of the Yellow River basin through the narrow Gansu corridor with its steep rocky mountains to China s far west of desert and oases Lanzhou received its name under the Sui Dynasty more than a thousand years ago In recent times its role as a transportation center has strengthened with the spread of the railways and air routes Industrial development here since 1949 has transformed the city adding vast new suburbs of oil refineries and factories The population of the metropolitan area now tops 2 million The Gansu Provincial Museum Sheng Bowuguan just across the street from the big Soviet style Huaiyi Hotel houses Silk Road treasures and perhaps the most famous sculpture in all of China the galloping Flying Horse of Gansu With its right rear leg touching a symbolic bird the Gansu horse is the subject of countless reproductions at home and abroad The original bronze was found in an ancient Han Dynasty tomb in Gansu Province in 1969 You can buy a bronze copy in the museum shop for a tidy sum For a view of the muddy swiftly moving Yellow River and the city along its banks go along to White Pagoda Hill Park Baitashan Gongyuan once a military stronghold The temple itself an octagonal seven tier structure was rebuilt in the 15th century Five Springs Hill Park Wuquanshan Gongyuan climbs a steep mountainside on the opposite bank of the river The springs provide water for various needs from making tea to ensuring fertility To break up the climb there are temples and pavilions to visit and a big pond crossed by a crooked bridge The temples date from the 14th century one artifact a 5 ton bronze bell was cast in 1202 West of Lanzhou are the magnificent Thousand Buddha Temple and Caves Binglingsi Shiku with ancient frescoes and hundreds of statues and at Xiahe the Labrang Monastery Labolengsi one of the largest and most active lamaseries outside of Tibet Southeast of Lanzhou requiring an overnight visit is one of the most celebrated of the great Buddhist grottoes the Maijishan Caves Maijishan Shiku dating back to the fourth century Leshan From the provincial capital of Chengdu a three hour drive via a new expressway through populous Sichuan Szechuan Province ends at the town of Leshan the base for visits to a monumental riverside Buddha and to one of four sacred mountains of Chinese Buddhism Emeishan A 13th century poet wrote that the most beautiful scenery of China is found in Sichuan and indeed some of the best of that scenery is concentrated in Leshan Here three rivers converge and flow along the city wall and far away in the mist rises Mt Emei Open boats ferry visitors from Leshan to the site of the Great Buddha Dafo Whether seen from the river or later from the hillsides the world s largest seated Buddha is an impressive spectacle Carved from the cliffside by a monk starting in the year 713 its height is 71 m 233 ft The statue s feet are so big that a hundred people can sit on each instep The boats tie up some distance from the Buddha and passengers climb from the shore to Dark Green Temple Wuyousi with its view of Mt Emei the gate to Western Paradise A pathway and suspension bridge lead back to the Great Buddha There the Stairs of Nine Turnings wind steeply down one side of the statue to the feet Another honeycombed stairway carved from the cliff leads back up the other side coming out level with Buddha s massive crown where you have a view of the Buddha s serene and knowing countenance More temples and caves lie on the road back to the boat landing and the buses to the sacred peak Mt Emei Dubbed the fairest mountain among the fair mountains of the world Mt Emei reaches an altitude of well over 3 000 m over 10 000 ft You don t have to climb all the way to the summit of Emeishan to appreciate its charm and mystique But the higher you go the more chance you ll have of sighting the rich fauna of the hill forests from gregarious monkeys to red pandas This was the traditional Buddhist Peak of the West the mountain shrine to countless pilgrims emperors included At the foot of Mt Emei are the 16th century Loyalty to Country Temple Baoguosi and the Crouching Tiger Temple Fuhusi foreshadowing the many temples ahead There are monasteries and famous scenic spots every few kilometers along the paths to the summit but this is a climb for the energetic only that requires several days Many tourists have time to spend only a night on the mountain in one of the basic inns such as those at the Shrine of Limpid Waters Jinshui before being driven to the summit before dawn to see the famous sunrise At sunrise on Golden Peak Jinding pilgrims and vacationers alike gather in hopes of seeing an optical phenomenon called Buddha s Halo Here each viewer can see his or her shadow perfectly framed inside a bright halo formed when the morning sea of clouds below Suicide Precipice is penetrated by the rising sun Luoyang Loyang The population of Luoyang today stands at nearly a million almost the same as it was during the Sui Dynasty 1 400 years ago when it shared the imperial court with Chang an present day Xi an Those were the days of imperial splendor and glory Luoyang is sometimes known as the Capital for Nine Dynasties reflecting a political and cultural prominence that originated nearly 4 000 years ago In the tenth century the imperial court moved from Luoyang to the northeast Luoyang later became capital of the central province of Henan but by the 20th century it was merely a shadow of its former self After the Communists took power they decided to revive the small sleepy city as a model industrial center Hundreds of new factories were built turning out tractors mining equipment ball bearings and thousands of other products The Luoyang Museum housed in a Ming Dynasty temple contains the fossil of an elephant tusk half a million years old Stone Age pottery Shang bronzes and glazed Tang ceramic figures The nearby Wangcheng Park with its two Han Dynasty tombs is a delight during the late April peony season But Luoyang s most precious relics are to be found outside of town A short distance east of Luoyang is White Horse Temple Baimasi which dates from the first century a d It is often cited as the first Buddhist monastery built in China The name refers to the story of two envoys returning from India with two Indian monks they met along the way The monks transported the first Buddhist scriptures to China on the backs of white horses Longmen Caves Counted among the most precious of the grotto complexes in China the Longmen Caves lie about 14 km 9 miles south of Luoyang The name Longmen which means Dragon s Gate might derive from the lie of the land here cliffs standing like gate towers rise on either side of the River Yi The best time to visit is early morning when the rising sun lights up the contours of the statues giving them an eerie lifelike quality The hard rock here was conducive to delicate carving carried out on a monumental scale for about 400 years starting in a d 494 More than 1 300 grottoes were constructed as well as 2 100 niches and nearly 100 000 statues These range from a height of about 17 m 56 ft to a fingernail sized 2 cm less than an inch In addition there are 40 pagodas and more than 3 600 inscribed steles or tablets of keen interest to historians and calligraphers Some priceless sculpture was in the past looted by Europeans and Americans Guides often point out one wall from which two classic reliefs were chiseled in 1935 by a Chinese curio dealer bribed by an American The works ended up in museums in New York and Kansas City Some of the earliest constructions were the three Binyang Grottoes dedicated to an emperor and empress of the Northern Wei Dynasty 386 534 after the capital was transferred to Luoyang The principal sculpture five times life size displays features typical of that dynasty s Buddhist art a thin face large eyes straight nose and quiet smile An inscription reports that these works required the labor of 802 366 craftsmen The subtleties of Tang Dynasty art can be seen in the Qianqi cave temple begun in the year 641 and in the Fengxian cave temple constructed a few years later The Fengxian cave shelters a 17 m 56 ft Buddha seated atop a thousand petaled lotus and accompanied by lesser but equally brilliant statues of his disciples The fierce heavenly guard trampling a devil underfoot is thought to bring good luck to those who put their arms around his ankle but an iron fence keeps most onlookers at bay Probably the oldest and one of the most beautiful of the grottoes is Guyang begun in 495 and completed under the Northern Qi in 575 The Buddha depicted here is guarded by two magnificent lions at his feet and the Buddha s head is a Qing Dynasty replacement for the original A great curiosity of the complex not at all sculptural is the Grotto of Prescriptions Yaofangdong begun in the year 575 The 120 inscriptions here amount to a compendium of ancient Chinese illnesses and treatments The showstoppers at Longmen carved in the years 680 and 675 respectively are the Cave of Ten Thousand Buddhas Wanfodong with 15 000 little Buddhas carved into its niches and the Honoring Ancestors Cave Juxianshiku constructed at the behest of Tang Empress Wu It is the largest cave at Longmen and the large Buddha inside it is said to bear the face of the never humble Empress Wu herself Nanjing Nanking This ancient capital of China has suffered so many catastrophes that few historic monuments have survived and these are widely dispersed Perhaps this is why so much emphasis is placed on modern triumphs such as the heroic bridge across the Yangzi River that has become Nanjing s emblem But past and present are often juxtaposed in Nanjing like the blue pedicabs sharing the streets with big new buses or the fresh pink and white plum blossoms on the hillsides around the Mingxiaoling tomb Nanjing a booming city of over 5 million is about 300 km 185 miles west of Shanghai in Jiangsu Kiangsu Province Here the great Yangzi River narrows to slightly more than one kilometer so even before there was a bridge the city had held high strategic significance Visitors are usually advised to avoid Nanjing in July and August when the heat can become debilitating temperatures of 40 C 104 F are no rarity Nanjing means Southern Capital a name conferred rather late in the city s history During its early grandeur under the State of Chu the town was called Jinling a name still used in literary and other allusions Then in the third century in the era of the Three Kingdoms it was christened Jianye Under that or similar titles it served as the capital of six southern dynasties The Ming emperors made it the national capital but this was soon moved north to Beijing in the 15th century In the 20th century a series of dramas overtook Nanjing and gave it new prominence It was here that Dr Sun Yat sen was elected president of the republic Chiang Kai shek made it his capital until the advance of Japanese invasion forces induced him to head west When the Japanese troops finally arrived here in 1937 the Rape of Nanking was added to the catalogue of war s atrocities A monument Datusha Jinianguan just outside the old city wall commemorates the victims around 100 000 died in the first four days alone The Nationalists regained the battered city after the Japanese surrender in 1945 The Communist army crossed the Yangzi which the Chinese people call Changjiang or Long River in April 1949 bringing the new order to the old capital The Yangzi River Bridge Nanjing Changjiang Daqiao is an extraordinary engineering achievement Only a few bridges span the entire river and this is the longest at 1 577 m over water it is a little less than a mile Proudly claimed to be the world s longest two tier bridge for rail and road traffic it has greatly improved contacts between North and South China And it inspired national self confidence at the time of the Sino Soviet schism of 1960 When the Soviet Union withdrew its technical experts the Chinese built it themselves in eight years Nanjing claims a little known distinction the longest city wall in the world In the 14th century the Ming rulers mobilized 200 000 workers to build fortifications extending 331 2 km nearly 21 miles The largest of 24 city gates newly renovated as a tourist attraction is the Zhonghuamen on the southern edge of Nanjing It was a formidable redoubt with tunnels for 3 000 besieged defenders and was never taken by enemies Also in southern Nanjing you can see the ruins of the Palace of the Heavenly King Tianqangfu built when the forces of the Taiping Rebellion captured the city see page 41 It was the most ambitious architectural project of the mid 19th century The Western Garden is full of fine touches an imaginative rock garden a dragon wall a children s maze and a bottle shaped lake for an imperial stone houseboat The Nanjing Museum Nanjing Bowuguan founded in 1933 is located inside Zhongshan Gate the main eastern portal of the city wall Among art and artifacts from prehistoric times to the end of the empire the museum displays colorful ancient pottery elegant figurines and a famous jade burial suit 2 000 years old Back in town the Ming Dynasty Drum Tower Gulou has been restored to its eminence on a hill in the very center of Nanjing The drum since replaced told the time and warned the citizens of danger Now there s a tearoom upstairs and a viewing deck One of the city s liveliest temples is Fuzimiao a Confucian temple located in the heart of Nanjing s main shopping district it is especially interesting to stroll through after working hours Nanjing s distinguished history as a political and cultural center accounts for its considerable local pride One area in which rivalry is freely revealed is the realm of cooking Nanjing claims its salted duck is superior to the more famous Peking duck Nanjing ducks it s pointed out are raised naturally on ponds not force fed like their less fortunate Beijing comrades Around Nanjing Chinese pilgrims of all political persuasions come from many countries to honor the founder of the Chinese Republic at the Mausoleum of Dr Sun Yat sen Zhongshanling in the Purple Hills east of Nanjing The hillside complex roofed with blue tiles completed in 1929 could scarcely be more grandiose Following a long winding avenue planted with plane trees you continue up the 392 granite steps of the ceremonial staircase to the actual memorial hall There are statues of Dr Sun standing sitting by a French sculptor Paul Landowski and recumbent above the vault itself On the ceiling is a mosaic version of the Nationalist Guomindang flag a white star on a blue background Dr Sun often roamed these hills during his Nanjing years It was his own wish that he be buried here although he could never have anticipated the imperial splendor that developed Nearby in the Purple Hills is Mingxiaoling the tomb of Emperor Hong Wu founder of the Ming Dynasty What with wars and revolutions there is not much left of the 14th century complex But don t miss the Sacred Way lined with large stone statues of elephants camels horses lions and mythical animals which turns north into an approach road guarded by statues of generals and mandarins In the hall above the burial site are displayed pictures of the emperor Guides report he was even uglier in real life two court artists are said to have lost their heads for an excess of realism in their portraits Despite its long history Nanjing is most remembered today for its role in 20th century events The Yangzi Bridge the Sun Yat Sen Memorial and the Rape of Nanjing epitomize for many the essence of Nanjing So too perhaps does Meiling Palace Meilinggong the vacation house of Chiang Kai shek and wife Song Meiling now open as a period museum for those nostalgic for the pre Revolutionary days between the Last Emperor of the Manchus and the First Chairman of the Communist Party Qingdao Tsingtao Imagine Copacabana beach set down on the shore of the Yellow Sea mix in some century old German villas and castles and paint in pinewoods parks and treelined hills for background This world class resort setting is one of the surprises of Qingdao an important seaport situated on the Shandong Shantung Peninsula Six beaches make this charming city one of China s favorite summer retreats The sea is refreshing and so usually is the air cooled in summer by the northerly ocean currents Whether or not you decide to join the Chinese masses and take the plunge you ll appreciate the chance to see them at ease sunbathing strolling having their pictures taken and eating ice cream or dumplings As you might deduce from the European architecture of the railway station and many other buildings here Qingdao has an unusual history Until the end of the 19th century there was little here apart from fishermen s houses and a minor Chinese naval base When Germany entered the imperialist age under Kaiser Wilhelm Qingdao was selected as a likely port for development A 99 year lease was imposed on the Manchu government Soon a modern German style city was built with villas a deepwater port a cathedral and a main street called Kaiser Wilhelmstrasse Business was not everything the Germans used Qingdao as a missionary base too It remains one of China s more Christian cities The twin spired Catholic cathedral Tianzhu Jiaotong and the Protestant church Jidu Jiaotong with its working clock tower tend to be crowded with local people on Sundays and have become tourist attractions German Qingdao suffered a curious fate during World War I Japan which joined the Allied forces invaded the city imprisoned the survivors of the German garrison and occupied Qingdao for the duration of the war China wasn t able to regain sovereignty until 1922 After the Communists came to power in 1949 industrial development went forward However even though the population now exceeds 4 million including the outlying regions Qingdao keeps its quiet allure As permanent as any of the German contributions to Qingdao is its brewing prowess The local beer has become China s national beer exported worldwide in big green bottles or modern cans under the old spelling of the town s name Tsingtao Brewery tours can be arranged and the Qingdao International Beer Festival in mid August has become China s first attempt at an Oktoberfest Qingdao is a remarkably walkable city Most of the German architecture is concentrated in the Badaguan District on Taiping Bay near Beach No 1 This is a lovely neighborhood of Western mansions landscaped lawns and tree lined lanes capped by what can only be described as a German castle by the sea actually the German governor s lodge during colonial days Not far from the old villas and castle is Qianhai Pier once the main berth for German ships Now the pier has been lengthened to an impressive 440 m nearly a quarter of a mile and an octagonal pavilion lies at the far end Visitors and vendors alike crowd the promenade Roving portrait photographers hustle vacationers pitching the lighthouse as a background Above the beaches with fine views of the city and the sea are a number of parks atop steep green hills In Xinhao Park there stands the opulent residence built for the German governor in 1903 Now a hotel the Qingdao Welcome Guest House is also partly a period museum The grand piano in its plush lobby dated 1876 is German But the suites off the lobby are decidedly Chinese occupied for a month in 1957 by Chairman Mao and his wife and left today just as Mao left them decades ago including his desk with its secret compartment In addition to Qingdao s stunning beaches which attract 100 000 sunbathers every summer the area is renowned for the mountain resort of Laoshan 30 km nearly 20 miles to the east Bordering the sea Laoshan is a region rich in legends waterfalls and springs Laoshan mineral water of vaunted medicinal value originates here and is sold throughout China it is also a key ingredient of the tasty beer Once the site of 72 temples Laoshan still boasts an interesting temple at its foot on the sea Xiaqinggong a Daoist retreat that dates back to 14 b c Shanghai You couldn t confuse Shanghai with any other Chinese city It is bigger more prosperous and more dynamic than any other its skyline boasts European style towers its shop windows and food stalls seize your attention Through the late 1990s Shanghai was the world s boomtown rebuilding itself and growing at a rate far beyond that of any other major city Before war and revolution changed its face Shanghai was dominated by foreign fortune hunters social climbers and a glittering array of sinners Its very name became a verb in English to shanghai meant to abduct by trickery or force Nowadays it is regaining some of its old glamour albeit without the criminal edge With 14 million people depending on how you count Shanghai is also one of the most expensive cities in the world A recent cost of living survey ranked Shanghai as the fifth most expensive city in the world ahead of London Geneva and New York Shanghai is not only expensive but extensive The metropolitan area covers about 6 000 sq km more than 2 300 sq miles which is five times the size of the city of Los Angeles Administered as a separate region like Beijing the Shanghai metropolis includes rich farmland as well as big city housing complexes and heavy industry Shanghai s present position as a great industrial and commercial center is part of an earlier 20th century colonial tradition The city has retained a special appeal to visitors as a sophisticated businesslike metropolis made all the more colorful because of its nostalgic associations Shanghai in History China s prime port began unpromisingly a thousand years ago as a fishing village on mud flats near the Yangzi River s outlet to the East China Sea Shanghai didn t officially become a town until the 13th century but even then it was largely ignored by the rest of China and the world In the 17th and 18th centuries domestic commerce increased the importance of the town as a port and marketplace But the authorities firmly resisted foreign connections until British gunboats won an invitation After the first Opium War Shanghai became one of five Chinese ports open to foreign residence and trade Over the next few years the influx of Europeans Americans and refugees from battles of the Taiping Rebellion turned Shanghai into a glamorous if naughty trading port But little of the prosperity filtered down to the ordinary citizen who was kept apart Bitterness at the injustices and corruption of Shanghai society fired the city s revolutionary movement the Chinese Communist Party was founded here in 1921 Between 1937 and 1945 Shanghai was occupied by Japanese troops most of the foreign colony was interned After the war the Guomindang Nationalists took power but Communist troops seized Shanghai in 1949 The new regime wiped out organized crime and vice expropriated factories and built new ones setting the city on a new industrial course In 1965 the Cultural Revolution was sparked off in Shanghai as the political base of Jiangqing the former Shanghai actress who was Mao s wife After the death of Mao and the arrest of the Gang of Four Shanghai culture and art experienced a renaissance and the new economic policies of the 1990s benefited Shanghai more than any other city Sightseeing As an essentially 19th century phenomenon Shanghai matured too late to contribute to classical Chinese art or culture If historic monuments are relatively rare here it doesn t mean the city lacks for sights In Shanghai the interest shifts to relics of uninhibited prewar capitalism and scenes of the city s contemporary energy and flair The port of Shanghai sums up the strange and often uncomfortable meeting of East and West of old and new The muddy Huangpu River slices through the center of the city after passing through the seemingly interminable industrial suburbs complete with their fuming smokestacks Foghorns converse into the night long after the sound of car horns and bike bells has ceased The river traffic is a motley flotilla of modern container ships and ocean going junks their sails the color of grime of packed ferries and convoys of barges warships rusty coasters and bobbing sampans Visitors can take a comfortable and endlessly fascinating riverboat tour of the Huangpu from downtown Shanghai to the mouth of the Yangzi River Returning to the city in the almost inevitable haze you see the astonishingly un Chinese skyline of Shanghai a mythical European metropolis transplanted to the Orient The riverfront promenade on the left bank of the Huangpu used to be called the Bund Waitan from an Anglo Indian word for an embankment on a muddy shore It s easy to imagine the elegance of the Bund in its heyday when the gardens were barred to dogs and Chinese in that order This is the place for relaxed people watching from early morning when the shadow boxers work out until the evening strolls of well dressed courting couples The promenade has been widened There s even a small port museum in an old brick tower Facing the river along Zhongshan Road are some grandiose old buildings a bit the worse for wear These include the Peace Hotel the Seamen s Club formerly the British consulate and the massive 1923 headquarters of the old Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank recently renovated and transformed into a Chinese bank with the separate entrances for Chinese and Europeans eliminated And east across the river is new East Shanghai known as Pudong where construction is booming and where you can enjoy a view from the top of Asia s tallest structure Around Nanjing Road One of the pleasures of Shanghai is to stroll Nanjing Road long the most famous shopping avenue in China to see what s new and what s old Ending up at the Peace Hotel now the Heping Hotel on the Bund don t fail to visit the Art Deco lobby This is where Noel Coward holed up to write Private Lives and where Steven Spielberg filmed scenes for Empire of the Sun The Peace Hotel s jazz band performing here since the 1930s still swings every evening in the north wing North from the Bund is the Ohel Moshe Synagogue Moxihuitang built in 1927 to serve Shanghai s resident and refugee Jewish population which once reached 20 000 On the south side of Nanjing Road is People s Park Renmin Gongyuan which used to feature a racecourse but gambling is sternly condemned in the People s Republic Now the only runners are the local children who play among the park s trees ponds and lawns and the kite fliers who occupy the large People s Square in front of the new Shanghai Museum Unequivocally the Shanghai Museum Shanghai Bowuguan is the best in China especially in terms of its state of the art displays and presentation There are four floors of exhibits with stalls on each floor selling gifts and museum reproductions Bronzes and stone sculptures are on the first floor ceramics are on the second floor paintings and calligraphy are on the third floor and coins jade and furniture are on the fourth floor Not all of the museum s 120 000 artifacts can be displayed here at one time but many visitors savor these displays and insist upon a return visit For a break during museum browsing there s a lovely tearoom on the second floor Old Town Just southwest of the Bund is a district known today as Old Town within the circle formed by Renminlu and Zhonghualu On Fuyoulu the Yuyuan Garden was commissioned by a Ming Dynasty mandarin As the main classical Chinese garden in Shanghai it is an absolute gem of landscaping and architecture the perfect place for the local people to seek tranquillity so conveniently offered in the heart of old Shanghai If you visit only one classic garden in China this is the best single choice Just inside the main gate is a rockery an artificial hill of inherently interesting stones held together with glutinous rice powder and lime From the pavilion atop this hill the Ming official could watch all the excitements of river life though tall buildings now intervene In front of the Hall of Ten Thousand Flowers grows a 400 year old gingko tree Another carefully created rockery is reflected in a pond teeming with giant goldfish All the corridors and pavilions bridges and walls sculptures and trees are so artfully arranged that the garden seems many times larger than its actual compact size Outside the garden walls a large rectangular pond is bisected by the Nine Turnings Bridge so shaped to deflect evil spirits The bridge is the only link to the 400 year old Huxinting Teahouse 257 Yuyuanlu which lies in the center of an illuminated pond With its upswept roofs this is an irresistible stop for tea and snacks There s no prettier teahouse in all of China The teahouse pond marks one corner of the Old Chinese City Nanshi once deemed a danger zone for European visitors You might still get lost in this maze of backstreets reminiscent of a North African souk but much of it has been renovated tastefully into the Yuyuan Shopping Center There are still shops from the old bazaar days selling chopsticks medicines bamboo fans silk and incense Also redeveloped nicely is the Temple to the Town Gods Chenghuangmiao which dates back to the 15th century and now hosts street fairs within sight of the teahouse and Yuyuan Garden as it did in previous centuries The French Quarter West of the riverside and old Chinese section is a landmark of modern history the low brick building at 76 Xingyelu where the Chinese Communist Party was founded in July 1921 This was in the French concession and when the French police learned of the clandestine meeting they raided the two story corner house But they arrived too late to find the 12 conspirators including Mao Zedong The Communist founding fathers continued their congress aboard a hired excursion boat on a lake The house is today a museum with documents and displays Today much of the finest European architecture in Shanghai is most visible in and around the French Quarter Art Deco and Tudor villas neo Gothic offices and large elegant mansions line many of the small streets The modern Garden Hotel 58 Maominglu preserves the original lobby area of the Cercle Sportif Fran ais from the 1920s The Shanghai Arts and Crafts Research Institute is housed in a wonderful old French mansion 79 Fenyanglu and allows visitors to view artisans at work on embroidery paper cutting and other crafts Nearby at 1555 Huaihaizhinglu the New Shanghai Library Shanghai Tushuguan one of the world s largest with over 13 million volumes has rare books dating back 1 400 years and a reading room for foreign language books Other old buildings open to view include Soong Ching ling s Former Residence Songqingling Guju where the wife of Sun Yat sen lived until 1963 and Sun Yat sen s Former Residence Sunzhongshan Guju where the founder of the Chinese Republic lived until 1924 The Xujiahui Cathedral a Gothic church erected in 1848 now holds masses in Chinese New Shanghai Pudong Immediately across the river from the Bund and old Shanghai is the future the Pudong New Development Zone Shanghai has over 300 skyscrapers and most of them are in Pudong in the new East Shanghai With its 88 stories China s tallest building is here the 427 m 1 400 ft Jinmao Plaza So is an even bolder monument the Pearl of the Orient TV Tower presently Asia s tallest structure at 468 m 1 535 ft and a symbol of the mighty new China The observation deck atop the TV tower is one of Shanghai s top tourist draws Pudong even has its own burgeoning version of the Bund And although it lacks history Binjiang Road has modern shops caf s and performing troupes making the east bank an up and coming rival to the west bank Outlying Sights The Jade Buddha Temple Yufosi in northwest Shanghai is not old but it is Shanghai s leading Buddhist site and quite active with resident monks Its Song Dynasty style grounds house a priceless white jade Buddha statue in the seated position of enlightenment brought from Burma Most statues in Buddhist temples are molded of clay with a thin overlay of gold so these giant jade works attract curiosity seekers as well as worshippers Around the back of the altar is a flamboyant three dimensional mural As an extra attraction for tourists there s an antiques shop in the compound with some unusual items at interesting prices Shanghai s only ancient pagoda part of the Longhua Temple Longhuagusi complex in the southwest suburbs was rebuilt more than a thousand years ago The seven level octagonal structure was restored in the 1950s But no one tried to correct its appealing tilt insignificant when compared to the Tower of Pisa but notable nonetheless Tiny bells suspended from the corners of the upswept eaves tinkle in the breeze Shanghai Entertainment and Cuisine Two popular venues for the performing arts are the Shanghai Center Theatre and the new Grand Theatre Dajuyuan Shanghai s answer to the Sydney Opera House Finally there s Shanghai cuisine While popular local dishes are based on beancurd together with mushrooms and bamboo shoots the best known Shanghai recipes capitalize on the city s proximity to the sea Steamed freshwater crabs in season from October through to December and river eel are the highlights for many gourmets Shaolin The fighting monks in a thousand kung fu films can trace their origin to the Shaolin Monastery in Henan Province In fact the Chinese martial arts and such offshoots as the gentler exercise forms known as taiqi have their symbolic if not literal birthplace at this monastery The branch of Buddhism known as Chan Zen in Japan and the West also looks to Shaolin as its source With so many traditional arts centered at one historic site it s no wonder the Shaolin Monastery has become one of China s more popular tourist attractions Shaolin now provides movie sets for film crews as well as schools for domestic and foreign classes in self defense As an excursion it is close to Zhengzhou 80 km 50 miles to the east and Luoyang 70 km 43 miles west You don t have to be a kung fu practitioner to enjoy Shaolin While crowded and commercialized Shaolin is still one of China s most interesting historical and religious monuments dating back to the end of the fifth century a d In 625 it was expanded by a Tang Dynasty emperor in gratitude for wartime services rendered by the Shaolin monks who used their fighting skills to send off some usurpers In the early sixth century a monk from India named Da Mo arrived at Shaolin where he founded Chan Buddhism Da Mo who was probably a legendary rather than actual figure is also heralded as the founder of kung fu wushu a system of hand to hand combat that was later modified to produce the immensely popular form of exercise that millions practice every morning throughout China taiqi tai chi sometimes called shadow boxing in the West The Shaolin monks do seem to have been well versed in self defense over the centuries In the 16th century they were called upon to rid China s coast of Japanese pirates In 1928 when warlords carved up sections of the faltering Chinese Republic one general laid siege to the monastery and set it ablaze Today Shaolin has a number of interesting relics and remains Of the many halls pavilions and temples linked by broad courtyards the most important is the Thousand Buddha Hall dating back to 1588 with its fresco of monks engaging in battle In the rear of the hall is a sacred stone floor heavily dented where generations of leaping monks are said to have left the imprint of their training Nearby is the Shadow Stone a slab with the outlines of a figure in meditation said to be from the cave where Da Mo meditated so steadfastly for nine years that he left his shadow on the wall A ten minute hike up the northern hill behind the Shaolin complex leads to the cave now a shrine for the faithful The outer courtyards of Shaolin contain other unusual treasures The Forest of Stupas Shaolin Talin is of historic note Stupas or dagobas are small sealed pagodas that hold holy relics and remains of important monks The forest of 227 stupas at Shaolin covers over 1 000 years of Buddhist funerals beginning with that of a Tang Dynasty abbot who was buried here in the year 746 Adjacent to the Forest of Stupas is the most popular display at Shaolin a courtyard of open air pavilions containing scores of wooden statues monks in all the classic poses of a feverish kung fu battle Shaolin offers one more treat for the more adventurous It is located at the foot of the western range of the Songshan mountains part of the mountain cluster that was traditionally regarded as the Central Mountain at the center of the Chinese empire A gondola now whisks visitors to the top where hiking trails are abundant and views of the Shaolin complex and the vast desert plains of Henan are impressive On the far side of the range sheer walls of stone 300 m 1 000 ft high tower over the plains where a series of catwalks and carved footpaths wander through old temples and pavilions into the silence and emptiness beyond Suzhou Soochow For centuries Suzhou has been famous for its canals and gardens its beautiful women and the musical cadences of the local dialect An old Chinese proverb referring to the area s linguistic charms claims that even an argument in Suzhou sounds sweeter than flattery in Guangzhon Marco Polo found the inhabitants better traders than warriors and he described the city as large and magnificent So much silk was produced he reported that every citizen was clothed in it and the surplus was exported Even today silk still retains its significance in the local economy Whether you go to Suzhou from Shanghai or Nanjing you will be moved by the wayside scenery typical of China s land of fish and rice Sampans and scows ply the canals that divide the farmlands where barefoot peasants in straw coolie hats squelch through the muddy rice fields The Grand Canal is crowded with strings of barges laden with fruit and vegetables construction materials or coal Suzhou in fact means Plentiful Water The Grand Canal second only to the Great Wall as a Chinese engineering achievement was started 2 400 years ago By the sixth century it linked Suzhou and other rich farming areas of the south with the consumers of the north most notably the emperor and his court who appreciated receiving fresh food regardless of the season Canal excursions by tourist boat often begin in Suzhou continuing to another enchanted city Wuxi see page 173 But Suzhou is best known for its perfectly landscaped classical Chinese gardens More than 150 were laid out the first over a thousand years ago Largest of all is the Humble Administrator s Garden Zhuozhengyuan built by a Ming Dynasty mandarin not otherwise remembered for humility As befits the City of Plentiful Water ponds make up the better part of the terrain And where there are ponds there are almost bound to be artificial islands winding bridges gazebos and weeping willows To the west the Lingering Garden Liuyuan is a refuge of flowers trees courtyards and halls This one too was built by a Ming civil servant as a place for meditation While you linger contemplate the five ton rock shipped here 400 years ago from Lake Tai because of its inspiring shape Nearby West Garden Xiyuan was given to a Buddhist monastery The temple was destroyed in the Taiping Rebellion then rebuilt The Forest of Lions Garden Shizilin dates back to 1336 its rocks from Lake Tai evoking the form and power of lions The Qing Dynasty Emperors modeled the rockeries in the Old Summer Palace in Beijing after those they saw in Suzhou s Forest of Lions Probably the smallest of all the Suzhou gardens situated right in the center of town is the Garden of the Master of the Nets Wangshiyuan covering half a hectare barely more than an acre The garden s founder a retired politician claimed he had given up public life to become a fisherman Whatever his interests he could hardly fail to be inspired by the view from his simple study This gem is considered the masterpiece of Chinese classical garden design and served as the inspiration for the Astor Chinese Garden Court in New York City s Metropolitan Museum of Art Among Suzhou s tourist highlights the highest is Tiger Hill Huqiu a man made hill built 2 500 years ago It is rich in contrived rock formations vegetation and waterfalls From the summit rises a seven level brick pagoda Yunyanta Like the one in Shanghai it leans a bit from the vertical although modern reinforcements should relieve your anxiety Other sights worth lingering over in the old inner city include the 14th century Panmen Gate where a magnificent arched bridge crosses a canal linking Suzhou to the Grand Canal Suzhou is also famous for its silk production The Suzhou Silk Museum exhibits the 5 000 years of silk history in the region and the Museum of Suzhou Embroidery is a working factory and sales outlet featured on many city tours There is one religious site of special note the Temple of Mystery Xuanmiaoguan in the heart of a modernizing downtown shopping area It includes the largest early Daoist hall in China built in 1179 and is today surrounded by Suzhou s biggest and liveliest outdoor market Taishan Although not well known in the West Taishan is China s most celebrated peak Everyone who was anyone in Chinese history from Confucius to Chairman Mao has stood on its summit Because it was long regarded as the Sacred Mountain of the East by followers of Daoism Taishan served as the supreme altar of worship for millions of pilgrims for over 2 000 years It undoubtedly ranks as one of the most climbed mountains in the world Even today it attracts large numbers of visitors most of them from China Situated in Shandong Province on the rail line between Beijing and Shanghai Taishan is only 1 545 m 5 069 ft in elevation but it is a steep climb as it rises for views of the East China Sea Today there are over 20 active temples on its slopes over 800 carved tablets and some 1 000 cliff face inscriptions It is a library of Chinese culture that is carved into the body of nature Tai an the village at Taishan s base that is 64 km 40 miles south of Jinan is home to the Dai Temple Daimiao a walled complex filled with its own historic treasures These include a stone tablet recording the mountain s promotion to the position of Emperor of China as Taishan was designated in 1011 by a Song Dynasty emperor Rarest of all is the Qin Tablet carved in 209 b c to commemorate the ascent of Taishan by China s first emperor Qinshi Huangdi The main temple also contains a statue of the God of the Mountain Taishanwang the Judge of the Dead North of the Dai Temple the Pilgrim s Road Panlu leads to the First Gate of Heaven the entrance to the mountain Beyond this point it is mostly massive granite steps From the First Gate to the Middle Gate of Heaven is about 5 km 3 miles and from the Middle Gate to the top less than 3 km 2 miles but the final mile is the steepest as the elevation rise is 1 370 m 4 500 ft Those in a hurry can catch a bus or hire a taxi to the Middle Gate and from there take the cable car to the top Those who keep to the old pilgrim s path are in for a long but fascinating walk Among the celebrated sights are the Valley of the Stone Sutra where sixth century Buddhists carved the text of the Diamond Sutra into a smooth stream bed the pine tree that sheltered the first emperor on his climb and a final ladder of 2 000 stone steps leading to the Pavilion That Touches the Sky On the summit there are even more treasures The Tang Dynasty Rock Inscriptions Moyabei were struck in large gold foil characters to record Emperor Xuanzong s imperial pilgrimage in the year 726 The Stele Without Inscription Wuzibei is blank thought to have been placed here by the First Emperor over 2 000 years earlier everyone who reaches it must touch it for good luck The Temple of the Purple Dawn Bixiaci is the most revered of the shrines on the summit of Taishan Here presides the Jade Goddess daughter of the mountain god who cures blindness and answers the prayers of the childless And there are hundreds of earnest petitioners and pilgrims even today on the summit of Taishan At dawn the thousands who spend the night in inns on the summit await the sunrise It is precisely here that Confucius observed that the world is small and that Chairman Mao proclaimed the East is Red Turpan Turfan Tulufan The sidewalks of Turpan would turn to mud if it ever rained but it almost never does Here in the middle of the great desert in Xinjiang Sinkiang Autonomous Region only 16 mm just over half an inch of rain ever reaches the ground in an average year Most evaporates on the way down Because of Turpan s location in the Tarim Basin at 79 m 260 ft below sea level this is the second deepest continental basin in the world it s startling to discover here a sizeable city where houses are supplied with electricity and running water and shady trees line the streets It s an amazing oasis a bastion of civilization in a climate as cruel as any on Earth Turpan s secret is underground water utilized today as it has been for thousands of years by a system of interconnecting wells karez that relay water from the Heavenly Mountains Tianshan underground to the oasis If the aqueduct were above ground the water would almost all be lost through evaporation Over the whole region these tunnels all dug by hand stretch for perhaps 3 000 km more than 1 800 miles with some singular water tunnels running as far as 40 km 25 miles Thanks to the wells Turpan grows cotton melons and grapes of great sweetness and renown And the surrounding desert is kept at bay by bountifully irrigated stands of elm poplar and palm trees The karez is an engineering feat on par with that of the Grand Canal and an exhibition center at one well site allows visitors to enter several of these hand dug wells for a close up view The climatic conditions of China s oven are nevertheless hostile to humans In the summer when the temperature exceeds 40 C 104 F for days at a time the locals take refuge in cellars until the night breeze comes up In the springtime when the mercury is merely in the 30s close to 90 F the people dress for a chill the men in their long underwear and the women in thick brown stockings and gaily colored headscarves Turpan is about 200 km 125 miles southeast of Urumqi the regional capital It s so dry and except for winter hot in the oasis that tourists are advised to drink as much tea or juice as possible to forestall dehydration Laundry on the line dries in a matter of minutes rather than hours or days Two thousand years ago the Silk Road traders stopped in Turpan to find water and rest The bazaar of today might give you the impression that little has changed There are outdoor butcher shops cobblers dentists and a shooting gallery plus merchants selling medicinal herbs embroidered skullcaps and tobacco by the pocketful Makeshift restaurants dish up spicy kebabs and the bread called nang The customers mostly of the Uighur nationality Uighurs make up 80 percent of Turpan s residents give this Silk Road oasis a most un Chinese atmosphere Minarets outnumber pagodas Just east of the city is Emin Minaret a stunning 44 m 144 ft tower of blue brick erected in 1778 The attached white stone mosque with its plain interior is the largest in the region The most remarkable sites in the area are the ruins of two ancient desert capitals The city of Jiaohe 10 km 6 miles west of Turpan was founded in the second century b c and laid out in a grid Destroyed at the end of the 14th century its sand and brick still preserve the haunting outlines of a great city that stretched for a mile with a Buddhist temple and headless statues at the center Gaochang a second ancient city 46 km 29 miles east of Turpan has an imposing city wall with a perimeter of 5 km 3 miles Gaochang reached its prime during the Tang Dynasty when it became a capital of China s western territories When Islam overtook Buddhism here in the 13th century Gaochang was abandoned Visitors today usually hire a Uighur donkey cart for a tour of the earthen remains A few miles from Gaochang is the royal Astana Cemetery discovered by accident in 1972 Its oldest grave dates from a d 273 Because of the almost total lack of moisture the murals in the tombs have retained their original lively colors and many of the corpses haven t aged much either Visitors can enter several of the underground burial chambers including one where a couple buried together 12 centuries ago lie side by side their hair and fingernails grown long in death Northeast of Turpan the road skirts the Flaming Mountains Kizilatak in Uighur Huoyanshan in Chinese Facing south the slopes attract and store the sun s heat temperatures have been recorded as high as 75 C 167 F On a sheer cliff in a gorge in these mountains the Bezeklik Thousand Buddha Caves are perched with carvings and frescoes dating from the fifth century Unfortunately these beautiful grottoes have been largely emptied by rival religious groups and by archaeological adventurers from the West The 40 painted walls and ceilings that remain have almost faded into the gray dust of the engulfing desert Urumqi Wulumuqi In Mongolian Urumqi means Fine Pasture In Uighur it s spelled with umlauts r mqi The Chinese make four syllables of it However you read or write it Urumqi sounds remote and exotic Remote it is the most distant major city in the world from any ocean or saltwater sea Exotic In fact Urumqi has an exotic population of minority and nomadic peoples but it has been developed by the Han Chinese into a modern industrial city And the Chinese mostly recent economic migrants make up 75 percent of its 1 5 million residents Urumqi is the capital of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region which covers one sixth of the total area of China It borders Afghanistan Pakistan India Tajikistan Kyrgyzstan Kazakhstan and Mongolia on the old Silk Road route through Central Asia and more than half the province s population belongs to minority groups led by the Uighurs The greatest attractions lie well outside the city in scenic highlands where nomads still reign Urumqi is the most modern and most Chinese city on the Silk Road Downtown avenues are tree lined there are dozens of mosques and the street markets provide splashes of color At the largest covered market the Erdaoqiao Bazaar vendors sell handmade goods from boots to carpets and herds of sheep and donkey carts ply the alleyways The most irresistible items are edible kebabs homemade noodles and round flatbreads cooked on the spot over coal fires The Xinjiang Museum Xinjiang Bowuguan with explanatory cards in English Chinese and Uighur contains Silk Road coins earrings tiles silks and a handful of mummies embalmed as long ago as the 13th century b c The museum stores carry the main local products Persian style carpets ornate skullcaps deadly looking knives in bronze scabbards which many of the local people carry stringed instruments and white jade Two sites with Chinese characteristics on the Urumqi River Red Hill Hongshan topped by the 18th century Zhenglong Pagoda and Hongshan Park on the west bank are favorite leisure and picnic grounds for the locals In the Southern Mountains Nanshan 74 km 46 miles south of Urumqi the Kazakhs move their families on horseback and set up their yurts on the high pastures to graze their sheep At the end of the road near an alpine waterfall the Kazakhs who once rode with Genghis and Kublai Khan across these grasslands open their village to visitors and in July stage a six day summer fair nadam with horse races and wrestling A more famous scenic spot is Heavenly Lake Tianchi 120 km 75 miles east of Urumqi one of the prettiest mountain lakes in the world It is surrounded by yurts grazing sheep and snowy peaks capped by Mt Bogda with an elevation of 5 444 m 17 864 ft In this alluring high country Shangri La the Kazakhs are happy to share their food shelter and horses with paying guests who want to ride the lake rim or spend the night in a yurt Wuhan A lively industrial and intellectual center Wuhan is nearly equidistant from Beijing Guangzhou Shanghai and Chongqing Its setting at the confluence of the Yangzi and Han rivers has made it an important traffic junction Here the wail of riverboat foghorns mingles with train whistles on the nation s main north south railway The story of Wuhan has always been anchored in the vital muddy Yangzi So wide and treacherous is the river that before the construction of the great concrete and steel bridge of Wuhan the first to cross the Yangzi in 1957 all communications depended on the ferries which were often hampered by fog or flood Now the two tiered Yangzi River Bridge Changjiang Daqiao is proudly shown to tourists as a triumph of the new China So are the dikes so tall they cut off the view of the river from the embankment But the Yangzi s rages can t always be contained In 1983 Wuhan was flooded in spite of monumental preparations for the worst and the great floods of 1998 the worst in 54 years again pushed Wuhan to the brink Wuhan is actually a modern composite name for three historic contiguous cities Wuchang Hankou and Hanyang Wuchang the oldest is bountifully supplied with parklands Hankou on the opposite bank of the Yangzi was opened to foreign development in the 19th century as a Treaty Port at high tide 10 000 ton ships can reach Hankou s harbor from the sea some 1 500 km 1 000 miles away Hanyang separated from Hankou by the Han River requiring another less heroic bridge is more typically Chinese After the Opium Wars Hankou was carved up into British French German Japanese and Russian zones of influence Along Zhongshan Avenue near the Yangzi ferry terminals some of the old buildings in European style are left The municipal office buildings on the embankment administering a city which has now grown well beyond 4 million are cast in the German mold But Wuhan the capital of Hubei Hupeh Province also has a significant revolutionary history The rebellion of October 1911 which was inspired by Dr Sun Yat sen began in Wuchang and Hankou suffered heavy damage in the fighting The Central Peasant Movement Institute where Communist activists were trained in the 1920s was established in Wuchang Mao Zedong taught here and his legacy is strong at several tourist attractions including a villa Mao Zedong Bieshu where he often vacationed and several displays at the provincial museum The Hubei Provincial Museum Hubeisheng Bowuguan owes its excellence to the chance discovery in 1978 of the tomb of the Marquis Yi of the State of Zeng Located 108 km 67 miles northwest of Wuhan the grave yielded treasure enough to furnish several museums About 1 000 items a mere 15 percent of the total hoard are now on display here Yi who lived during the fifth century b c died at the age of 25 and was greatly mourned He was buried with his dog and 21 female sacrifices as well as tributes ranging from bronze wine vessels to enough musical instruments for an orchestra The finest musical exhibit in the collection is a set of 65 intricately decorated bronze bells now restored to their original resonance Visitors can hear a tape recording of the bells interpreting both Chinese and Western music they sound like a cross between a glockenspiel and a modern carillon The museum looks out on East Lake Dong Hu vaunted as the largest lake in any municipal park in China with 33 sq km nearly 13 sq miles of invitingly clear water Boating swimming and fishing are popular here Of course no Chinese lake would be complete without its artificial islands causeways and pavilions several of which serve as teahouses festooned with peach and plum blossoms orchids or osmanthus depending on the season Hanyang s main religious landmark Gui Yuan Temple Guiyuan Chansi sprawls among pines and cypress Built in the 17th century it was the only one of Wuhan s 20 or more Buddhist temples spared by rampaging Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution 1966 1976 The Hall of Five Hundred Disciples is a fascinating gallery of statues Grinning yawning frowning meditating and leering each one is different The Northern Song Dynasty Ancient Lute Terrace Guqintai commemorates a 2 500 year old legend of the deep friendship between a lute playing mandarin and a music loving woodcutter Amateur musicians hold forth in the teahouse here a favorite meeting place of local pensioners Across the 11 2 km 1 mile Yangzi River Bridge in Wuchang is the Yellow Crane Tower Huanghelou based on another legend First built in a d 223 the wooden structure burned down and was reconstructed several times In 1981 the latest rebuilding project got under way about 1 km 1 2 mile from the original site The design and decor of the new tower are based on paintings from the Yuan and Ming dynasties and a model of the bridge as it existed in the Qing Dynasty Wuxi Wuhsi This appealing town really does deserve a more poetic name Wuxi means no more tin a reference to the depletion a couple of thousand years ago of the local mines Wuxi is an industrial and marketing center with a population of more than one million in the land of fish and rice a fertile semitropical region It lies 128 km 80 miles northwest of Shanghai close enough for a day trip by train Canals and rivers crisscross the city and the Grand Canal Wuxi s prime historic attraction flows right through the center of town from Lake Tai Wuxi s prime scenic attraction Even a short boat ride through the city on the Grand Canal produces unforgettable sights and photos Many people line the bridges each of a different design to wave Human propelled ferryboats scurry out of the way as long trains of barges their decks heaped up with onions reeds or bricks labor past The riverside dwellers who live in quaint whitewashed houses wash their clothes in the canal You might see a fisherman assigning his captive cormorants to dive their gullets collared to stop them from eating the catch The Grand Canal project begun 2 400 years ago created an inland waterway stretching 1 794 km 1 113 miles from Beijing to Hangzhou Canal excursions organized for foreign tourists range from a half day tour to a seven day cruise that takes in Suzhou Wuxi Changzhou and Zhenjiang in addition to the Yangzi River port of Yangzhou The tourist authorities of Jiangsu Province also promote bicycle tours through the flat green countryside Lake Tai Taihu a vast freshwater expanse boasting 72 islets is the most celebrated lake in Chinese legend Turtle Head Island Yuantouzhu is actually a peninsula at the edge of Lake Tai a sanctuary of trees flowers bridges and lake viewing pavilions that began as a garden in 1918 But more than any specific landfall the lake is a spectacle on its own with its fleet of fishing junks and roving sampans Visitors can easily take to the waters aboard the public ferries to Three Hills Island Sanshandao Largely an amusement park in the middle of the lake Three Hills known locally as Fairy Island contains a new four tiered temple with the statue of an ancient emperor providing an enchanting view of Lake Tai from the top To underline the monumental character of Lake Tai in legend and in nature the world s largest standing statue of Buddha was unveiled in 1997 at Lingshan on the lake shore 18 km 11 miles west of Wuxi Fashioned from bronze plates the Lake Tai Buddha weighs 700 tons and stands 73 m 240 ft tall Wuxi is also home to two classic gardens Li Garden Liyuan is composed of arched bridges gaudy pavilions open walkways fish ponds a miniature pagoda and a covered walkway with 89 view framing windows Jichang Garden Jichangyuan established in 1520 is a Suzhou style private garden much admired by Emperor Qianlong who constructed a similar garden in Beijing s Summer Palace in 1750 Jichang Park is contained within Xihui Park on the Grand Canal site of the seven tiered Ming Dynasty Dragon Light Pagoda Longguang and a spring tulip festival with flowers imported from Holland The park also contains Erquan Spring source of the some of the world s best water for tea brewing according to the Classic of Tea Chajing written by the scholar Luyu Xiamen Amoy China s cleanest major city according to an official poll and one of its most charming Xiamen is a port city located in Fujian Province hardly a heartbeat from Taiwan across the East China Sea A prosperous place owing to its close connections with overseas Chinese investors many of whom emigrated from the area Xiamen has wisely spared much of its downtown and harbor from the bulldozers of progress From the busy harbor square overlooked by the balconies of the venerable Lujiang Hotel you can stroll into old town areas along Zhongshan Road past dozens of antique shophouses and caf s Or you can head south along Minzu Road and take in the life of the fishing boats and warehouses on the quays If you walk long enough or hail a taxi you end up at Nanputuo Temple nestled in the hillside on the east shore of the harbor This Buddhist complex is in immaculate condition its marble a gleaming white Locals are always on hand burning incense and praying for good fortune The rocky cliffs behind the temple make for fine hiking and picnicking South of the temple and past Xiamen University founded in 1921 by a local who made good in Singapore is the Huli Mountain Cannon Platform In 1921 the Germans placed their artillery here to defend the colonial port of Amoy as Xiamen was known to Westerners From here if you look across the Formosa Strait on a sunny day you can make out the disputed islands of Mazu and Jinmen Once known to Western politicians as Quemoy and Matsu these islands figured in the Nixon Kennedy presidential debates of 1960 Today the cold war between China and Taiwan often waged with loudspeakers and leaflet bombardments across the Formosa Strait appears to be over and the two islands have been opened to tourism by Taiwan Xiamen s chief pleasure for any visitor is Gulangyu a small island in the harbor that was once the home to foreign colonials Passenger ferries connect downtown Xiamen to the island Gulangyu has banned automotive vehicles and is a pedestrians island not even bicycles are allowed here The terrain is hilly with twisting cobblestone streets forming a compact maze but you re always within sight of a shoreline The lanes are full of villas and grand European buildings Beginning in 1842 Western traders allowed in after the Opium Wars built Gulangyu into a virtual European town with their own schools churches and hospitals The British Embassy still stands on a hill above the ferry landing and beyond it the Roman Catholic Church completed in 1882 and still in use The Sanyi Protestant Church built by the British in 1904 is also active These days the colonial villas are occupied by local Chinese The ripe gardens give Gulangyu a lazy tropical atmosphere reminiscent of Macau or Malacca A statue of the patron saint of Xiamen Koxinga Zheng Chenggong stands on the tip of the island A warrior in flowing robes he expelled the Dutch from Taiwan in the 17th century Not far from Koxinga s heroic image are the guesthouse villas and sandy beaches where locals relax and sometimes even take a dip Above the beaches is the island s most famous garden Shuzhuang built in 1913 by a wealthy Taiwanese merchant and admired for its pond and rock design a garden in the sea a sea in the garden Best views are from the towering Sunlight Rock Riguangyan in Yanping Park the highest point on Gulangyu and well worth the climb From here you can see across the long harbor to downtown Xiamen And of course you can see Gulangyu itself a dense sea garden of flowers red tiled villas and tiny seafood caf s a bright home to just 12 000 residents By comparison the city of Xiamen has over 600 000 residents and is a rampaging metropolis The Xiamen Museum housed in Gulangyu s most striking red domed building contains a sprinkling of odd exhibits on its four floors including printing presses Tang Dynasty porcelains wooden rifles assorted gifts from sister cities around the world and photographs of the island s dazzling colonial architecture Xi an Sian When ancient Peking was just a remote trading post Xi an was the capital of the Middle Kingdom and the largest city in the world Palaces pavilions and pagodas crowned the skyline Artists and poets and of course cooks catered to the most demanding imperial tastes And since this was the starting point of the Silk Road the most adventurous of foreigners congregated here Having made history over several thousand years the city of today is more populous than ever at 2 million residents and proud of its leafy new avenues modern factories and housing projects But there s no avoiding the past in this treasure trove of Chinese civilization Xi an and its surrounding countryside preserve the glories of eleven dynasties and it is as a storehouse of China s Qin Han and Tang Dynasty treasures that Xi an has reached the top ranks of international tourism On the way to any of Xi an s archaeological sites you get a good look at the wind whipped landscape of the Wei River valley Militarily and economically strategic since prehistoric times the area comprises fertile cotton and wheat fields fallow plains and bizarre terraces of loess dotted with caves that provide housing even to this day As the rapidly modernizing capital of Shaanxi Province Xi an can look back almost with detachment on its regal past During the first Zhou Dynasty which ended in 770 b c several places in the Xi an district served as capitals In the third century b c the Qin settled just northwest of Xi an in Xianyang When the Han took over in 206 b c a grandiose new capital called Chang an Everlasting Peace rose just north of Xi an Imperial splendor returned under the Sui a d 581 618 when a capital known as Daxing Great Prosperity was established on the site of Xi an The Tang emperors who followed greatly enlarged and beautified the city again naming it Chang an The golden age of Xi an as Chang an ended more than a thousand years ago when the Tang succumbed to rebellion and anarchy The city sank into provinciality even though impressive new city walls and official buildings were constructed in the 14th century These features of the Ming era almost modern by Xi an standards are the first to catch the eye Sightseeing within City Walls The rectangular Ming Dynasty city wall of Xi an is 141 2 km almost 9 miles around and so thick that two way chariot traffic could travel the roadway on top Major renovations have restored the ramparts guard towers and city moat Gardens and parks complement these massive fortifications the last major city walls standing intact in China In the center of the walled city are several monuments from the Ming Dynasty The Bell Tower Zhonglou is another of those lofty wooden buildings ingeniously constructed without the use of nails Three tiers of elegant roofs rise from a solid brick pedestal at the center of the city forming one of the emblems of Xi an The Drum Tower Gulou a similar building across a new public square and shopping mall dates from 1370 and is also open to tourists One of the most popular new tourist treats are the bell striking and drum beating ceremonies carried out daily by warriors to the sound of re creations of Tang Dynasty music The drum is sounded in its tower 21 times at sunrise the bell is sounded in its tower 21 times at sunset Religious Sites Just around the corner and up a curving alleyway of vendors the Great Mosque Qingzhensi traces its history to a d 742 The serene and spacious complex consists of gardens temples and pavilions largely in the Chinese style The side galleries contain beautifully carved furniture and screens The triple eaved Introspection Tower Shengxin is a minaret from which many of Xi an s sizeable Muslim minority including descendants of Silk Road travelers are called to prayer The prayer hall holds over 1 000 Xi an s once glorious temples were devastated during the Cultural Revolution 1966 1976 but restorations have led to the reopening of the Lama Temple Guangrensi founded in 1705 Woolongsi an ancient Zen Buddhist temple Dongyuemiao a Daoist temple to the mountain god of Taishan and the Temple of the Eight Immortals Baxianguan which is the most active of the city s religious shrines at present and has an open air market Museums Xi an has two fine museums The Shaanxi Provincial Museum Shaanxi Shengbowuguan occupying the 14th century grounds of the Temple to Confucius holds a rich store of art works and rare artifacts funerary figurines traditional paintings ancient household equipment and huge bronzes masterfully cast 3 000 years ago But the chief focus must be on the museum s famous Forest of Steles Beilin This library of inscribed stone slabs including a complete edition of the Confucian classics carved in a d 837 documents the history of Chinese culture and calligraphy The Nestorian Stele records another history altogether that of Christianity in China from 635 to 781 The art of calligraphy is exalted in this museum as nowhere else The street leading to the old museum along the southern city wall Shuyuanmen has been restored and offers a fine collection of traditional art and calligraphy shops The Shaanxi History Museum Shaanxi Lishibowuguan south of the city wall houses a thoroughly modern collection of prehistoric and imperial treasures that is comparable to those in Beijing and Shanghai and far superior in terms of its Han Qin and Tang Dynasty holdings Pagodas When the Big Wild Goose Pagoda Dayanta was built in a d 652 during the Tang Dynasty it stood well within the walled city But Xi an has since shrunk in size and now the seven tiered brick pagoda rises in the middle of farming country to the south of the urban area Grass grows from the pagoda s roofs The Big Wild Goose Pagoda was built to house precious Buddhist texts brought back from India by Xi an s most celebrated pilgrim an intrepid scholar named Xuanzang Having survived years of sandstorms and blizzards demons and dragons Xuanzang was feted on his return to the capital in 645 He spent the next two decades translating his stack of holy books from Sanskrit to Chinese Though it s shorter slimmer and slightly newer than the Big Wild Goose Pagoda the Small Wild Goose Pagoda Xiaoyanta built in a d 707 has more tiers 13 at the moment When it was built it had 15 tiers but the top came tumbling down in a Ming era earthquake Both these exquisite Tang Dynasty towers the finest of their kind in China can be climbed yielding interesting views of the walled city and beyond Excursions from Xi an The oldest of the region s archaeological wonders are found in a museum erected on the very site where they were discovered This is at the Stone Age site of Banpo 10 km 6 miles east of Xi an Six thousand years ago a village evidently thriving occupied this farmland but traces of habitation came to light only in the 1950s when workmen were digging the foundations for a new factory You have to climb a flight of stairs to reach the covered excavation From a series of walkways you look down on the outlines of houses ovens storage areas and graves You can follow the evolution of dwellings in China from round structures to rectangular houses with slanting roofs the prototypes for today s typical Chinese abode Also on display in the Banpo Museum Banpo Bowuguan are some of the objects found in the course of excavations axes fishhooks and utilitarian pots as well as artistically decorated ceramics and most dramatically the skeletons of these ancient villagers Qin Dynasty Warriors China s greatest archaeological attraction the terra cotta warriors of the Qin Dynasty Army stand in battle formation about 30 km nearly 20 miles east of Xi an in the complex known as the Museum of the Terra Cotta Warriors and Horses Qinshihuang Bingmayong Bowuguan The life sized and slightly larger infantrymen archers officers and their horses symbolically guard the tomb of the first Qin emperor Well before his death in 210 b c Qinshihuangdi conscripted hundreds of thousands of his subjects to construct a suitably impressive tomb That tomb beneath an artificial hill nearby has yet to be excavated But the novel idea of guarding it with thousands of pottery soldiers was revealed by accident in 1974 when local peasants digging a well created a world wide sensation An arched structure resembling an aircraft hangar has since been built to protect the exposed soldiers and horses in Vault 1 from the weather Walkways permit tourists a bird s eye survey of the site revealing the deployment of the troops 6 000 of them reassembled and back in their original ranks Each warrior is an individual with his own headdress moustache or beard and unique expression The eager graceful horses also have distinctive traits The small museum in the courtyard entrance to Vault 1 contains warriors their steeds and one of the two half life sized solid bronze chariots found near the First Emperor s burial mound Vault 2 opened in 1994 is an excavation in progress It contains the imperial cavalry 900 soldiers 116 saddled horses and 356 horses hitched to 89 chariots Vault 3 the smallest so far opened to the public is a command post with 68 officers in war robes Other vaults await official openings One of the most recent one kilometer from the vaults now open to the public contains stone armor the oldest ever found in China Huaqing Hot Springs History and natural beauty mingle easily at Huaqing Hot Springs Huaqingchi a popular side trip for tourists on the way to or from the Qin terra cotta warriors excavations The spa s hot mineral rich waters and its situation on Black Horse Mountain Lishan attracted a series of royal patrons as far back as the eighth century b c The emperors and their retinue required suitable accommodation so the place was provided with delightful pavilions pools and gardens There is one attraction in particular that draws crowds of eager Chinese tourists the large mosaic bottomed Oval Tub used by Lady Yangguifei favorite concubine of the Tang Emperor Xuanzong who reigned a d 712 756 Lady Yang was known as a famous beauty and her portrait hanging in her former dressing room attests to that It is said that women who wash their face in the basin will look ten years younger Although she was dear to the emperor Lady Yang s extravagances and intrigues angered courtiers When mutinous troops demanded her head the intimidated emperor acceded to save his throne After she was taken away and strangled the emperor wept and then abdicated The sad story is the subject of many classic poems Qianling Tombs Xi an is surrounded by hundreds of huge earthen mounds the largely unopened tombs of emperors and their courts The tombs of notables of the Tang Dynasty dug into a mountainside Liangshan about 80 km 50 miles northwest of Xi an provide an intriguing look at what lies buried around the old capital and at the level of art and culture reached in China during the seventh eighth and ninth centuries Several tombs here contain exquisite murals The famous set of frescoes in the tomb of Prince Zhanghuai depicts an animated polo match a hunting expedition a reception for foreign diplomats and most movingly a scene in a court cloister with a young concubine looking longingly at a bird in flight A tomb with a steeply inclined entrance that of Princess Yong Tai has a mural which is full of intriguing details depicting the court maidens attending the princess who was to die at the age of 17 These tombs have also yielded brightly colored ceramic figurines fine stone carvings and large memorial tablets The principal tomb belongs to the third Tang emperor Gaozong and to his ambitious widow Wuzetian who had herself promoted to the rank of empress in a d 691 the only woman to hold such power in all Chinese history Gigantic stone sculptures of animals birds generals and now headless ambassadors line the Royal Way to this tomb but its entrance remains sealed The ostentation of the exterior hints at what might lie within What s still buried at Xi an seems likely to outweigh all the great treasures that have been brought to light from a Stone Age village to the First Emperor s vast City of the Dead from the silks and ceramics of the Tang to the walls and pagodas of the Ming Briefings The following cities and sights are among the additional attractions that might be included on tours and itineraries Anyang Henan Province Capital of the
