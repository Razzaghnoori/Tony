 Mexican Watershed Everybody leads with the Mexican elections The Los Angeles Times the Washington Post and USA TODAY each put the story at the top right and the New York Times gives almost the entire right side of its front page to it And the top of the Wall Street Journal World Wide News column notes Mexican Stocks Surge As of press time it remains unclear exactly what the balance of power in the legislative branch or in the various states will be between the three major political parties but the news is that for the first time in the country s modern history there will be a balance of power USAT quotes one political scientist as saying This was a revolution the beginning of a new country The Times has another saying If votes begin to count in Mexico then this is a revolution The Post has Cambodia on the front above the fold while the LAT and NYT put it inside What happened there is that one of the country s co rulers as established by U N brokered elections in 1993 conducted a coup when the other one was in Paris The U S has delayed taking sides The NYT has the State Department spokesman s official position I think the origin of the fighting is sufficiently murky so that we don t want to shoot arrows at one side or another today If nothing else the episode allows the Post to trot out this foreign correspondent s staple phrase found I believe on key F7 the capital appeared calm but tense tonight By the way what does that actually mean The Journal s front page Work Week column has two rather interesting items today One details that a Missouri federal appeals court has ruled that a woman demoted while on maternity leave wasn t a victim of pregnancy discrimination The story notes that a 1978 federal law bars discrimination based on pregnancy giving birth or a related medical condition but that the court ruled that it didn t apply to her case because caring for a child is a gender neutral social role not a condition related to childbirth The other item relates how Karl Mason a self described numerologist and astrologer and a dozen of his colleagues have asked the Broward County Florida state attorney to look into why the psychic phone network where they dispensed visions of the future to callers had stopped paying their salaries The county is investigating But the Journal wonders why the employees didn t see trouble coming
