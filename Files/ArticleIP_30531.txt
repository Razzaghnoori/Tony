 To a Friend Who Keeps Telling Me He Has Lost His Memory And yet you know that you remember me whoever I am and it is to me you speak as you used to and we are sure of it and you remember the child being saved by some kind of mother from whatever she insists he will never be able to do when he has done it easily the light has not changed at all on that one falling in front of you as you look through it and decades of explaining are a fan that opens against the light here and there proving something that then darkens again they are at hand but closer than they are is the grandmother who entrusted you with her old Baedeker to take along on the Normandy landing where it turned out to have powers and a time of its own but the names fade out leaving the faces weddings and processions anonymous where is it the sudden tears well up from as you see faces turning in silence though if they were here now it would still be hard for you to hear what they said to you but you lean forward and confide in me as when you arrived once at some finely wrought conclusion in the old days that now what interests you most of all is birdsong you have a plan to take some birds with you
