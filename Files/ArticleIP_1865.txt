 Larry Bird When Larry Bird and Magic Johnson retired six years ago they left the National Basketball Association in the capable hands of Michael Jordan Now Bird wants it back His Indiana Pacers face the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference Finals in what could be Jordan s final season Basketball pundits think that the tough wily Pacers are the team that can dethrone the five time champion Bulls Bird a thing of beauty and a joy forever as a player is turning out to be a fabulous coach too When lured out of retirement a year ago he was bored to death of fishing and golfing the Pacers had just finished a miserable 39 43 season had missed the playoffs and were led by a core of aging disgruntled players This year with a virtually identical roster Bird has coached Indiana to a 58 24 record the best in the team s history Tuesday Bird was named deservedly the NBA s Coach of the Year Wednesday his team finished off the New York Knicks to advance to the conference finals Larry Legend s emergence as a coaching phenom is surprising In part it s so because when he played for the Celtics he used to say he would never coach in the NBA It s also surprising because Bird the Coach is not much like Bird the Player at least not in the ways you might expect At Indiana State University and during his early NBA career Bird gulled fans opposing players and the media He played the rube He had grown up in the small poor Indiana town of French Lick and he dubbed himself the Hick from French Lick His redneck accent and reinforced the impression that he was a dim good ol boy So did his doughy face blond feathered hair and beaky nose The 6 foot 9 inch Bird looks appropriately very much like Big Bird But behind that bumpkin s exterior lurked a man of endless guile and will Bird may have been slow but he was an astounding passer an elegant shooter a vicious rebounder and the league s toughest competitor He was always busy on the court If he didn t make the assist he made the basket if he didn t make the basket he grabbed the rebound if he didn t grab the rebound he made the steal He was also a relentless psychological warrior So taciturn in public Bird was the NBA s most notorious trash talker mocking opponents attempts to guard him Once when Magic rushed over to stop him Larry stared at him said You know you re too late and buried a jumper Bird goaded and inspired his own teammates and they heeded him If he told a teammate to do something he did it Thanks in large part to Bird the Celtics were a single minded and selfless Bird and Magic are permanently yoked in NBA legend They entered the NBA together rose together retired together One of the greatest achievements of each is that he destroyed the stereotype about himself Magic the black mouthy Showtime guard won over basketball fogies with his sound fundamentals and court intelligence Bird the solid white guy won over Magic s fans with his creative shooting and flashy passing So why is Bird s coaching career taking off when Magic s flopped Magic s 16 game stint coaching the Los Angeles Lakers was a disaster He failed as a coach for the reason that other great players have failed as coaches He thought about himself too much He complained his players didn t care about the game the way he did He felt he still belonged on the court But the 41 year old Bird has a cranky back and he s accomplished everything any basketball player could ever dream of He doesn t want to play anymore and he doesn t need to show off As a result Bird is a very effective very unobtrusive leader The player who used to be involved in every play has become a coach who is hardly involved in any of them Player Bird was a maximalist Coach Bird is a minimalist His predecessor as Pacers coach Larry Brown hectored and nit picked in practices and games Bird is quiet has short meetings and never chews out his players publicly He doesn t criticize them when they make turnovers or commit fouls and he doesn t tell them how to play He treats them as professionals just as he liked his coaches to treat him Bird s coaching philosophy which he repeats over and over is It s a player s game He laid down a few commandments Thou shalt be well conditioned thou shalt be thou shalt not hot dog Then he let his players do their jobs Pacers guard Mark Jackson explained Bird s hands off style this way to the Denver Post You don t have to tell Chris Mullin how to come off a pick You don t have to tell Reggie Miller what to do when he catches the ball in the fourth quarter You don t have to teach Rik Smits how to make post moves The laissez faire philosophy has worked wonders on the Pacers Last year they were spooked This season they sense Bird s trust They play confidently hustle and never choke in the fourth quarter They re selfless They have the most balanced scoring of any NBA team It s true that the Pacers don t play beautiful or acrobatic basketball They play something much rarer in the NBA these days team basketball The greatest tribute to Bird is that his players now play as he used to With typical canniness Bird chose to coach a team that would listen to him The Pacers are veterans The average age in the starting lineup is 32 and the roster is filled by NBA workhorses such as Mullin Jackson and Dale Davis They have only one star Miller and no prima donnas Could Bird manage a different group of players It s a full time job just controlling the young hotheads on some NBA squads Like many NBA old timers Bird deplores the MTVification of the league He doesn t like its glitz and disapproves of young players greed And he has said he wouldn t want to coach a team of youngsters Bird might not want to coach kids but he surely could The Pacer who has made the most improvement under Bird is Jalen Rose Rose used to be the NBA head case par excellence When he entered the NBA a few years ago he was supposed to be the next Magic a 6 foot 8 inch guard who could do everything But Rose struggled pouted mightily feuded with coaches and generally demoralized himself and the players around him Under Bird he has settled in happily as a Pacers role player He s playing a little more scoring a little more and cooperating a lot more Bird gave him respect and Rose reciprocated It would be a fitting reward for Bird if his mature Calvinist style did catch on around the league Maybe just as he helped revive pro basketball as a player in the early 80s he can revive the game as a coach in the late 90s saving it for a generation of kids who never saw Larry Legend play If you missed
