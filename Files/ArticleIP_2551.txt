 PC TV Mixmaster Does your television want to be a computer Does your computer want to be a VCR Does your Mixmaster want to be a telephone The moguls who control the computer television and telephone businesses think so and they are populating your future with Internet appliances Already on sale are such I appliance devices as Web aware televisions and e mail telephones which offer quick and easy Internet access for consumers who fear personal computers These appliances are as simple to run as a microwave or a toaster oven Just plug them in and before you know it you re reading your favorite online magazines ordering Puff Daddy the Family concert tickets and composing e mail from the comfort of your Naugahyde couch TV and telephone manufacturers are nuts about I appliances because they view them as a way to sell new boxes to a world supersaturated with phones and televisions More U S homes have a television 96 percent than have phone service The computer industry sees I appliances as a way to sell chip and software packages to what they consider an under PCed world Only 40 percent of U S households own a PC and two thirds of all new PC purchases are made by folks who already own one The vision of a computer television telephone thingamajig dates back to early episodes of The Jetsons if not before Techno utopian George Gilder foresaw the convergence of all these electronic boxes into one back in his 1990 book Life After Television proposing a simple yet powerful teleputer device Gilder was right about convergence but as we ll see he was also wrong Among the first entries in the I appliance market is WebTV a 300 box and keyboard combination built by Sony and Phillips WebTV hooks your television into your telephone line to provide access to the Web Full disclosure I work for the Great Satan that is behind WebTV Think of WebTV as a whip smart version of the set top box you rent from your cable TV provider What s smart about WebTV compared with a set top box WebTVs are essentially tiny simple computers The new model boasts a 1 1 gigabyte hard drive and a 56 600 bits per second modem comparable to what you d find in a low end laptop The cable company s set top boxes which couldn t calculate the cube root of 8 if you gave them a hint merely decode TV signals from the cable people A unit of Oracle Corp has developed a similar Web aware product called Enhanced TV Sun Microsystems which recently bought I appliance designer Diba Inc is also developing a competing set top standard of its own OpenTV Web aware televisions are fantastic because they re cheap and they work But they also suck because they re slow and their graphics are worse than what you find on a PC monitor Only 100 000 WebTVs have been sold so far but that number is sure to rise WebTV vendor Phillips is peddling the machine door to door Fuller Brush style Salesmen will visit your home plug you in and explain all the machine s wonders to you Another even simpler I appliance is the EP 200 e mail telephone by Uniden This device merges a Caller ID ready 900 MHz cordless phone with e mail and calendar systems A tad pricier at 399 than WebTV the EP 200 is fun for the whole family allowing multiple users to receive and send e mail the Internet connection costs 4 95 a month Uniden and others promise Web browsing on future e mail telephones Also flooding the market are cellular phones that send and receive e mail Not content with being your spreadsheet program word processor Web device game machine and recipe keeper PCs want to be your home entertainment center too A variety of manufacturers build PCs that connect you to the Web display TV broadcasts play music CDs and screen DVD movies PC maker Gateway 2000 bills the Destination Digital Media Computer as an audio video monster that engulfs you in a wall of sound as you play Doom on a 31 inch monitor with a screaming 300 MHz Intel Pentium II processor Gateway hasn t attached a phone to it Yet The PC industry may believe in convergence but the broadcasters don t Broadcasters like their televisions dumb mostly because they re afraid that the PC industry will steal their business if computers and televisions merge They re probably right So the two groups have gone to war over the technical standards for the next TV technology digital TV All you need to know about the digital TV standard proposed by the computer people is that it s more flexible and powerful and offers better resolution and is much more computer friendly than the current standard of analog TV or the digital standard pitched by broadcasters Cable company spinoff WorldGate also wants your television to stay as dumb as an eggbeater because it s found a way to offer cheap Internet access through existing cable boxes The cost is 4 95 a month keyboard rental will set you back an additional 1 95 Question How can something as stupid as a set top box connect to the Internet Answer WorldGate keeps all the brains back at the office Its computers recognize Web page requests from set top boxes and then ship the pages back to the requesting televisions in a compact single image a bitmap The WorldGate system depends on the vertical blanking interval an unused part of each TV channel to send the bitmap Click for a tidy explanation of the vertical blanking interval Critics say WorldGate s computers will choke when thousands of surfers start demanding Web pages Webhead says don t underestimate the cable companies who have such enormous bandwidth at their disposal that they can do anything see my piece on bandwidth Will your Mixmaster ever fulfill its career ambition to become an I appliance Shuman s Second Law of Computational Dynamics suggests so This law states that wherever computer chips go the Internet will follow Everything that s powered by electricity will eventually become studded with computer chips And as these dumb devices become smarter manufacturers will explore ways to make them more useful that is smarter still which means connecting them to the Internet so they can share their wisdom with other devices Take the example of the Internet enabled car currently a pipe dream The modern automobile is laden with microchips which control fuel intake cruise control anti lock brakes and more It s only a short step from where we are now to the Network Vehicle being developed by Netscape Sun Delco and IBM It will be outfitted with voice recognition transparent displays global positioning systems and Internet access The Network Vehicle designers left car phones off the list I guess because they assume that car phones are practically standard equipment today The take home lesson of this edition of Webhead is that all electronic devices are converging at a wicked rate But they re also diverging Our powerful multipurpose computers will continue to become even more powerful but as they acquire new skills like voice recognition their appeal will be limited by their price Meanwhile their simpler brethren assigned specific and narrow tasks look for Internet aware watches biomedical monitors and security devices will occupy the price niche of clock radios and bread makers In the future the way to tell a real computer from an I appliance will be that you tell a real computer what to do and when to do it whereas an I appliance will tell you what to do and when to do it
