 Bill Bradley s Air Ball Last week announcing his candidacy for president Bill Bradley compared politics to basketball recalling his love of discipline teamwork and the swish of the net Pundits ate up the speech Paul Gigot called it a character and ethics assault on Bill Clinton and Al Gore Fred Barnes applauded Bradley for slam dunking the case against Gore It s the best speech I ve ever heard him give said Margaret Carlson A video replay of the speech however shows that the swish was the sound of a jump shot missing the rim altogether Bradley continues to think up new ways of saying nothing while making it look like something 1 Leadership A speech can set a direction define an agenda and explain what the candidate has done or would do Instead of fulfilling these responsibilities Bradley simply asserts that he has fulfilled or will fulfill them He promises to act on his convictions but doesn t say what they are Rather than explain where America should go he says he has a strong sense of where America is and where we need to go Rather than define America s role in the world he pledges to define more clearly America s role in the world Rather than challenge his listeners or tell them where he plans to lead them he says they deserve leadership that respects the people as well as challenges them Rather than say what he would do he promises There are two kinds of politicians those who talk and promise and those who listen and do I know which one I am 2 Depth Bradley like George W Bush says prosperity isn t enough What we need in America is a deeper prosperity a prosperity that makes us feel rich inside as well as out he argues The leadership that is called for at this moment goes beyond a presidency and into every home and heart A leadership that understands the people s fears as well as their hopes By exuding profundity Bradley shames those who wonder what it means to feel rich inside and why this is more important than rising incomes and declining unemployment The problem isn t that Bradley s message is empty The problem is that you re too shallow to understand it 3 Immeasurability The Dow Jones is at record heights Bradley concedes but such numbers are not the measure of all things They do not measure what is in our heads and our hearts They do not measure a young girl s smile or a little boy s first handshake or a grandmother s pride They convey nothing about friendship or the self fulfillment of helping a person in need They tell us little about the magic of a good marriage or the satisfaction of a life led true to its own values As Slate s Jacob Weisberg these things have nothing to do with the presidency But never mind The point is that they can t be measured and therefore no one can disprove Bradley s suggestion that they re lacking today and that his presidency would restore them 4 Wholeness Bradley speaks constantly of elusive wholes America should be made whole he says He proposes to build racial unity confidence in our collective will and a prosperity that adds up to more than the sum of all our possessions A team is not just about winning he adds It s about shared sacrifice it s about giving up something small for yourself in order to gain something large for everyone It s the same for our country What is the something large What does unity entail What does our collective will call for Bradley doesn t dwell on such coarse concerns The point is wholeness itself 5 Things Lest anyone doubt Bradley s substance he touts his record of doing things In the Senate he reached across party lines to get things done I attempted to do big things without ever losing sight of the little things If elected he ll do some of the big things that need to be done We will do fewer things but they will be essential things and we will do them more thoroughly And what exactly are these large and essential things Bradley cites only one example the Works Project Administration How he would apply a Depression era public jobs program to today s roaring economy remains unclear 6 Reality To those who suspect him of empty idealism Bradley asserts a firm grasp of reality Isn t it just common sense that we make sure every child in America is covered by health care he asks Isn t it just common sense that we protect our natural world from destruction and do what it takes to achieve racial unity Isn t it common sense that all our schools should perform well and that more Americans should do better economically What others may call idealism is a common sense reality I know we can achieve How will Bradley realize these realities He doesn t say The point is that he will do what it takes Really It s just common sense 7 Possibility The American Dream Bradley argues is not just an ideal to wish on It should be a possibility available to all The renewal of the American Dream has to shine so bright that we can dream dreams we never thought possible before I want that hope that encouragement that sense of possibility to be a reality for everybody Since possibility can t be measured no one can disprove Bradley s claim that the American Dream is impossible for too many people today and no one can disprove him if he claims four years from now that he has made it possible again 8 Poetry Bradley relies heavily on metaphors Americans should be fixing our roof while the sun is shining he says As president he pledges to set the table for future economic growth put every American on the train of that deeper broader prosperity and urge Americans to bridge the divide of prejudice What any of this means is left to the imagination As a child Bradley recalls he learned from his father that character is where you find it As a senator I tried to help people where they lived their lives As president he will invest in our common future So if you want a president who invests in the past finds character where it isn t and helps people where they don t live vote for someone else 9 Skepticism Our campaigns often end up doing the very opposite of what they intend Bradley laments Instead of engendering hope and optimism they breed mistrust and cynicism Just last week in Iowa after I spoke about political involvement once again making our nation better a woman came up to me and said It all sounds so wonderful if only it could be true Yes the American people have a right to be skeptical But I have a right to try to change that skepticism I am trying to run a different kind of presidential campaign I m calling us to renew our faith in each other Skepticism as Bradley defines it is about whether a big money political system will let his vision come true This obscures a more sophisticated skepticism about whether he has a substantive vision to begin with much less a serious plan to achieve it Bradley isn t asking us to overcome that skepticism He s asking us to overlook it And by planting what looks like a bold idea that the purpose of campaigning is to engender optimism and renew our faith he erases his obligation to tell us how he would govern Bradley s campaign it turns out isn t about the presidency It s about campaigning The pundits can t believe Bradley has nothing to say Some surmise that he s cleverly waiting to unveil his platform Others infer that he s already mounting a brilliantly oblique attack on Gore Both camps read insight into his every remark If you don t recognize his wisdom you must not get what the election is about Does Bradley get it Don t be a cynic Ask not whether your candidate is worthy of you but whether you are worthy of your candidate
