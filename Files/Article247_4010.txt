                                 New Age in China                        Dear Todd            The way you describe your life is starting to sound glamorous to me Wedont even have hour waffle places out here If we want waffles we haveabout a hour window of opportunity and after that tough luck youre onyour own            I have never been to Madison Wis but this dayandnight access to wafflesmay be all the reason I need to start planning a trip The last time I visitedyour general part of the country I learned a different but equally interestingregional dietary lesson Apparently restaurants around there do not feel thata salad is really a salad unless it has first been deep fried and then soakedin a heavy cream sauce I went to one salad bar where not only did I not seeanything that reminded me of a vegetable and by the way Im intentionallygoing to skip the reflexive but pointlessly callous joke I could make about thecustomers who Im sure upon closer examination were lovely and admirablepeople but among the salad ingredients being offered was a dish ofchocolate pudding I thought to myself God bless the dietician behind thismenu who deserves a nomination for a Nobel Peace Prize just for gettingchocolate pudding reclassified as a salad            I guess you must be relieved that our friend Moesha has rehydrated and hershow is back in production in time for it to be considered as a possible exportto China under the new Trade Pact I wonder what the first Chinese products tohit our stores will be If things work the way they usually do in commercewhen they find out our stores are already glutted with Chinese frozen food myguess is that they will begin to make and export enchiladas According to theNew York Times  the president of the AFLCIO John Sweeney said it wasdisgustingly hypocritical of the administration to claim to be keeping theinterests of working people in mind as it negotiates with a regime thatroutinely violates human rights Which got me to thinking about how theChinese government continues to arrest and jail members of a religiousgroupsectcult called Falun Gong which from what I understand sounds likekind of a cross between tai chi yoga and the kind of New Age philosophy aboutcontrolling your bodys energy centers that would make it not only a belovedspiritual staple but also a marketing bonanza at least in Los Angeles andeventually the rest of the country Maybe when they realize that their socialirritants might well be their most profitable exports it will be the kick inthe butt the Chinese government will need to start respecting the rights of itscitizens            On the furiouswithrage front how about that creepy antiabortiondunderhead Christopher H Smith keeping us from paying our UN dues becausepart of the money supports womens health organizations that have proabortionties Its good of him to be putting energy into making sure that the unwantedchildren of the future will be born into to a world without a functioningUnited Nations            And while Im in the anger section of todays events I loved Donald Trumpscomments as he campaigns in Miami The New York Daily news quotes Trumpas having looked the other candidates over and come up with this incisivestatement Let me ask you did they make billions of dollars in a very shorttime I dont think so Since that is his criterion for excellence ingovernment I hope he will remember to review the rsums of drug dealerslotto winners sitcom stars and successful contestants from Who Wants To Bea Millionaire when he is picking out his cabinet I also love the way hebrings his girlfriend to press conferences to dress things up I hope in thefuture he will also bring a blowup of his bank statement and a wheelbarrow fullof cash and precious gems            Now I am on to reading about string theory            LoveMerrill
