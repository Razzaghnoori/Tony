 Background The rigid cell wall that forms a protective layer around most bacterial cells is chiefly composed of peptidoglycan a biopolymer unique to bacteria 1 2 The backbone of peptidoglycan consists of a chain of alternating N acetylglucosamine NAG and N acetylmuramate NAM units linked by a 1 4 glycosidic bond between the two hexoses The NAM units of the glycan chain are linked to short peptides which are synthesized via a ribosome independent mechanism and contain both canonical L amino acids and unusual D amino acids Cross links between these peptides hold together the glycan chains and give the cell wall its characteristic rigidity While this generic structure is conserved throughout the Bacteria there are number of variations in particular lineages of bacteria in terms of adducts to the glycan and composition of the peptide chain 1 2 A large suite of conserved enzymes such as glycosyltransferases which form the hexose polymers racemases which generate D amino acid units and peptidyltransferases and transpeptidases which form inter peptide linkages are involved in the biosynthesis of peptidoglycan 3 4 5 The bacterial cell wall is dynamic and undergoes reorganization during vegetative growth development and cell division 1 2 6 7 8 In these processes the wall is disassembled through the action of a diverse set of enzymes that hydrolyze various linkages in peptidoglycan These enzymes include glycosidases such as lysozymes that attack the polysaccharide backbone and peptidases that degrade the cross linking peptides 8 Some of these enzymes are also encoded by bacteriophages and are used to degrade the host cell wall 9 10 11 Biochemical and structural analysis of the peptide hydrolyzing enzymes of bacteria have revealed a large diversity of peptidases with different catalytic mechanisms Some well studied examples of these peptidases include Zn dependent peptidases of the Hedgehog carboxy terminal domain fold and the DD peptidases with a PAS domain like fold 12 13 14 15 16 17 The Bacillus subtilis autolysins LytE and LytF the Listeria monocytogenes proteins p60 and p45 and the Streptococcus PcsB proteins define another family of somewhat less well explored peptidoglycan hydrolyzing proteins that are present in all bacterial lineages 8 18 19 20 21 This family includes the Escherichia coli membrane associated lipoprotein N1pC and possesses a catalytic domain containing a conserved amino terminal cysteine and a carboxy terminal histidine Members of this family here termed the N1pC P60 family from the genus Bacillus have been shown to be D Lendopeptidases that hydrolyze the D glutamyl meso diaminopimelate linkage in the cell wall peptides 19 In B subtilis disruption of LytE Cw1F and LytF Cw1E causes the normally rod shaped cells to assume a long filament like morphology as a result of defective cell wall separation during cell division 18 19 22 In L monocytogenes p60 is an essential gene and has a similar role in cell separation 23 Multiple paralogous proteins with N1pC P60 catalytic domains are present in most bacteria suggesting that the N1pC P60 family is a peptidase family with a widespread role in the dynamics of the bacterial cell wall We sought to understand the evolutionary history of the proteins involved in cell wall dynamics because such an analysis could throw light on the emergence and diversification of this uniquely bacterial structure Such an investigation could also uncover hitherto under appreciated components of cell wall dynamic systems and could help in clarifying the biochemical mechanisms of certain poorly characterized but critical proteins Furthermore there is considerable interest in these proteins as they could be potential targets for antibacterial agents and some cell wall hydrolyzing enzymes from bacteriophages themselves function as antibacterial agents As a part of a comprehensive analysis of proteins involved in bacterial cell wall dynamics we studied the diversity of the N1pC P60 family Here we present evidence that these proteins define a large superfamily which encompasses several conserved lineages of proteins which were previously not known to be related to the N1pC P60 proteins These include the cell wall hydrolases typified by the Pal protein from streptococcal phages 24 25 and the amidase domain of the bacterial and kinetoplastid GSPS 26 We also show that members of the N1pC superfamily exist outside the bacterial superkingdom in eukaryotes large DNA viruses positive strand RNA viruses and certain archaea In eukaryotes one of the members of this family has been studied experimentally and possesses LRAT activity rather than peptidase activity 27 These eukaryotic versions along with certain bacterial forms show a circular permutation of the domain which results in a swapping of the positions of the catalytic cysteine and histidine residues in the sequence These observations point to greater diversity in terms of biochemistry biological functions and structural organization than has previously been recognized in this superfamily Results and discussion Sequence analysis and detection of novel divergent members To determine the entire extant of the N1pC P60 family we initiated PSI BLAST 28 searches of the non redundant database expect E value for inclusion in threshold 0 01 iterated to convergence with a number of starting points such as the catalytic domains of B subtilis LytF C1wE and LytE C1wF L monocytogenes P60 and P45 and E coli N1pC A search with the N1pC of E coli gi 15802120 residues 35 154 recovered several P60 homologs in its first iteration YaeF of E coli second iteration E 3 10 4 the Arabidopsis homolog of LRAT At5g16360 gi 15237330 second iteration E 5 10 4 and LytN of Staphylococcus aureus gi 3767593 fourth iteration 8 10 6 Reciprocal searches initiated with regions from the newly detected proteins YaeF LRAT and LytN detected their closely related homologs in the initial iterations but in subsequent iterations they recovered several classic N1pC P60 homolog members with significant E values E 0 01 suggesting that these proteins defined a novel superfamily of proteins The large set of homologous proteins from diverse bacteria which was recovered in these searches typically contain a characteristic amino terminal conserved region with a cysteine followed by a carboxy terminal conserved region with a characteristic histidine Figure 1 see also Additional data files In between these conserved regions there is another characteristic stretch with a highly conserved glycine that is often followed by an aspartate Figure 1 Hereinafter we term these obviously related bacterial proteins as the classical N1pC P60 group Thiol peptidases of the papain like transglutaminase like adenoviral protease like and caspase hemoglobinase like folds have a conserved cysteine C histidine H pair 29 30 31 32 Figure 2 However the context of the C H pair in the N1pC P60 peptidase domains along with the central motif with the conserved glycine G defines a unique constellation of residues Figure 1 which is not encountered in any of the above peptidase families Accordingly this pattern served as a good marker to identify divergent homologs of the classical N1pC P60 family The above searches unexpectedly recovered LRAT and its homologs from various eukaryotes Caenorhabditis elegans developmental regulator Egl 26 candidate tumor suppressor H rev107 proteins from poxviruses and animal positive strand RNA viruses with statistically significant E values Transitive searches initiated with the divergent members detected in these searches additionally recovered the amidase domains of bacterial and kinetoplastid GSPS and the bacterial peptidoglycan degrading enzymes such as Lactococcus AcmB Staphylococcus LytA 33 and LytN 34 and their homologs The presence of three tandem repeats of the N1pC P60 module in the protein YwtD from B subtilis allowed us to define the amino and carboxy terminal boundaries of this domain quite precisely The domain begins approximately 25 30 residues before the amino terminal conserved cysteine and ends 40 55 residues from the carboxy terminal conserved histidine A search for conserved motifs using the Gibbs sampling procedure resulted in the detection of three conserved motifs with a probability of chance occurrence 10 12in the search space comprising these proteins These motifs correspond to the above mentioned conserved signatures which are characteristic of the NlpC P60 like proteins and were readily identifiable in all true positives recovered in the transitive sequence profile searches Interestingly the eukaryotic versions typified by the LRAT their viral homologs and the bacterial forms typified by E coli YaeF while containing all the hallmark signatures of the NlpC P60 catalytic domain showed a reversal in the positions of the motifs with the conserved cysteine and the conserved histidine in their primary structures Figures 1 2 Thus in these proteins the central motif of the classic NlpC P60 proteins with the conserved glycine was the most amino terminal conserved motif followed by the motif containing the conserved histidine and then the one with the cysteine This arrangement suggested that there was a circular permutation with respect to the classical NlpC P60 module in these proteins All the NlpC P60 homologs recovered in the above searches were collated and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST bit score to high scoring pairs HSP length ratios using the BLASTCLUST program Multiple sequence alignments were prepared for the individual clusters using T Coffee 35 and their secondary structure was predicted with the PHD program 36 A comparison revealed that the core secondary structures of both the classical NlpC P60 modules as well as those with permuted motifs showed 90 or greater concordance These observations taken together suggest that classical NlpC P60 like peptidases the LRAT like permuted forms and the divergent GSPS amidase domain like proteins comprise a vast superfamily of enzymes with different biochemical activities Structural and biochemical features of the NlpC P60 superfamily Secondary structure prediction based on multiple sequence alignments revealed that the NlpC P60 superfamily domains adopt an fold with segregated and elements Figure 1 The first recognizable secondary structure element in this domain is an helix that is present in practically all members of this superfamily with the exception of a few members of the AcmB family from Staphylococcus aureus Figures 1 2 where it appears to have entirely degenerated The most prominent helix which is conserved in all proteins of this superfamily is the second helix which is associated with the first conserved motif The conserved cysteine occurs at the extreme amino terminus of this helix and is typically preceded by a polar residue The central motif with the conserved glycine and the motif bearing the conserved histidine correspond to the two well conserved strands Three more strands are predicted to occur carboxy terminal to these two strands Of these the strand that immediately follows the strand with the conserved histidine contains a conserved polar residue either histidine or an acidic or amide residue By analogy with all other thiol proteases in the NlpC P60 superfamily peptidases the cysteine would act as the nucleophile that attacks the peptide bond while the histidine acts in sequential steps as the base and then acid catalyst for the proton transfers 37 In other thiol proteases the histidine is oriented to a hydrogen bond with the cysteine by a third polar residue 37 The presence of a third conserved polar position in the strand that follows the histidine containing strand suggests that it serves as the orienting residue for the catalytic histidine in the NlpC P60 While there is no directly detectable sequence similarity between the NlpC P60 proteins and other superfamilies of peptidases the arrangement of catalytic residues with respect to the conserved secondary elements in this superfamily is the same as that in several other peptidase superfamilies Figure 2 The configuration comprising a catalytic cysteine at the amino terminus of a helix packed against a core three stranded sheet with the second and third strands bearing the catalytic histidine and its orienting polar partner is seen in the transglutaminases and a related class of amino group acetyltransferases papain like proteases adenoviral proteases and ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolases 32 38 Figure 2 This suggests that despite the absence of significant sequence similarity the NlpC P60 domain is likely to contain a structural core corresponding to the classical papain like protease fold Figure 2 In the case of papain like proteases calpains transglutaminases and NH 2 acetyltransferases the three stranded sheet of the core is incorporated into barrel with five to eight constituent strands Figure 2 Contrary to this in the case of the ubiquitin carboxy terminal hydrolases and the adenoviral proteases there is a tendency for the sheet to be incorporated into a scaffold with other helical elements forming a mixed structure The observation that the three stranded unit of the NlpC P60 domain is followed by two other strands suggests that the NlpC P60 proteins are likely to form a five stranded barrel similar to that seen in papain like proteases Figures 1 2 However in the NlpC P60 domain the distance between the helix bearing the catalytic cysteine and the core barrel is similar to that seen in the transglutaminases and NH 2 aminotransferases suggesting that it lacks the large insert that is seen in several papain like proteases Figure 2 This difference may also explain the failure of sequence structure threading algorithms such as the combined fold prediction and 3DPSSM 39 to recover any significant hits to the papain like proteases Thus the NlpC P60 domain is structurally close to the minimal ancestral unit of the thiol protease fold The prediction of a classical thiol protease fold for the NlpC P60 proteins also explains the circular permutation of the conserved motifs that is observed in several members of this superfamily such as LRAT and YaeF Figure 1 Precedent for such a permutation is offered by the adenoviral proteases in which the sheet with the catalytic histidine precedes the helix with the catalytic cysteine 40 41 In this fold the carboxyl terminus of the structure barrel or sheet with the histidine typically occurs in close proximity to the amino terminal region of the domain Figure 2 This could allow a permutation to survive without distorting the overall spatial arrangement of the catalytic residues A comparison of the conserved residues and predicted secondary structure of the regular NlpC P60 domain with the permuted versions suggests that the five stranded barrel is maintained intact with the remaining segment including the helix with the cysteine being linked to either the amino or carboxyl terminus of the barrel Figures 1 2 The only biochemically characterized eukaryotic representative of this superfamily is LRAT which transfers an acyl group from the sn 1 position of phosphatidylcholine lecithin to retinal to form retinyl esters 27 42 43 The general base of the enzyme cysteine accepts the acyl group from lecithin and this is followed by retinol being directed to attack the acyl enzyme by the catalytic histidine followed by the release of the retinyl ester 42 43 The similarity of this reaction mechanism to that catalyzed by the catalytic triad cysteine and serine proteases has been previously proposed 27 44 The phylogenetic relationship we demonstrate between the LRAT family of enzymes and thiol peptidases shows that this catalytic triad was derived only once in evolution and re used for different mechanistically similar reactions such as acyl transfer transacylation or peptide bond hydrolysis The presence of an analogous situation in the transglutaminases 30 45 and the related NH 2 acyltransferases 46 suggests that diverse acetyl acyltransferase activities have been repeatedly derived in course of the evolution of the papain like fold The presence of duplicated versions of the NlpC P60 domain in some proteins Figures 1 3 suggests that the permutation could have potentially occurred through a duplicate intermediate in which the either the amino or carboxyl terminus of each of the copies degenerated leaving behind a stable permuted unit In the thiol protease fold variable sized inserts are often seen in the region between the strand containing the histidine and the strand bearing the orienting polar residue This feature is even observed in the NlpC P60 superfamily including the insertion of an entire zinc ribbon domain 47 in the case of the plant homologs of LRAT The orienting polar residue is either an acidic or a polar amide residue in most members of the thiol peptidase fold 32 37 In the majority of the members of the NlpC P60 superfamily this residue is histidine which in the appropriate environment can act equivalently to an acidic orienting residue In the NlpC P60 domains of the AcmB like divergent group and the circularly permuted YaeF like and poxviral groups this residue is an acidic residue as in most other thiol peptidases Figure 1 However in the AcmB like group it is shifted by two positions with respect to the rest of the superfamily Figure 1 suggesting a specific elongation of the strand bearing this residue in this lineage Functional architectural and phylogenetic diversity of the NlpC P60 superfamily The P60 like family The P60 like family typified by P60 and its obvious relatives includes the most commonly occurring versions of the superfamily which are seen in most bacterial lineages Figures 3 4 All members of this family have either a signal peptide or a transmembrane region indicating an extracellular location Figure 3 All characterized members of this family are peptidases and they either hydrolyze the D glutamyl meso diaminopimelate linkage or N acetylmuramate L alanine linkage 19 25 There are 10 clearly identifiable orthologous lineages within this family which have varying phyletic distributions in bacteria Figure 3 Some of these like the YwtD like orthologous group are prevalent only in Gram positive bacteria while the NlpC like orthologous group is present in both Gram positive bacteria and proteobacteria The Pal lineage of the NIpC like orthologous group is restricted to the bacteriophages and their prophage remnants in Gram positive bacteria They hydrolyze the N acetylmuramate L alanine linkage and are potent bacteriolytic enzymes 24 25 They appear to represent a case where a host enzyme has been exapted re used by a virus for penetrating the bacterial cell wall The presence of the P60 like family in most bacterial lineages suggests that a representative of this lineage was probably present before the divergence of the bacteria from a common ancestor However it appears to have differentiated to several distinct orthologous groups only later in bacterial evolution Several orthologous groups show a patchy phyletic pattern for example the orthologous group SCP1 148 is present in the actinomycetes and the Gram positive bacterium Clostridium acetobutylicum It shows a lineage specific expansion in the former taxon with 11 and 3 closely related paralogous forms in the genomes of Streptomyces and Mycobacterium tuberculosis respectively Such phyletic patterns together with the presence of members of this family in genomes of phages and prophages suggests that lateral transfer was involved in the dissemination of some of these orthologous groups Gene loss is an alternative possibility that could in part explain the sporadic distribution of some of these orthologous groups If the trees showed a consistent clustering of proteins only from bacteria with large genomes in which gene loss is less pervasive then gene loss is likely to be a major factor However this pattern in not observed Figures 3 4 suggesting an important role for lateral transfer In addition to the variable phyletic patterns the proteins of the P60 like family also show extensive lineage specific diversification in terms of their domain architectures Figure 3 In many proteins the catalytic peptidase domain is fused to domains such as SH3 LysM and choline binding domains 51 52 Figure 3 These domains probably aid them in interactions with peptides carbohydrates and lipids that are associated with the bacterial cell wall The NlpC P60 domain is also fused to other catalytic domains such as the polysaccharide hydrolyzing lysozyme domain and the JAB domain that has recently been described to have metallopeptidase activity 53 54 These are likely to function as two headed enzymes that simultaneously attack different linkages in the murein These architectures point to the potential diversity in the biological functions of the autolysins in bacterial cell wall metabolism They could be functional at different spatial locations and at different temporal points in the life cycle thereby contributing to the diversity in the morphology of the bacterial cell and colonies The AcmB LytN like family The AcmB LytN like family is the most divergent family of the NlpC P60 superfamily Figure 4 The monophyly of this family is strongly supported in the phylogenetic analysis RELL bootstrap 99 and by synapomorphies such as the position of the orienting polar residue see above Two major subfamilies within this family typified respectively by AcmB and S aureus LytN are predominantly restricted to the Gram positive bacteria and function as cell wall hydrolases The AcmB subfamily shows a lineage specific expansion in the genome of S aureus with around seven paralogs Both the subfamilies exhibit considerable diversity of domain architectures with most of the architectures mirroring those seen in the P60 like family Thus these proteins contain fusions of the NlpC P60 peptidase domain with the SH3 choline binding LysM lysozyme and NAM amidase domains Figure 4 and this implicates them in different processes in cell wall dynamics A third subfamily of the AcmB LytN like family is typified by the amino terminal amidase domain of the GSPS from proteobacteria and trypanosomes 26 55 56 GSPS is a bifunctional enzyme its synthase domain carries out the ATP dependent fusion of two glutathione moieties to the polyamine spermidine to form the antioxidant metabolite GSP while its amidase domain hydrolyzes the amide linkage to release glutathione and spermidine 26 55 56 The proteomes of Methanosarcina and the Gram positive bacterium C acetobutylicum have a member each of this GSPS like subfamily Both these proteins are secreted proteins with the version from Methanosarcina MM2478 additionally containing von Willebrandt factor A immunoglobulin and fibrinogen like repeat domains Figure 4 The phyletic distribution suggests that the AcmB LytN like family emerged early in the Gram positive lineage through rapid sequence divergence With the exception of the GSPSs all the proteins within each subfamily of this family are secreted or membrane associated Even the closest relatives of the GSPSs namely MM2478 and CAC1526 are secreted proteins that are likely to function as extracellular peptidases This suggests that even the GSPS subfamily probably arose within the Gram positive bacteria followed by a lateral transfer to the archaeon Methanosarcina and the proteobacteria In the latter lineage it was exapted to function as an intracellular enzyme probably due to the similarity in structure of GSP and the ancestral extracellular substrate namely the peptidoglycan peptides MM2478 is a rare instance of an NlpC P60 superfamily member occurring in the archaeal lineage Its domain architecture suggests that it might function as a protease in the maturation of the complex extracellular matrix of this multicellular archaeon The YaeF Poxvirus G6R like and the LRAT like families Both the LRAT like and the YaeF Poxvirus G6R families are unified by the circular permutation that occurs at essentially the same point in both these families The YaeF Poxvirus G6R shows a peculiar phyletic distribution of being present only in bacteria the archaeon Archaeoglobus C elegans and the poxviruses Figure 4 The synapomorphy that unifies this family is the presence of an acidic orienting residue in the catalytic triad Figure 1 Given the widespread distribution of this family in bacteria with multiple distinct lineages it is likely that this family arose early in the bacteria through a circular permutation from an ancestral classical NlpC P60 domain Subsequently it appears to have been transferred from a bacterial source to Archaeoglobus the nematode lineage and the common ancestor of all poxviruses The high degree of conservation and maintenance of this protein across both entomopoxviruses and vertebrate poxviruses suggests that it performs an important function in these viruses Figures 1 4 Along with the LRAT proteins these proteins contain a second conserved cysteine red letters in Figure 1 carboxy terminal to the catalytic cysteine This second cysteine has been shown to be critical for a functional LRAT enzyme suggesting that the poxviral proteins may have a related activity see below 42 Formation of acyl conjugates during the maturation of the lipoprotein component of the viral capsid could be one such potential function Alternatively these proteins could function as proteases in the maturation of the viral particle The LRAT family is thus far found only in eukaryotes and animal viruses with the sole exception of a single member from the proteomes of Vibrio cholerae and Anabaena The LRAT and its obvious orthologs are found in addition to the vertebrates in other animals and plants In vertebrates the enzyme has an important role in the storage and mobilization of retinol vitamin A as esters in peripheral tissues and for generating an intermediate in the synthesis of the rhodopsin chromophore in the visual tissues 27 The ortholog of the vertebrate LRAT Egl 29 in C elegans has been implicated in the development of the vulva 57 The Egl 29 function is required in the cell neighboring the one in which it is expressed suggesting that it may have a role in generating a regulatory signal 57 This could raise the interesting possibility of Egl 29 synthesizing an ester similar to the retinyl esters that might function as a secreted differentiation signal during vulval development The presence of orthologs in plants suggests that even plants may process retinol or related compounds similar to those in animals The vertebrates possess two other distinct subfamilies that appear to have been derived from the LRAT family Figure 4 One of these is typified by the candidate tumor suppressor protein H rev107 which inhibits growth of tumors induced by the oncoprotein H Ras 58 H rev107 has been shown to exist in two cellular isoforms one of which is associated with the cell membrane 59 60 This suggests that H rev107 could potentially act as an acyltransferase that might modify membrane components A homolog of H rev107 is detectable in the pathogenic bacterium V cholerae and phylogenetic analysis suggests that it has been acquired through lateral transfer from a vertebrate source Further experimental analysis of this bacterial protein could be of considerable interest as it could potentially have a role in interactions with its vertebrate host The second vertebrate specific subfamily is typified by the uncharacterized human protein NSE2 which could potentially function in a similar capacity to H rev107 However in these proteins the catalytic cysteine is replaced by a serine Figure 1 Such substitutions have previously been observed in other papain like peptidases with the serine participating in a functional active site 61 62 Multiple paralogs of both H rev107 and NSE2 are seen in vertebrates suggesting some functional diversification of these subgroups The viral homologs of H rev107 were observed in picornaviruses such as human parechoviruses Aichi virus and avian encephalomyelitis virus 63 We also detected related proteins in human caliciviruses such as the Norwalk virus and related viruses Figures 1 4 These proteins could potentially function as a second protease in the processing of viral polyproteins or they could function as a viral enzyme that could modify some membrane component like their cellular homologs All the members of the LRAT family including the forms from RNA viruses clearly form a distinct family which excludes the YaeF poxvirus G6R family which shows a similar circular permutation The widespread distribution of the LRAT family in eukaryotes suggests that they possessed the enzymes from an early stage in their evolution The NlpC P60 superfamily is largely absent from most archaeal proteomes However it is very widespread in bacteria and includes forms with circular permutations similar to the eukaryotic LRAT like proteins Hence the LRAT family was probably acquired by the eukaryotes by the lateral transfer of a bacterial precursor similar to the YaeF YiiX family This could have either occurred during the primary proteobacterial endosymbiosis which gave rise to the mitochondrion or as a result of a subsequent transfer from some other bacterial source The currently available sequences do not allow us to distinguish between these possibilities The drastic change in biochemical function might have resulted in an accelerated evolution of these eukaryotic proteins resulting in considerable divergence from the bacterial YaeF YiiX like forms Conclusions We present a detailed evolutionary and structural analysis of the NlpC P60 superfamily of peptidases We show that this superfamily in addition to the well characterized P60 related peptidoglycan peptidases includes divergent cell wall hydrolases typified by AcmB LytN eukaryotic proteins such as LRAT Egl 26 and their relatives amidase domains of GSPSs and several other uncharacterized bacterial proteins We identified three residues involved in catalysis namely a cysteine a histidine and a polar residue that are conserved throughout this superfamily A comparison of the predicted secondary structure for this superfamily with known peptidase folds revealed that these three residues show exactly the same arrangement as the catalytic triad of papain like thiol peptidases The NlpC P60 domain is predicted to adopt a papain like fold in which the catalytic cysteine is at the amino terminus of a helix which is packed against a five stranded barrel with the histidine and the polar residue The NlpC P60 superfamily has diversified into four major families with two of them namely the LRAT and YaeF Poxvirus G6R families showing a circular permutation of the catalytic domain This analysis could considerably aid further experimental investigations of the NlpC P60 superfamily Certain members of this superfamily such as Pal have recently been proposed as potent antibacterial agents 24 Identification of novel members of this superfamily in diverse bacterial proteomes could point to additional candidates with similar bacteriolytic activity Furthermore this analysis could help in identifying enzymes with important roles in bacterial colony and cell morphology Recognition of Egl 26 H rev107 and NSE2 as homologs of LRAT suggests a potential role for these proteins as novel components of lipid metabolism in eukaryotes Further studies on the homologs of these proteins in diverse animal viruses and the pathogenic bacterium V cholerae could help in uncovering hitherto unknown mechanisms by which these pathogens could interact with their hosts Materials and methods The non redundant nr database of protein sequences National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI was searched using the BLASTP program 28 Profile searches were conducted using the PSI BLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query with a profile inclusion expectation E value threshold of 0 01 and was iterated until convergence 28 64 Before use in PSI BLAST searches the NlpC domain was evaluated for compositional bias using the SEG program 65 No such bias that could skew the statistics of sequence relationships in searches of the nr database was detected Accordingly to achieve maximum sensitivity all searches were run with the compositional bias based statistics turned off 66 Multiple sequence alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee program 35 followed by manual correction based on the PSI BLAST results Conserved motifs were searched for using the Gibbs sampling procedure Homologs recovered in the searches were collated and clustered at various thresholds of BLAST bit score to HSP length ratios using the BLASTCLUST program 67 Structural manipulations were carried out using the Swiss PDB viewer program 68 and the ribbon diagrams were constructed with MOLSCRIPT 69 Searches of the PDB database with query structures was conducted using the DALI program 70 71 Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple sequence alignment as the input for the PHD program 36 72 Signal peptides were predicted using the SIGNALP program 73 74 75 and the transmembrane regions were predicted using the TOPRED program 76 77 Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximum likelihood neighbor joining and least squares methods 49 50 Briefly this process involved the construction of a least squares tree using the FITCH program or a neighbor joining tree using the NEIGHBOR program both from the Phylip package 48 followed by local rearrangement using the Protml program of the Molphy package 50 to arrive at the maximum likelihood ML tree The statistical significance of various nodes of this ML tree was assessed using the relative estimate of logarithmic
