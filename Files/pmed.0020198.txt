                            Smoking is the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death        according to the World Health Organization Smokingrelated diseases kill one in ten adults        globally ie  million deaths annually by  if current trends continue smoking        will kill one in six people Smoking is a prime factor in heart disease stroke and        chronic lung disease which cost the United States more than  billion a year The        relationship between smoking and cardiovascular disease is well documented as is the        association of smoking with increased levels of inflammatory markers and accelerated        atherosclerosis It is also well known that when smokers quit their risk of mortality and        future cardiac events declines but there is little data quantifying the rate of this risk        reduction        Smoking triggers an immunologic response to vascular injury which is associated with        increased levels of inflammatory markers such as Creactive protein and white blood cell        count Several studies have shown that such markers predict future cardiovascular events        Markers such as Creactive protein are also increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of        atherosclerosis There are however still some gaps in our knowledge of cardiovascular        disease smoking and the predictive use of such markers For example few studies have        examined the impact of smoking cessation on levels of inflammatory markers or on        cardiovascular risk reduction the level and rate at which the inflammatory response        subsides following smoking cessation is also uncertain Furthermore whether traditional        risk factors can explain the decline in cardiovascular risk following smoking cessation is        also unclear        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Arvind Bakhru and Thomas Erlinger investigate the        association between smoking and smoking cessation and levels of inflammatory markers and        cardiovascular risk factors Data were gathered on  US adults between  and         in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Of these  were        classified as never smokers  were former smokers and  were current smokers        The investigators focused on changes in Creactive protein white blood cell count        albumin and fibrinogen and the traditional risk factorstotal cholesterol highdensity        lipoprotein cholesterol triglycerides systolic blood pressure and diabetesthat occurred        with decreased smoking intensity and increased time since smoking cessation They found        that inflammatory markers had a dosedependent and temporal relationship to smoking and        smoking cessation They noted that both inflammatory and traditional risk factors improved        with less smoking but as the time since smokers quit increased inflammatory markers        resolved more slowly than traditional cardiovascular risk factors Still the        smokingassociated inflammatory response returned to normal within five years after smokers        quit suggesting that the vascular effects were reversible and that cardiovascular risk        subsides gradually with reduced exposure        The authors conclude that these findings support the hypothesis that cardiovascular risk        falls as inflammatory response falls and that inflammatory markers are good indicators of        this risk reduction Despite limitations of the study including possible errors from        selfreporting and lack of data on secondhand smoke and newer measures such as        interleukin and highsensitivity Creactive protein the inflammatory markers studied        here demonstrated a much clearer trend and longerlasting effect after smoking cessation        than traditional risk factors and hence were more useful and accurate markers of        disease        As with related studies these results suggest that smoking cessation should be a more        prominent goal of public policy and the authors conclude that policymakers must pursue        smoking cessation plans as an opportunity to make savings on health care through        cardiovascular risk reduction Further research should explore the acute phase response in        the months after smoking cessation which this and other studies have not been able to        study adequately
