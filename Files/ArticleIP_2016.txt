 Homo Deceptus At the risk of sounding grandiose I hereby declare myself to be involved in a bitter feud with no less a personage than Stephen Jay Gould It all started in 1990 when I reviewed his book Wonderful Life for the New Republic I argued basically that Gould is a fraud He has convinced the public that he is not merely a great writer but a great theorist of evolution Yet among top flight evolutionary biologists Gould is considered a pest not just a lightweight but an actively muddled man who has warped the public s understanding of Darwinism Gould alas paid me no mind No testy letter to the New Republic nothing I heard through the grapevine that he was riled But savvy alpha male that he is he refrained from getting into a gutter brawl with a scrawny marginal primate such as myself Then last month my big moment finally arrived Gould s long repressed contempt burst forth from the reptilian core of his brain and leapt over the fire walls in his frontal lobes In an essay in Natural History magazine while dismissing evolutionary psychology as pop science he called my book The Moral Animal the most noted and most absurd example It is of course beneath my dignity to respond to this personally motivated attack except to note that if you think Stephen Jay Gould actually deigned to read my puny book you must be getting him mixed up with someone whose time is less precious Instead I will use the occasion of Gould s essay to make a major contribution to Western thought And actually come to think of it making this contribution will entail responding to Gould s personally motivated attack We ll start with Gould and get to Western thought later Gould s Natural History essay in keeping with his long tradition of taking courageous political stands argues against genocide Its final lines are It need not be We can do otherwise You may ask Where s the news value in noting that people can refrain from committing genocide Well Gould spent the previous half dozen paragraphs cultivating the impression that some people think genocide is hard wired into our genes Who are these people Good question Gould doesn t name names Instead just when you re starting to wonder who exactly is making this ridiculous claim he changes the subject to an allegedly analogous example of biological determinism currently popular Darwinian ideas about male and female psychology Here he can name names or at least one name That s where I come in Gould begins by distorting a basic evolutionary psychology argument that because men can reproduce more often and more easily than women natural selection which favors traits conducive to genetic proliferation has made the minds of men and women different Gould puts the posited difference this way Women in theory should act in such a way as to encourage male investment after impregnation protection feeding economic wealth and subsequent child care whereas men would rather wander right off in search of other mates in a never ending quest for maximal genetic spread The wander right off part is wrong Evolutionary psychologists classify our species as having high male parental investment Men are naturally inclined to fall in love with women stay with them through pregnancy and fall in love with the endearing little vehicles of genetic transmission that roll out of the womb To be sure men may be tempted to philander on the side even to fall in love with a second woman they are more inclined than women to both infidelity and polygamy Women do have a penchant for cheating or straying but under a narrower range of circumstances Moreover men find it easier to have sex without emotional attachment so they do sometimes want to wander right off after sex Still the fact that evolutionary psychologists don t view desertion as standard male procedure vaporizes what Gould considers one of his killer arguments Any man who has fiercely loved his little child including most fathers I trust knows that no siren song from distinctive ly male genes or hormones can overcome this drive for nurturing behavior shared with the child s mother If Gould knew the first thing about evolutionary psychology if he had say read my book he d know that this drive for nurturing behavior isn t some news flash to evolutionary psychologists It is central to their view of the tensions within male sexual psychology More noteworthy than Gould s warping of evolutionary psychology is that he actually embraces some of its premises On sex differences I don t think that the basic argument is wrong Such differences in behavioral strategy do make Darwinian sense Hmm Gould has denounced evolutionary psychology for years without to my knowledge making such concessions Now as it gains support within both biology and psychology he seems to be staging a strategic retreat But of course he can t be seen retreating He must in the end still manage to depict evolutionary psychologists as simpletons What to do Create confusion Gould informs us that the sexual strategies of men and women are mere capacities not requirements or even determining propensities Now first of all a truly determining propensity is a requirement So Gould without conspicuously positing a simplistic dichotomy has posited a simplistic dichotomy Every behavior infidelity genocide whatever is either a mere capacity or an inevitability Evolutionary psychologists Gould suggests tend to take the inevitability view while a more discerning interpretation of biology his takes the capacity view Let s not dwell on the sheer dishonesty of insinuating that I or any serious writers on evolutionary psychology believe infidelity or genocide or anything else is rendered inevitable genetically Well OK let s dwell briefly There The key point is this Isn t the range of alternatives to inevitability too broad to cram under the single heading of capacity Do I just have the capacity to eat doughnuts and hamburgers and broccoli No Unfortunately it s more complicated than that I almost always feel a very strong attraction to doughnuts To hamburgers I feel a fairly strong attraction under most circumstances For broccoli I can muster mild enthusiasm if I m feeling hungry or guilty All these attractions can be bridled but the amount and nature of the necessary effort differs by food type and by circumstance I concede that my inner turmoil over doughnuts is not of great moment But let s get back to things like infidelity men s desertion of their families or even genocide If we can learn something about how the underlying emotions wax and wane about the circumstances under which bad things are likely to happen wouldn t that be useful information Amazingly Gould suggests not After saying we learn nothing from current Darwinian theorizing about any darkness in human nature he continues At the very most biology might help us to delimit the environmental circumstances that tend to elicit one behavior rather than the other At the very most Delimiting those circumstances is the central aspiration of 20 th century psychology So even if Freud and Skinner had wholly succeeded in explaining how upbringing and social experience shape us it all would have been a waste of time Too bad they didn t have a luminary like Gould to explain that to them I ve heard many criticisms of evolutionary psychology but this is the first time I ve heard anyone dismiss it by saying that all it can do is find the Holy Grail of behavioral science Obviously evolutionary psychology hasn t yet come close to finding the Holy Grail But it has provoked ideas about the role of environment that if confirmed by further study can inform moral discourse and public policy For example I ve argued from ev psych premises that extreme inequality of income all other things being equal tends to raise the divorce rate This claim may turn out to be wrong but contrary to Gould s basic indictment of evolutionary psychology it is neither obvious nor if true useless I grant Gould that evolutionary psychology hasn t taught us much about genocide that we didn t already know So far its main contribution is to illuminate not epic enmity but the everyday subtle kind For example I just referred to Gould s dishonesty in misrepresenting my views but maybe the dishonesty isn t conscious Once I wrote that 1990 review I became a threat to Gould s social status an enemy According to evolutionary psychology it then became hard for him to objectively appraise anything I ve written though I suppose actually reading it would have been a start Tactically caricaturing my beliefs became an essentially unconscious process Similarly now that Gould has attacked me I have trouble being objective about him My radar readily picks up even magnifies his distortions and confusions but is less sensitive to my own missteps The editors of Slate will contact Gould and invite him to have an online debate with me during which the truth can emerge from dueling egocentric biases I predict Gould will ignore the invitation reverting to a risk averse alpha male strategy Anyway the point is just that we are all by nature deeply and unconsciously self serving in our judgments of others Gould and I are convinced of each other s confusion and the Hutus and Tutsis long before the slaughter began were convinced of each other s treachery One big problem with Gould s simplistic capacity necessity dichotomy is the way it obscures this commonality between us and the Hutus Gould in another sign of strategic retreat concedes that people have a biologically based capacity to view enemies as beyond fellowship and ripe for slaughter But that makes it sound as if most of us are entirely civil human beings while occasionally in some remote part of the world a genocide switch gets flicked and slaughter happens Those Serbs and Hutus may act like animals but we Americans have kept our capacity for evil turned off Many Germans presumably had a similarly high opinion of themselves in the early 1930s and no doubt such blithe self regard lubricates descent OK OK I won t get carried away I m not saying Americans are on a slippery slope toward genocide and that only evolutionary psychology can save the day My point is just that here comes my contribution to Western thought evolutionary psychology needn t as Gould fears be used to excuse evildoers as victims of biology It can actually serve humanity by making it harder for any of us to casually assume our own goodness It says we all warrant skeptical self scrutiny and it warns us that this scrutiny being unnatural is very hard But it also suggests that the effort is needed If you sit around waiting for some switch to get flicked you ll have waited too long
