                                 Fuzzy Logic            It is said that publishing is not a business but an art Movie executivesare famous for knowing their boxoffice grosses dollar for dollar the dayafter the movie opens Not book executives Ill call an editor and ask how aclients book is selling and hell say Oh gee I dont know Let me checkwith inventory an agent told me recently But of course all inventory cantell youwhen inventory finally gets back to the editor three days laterishow many books have been ordered not how many have been sold Not until muchlater as much as a year later after bookstores have returned all theirunsold copies can publishers compile firm sales figures And even then thenumbers are not particularly helpful Did a book sell better in Topeka or SanDiego In the spring or in the summer            There are ways to answer those questions but the book industry doesnt seemall that interested in the answers Bookscan for instance is a system madeand marketed by Soundscan the company that brings you the music industrysgreatesthits charts Soundscan gets its numbers from a scanning deviceinstalled at checkout counters at more than  percent of all music outlets inAmerica Bookscan is trying to put a similar gizmo into bookstores So far ithasnt caught on Unlike Soundscan which swept swiftly through the musicbusiness after it was introduced when Bookscan was unveiled last year it wasdismissed by the American Association of Publishers whose official line on itwas that it was too expensive Publishers would have to pay Bookscan for thedata            Was that the real reason it was rejected Publishers could have comeback to Bookscan and said we like your product but want you to bring yourprice down Youd think theyd be eager to learn whether local or nationaladvertising works better or whether book tours do anything other than strokeauthorial egos Culturebox doesnt know how much Bookscan was charging butwonders whether publishers really factored in the savings theyd accrue frombettertargeted marketing            Culturebox asked around and came up with a few other theories of whypublishing is one of the last industries to seek the comfort of hardnumbers             Editors dont want to know exactly how well their books are selling Itmight force them to stop buying the kinds of books they love publishingtheserious books with limited sales A corollary to this theory is that publishersdont want the world to see how small the unit sales are for even worldfamousauthors they usually linger under it might make the whole industryseem a lot less glamorous             Hard sales data might eliminate a cash hoard publishers have secured forthemselves It turns out that most contracts between authors and publishersallow publishers to withhold as much of  percent of royalties againstpossible returns during the first year of publication and as much as percent for paperbacks Precise pointofsale data would obviate that clauseand force publishers to fork over all royalties right away             The big chains have been quietly going into the business of compilingbook sales data themselvesan obvious thing to do given their dominance ofthe retail marketand dont want to give up what amounts to a competitiveadvantage This may explain why so far Bookscan has not cut deals with any ofthe big chains though they are talking to them Also if publishers aregetting the numbers for free from the chains why pay for them            Whatever the reason publishers are making it clear that what they want morethan anything is to keep their sales figures secret A Soundscan executive toldCulturebox this week that one change it had made to Bookscan in response topublishers concerns was to turn it into a closed system In other words thedata will not be published and no one but the publisher of a book will be ableto learn its hard sales figures Soundscan by contrast is an open systemExpect industrywide numbers to remain fuzzy in the foreseeable future             Judith Shulevitz
