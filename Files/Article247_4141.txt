 The Candid and the Canned Massa Honey So was Rockefeller really the vice president and I missed it As for Puff Daddy isn t he the one who dates the girl with the much discussed big behind As you may have gleaned this is not my kinda music making him I guess not my kinda guy And whatever happened anyway to names like Mel Torme and Tony Bennett But back to politics where they have names like Bauer and McCain and Bush A kind reader let me know the kind of doll I was thinking Bauer looked like a kewpie Well Liddy Dole is out of the race maybe he could make it work for him As for McCain who I admit to liking enormously Howie Kurtz this morning tells me why It s because the guy s mouth is on a trolley just like mine Kurtz says The Arizona senator rambles on about politics the military taxes his wife s ex boyfriend And this is my fave He blabs and banters and jokingly called an Associated Press reporter a jerk You know Massa Honey honesty is hard to come by these days and it is refreshing beyond belief Too bad for the AP guy though Kurtz goes on to say that aides sometimes cringe at McCain s flights of candor Well yes but the rest of us are enthralled OK some of the rest of us Any candidate who says I hate the French and calls the Vietnamese gooks and basically gets away with it with the press corps at least has really good karma and should not be dismissed out of hand Speaking of things genuine it seems the handlers of the Texas governor are having second thoughts about letting him get out there in the debates and just be himself Himself is looking dumb and programmed or is it stiff and smug Some former supporters according to the Boston Globe are deciding he is coming across as er unqualified to be president And while they re considering a makeover perhaps they ll deep six the phrase compassionate conservative That really is a little like a pregnant virgin And of course this is the wrong season to be making such an analogy Now do you see why I feel kinship with McCain In any case I do not think my fellow Americans are up for someone who says what he s actually thinking so it s probably ta ta J McC Tant pis Which proves obviously that I don t hate the French So au revoir Massa Honey It s a great day in Harvard Square and I m a goin on out there to read my Esther Williams book having loaned my copy of the Dean Acheson book to Dubya xxM
