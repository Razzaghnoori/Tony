 United States General Accounting Office Internal Control GAO Exposure Draft December 2000 Maintaining Effective Control Over Employee Time and Attendance Reporting GAO01186G Abbreviations INTRODUCTION In recent years significant changes in work place habits and technological advances have affected the manner in which time and attendance T A reporting is accomplished For example more flexible work schedules and places and the trend in government to streamline operations have provided a major impetus for changes in T A systems However perhaps the most significant influence on these changes is advancing technology and the increased use of automation The Government Paperwork Elimination Act GPEA encourages the movement toward paperless applications and the use of electronic signatures Although GPEA focuses on electronic systems regarding information obtained from and provided to sources outside the government it provides an additional impetus to agencies to seek further applications of paperless systems and use of electronic signatures Trends toward increased automation and workplace flexibility have changed the operating environment However the need for good internal control continues to exist To keep abreast of the changes especially those in automation we have revised this document to emphasize the attention that should remain regarding effective internal control in T A systems This document offers suggestions for taking advantage of the advancements in automated T A systems and updates the previous guidance to incorporate guidance offered in response to agency requests 1 As advancing technologies continue managers have greater flexibility in designing and implementing T A systems best suited for their agencies In designing and implementing new T A systems or components of existing systems management should strive for costbeneficial systems and related internal control The traditional work schedule followed by civilian employees differs from those generally followed by members on active duty of the armed services Because traditional work schedules influence internal control in T A systems this document contains two major parts the first dealing with civilian employees who are expected to be working usually during certain times and the second part dealing with members of the active duty armed services who are expected to be in a duty status and thus on call 24 hours a day Part I civilian employees provides guidance for civilian employees and part II military service members provides guidance for military service members Employees who are paid regardless of their presence or absence and who do not accrue leave under 5 U S C 6301 et seq e g certain political appointees are exempt from the provisions of this document 2 Questions on or interpretations of any material in this document may be submitted to the Managing Director Financial Management and Assurance U S General Accounting Office 441 G Street NW Washington DC 20548 1 When issued in final this document will replace our 1996 revision to Title 6 Pay Leave and Allowances of the GAO PolicyandProceduresManualforGuidanceofFederalAgencies 2 See Comptroller General Decision B123698 May 10 1978 BLANK PART I CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES INTERNAL CONTROL OBJECTIVES IN T A SYSTEMS The primary objective of a T A system is to ensure that hours worked hours in pay status and hours absent are properly reported Reliable data are important to accurately compute and account for computed pay leave and allowances To achieve this objective management should have in place an internal control system that provides reasonable assurance that 1 T A transactions are properly authorized and approved and 2 T A data are completely and accurately recorded and retained T A Transactions Are Properly Authorized and Approved The nature and extent of T A transaction approvals and controls can vary among T A systems Fully automated systems for example may require fewer approvals than manual systems because of automated edits and controls and the use of automated signatures Nevertheless the nature and extent of T A approvals must be such that management has assurance that supervisors or other officials know they are accountable for the approvals of an employee s work time and absences This helps ensure that accurate T A information is recorded and reported for the purposes of computing pay and allowances Primary responsibility for authorizing and approving T A transactions rests with the employee s supervisor who approves the employee s T A reports Timekeepers3 and supervisors must be aware of the work time and absence of employees for whom they are responsible to ensure the reliability of T A data To the extent practical changes to an employee s normal work schedule should generally be approved prior to the change actually occurring Unanticipated changes should be reviewed for approval or disapproval as soon as reasonably possible T A Data Are Complete and Accurate Because most federal civilian employees are paid on an hourly basis or fractions of an hour and earn and charge leave on that basis a complete and accurate record of the time an employee works must be retained as an official agency record available for review or inspection To provide a basis for pay leave and benefits the records must include aggregate hours of regular time other time e g overtime credit hours or compensatory time and leave 4 To help ensure accuracy the completed records must be reviewed and approved by the supervisor or other equivalent official In an automated environment system edits and other automated tests can 3 The traditional T A system normally involved a timekeeper who was responsible for assisting supervisors in recording and verifying employees work time and absences New T A systems can reduce or even eliminate timekeepers duties and shift the responsibilities to employees or supervisors Regardless of the changes made recording accurate T A information remains the primary control objective 4 Traditionally daily arrival and departure times were required to be recorded Although it is not required that daily records be maintained agency management may choose to do so by using signin signout sheets or other means assist the supervisor in his or her review and verify that recorded work time is accurate and allowable RELIANCE ON INTERNAL CONTROLS IN A T A SYSTEM As T A systems evolve toward increasingly automated methods of recording and reporting employee work and leave times it is important to implement and maintain a welldefined system that provides management with the confidence that controls are working as designed This can be done by Having a welldefined organizational structure and flow of T A data with clearly written policies and procedures setting forth the responsibilities of employees timekeepers if applicable and supervisors regarding recording examining and approving T A transactions Effectively applying available technology and concepts to achieve efficient and effective T A system processes in accordance with applicable requirements and the environment in which the agency operates Having the ability to record payroll costs by appropriation organizational code and work activity to facilitate application of required cost accounting for financial and program management Reviewing and testing all aspects of the T A systems processing procedures and controls in sufficient scope depth and frequency to provide reasonable assurance that key procedures and controls are working and effective and that data integrity is maintained Agencies T A systems are subject to periodic review under the Federal Managers Financial Integrity Act of 1982 FMFIA 31 U S C 3512 c d 5 RECORDING AND MAINTAINING COMPLETE AND ACCURATE T A RECORDS Required T A Information The following T A information and documentation should be recorded and maintained for each employee for each pay period 1 employee name and unique identifying number e g a social security number 5StandardsforInternalControlintheFederalGovernment GAO AIMD0021 3 1 was revised in November 1999 and is available on the Internet GAO home page www gao gov under Other Publications It is also available in hard copy by calling 202 5126000 or at the U S General Accounting Office 700 4th Street NW Room 1100 Washington D C In addition the Office of Management and Budget OMB requirements for evaluating financial systems and controls are in OMB Circular A123 InternalControlSystems June 1995 and OMB Circular A127 FinancialManagementSystems July 1993 These OMB and GAO issuances establish the criteria and rules for assessing and reporting annually on the status of agency systems and controls 2 pay period number or dates 3 hours worked 4 hours of premium pay by type to which the employee is entitled 5 dates and number of hours of leave by type credit hours and compensatory hours earned and used 6 6 evidence of approval by an authorized official usually the supervisor 7 any required supporting documentation or records for absences and 8 other information agencies believe necessary A T A record containing all required data elements can be 1 a manually completed hard copy document 2 an automated file retained electronically or 3 a combination of automated and manual records The T A information can be obtained using a number of different methods including but not limited to preprinted or designed T A forms other standard forms internal memorandums emails employee timekeeper or supervisor notations for example that might result from phone conversations or other formats so long as the documents are controlled and retained as the official T A record of employees The data contained in the T A records should be linked to accounting records and provide the necessary support for financial reporting and allocation of costs Recording T A Data Agency policy must affix accountability for recording the T A data referred to in the previous section The data may be recorded by the 1 individual employee 2 timekeeper 3 supervisor or 4 a combination of the three Agency policy must assign accountability for recording and maintaining T A data referred to in the previous section If the employee is not recording his or her T A data the basis for recording the data could be 1 the timekeeper s or supervisor s observation 2 time clocks or other automated timekeeping devices where not prohibited by law or 3 other applicable techniques The person recording the T A data acknowledges responsibility for the accuracy of the recorded data The point at which T A data are recorded can vary among different T A systems For example T A data may be recorded 1 daily 2 when deviations occur from an individual s or agency s established work schedule or 3 at the end of the pay period Regardless of the timing of recording T A data management must have in place a system of control techniques that gives reasonable assurance that the recorded information reflects time worked leave taken or other absences 6Cumulative balances of available leave by type per employee are required to be maintained on record Agencies may maintain these cumulative balances on biweekly or pay period T A records which show the available balances for the pay period ending Examples of the types of leave on such T A records include but are not limited to annual sick and family friendly leave Supplementary T A Records Supplementary T A records containing information not previously discussed shall be completed and maintained Examples of such records include those for establishing 1 work schedules 7 2 flexiplace arrangements 8 3 cumulative leave balances available for use by type 4 overtime 5 compensatory time earned and used 6 credit hours earned and used under an alternative work schedule and 7 number of unscheduled duty hours The records must show 1 an employee s pay period schedules indicating planned start and stop work times and hours per day for an established work schedule 2 the aggregate hours or fractions of hours and days the employees worked regular hours worked overtime took leave or used earned compensatory time or credit hours and 3 the supervisor s approval In order for the agency to properly document and calculate an employee s overtime pay entitlements under 5 U S C chapters 55 and 61 and 29 U S C 201 et seq the records must distinguish between regular overtime and irregular or occasional overtime Employees Temporarily Assigned to Another Agency When an employee is on temporary assignment to another agency the agency to which the employee is detailed must record T A data for the employee in accordance with these requirements It must also report the information to the employee s home agency promptly to facilitate disbursement of pay by the home agency Access to T A Information Access to T A information should be limited to those authorized to access the information AUTHORIZING AND APPROVING T A TRANSACTIONS Attestations Verifications and Approvals This section 1 defines attestations verifications and approvals and 2 discusses how attestations verifications and approvals can be achieved in a manual or automated T A system environment Attestation refers to an employee affirming T A data to be true correct and accurate Verification is a confirmation usually by the timekeeper or supervisor that recorded information is true correct and accurate to the best of his her knowledge Approval is the supervisor s other equivalent official s or higher level manager s agreement ratification or concurrence to 1 a planned work schedule and leave of employee or 2 actual T A data Such approvals represent that the actual work schedule recorded by the employee or timekeeper is to the best of 7 Federal agencies can allow employees to vary their daily arrival and departure times and under some options to vary the length of their workday or workweek In all cases fulltime employees are required to work or otherwise account for 80 hours each biweekly pay period 5 U S C 6120 et seq 8 See Office of Personnel Management s OPM Memorandum for Personnel Directors on the subject of Alternative Workplace Arrangements October 21 1993 the approving official s knowledge true correct and accurate and in accordance with applicable laws regulations and legal decisions The approving official acknowledges awareness and understanding of his her responsibility when approving T A data The evidence of attestations verifications and approvals will of necessity differ between manual and automated systems In manual systems attestations verifications and approvals are usually shown by a signature or initial of an individual on a hard copy document In automated systems they are represented by what can be referred to generically as electronic signatures 9 There are many types of electronic signature technologies offering different degrees of confidence control and security In selecting and or developing and implementing a particular electronic signature technology for an automated T A application management must assess the risks associated with the loss misuse or compromise of the electronic T A information and signatures compared to the benefits costs and effort associated with selecting and or developing and managing the automated systems and electronic signatures 10 See the appendix for a further explanation about electronic signatures and GAO s review of such applications Authorizing an Employee s Work Schedule When 1 an employee s work schedule differs from the agencywide schedule established by management or 2 reflects a flexible work program an employee s work schedule should be approved by the supervisor or the official most knowledgeable of the employee s schedule in advance of the period when the plan takes effect If the schedule is not approved in advance the plan should be approved as soon after the start of the pay period as possible Approval must be granted for overtime before the work has been performed when feasible and when not feasible as soon as possible after the work has been performed Care must be taken to distinguish between regular overtime and irregular overtime or occasional overtime or compensatory time in lieu of overtime where allowed in order for the agency to properly document and calculate an employee s overtime pay entitlements under 5 U S C chapters 55 and 61 and 29 U S C 201 et seq Approval of Leave Approval of leave should be made by the employee s supervisor before the leave is taken If leave is not approved in advance it should be reviewed for approval or disapproval as soon as reasonably possible after taken 9 The GPEA defines electronic signature as a method of signing an electronic message that 1 identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the electronic message and 2 indicates such person s approval of the information contained in the message 10 GPEA requires agencies to comply with the guidance issued by OMB regarding automated systems that maintain electronic information as a substitute for paper and use of electronic signatures OMB issued the guidance in Memorandum M0010 dated April 25 2000 A 29page attachment to the memorandum contains the details of the guidance Also as part of the OMB guidance the Department of Justice was charged with developing practical guidance on legal considerations related to agencies use of electronic filing and record keeping The department issued LegalConsiderationsinDesigningandImplementing ElectronicProcesses AGuideforFederalAgenciesin November 2000 Attestation and Verification by Employees and Timekeepers The employee and timekeeper if any are not required to attest or verify T A reports and related documents However if management requires such attestations and or verifications they should be performed as close to the end of the pay period as possible When not possible until after the end of the pay period a copy of the T A report and related documents when applicable should be provided to the employee promptly for attestation and to the timekeeper promptly for verification The employee and or timekeeper should promptly disclose any discrepancies to the supervisor The supervisor should promptly resolve such discrepancies Approval of T A Reports and Related Records All T A reports and related supporting documents e g overtime pay authorizations must be reviewed and approved by an authorized official Review and approval should be made by the official normally the immediate supervisor most knowledgeable of the time worked and absence of the employee involved Approval of T A reports and related documents should be based on personal observation work output timekeeper verification checking data against other independent sources reliance on other controls or a combination of these methods The official most knowledgeable of the time worked should approve any overtime or compensatory time Care should be taken 1 to ensure that the overtime was approved preferably in advance and 2 that the amount and type of overtime regular or irregular credit hours and compensatory time is accurately recorded If practical T A data must be approved at the end of the last day of the pay period or later When this is not feasible because of payroll processing requirements to meet established paydays T A data must be prepared and approved as close to the end of the pay period as possible to still allow processing of the payroll by payday Adjustment or Corrections After the T A Period Ends Adjustments or corrections required because of changes after T A data were approved must be made in the payroll system and reflected in pay for the pay period to which the changes apply when possible When not possible adjustments must be made as soon after discovery as practical Any changes must be approved by an authorizing official before being entered into the payroll system SelfApproval of T A Reports In general employees may not approve their own T A data However the head of an agency or designee may authorize particular individuals to approve their own T A data in certain situations or if the individual is a high level manager such as the head of a large unit within the agency In these situations an official authorized by the agency head or designee must grant advance authority in writing and the agency must ensure that effective controls are in place to ensure the proper reporting of T A data Exceptions to the general prohibition of employees approving their own T A data are intended to apply when it is not feasible to have T A data approved by a supervisor These exceptions include but are not necessarily limited to 1 employees working alone at a remote site for long periods and 2 employees based at the same duty station as their supervisors or timekeepers but frequently at work sites away from the duty station In other situations when it is not practical for the supervisor to approve T A data promptly the employee may be paid and the supervisor may subsequently review and approve the data TRANSMITTING T A INFORMATION TO PAYROLL T A information must be transmitted to the payroll system for all employees or under exceptionbased systems for employees who have changes to their normal work schedules While the choice of methods used to transmit the T A data may be based on costeffectiveness and management information needs the system used to transmit the information must protect T A data from unauthorized change or alteration and must generate a record of any change made Any change to previously attested to and approved data must be reviewed by and attested to by the employee whose data was changed The changed data must also be reviewed by and approved by an authorized official EXCEPTIONBASED SYSTEMS Exceptionbased T A systems as the name implies require pay period recording of arrival and departure times only if material variances11 from preestablished work schedules occur Employees schedules are established either through management designated work schedules or by mutual agreement between employees and management When employees arrival and departure times for a pay period are established these schedules become the basis for recorded T A data unless material variances or deviations occur As previously noted if no material variances occur arrival and departure times and hours worked per day need not be recorded Material variances or deviations must be approved by the supervisor before the change occurs if feasible or promptly after occurring if not feasible As part of their approval of the change supervisors or designees must verify that the dates and amounts of material changes have been recorded in the appropriate T A record However in either case material variance or no variance each employee s T A record must be approved by the supervisor or comparable official Several alternatives exist for recording changes to established schedules Changes can be noted by recording arrival and departure times directly on an employee s time sheet recording arrival and departure times on a centrally maintained timein timeout log used by many employees or noting the number of hours and minutes of the deviation in a record that the supervisor maintains The method selected by management to record the deviations should be the most efficient and effective one under the circumstances Unless otherwise designated by management material variances or deviations from an established schedule for recording purposes are those that differ by 1 hour or more during a planned workday or flex day However if leave is used a deviation of less than 1 hour could be considered material For example if an employee arrives 30 minutes late but works 30 minutes past the planned departure time this would be considered an immaterial variation and need not be recorded On the other hand if the employee chooses to request annual or sick leave rather than to work for the time absent then a material deviation for recording purposes has occurred ALTERNATIVE WORKPLACE ARRANGEMENTS Alternative workplace arrangements12 involve working at locations other than the traditional government office Locations of alternative workplaces are usually the employee s home or telecenters 13 Although numerous benefits exist for both the agency and employees participating in alternative workplaces such as employee moral and lower commuting costs flexible workplace is a management option not an employee benefit Employees who work at alternative work sites should have a written agreement with their supervisors stipulating among other items the period of time the agreement is in effect days in which the employee will work at the alternative site work assignments and performance work schedule and time and attendance As a basis for approving T A data supervisors are required to obtain reasonable assurance that employees working at remote sites are working when scheduled and that T A information accurately reflects time worked and absences from scheduled tours of duty Numerous techniques are available to the supervisor to obtain this assurance For example reviewing the work output of the employee and occasional phone call or visits to the employee 12 Other terms used to refer to alternative workplace arrangements or locations of work are flexible workplace flexiplace and telecommuting 13 Telecenters are facilities away from the traditional government office that are equipped with workstations telephones and computers among other items that are shared by employees of multiple agencies PART II MILITARY SERVICE MEMBERS ACTIVE MILITARY PERSONNEL Active military personnel are considered to be on duty 24 hours a day Because the nature of some military assignments makes a confirmation of the presence at duty stations difficult if not impossible the recording of presence for duty and of specific hours during which duty is performed each day is not required This is similar to exceptionbased T A systems explained earlier in this document Most active duty military personnel follow exceptionbased systems However superiors are expected to be aware of the presence and absence of service members for whom they are responsible When a service member is on temporary assignment to another component of the armed services or to a civilian agency the entity to which the service member is detailed must provide time and attendance recording for the service member and report the information to his or her home component promptly to facilitate payment of basic pay and allowances by or through the home component Absence reports must be maintained daily to indicate those service members who are to be charged leave and those who are not present for duty but who should be Examples of reports that might contain such data are morning or day reports strength reports unit diaries and other similar reports Information on absences which affect pay should be compiled each pay period and be transmitted to the payroll system Without such information the payroll system may mistakenly pay the member for unauthorized pay and allowances The following requirements for review and approval must be met 1 Reports of such information and related supporting documents must be reviewed and approved by a designated authorizing official The official must be aware of the responsibilities he or she is taking regarding the accuracy of the reports 2 Approvals of such reports will be made at the end of the last day of the pay period whenever possible When this is not possible because of payroll processing requirements to meet established paydays documents must be approved as close to the end of the pay period as possible 3 Approval must be done in accordance with guidance found in the subsection Attestations Verifications and Approvals of section Authorizing and Approving T A Transactions of this document 4 Any adjustments required because of changes in reported absences after the reports were approved and transmitted to the payroll system must be made and reflected in the pay period to which the changes apply when possible or when not possible adjusted as soon as possible preferably in the next pay period Any changes must be approved by the authorizing official prior to being entered into the payroll system Service members may not approve their own absence reports unless prior authority to do so is granted in writing by an authorized official When feasible as in an office setting or environment costeffective and applicable attendance reporting and related internal controls set forth in Part I Civilian Employees should be instituted for service members to the extent management deems appropriate MILITARY RESERVISTS T A controls for military reservists depend largely on the nature of the work If they have defined work schedules and are not expected to be available for duty on a roundtheclock basis the T A requirements for civilian employees are operative and should be used If however they are employed similar to those who are on active duty or are actually on active duty then the controls in the subsection Active Military Personnel are operative and should be used APPENDIX I GAO S REVIEW OF ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES APPLICATIONS GAO has been asked by several federal agencies to review electronic signature systems used in financial management systems and to discuss how such systems should be evaluated Because of some of the unique risks associated with highly automated environments traditional data integrity techniques such as password and user identification based systems used to authenticate an individual may not provide the same degree of assurance as that provided by paperbased systems For example in a paperbased system an individual s signature on the paper document is a timetested method of showing that an individual intended to be bound by the terms and conditions in the paper document However in an electronic world where adequate controls have not been implemented the similar approach of having an individual s name appended to a data record does not provide the same assurance because for example the terms and conditions can be changed without obtaining the individual s approval of the changes made When reviewing electronic signature systems we evaluate whether a system generates electronic signatures that represent an individual s or an entity s intent to be bound To do this we determine whether the electronic signature system provides reasonable assurance that the signature produced by the system is 1 unique to the signer 2 under the signer s sole control 3 capable of being verified and 4 linked to the data in such a manner that if the data are changed the signature is invalidated Adopting these criteria facilitates our evaluation of how well the electronic signature system addresses its threats and helps identify vulnerabilities that may be present in the system We have also found these criteria useful since they are technology neutral can be used regardless of the technology used to produce the signature and allow for a variety of implementation methods depending of the degree of risk associated with a given application When deciding on an electronic signature system for T A data agencies should identify and or develop and document the criteria used in the selection of the signature system and how the criteria and the selected system complies with the GPEA definition of an electronic signature In addition the agency s risk assessment process as called for in the OMB guidance14 should disclose the risks considered that would prevent the system from successfully complying with the criteria selected by the agency Without developing the criteria that the system should meet and then effectively assessing the risks agencies could adopt signature systems that will not provide the necessary data integrity 15 922289 14 See footnote 10 A recently issued GAO report InformationSecurity
