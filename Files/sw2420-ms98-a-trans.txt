 views huh political views huh well just any any political event or view or anything well i think Bush done screwed up well uh in what way well as far as like the the people over there he told them to uprising have a uprising you know and overtake Saddam so now that they re listening he s not helping them i don t think he ever told them to to rise up against Saddam Hussein yeah that s what he said when it first started that they should think about what they re doing and and you know what he s doing that they should you know make him understand it it s just like them saying that we should understand what Bush is doing but they don t have no say so in it i guess well unfortunately the the United States as a government can t get involved in a civil war in another country because it s not it it s well that s what Vietnam was was a civil war that s what get you know it s like a double double standard well you know i m i uh the uh the Kurdish in the northern part of Iraq unfortunately when the the uh Mid Eastern countries were when the boundaries were adjusted and changed and all the Kurdish were basically forgotten because there s a group of Kurdish in Northern Iraq there s some in uh Western Iran and there s some in Southern Turkey oh yeah and uh well that s where he bombed before with the Turks that s where he put the chemical weapons before um hum and killed all them people what s uh Saddam did yeah it it s just unfortunate that the Kurdish people didn t get their own uh land or something well their their own government or their own something originally um yeah now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out more or less taken on from each side because they re getting it from like Turkey closed their borders um hum you know so i think they re screwed up there yeah they ve they ve got plenty of problems without the Iraqi problem uh huh and then Iran i don t know if they can go to Iran or not that wasn t the the Iranian borders are still open uh from what i understand understand um David the Iraqis the Kurdish are going into Iran to Iran and into Syria i know that the Saudi the uh that Saudi Arabia has some pretty strict yeah uh now they have yeah they re pretty strict anyway yeah and i doubt that they re letting too many Iraqis in uh huh unless the people have proof that they re leaving that they re not going to stay yeah i don t even think that will help right now because you never know who s on whose side and they re worried about that and they could get over there and change their mind or something you know who knows then the Saudi Arabians will just shoot them yeah now that s something i like about the country there s not a whole lot of crime over there as far as petty crime you know they well they it s a it s all the countries over there are very wealthy yeah and so most of the people are wealthy and and they don t have some most of their basic needs for for food and shelter and clothing are met so they don t have any yeah uh any need that s going to drive them to to petty theft or or to that type of crime i wish it was as good over here as it is over there but if you re the yeah but those uh those countries are so extremely wealthy but from what i understand though that it s private it s the same type of wealth distribution where you have a the very few are very wealthy yeah but since there s so much more to go around that that leaves the the lower classes with more yeah that s better than none at all i guess yeah they don t have no crime so you think that that George Bush s foreign policy is poor because of because of what s happening to the Kurdish people they no i just think i don t know if he should have made that statement other than that you know he s all right you know but i don t know i m not a Bush fan i m not really none of them s fan i just wish something else could be done in this country i don t know what something else done here that would would solve the problems in the Mid East or or no that would solve our own problems i don t know i think the war was good to a point but then it really didn t help us any you know no other than than reestablishing the dominance of the United States in the in the world economy you know yeah that s it that s all that s that the to let the world know that we could do what we say we was going to that s about it another thing that was good if you re looking at the balance of the super powers between the United States and the Soviet Union you know the United States went in and led the battle and and solved the problem and the Soviet Union is is a whimpering is a whimpering country right now because they they ve got so many problems that they can t even now they now they have an internal problem themselves right now and i think that has to do with them having problems with food and and and and prices and all of that stuff yeah yeah a lot of their their civil problems where they ve got their uh Baltic states rising against the the uh the leadership in in the Russian state um hum uh is the same type of deal as what occurred with the Kurdish people it s the same type of situation where they they want their own their where where ethnic groups were split up and and our and don t necessarily have the same uh social structure or value systems as the government yep it s i it s it s kind of fortunate that that the United States was founded in the way that it did because it s such a mixture of people oh goodness yes with with for the most part with the same ideals yeah more or less just whatever it it s really that choice yeah and and that s the biggest that s the bottom line is it s your choice it s not told to you or pushed on you it s whatever choice you want to make you can make it yourself yeah and and when the when the United States was founded the people the people who founded the country all had the same value systems and beliefs and so immigrants coming in understood that and and it wasn t as if it was forced upon them they chose to come to this country yeah it wasn t as if a a new government was established when they were already here um hum so well i think we ve taken up at least five minutes i ve enjoyed talking t o you all righty bye bye bye
