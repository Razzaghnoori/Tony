        all right Cliff what kind of hobbies do you have   too many   too many not enough time for them all huh   i have i uh have photography or i read a lot i also uh work with computers as both hobby and and work   uhhuh      and uh those are the main ones i suppose i also design kites   really   yeah   wow thats interesting interesting well what all do you have to take into consideration when you design a kite   the ones i like are the ones that are simple and cheap   uhhuh   i have one that i made from newspaper that uh you cant get much cheaper than old newspaper but it doesnt have any sticks or anything of that sort   yeah   it flies like a sled in other words     are you uh have you made any money off your hobby   oh no no my hobbies are hobbies   yeah so what do you like to read when you read   i read uh both nonfiction and fiction   uhhuh   most of the name brand authors and so forth   yeah uh does that take up do you uh watch any TV or anything like that or   oh yeah everybody watches TV i suppose but i uh       i uh not married to it lets put it that way if i have a good book i would rather read it than watch TV   yeah well thats good thats cool um   how about yourself   me i uh i play chess i uh lift weights play basketball ride bikes thats my exercise part of my hobbies i guess   yeah   and i read usually the Bible or some other type of Christian literature um lets see   i like to play cards uh dont watch any TV though because we dont have a TV but uh every once in a while ill sneak over to some friends house and well watch a ball game or something uh were just were pretty much new in Texas so were just trying to get into the lifestyle like wed like to go see a rodeo sometime and and we my wife and i went to a one Rangers game and wed like to go a few more times maybe see Nolan pitch one time   should have been out the other night right   yeah exactly that would have been the best were you watching that game   well we got to see the illegal broadcast that channel five had at the end of the game   oh   they were supposed to just show a quick flick and they it turned out that was the last batter that he was pitching to so they just stayed on the uh network and i understand that the producers got themselves in a little trouble theyll probably have to pay a   yeah   compensation of some sort for that   oh thats terrible should showed a little bit of yeah   but we got to see it anyway so they showed a little initiative   showed a little bit oh yeah get your priorities in line see a little bit of history   right where did you uh come to Texas from   from Indiana   from Indiana   yeah my wife and i both went to Purdue and she got a job with Texas Instruments down here so i kind of followed her down here and im looking for employment or schooling or something on those lines   the uh Sherman is far enough away from Dallas to be uh away from most of the the blithe that associate is associated with Dallas   yeah   they uh i work with Texas Instruments also   uhhuh   actually ive been with TI for thirty four years   wow   in research my wife originally came from Des Moines so shes from that turf up there   yeah       the Midwestern Corn Belt   right yeah i was in the Kokomo uh last year uh late on in the year uh out to the Delco plant Delco Electronics out that way   yeah were you just out on loan or something or   they uh well we had we do a lot of uh work with automotives thats lots of T i parts on automotive uh things that dont have the TI bug on them   oh   we make uh anything anything thats uh metal clad for example aluminum bumpers that are metal clad and all sorts we have we make  we make that in Massachusetts the uh a lot of the sensors that go there   yeah   when uh automatic chokes were common in automobiles well we had a hundred percent capture of the American market we made all the automatic chokes for Ford Chrysler Chevrolet   wow   all that so theres a lot of things like that that Texas Instruments makes that even the employees dont know they make  for the most part     no kidding i dont know that so the more a car becomes computerized the more TI becomes involved   yeah we have a lot of electronic stuff there as well but what i described was mainly uh associated with metals and sensors which is mainly what our Attleboro Massachusetts group does   huh so how did you like Kokomo   oh i liked it fine   how long were you there   uh only two days we we were out visiting uh Delco to show them some of the uh computerized map things that we had that sort of thing   yeah well you said something about uh the blithe of Dallas uh do you live in Richardson   yeah well we we havent   so   been contaminated yet shall i say with the blithe but theres some older areas in Dallas and Oak Cliff that are pretty you wouldnt want to be out at night lets put it that way in that area   yeah but that hasnt reached Richardson yet huh   no no thank goodness and its all the way across town its on more on the south side than it is the north side anyway   uhhuh   but i guess all the older cities have that have that problem you say you play cards do you play bridge   oh i had a friend that taught me how to play bridge we we get all these transplanted people here in Sherman not too many i dont know any one thats from Sherman now really uh a guy from New Mexico has been trying to teach us how to play bridge and we liked it we played a game called euchre which is   im familiar with it   you know euchre hey thats cool   yeah right yeah my uh i was in the uh service right after college the Korean war going on   uhhuh   and my wife and i played uh all sorts of card games that we got out of uh book of Hoyle of which euchre was one that we learned   yeah right   pinochle uh flabbergash ever hear that i bet thats one you havent heard of   ive heard of it but ive never played yeah i read read Hoyle too not the whole book but   yeah yeah yeah yeah   looked through some of the games hey euchres a big Indiana game Indiana and Illinois and Ohio   yeah well in Texas of course the Texan game is with dominos playing forty two   with dominos   right its its a bidding game also but not like bridge you only go around one time with dominos   huh   and uh you probably havent even heard of it but im im telling you thats a Texas game   no       okay   thats a very uh very well known old timers Texas game lots of people uh play that   so at least i got the scouting report   yeah in fact that used to be called Baptist bridge because the Baptist dont believe in playing cards so you could but its okay to play dominos so you   so far        forty two is called Baptist bridge   thats funny wow do you do you play cards a lot or   oh no i i like cribbage also thats a good game for two   yeah   and uh   play backgammon or anything like that   uh i havent really gotten serious about it like the resurgence i played it in uh teams but   uhhuh   not until until it came back so to speak i havent played that with the the doubling bet and so forth   i figured a uh a computer man would be into chess   well i uh had no one around me when i was growing up i uh solved chess problems and have several chess problem books you know mate and foremoves and that sort of thing which i enjoy but uh   uhhuh yeah   i didnt have a uh anyone else around me uh when i was growing up that was all that interested in chess i know all the moves and i can follow the game and that sort of thing and enjoy watching   huh   experts play   yeah   i participated one time with a uh grand master we used to have a chess club at Texas Instruments and uh we actually had a grand master in the area who came out and played all of us  simultaneously you know   yeah uhhuh   and he also played us uh blindfold chess one one one on uh one  and uh as the game was going along uh he says uh       mate in six and if you play chess you know six is a long way ahead  and uh we all looked at the board and couldnt figure out how he could possibly mate six and sure enough he mated in six just like he said he would   yeah wow thats scary   but he played us uh on a round robin where he walks around the tables and plays everybody   how long ago was this   oh its been several years ago like uh probably ten years   remember his name   no its too long ago uh i really dont but he was he was something else we had one member whos really uh in the professional class if you will he used to go to the matches all the time     uhhuh   and his lets see ive forgotten lets see the grand master and then right out of thats master whats the one thats just under master   expert   expert yeah he was expert   uhhuh   so uh he gave him a run for his money when he he had to be playing all of us but if he passed you uh twice uh you were out in other words if you hadnt moved when he went around so the more members he beat well the faster he got around and uh so Tony the   yeah
