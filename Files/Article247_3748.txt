 Why the Press Loves John McCain John McCain isn t running in Iowa and he may get clobbered in New Hampshire But he s miles ahead in the very first contest of the 2000 campaign the press primary Journalists go weak in the knees around the guy The few who have attempted to write debunking pieces about him have failed miserably When I set out to spend a few days with McCain last week I promised my editor that I wouldn t join in this collective swoon That proved impossible But perhaps I can redeem myself a bit by examining the phenomenon Why do the hacks love McCain You could start with our admiration for a quality not many of us possess physical courage But I think the deeper admiration is for the guts McCain showed in his Vietnamese captivity and which he s shown consistently ever since Everyone knows by now the story told in McCain s book how he voluntarily suffered five and a half years as a P O W in Vietnam after refusing an early release McCain wasn t just a war hero He was a kind of spirit of resistance personified a man who writes in his book click here for a Ballot Box review that he found freedom in captivity by tormenting his torturers even at the cost of additional abuse McCain is a Faulknerian character in a very different sense than Bill Clinton is And I think that at this point even those of us who think Clinton has been a good president hunger for a successor more deserving of our respect Reporters who have covered McCain in the Senate have seen Republican politics considerably enlivened by this defiant character McCain is barely tolerated by his party s leadership and he hardly conceals his contempt for Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell He has broken with his colleagues over campaign finance reform over legislation to punish cigarette makers and over corporate welfare There s a bit of the strange new respect phenomenon in the way journalists respond to these positions When a conservative politician takes liberal stands he is often described as having grown Yet McCain remains a genuine conservative the farthest to the right of any of the other plausible candidates in the race a category that excludes the born again Bible slinger Steve Forbes Reporters respect McCain less because he takes liberal positions than because of the way he puts his beliefs ahead of his career as a matter of course McCain has been conducting himself in the same delightfully subversive way as a candidate for the GOP nomination There were two guys in the campaign brave enough or clueless enough to oppose ethanol subsidies beforehand Both faced the unappealing prospect of having to run in the Iowa caucus with this millstone around their necks One of those candidates Bill Bradley brazenly changed his position to favor tax breaks for ethanol The other John McCain decided not to run in the Iowa Caucuses rather than change his position even though forgoing the first contest makes his uphill struggle that much steeper Every candidate that I ve observed in a race if winning is the only objective they always end up doing something he told me They compromise in order to experience some real or imagined short term political gain McCain says this not with contempt but with pity for those of his colleagues who cannot resist political temptation Then there s the McCain charm I doubt I ll enjoy any part of this 2000 campaign so much as a couple of days spent as part of a three person press corps traveling with McCain He s funny friendly and far too candid for his own good Most politicians go off the record when they want to state the obvious McCain doesn t go off the record at all at least in my experience He behaves in fact more like a civilian talking about politics than a politician discussing politics He does reverse spin Unprompted he tells me that his big announcement speech the previous day in South Carolina was something of a failure describing himself as tired and his audience as merely polite And there aren t too many other senators let alone presidential candidates who will start a conversation in the van leaving the Reagan Library with the line One of the many reasons I hate the French the reason related to a diplomatic insult to Warren Christopher when he was secretary of state McCain has said other things in recent weeks that would land another candidate in deep doo doo In a recent piece in U S News Roger Simon quoted him referring to his North Vietnamese prison guards as the goddamn gooks Reporters usually either put such indiscretions off the record on McCain s behalf or congratulate him for making them One reason for this is the media s sound instinct not to punish a politician for being exceptionally candid with the media Another is the feeling that McCain has earned the right to say whatever he wants For those who have watched his career his outspokenness on the campaign trail appears as a refusal to be cowed by yet another prison and its silly rules As Bob Dole once said about McCain you spend five and a half years in a box you get to say whatever you want He also responds to the press Unlike the inaccessible George W Bush you can get to McCain easily and have a frank intelligent discussion with him about just about any topic I ve developed a minor obsession with how the various Republican education plans don t make sense even on their own terms McCain s flawed plan like Bush s even more flawed plan wouldn t give vouchers a fair test because it doesn t fund the voucher at anywhere near the cost of most private schools And if a voucher won t pay for private school it won t create any pressure on public schools to improve I made this point to McCain on a flight from Grand Rapids Mich to the Reagan Library in California His initial response was that while 2 000 the amount in his plan wouldn t cover tuition at Sidwell Friends or Andover it would pay for many Catholic parochial schools I m unembarrassed to tell you that one of my happiest days of recent years was when my daughter was accepted in Catholic school he said I know she ll get a quality education She ll wear a uniform and she ll be away from those little bastards that are trying to get their hands on her McCain then called across the aisle of the plane to his wife Cindy honey good morning How much is our tuition for Meghan at Xavier Meghan 14 is the McCains oldest daughter 6 100 Mrs McCain answered Not including books or uniforms McCain seemed surprised at how high it was And the next thing I knew he was running with my criticism trashing his own proposal It s one thing to say we ll give everybody a choice he said Well if they can t get in then we d better either provide incentives for schools to come into being where they can afford it or figure out a way to give them enough of a voucher where they can You could say that McCain is to be faulted for not working out a better education proposal in the first place But in a way being able to profit from valid criticism is more important than being a master of policy detail The Clinton health care plan is a case in point This points to a final press friendly quality of McCain s brilliant flattery It s fairly unusual in my experience for a politician to accept a reporter s opinion that one of his major proposals is seriously flawed It s also gratifying to the reporter Bill Clinton is a master of buttering up journalists by quoting their books and articles back to them But with Clinton the effort at seduction is transparent You know he really hates the press and is forcing himself to try to win them over When McCain flatters you it doesn t feel automatic or calculated He truly likes us journalists It s his fellow senators he can t stand
