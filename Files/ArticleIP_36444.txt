plans to cover its tracks before a proposed U N human rights investigation The intelligence is believed to detail conversations between senior Indonesian Army TNI figures in Bali West Timor and possibly Jakarta about silencing senior and middle ranking militiamen who may be persuaded to assist the UN with inquiries the paper said The intelligence shows that they will go to great lengths any length to cover their tracks ahead of such inquiries a source told the Age The information is on the lines that if any militia guys show signs of splitting from the TNI program or show signs of talking to UN investigators then the militia members will be taken out liquidated There are suggestions that deaths have already occurred there in West Timor The Sydney Morning Herald led Monday with

reputation sink lower and lower into the depths of ignominy The Straits Times ran an editorial Monday condemning the Republicans in the U S Senate for opposing ratification of the global nuclear test

editorial Monday about the surge of the extreme right in the recent Austrian general election It warned that the rise of J rg Haider leader of the Freedom Party is no less alarming because he may not

forms of extremism the paper said Noting that he blames whole classes of people for his country s ills it commented Singling out groups because of nationality is no less racist than doing so because of skin color or religion Though it is often treated as a milder form of racism there is no firewall of principle separating one form of racism from another Haider is now the most successful xenophobe
