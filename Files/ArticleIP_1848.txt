 Sen John Glenn Washington being Washington and politics being politics the announcement of Sen John Glenn s return to space was the occasion for much sneering Republicans mocked the space trip as Clinton s payoff for Glenn s hackwork during the campaign fund raising hearings He can go into orbit and stay there snapped a Republican congressional staffer NASA skeptics added Glenn s scientific mission to the long list of Remember when NASA gave shuttle rides to congressional paymasters Sen Jake Garn and Rep Bill Nelson But if it s easy to be cynical about Glenn s trip it s nearly impossible to be cynical about the man himself Glenn confounds Washington The armor has no chink His life proves that in politics virtue can triumph over expediency Glenn hasn t sacrificed principle for ambition That s his blessing and his curse Glenn is as much a careerist as any pol As Tom Wolfe chronicled in The Right Stuff Glenn positioned himself carefully to be America s first astronaut Selected for the Mercury program in 1959 Glenn paraded his Marine pilot heroism 149 missions in World War II and Korea his loving marriage his religious faith As it happened all were genuine Alan Shepard beat Glenn to space But Glenn the first American to orbit Earth became the Mercury superstar anyway His eloquence his calm in the face of danger his small town Ohio decency his boyish freckles they canonized him Four million New Yorkers attended his welcome home parade He was the Cold War s greatest hero He was so revered that when Robert Kennedy was assassinated Ethel Kennedy asked Glenn to break the news to her children And the man is the equal of his image He is honest hard working faithful religious patriotic a devoted father and a loving husband When he entered politics Glenn vowed that he would never mortgage his reputation for political gain This pact was more selfless than it sounds It ensured that America would never be disillusioned about its hero Thanks to Glenn s high mindedness he s had a peculiar worthy and forgettable political career Elected to the Senate in 1974 he has devoted himself to important numbing issues He s the Senate s technocrat He likes reading General Accounting Office reports He is by his own admission dull Glenn helped draft U S nuclear nonproliferation policy He revels in the nitty gritty of arms treaties He is an expert in the science and policy of nuclear waste storage He pioneered the idea of reinventing government Long before Al Gore Glenn was pushing to cut waste and rationalize government procurement He has been in short an admirable public servant a solid stolid senator But Glenn was supposed to be more He was to be the Democratic Eisenhower He and Ike share freckles a shiny skull war heroism But Glenn never commanded troops He does not know how to lead Glenn s vision of the Senate is Platonic a committee of the wise elevated above conflict and partisanship that does what is right for the nation But bargain and compromise are the fuel of politics Glenn is a bad horse trader He makes his own decisions on principle and thinks his colleagues should do the same He doesn t do pork barrel He delivers goodies to Ohio only when Ohio deserves them He s never risen to the top ranks of the Senate because he s never been able to behave like a normal senator Glenn s scruples as well as his dullness also doomed his quest for the presidency His 1984 campaign is a model of how to blow an election Glenn entered the Democratic race with enormous advantages He had 100 percent national name recognition and a stellar reputation The movie of The Right Stuff which lionized Glenn opened just before primary season He was a centrist in a field of liberals But he tanked it He was a terrible fund raiser largely because he didn t suck up to donors More importantly he failed to inspire voters Glenn can t master the glib sound bite rhetoric that characterizes politics He believes that speeches should explain facts as much as excite emotion Glenn notoriously is a politician who gets more applause when he s introduced than when he leaves In 1984 he was soporific on the stump boring crowds with endless details of energy policy and SALT negotiations After polling neck and neck with Walter Mondale Glenn finished sixth in the Iowa caucuses well behind Undecided He also managed to lose every state in the Super Tuesday primary before quitting the race Any 20 year political career has its scars and Glenn s is no exception But here too he may deserve the benefit of the doubt He still carries a 3 million debt from his presidential campaign His reluctance to fund raise partly explains the nonpayment of debt A normal politician would have invited corporate allies to a few fund raisers cleared the debt and reciprocated with a few favors Glenn is allergic to such politicking He has also taken too much abuse for his membership in the Keating Five He accepted more than 200 000 in campaign contributions from S L crook Charles Keating and arranged a meeting for Keating with then House Speaker Jim Wright The Senate Ethics Committee found Glenn guilty of poor judgment But Glenn seems to have been oblivious rather than sleazy He was simply helping a constituent It probably never occurred to him that he was doing anything wrong He was genuinely shocked that people saw venality in his behavior says John Green a political science professor at the University of Akron Last Feb 20 on the 35 th anniversary of his space shot Glenn announced that he wouldn t seek re election in 1998 The 76 year old is increasingly out of place in the Senate which is a more unfriendly place than when he entered it He s awkward in opposition There is too much sniping for him and not enough legislating Glenn s performance in the campaign fund raising hearings last fall highlighted his unhappiness with his job It was the low moment of his career He stonewalled and disrupted the Republicans at every turn contending that the investigation was ignoring GOP wrongdoing He did his party duty obediently but his own partisanship made him uncomfortable He seems to know that he doesn t belong in the increasingly nasty uncollegial Senate But he does belong on the shuttle Yes the ostensible reason for the mission aging research is dubious And NASA s budgetary whoring is unseemly And the appeal to public sentiment is shameless So what Glenn has spent 36 years protecting the five hours of his life he spent in space 36 years living up to an impossibly heroic image He has done it admirably His first trip into space was work Doesn t he deserve a vacation there
