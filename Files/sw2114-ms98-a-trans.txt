 well uh she said uh one was a total ban on gun control and ten was uh no control at all where do you fit in there yeah well i think you d probably have to put me at the at the ten area ten or nine oh is that right well we re probably not too far apart i d probably fall in there at a seven or eight yeah i uh i just you know it s it s you know weapons weapons obviously do not kill it s the people that operate them and well i pretty much agree with that that s uh with with two hundred years of uncontrolled gun control in this country i mean it was founded on that it was one of the things that founded this country i can t imagine trying to to do that and if you pass laws you re gonna make a lot of um hum criminals criminals because people wouldn t register them i i i live in California and and we just had a a registration a law registration for automatic guns and uh uh huh they know that there are tens of thousands of them out in this state and less than about i think fifteen hundred people registered them is that right in the whole state yeah yeah in the whole state golly well the so what is happened now is that those people that did not register them are um they re now criminals themselves yeah that s that s the crazy thing about it you re you re putting they re now criminals they re they re putting more laws and more restrictions and more burden on the honest citizen the one who doesn t give them a problem anyway you know and it s it s crazy they re just putting more giving more paper work problems to the honest citizen and and you know because uh a person whose gonna use a gun for a crime he s he s not too concerned with the crime of not registering his gun no no no that s absolutely you know it s like it s i i i i don t really quite understand the idea that people think that i mean i i m all for registration in the sense that uh a a a lawful person can go down and get a gun and and maybe you shouldn t be given one the day that you go down they should be able to do a check i think possibly and yeah i i would agree with that that you know well you know that s that s why i say i kind of fall into a seven or eight range there you know i i don t have a problem with registration yeah yeah but uh you know when it comes to restrictions and and yeah and and just plain can t have guns yeah yeah it it is crazy because like you say this country was founded uh and obviously had a uh had a big interest in in letting them their citizens arm themselves and which uh you know which maybe does cause some problems that maybe other countries with more restrictive laws don t have but it s one of the prices that you have to pay for for freedom i think oh absolutely not only that but i think there s also a hidden a hidden wealth in in in the citizen having firearms and that hidden wealth is is that i would really i would really feel sorry for anybody for a country that that tried to physically invade this country yeah yeah mean because you know it s it s a country where everybody has a gun and they re gonna have some trouble i mean you know in the mom and pop little towns and stuff they re gonna run into people with guns uh huh yeah oh yeah yeah they re and and that that is sort of a hidden security factor i think for this nation you know i mean oh yeah everybody who lives out in the country or or around around my area everybody who lives out in the country has a gun sure at least one yeah you know and it s not for uh not for protection or hunting or or anything just you know for all those reasons just you know nobody thinks anything about having a gun it s no big deal it s that s the way they just brought up well uh where re you from by the way but but yeah i am in uh Trenton Texas did you yeah did you say you were in California Texas yeah i m in California right now i m i m originally from North Carolina though i well i well i didn t know this program reached out that far hey it s reaching all over all right well that s that s a neat deal well listen you think they ve earned their money we ve earned our money tonight oh i bet we have we gave them a few minutes worth all right well listen you take care of yourself all right all right you too good night then bye bye good night all right
