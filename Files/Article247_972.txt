 Hospital Sushi Andrew So given your commitment to lots of medical care am I right to assume that you oppose cuts in the British health care budget Maybe if the system wasn t so cheap your dentist would have sprung for some Novocaine I wasn t defending small health care expenditures I m all in favor of everyone getting everything they need I was making a point about health and health care as related to other social values For instance awful as your childhood dental experience was at least you had a dentist In this country lots of people can t afford any kind of dental care it mostly isn t covered by Medicaid and are just out of luck What s the situation with people who are HIV positive and don t have private health insurance that pays for the drug regimen I think I remember a news story which said they were getting too expensive for Medicaid And the 40 million people who have neither private insurance nor Medicaid what happens to them Talk to you soon Katha PS I love Japanese food Better a thousand nights of sushi than a single meal of baked beans on toast Your portrait of Japan is funny but if they were really as timid and mingy as you suggest they wouldn t be so healthy and long lived Unlike the British who I think are not so healthy in general We re always reading about Japan s weird side the businessmen reading sado porn comics on the morning train and schoolgirls moonlighting as prostitutes people eating potentially fatal blowfish just for kicks And of course the incredible level of sexism conformity pollution hideous modern buildings and so on I ll bet their newspapers carry the same sort of stories about us
