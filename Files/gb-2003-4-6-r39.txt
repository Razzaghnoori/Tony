 Background Nematodes are the most abundant and speciose metazoans and account for up to 80 of the kingdom s members 1 Not surprisingly nematodes have evolved to occupy diverse ecological niches Like the well studied Caenorhabditis elegans most are free living and graze on microbes or detritus and as such have no obvious direct impact on humans Others however are adapted as parasites and are responsible for such widespread problems as human disease debilitation of livestock and crop damage Plant parasitic forms are responsible for an estimated 100 billion in annual crop damage worldwide 2 The most damaging family the Heteroderidae includes the root knot Meloidogyne spp and the cyst Globodera and Heterodera spp nematodes Root knot nematodes penetrate plant hosts and migrate between the cells in roots where they induce formation of large multinucleate cells called giant cells Galls form around the giant cells and the roots become distorted often leading to compromised root function and retardation of plant growth 3 It is not clear which genetic differences between the plant parasitic and non parasitic forms may be responsible for conferring parasitic ability On the basis of phylogenetic analysis 4 it appears that plant parasitism arose independently at least three times over the course of nematode evolution Consequently one cannot be assured that any gene or set of genes that aid in the parasitic lifestyle in one nematode species will also exist in another Conceptually several mechanisms affecting evolution to parasitism can be envisioned These include adaptation of pre existing genes to encode new functions changes in genes regulating metabolic or developmental pathways gene duplication gene loss and acquisition of genes from other species horizontal gene transfer HGT HGT has become a widely accepted mechanism of rapid evolution and diversification in prokaryotic populations 5 6 7 Recent genome analyses of primitive eukaryotes such as the sea squirt Ciona intestinalis 8 and single celled parasitic diplomonads 9 implicate HGT events in early eukaryotic evolution In contrast the extent of horizontal transfer involving higher eukaryotes has been controversial with many cases of hypothesized horizontally transferred genes 10 11 12 13 14 having been refuted by later studies 15 16 On the basis of biochemical and immunological criteria genes have been identified in Globodera rostochiensis and Heterodera glycines that allow these nematodes to endogenously produce enzymes that can degrade cellulose and pectin the two major components of plant cell walls A possible ancient bacterial origin of these genes has been theorized 17 18 19 A bacterial origin for a number of root knot nematode RKN genes also has been proposed although their possible role in parasitism is less clear Some such as a gene encoding chorismate mutase 20 were likewise identified on the basis of biochemical properties whereas others including a polygalacturonase gene 21 were identified from expressed sequence tag EST datasets the latter from our data 22 using a keyword search Veronico et al 23 isolated a presumed polyglutamate synthetase gene with bacterial homology by sequencing neighboring regions of the M artiellia chitin synthetase locus We wished to determine whether other RKN genes might have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer particularly as such genes might potentially be related to parasitism Claims of HGT have frequently pivoted on incongruencies between a particular gene tree and the assumed underlying species tree Acquisition of new sequence data has often revealed that genes believed to be absent in a species were merely missing in the database rather than missing from the genome 16 Obviously because full genomes are not available for all plant and animal species we are not able to make definitive statements about the presence or absence of a particular gene in every organism However with the completed C elegans genome available as a reference model nematode it is now possible to examine the emerging genetic resources for Meloidogyne comprehensively to begin to address the question of evolution of parasitism and in particular a possible role for HGT A similarity to a bacterial protein sequence is the simplest criterion for considering a nematode protein and thus the gene that encodes it as a possible HGT candidate For that candidate truly to define an HGT event its presence must be incongruent with nematode phylogeny Figure 1 Nevertheless the presence of a gene in one nematode species such as Meloidogyne but its absence in another such as C elegans might merely reflect a gene loss in the latter lineage In addition to C elegans several other invertebrate genomes have been completely sequenced and at the time of this study the best characterized of those was Drosophila melanogaster Consequently we chose this resource as a tool to identify genes which may be present in nematodes but which are absent in C elegans A bacteria like gene present in Meloidogyne and Drosophila but absent in C elegans is unlikely to have experienced HGT but may rather reflect a gene loss in the C elegans lineage We therefore developed a phylogenetic filter based on these relationships to rapidly reveal Meloidogyne HGT candidates identified by sequence similarity to bacterial proteins The intent of this filter is to efficiently eliminate spurious HGT candidates Surprisingly the relationship between the invertebrate phyla Nematoda and Arthropoda which includes Drosophila is controversial The traditional view is that arthropods are more closely related to annelids than to nematodes but some recent molecular phylogenies place nematodes and arthropods together in a high level taxon named Ecdysozoa which does not include annelids 24 25 Other molecular studies give conflicting results 26 27 Regardless of the evolutionary relationship between Nematoda and Arthropoda C elegans and Drosophila remain useful and valid models for our analyses and the relationships shown in Figure 1are consistent with both hypotheses Genes that were transferred from bacteria to nematodes would pass through our phylogenetic filter if the transfer event occurred subsequent to the divergence of the C elegans and Meloidogyne lineages Figure 1 Should a gene appear to be present in other closely related plant parasites such as the cyst nematodes the transfer event probably affected a common ancestor of the two families of parasitic nematodes event a in Figure 1 Alternatively the transfer event may be more recent such as to the progenitor of the Meloidogyne lineage since its divergence from the cyst nematodes event b in Figure 1 or in a lineage leading to a single Meloidogyne species event c Although bacteria like Meloidogyne genes that are not present in C elegans and Drosophila comprise a preliminary pool of candidates multiple gene loss may be responsible for the presence absence pattern revealed by the filter To test this more thoroughly we established a screen to compare the now small pool of preliminary candidates with all other sequences in the public databases The most parsimonious explanation to be drawn from candidates with no significant matches to any metazoan genes is that they arose by horizontal gene transfer from a non metazoan pool as opposed to multiple independent gene losses in the metazoan lineages Candidates thus identified were subsequently validated through phylogenetic analysis of relationships between the most similar matches from our screening processes We describe here a comprehensive two step search for HGT candidates in M incognita M javanica and M hapla using EST data 22 28 29 Genome to genome comparisons were made to discover patterns of presence and absence that would indicate horizontally acquired genes Second kingdom wide comparisons further reduced the candidate pool these genes were then examined from an evolutionary standpoint Twelve Meloidogyne candidates were discovered and their potential role in plant pathogenicity is discussed Results and discussion Genome to genome comparisons act as a phylogenetic filter in candidate searching Given the large number of sequences to examine and the expectation that most were not horizontally acquired we developed a phylogenetic filter based on genome to genome sequence comparisons Further because the available data included raw ESTs from the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI GenBank dbEST as well as clustered ESTs from the Parasitic Nematode Sequencing Project 22 28 29 for which the data can be presumed to be significantly more reliable we wished to compare the efficiency of reducing each dataset with this filter Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI dbEST M incognita M javanica and M hapla sequences named NMi NMj and NMh respectively were translated in six frames and individually compared to conceptual six phase translations of the C elegans and Drosophila genomes as well as all available bacterial sequences This first filter which makes no assumptions about gene annotation in the target genomes and which employed the relatively error prone raw ESTs reduced the pool of HGT candidates by eliminating more than 99 of the original ESTs for all three species tested Table 1 Using clustered ESTs M incognita and M javanica sequences named WMi and WMj as queries to the worm fly and bacterial protein databases which are based on gene annotation produced a similar degree of reduction Table 1 Importantly genes previously predicted to be the result of HGT events were identified by and passed through the phylogenetic filter see below The main objective of the phylogenetic filter was to reduce the computational load necessary to screen HGT candidates against all metazoan proteins A second filter consisting of a BLAST analysis against the GenBank nonredundant nr protein database served to eliminate genes that may have been independently lost in the C elegans and Drosophila lineages but are still representative of a more ancient animal gene Table 1 This filter eliminated four candidates from the WMi data set Examination of these showed a putative copper homeostatis protein and a protein of unknown function both with significant matches to Homo sapiens e values of 1 10e 23and 4 20e 18respectively one aldehyde dehydrogenase with a significant match to Mus musculus 2 70e 26 and one asparaginyl tRNA synthetase Three of the four had best matches to bacteria Table 2 Interestingly manual inspection revealed that all four sequences did have significant matches to C elegans but passed through our initial phylogenetic filter because the bacterial matches were stronger than those for C elegans or Drosophila The 12 final candidates in WMi had no significant match to C elegans or Drosophila in the preliminary screen The best eukaryotic matches to these candidates from the BLAST search against nr are shown in Table 3 The second filter generated similar enrichment in WMj reducing the number of candidates from eleven to seven The fact that more candidates from the raw datasets were eliminated during second round filtering for example from 99 to 27 in NMi reflects the redundancy in the datasets If multiple EST sequences representing a single gene pass through the first filter each of those EST sequences will be in the preliminary candidate pool The second filter is likely to simultaneously remove more than one of these homologous sequences if it removes any at all Therefore searching with raw EST sequences is likely to result in a larger absolute decrease in the candidate number than will searching with clustered EST sequences The number of final candidates listed in Table 1are candidate HGT genes after clustering A smaller number of candidates was discovered from the raw EST datasets compared with the clustered sequences which suggests that our method of HGT candidate searching is partially dependent on sequence quality The lower number of final candidates obtained using raw EST data is principally due to filtering of areas of low complexity and tandem repeats and uncertainty of similarity matching for shorter sequences during BLAST searches Similarly the size of the dataset influences the number of final candidates obtained Thus the absence of candidates in M hapla is likely to be due to a combination of the small number of unique ESTs analyzed because of redundancy in the data and possibly overall quality of the raw ESTs rather than to a lack of laterally acquired genes in the genome Despite the lowered efficiency of candidate discovery when using the lower quality raw EST sequences this tool was able to recover five candidates from the NMi dataset compared to the 12 candidates identified from the higher quality clustered sequences in the WMi dataset The fact that candidates were discovered across disparate sequence quality conditions not only provides additional validation of our methods but also suggests a high degree of flexibility and robustness in the tool Identification of previously hypothesized HGT candidates The literature reports seven genes postulated to have been horizontally acquired by M incognita M hapla or M javanica during evolution of plant parasitic nematodes 17 18 19 20 21 our search algorithm revealed six of these genes The notable exception is Mj CM which is postulated to encode chorismate mutase in M javanica 20 To examine why this gene was not identified by our filtering process we used both Mj CM sequences found in GenBank AF095949 AF095950 in a series of BLASTX queries No significant matches were found in the Drosophila C elegans or bacterial databases nor in the Meloidogyne datasets used in this study Recent BLAST searches at nematode net 30 against all Meloidogyne ESTs including sequences not available when our analyses were first conducted confirm that the chorismate mutase gene is absent from WMi and WMj although a single significant match to an M arenaria chorismate mutase EST was revealed Another RKN gene also postulated to have been acquired by HGT and which encodes polyglutamate synthetase was previously identified in M artiellia 23 Significantly hybridization data showed that this particular gene is absent from both the M javanica and G rostochiensis genomes 23 We speculate that acquisition of this gene by M artiellia is a recent HGT event event c Figure 1 and thus it is truly absent from the Meloidogyne genomes from which our datasets were derived In other words failure to discover this gene was not a failure of our screening process but is likely to be a correct reflection of the biology The most extensively studied HGT candidates are four genes encoding 1 4 endoglucanase initially identified in the cyst nematodes G rostochiensis and H glycines 18 19 These four genes NemaGene Contig IDs MI00537 MI01011 MI01381 and MI01842 30 appear to define two sets of paralogs formed before divergence of the cyst and root knot nematodes As noted 18 19 1 4 endoglucanases presumably equip these nematodes with the ability to endogenously degrade the most abundant component of cell walls namely cellulose Similarly the second most abundant component of cell walls pectin is the assumed target of nematode encoded pectate lyase and exo polygalacturonase both functions also postulated to have been acquired by HGT The pectate lyase gene MI00592 was identified in G rostochiensis and H glycines 17 and the exo polygalacturonase MI00252 was identified in our M incognita data 21 22 Because of the obvious role of nematode genes that allow endogenous production of cell wall degrading enzymes in attacking a plant host it has been hypothesized that their acquisition by HGT may have been key steps in the evolution of plant parasitic nematodes from ancestral free living forms 3 In that model an intermediate symbiotic association of a soil dwelling but free living nematode with a soil bacterium possessing these enzymes is postulated before the HGT event It was suggested 3 that acquisition of these new functions either by symbiosis or HGT permitted previously free living nematodes to expand their range into a new ecological niche the plant as a prelude to speciation into parasitic forms Also revealed by our tool were six new HGT candidates including homologs for glutamine synthetase L threonine aldolase and nodL and three to which function could not be unequivocally ascribed Rhizobial origin of Meloidogynegenes Of the six newly identified HGT candidates four have highest similarity to genes in the nitrogen fixing soil bacteria that nodulate plant roots and which are collectively termed rhizobia Meloidogyne and rhizobia are sympatric that is they share an ecological niche in the soil 3 and arguably in the plant too 31 satisfying the minimal requirement for an HGT to occur namely physical proximity Interestingly models of bacterial evolution suggest HGT as a mechanism of adaptation into either symbiosis or parasitism 32 This is specifically thought to be the case for divergent species of rhizobia such as the symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti and the pathogen Rhizobium radiobacter formerly known as Agrobacterium tumefaciens where differential selection and gene maintenance is likely to be responsible for different lifestyle strategies 33 Two of the Meloidogyne genes revealed by our filters which encode an L threonine aldolase gene MI01644 and a deduced protein of unknown function MI00109 exhibit striking amino acid identity to rhizobial proteins 48 and 51 respectively but a complete absence of meaningful homology with any eukaryotic sequence Table 3 Consequently these genes are strong candidates for having entered nematodes via HGT presumably from a rhizobial ancestor The deduced product of a third M incognita gene MI00426 has striking sequence similarity to glutamine synthetase GS Glutamine synthetases fall into two structurally and functionally distinct classes GSI which to date appears restricted to prokaryotes 34 is involved in ammonium assimilation as part of the nitrogen fixation pathway in rhizobia 35 The ability to be reversibly adenylylated at Tyr397 of the active site is a characteristic of GSI The second class GSII is found in all eukaryotes and a small number of prokaryotes and appears to be involved in purine synthesis 35 Unlike GSI GSII is not adenylylated and lacks the conserved tyrosine On the basis of both amino acid sequence similarity Table 3 and a Pfam 36 HMM search e value 4 3e 24 it is clear that the RKN glutamine synthetase is a GSI homolog implying a prokaryotic origin Strikingly the nematode protein has greatest similarity 56 amino acid identity to GSI from the rhizobial bacterium Mesorhizobium loti including conservation of Tyr397 The best match to a eukaryotic glutamine synthetase GSII is substantially lower Table 3 strongly implicating the RKN gene as a robust candidate for an HGT event The fourth rhizobial like HGT candidate MI01045 identified by our filter has 58 amino acid identity 8 8e 54 to NodL from Rhizobium leguminosarum Table 3 This protein encodes an N acetyltransferase previously thought to be present only in rhizobia 37 where it functions in the biosynthesis of Nod factor Nod factors are a rhizobial species specific family of lipo chito oligosaccharides which function in signal exchange between the bacterium and its symbiotic partner plant 38 The first visible signs of nodule formation root hair deformation as part of the symbiotic pathway are triggered by Nod factors 39 and although the specific mechanisms of Nod factor function remain unknown it is clear that it has a central role in initiation of cell division and possibly also nodule differentiation in the root 40 For most rhizobia the product of nodD acts as a transcriptional activator and induces expression of a set of nod genes Experimental evidence 39 shows that lack of either nodABC or nodD in rhizobia results in a Nod phenotype that is a strain unable to initiate nodule formation on the host plant By contrast R radiobacter which forms a parasitic relationship with plants by producing a crown gall rather than nodules lacks these genes and appears to possess only nodL nodX and nodN suggesting these three nod genes are sufficient to affect root growth and are involved in a parasitic lifestyle rather than being specific to symbiosis 33 To examine further the relationship between putative nodL candidates found in M incognita and M javanica with the cognate genes in rhizobia we undertook a phylogenetic analysis and found that the two nematode genes fall squarely within the rhizobial nodL clade Figure 2 This analysis further grouped other sequences with significant similarity to the deduced Meloidogyne NodL protein Not surprisingly these enzymes clustered according to specific enzymatic function of the different classes of acetyltransferase Significantly the solitary significant match of the Meloidogyne NodL sequences to a eukaryote is to a yeast serine acetyltransferase an enzyme clearly separated from the RKN by function as well as in our phylogeny Figure 2 Bayesian analysis of the amino acid alignment confirms this grouping The posterior probability of the two Meloidogyne sequences being most closely related to the one other eukaryotic sequence from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is estimated to be 0 Instead a group consisting of the two Meloidogyne sequences along with the Sinorhizobium meliloti and Rhizobium leguminosarum sequences is estimated to have a posterior probability of 1 0 For the clade consisting solely of the four rhizobial and the two Meloidogyne sequences the posterior probability is estimated to be about 0 657 and almost all of the remaining posterior probability is accounted for by adding the Streptomyces coelicolor sequence to this clade of rhizobial and Meloidogyne sequences Using polymerase chain reaction PCR primers designed from the Meloidogyne sequence we have attempted to amplify nodL from a range of nematode species For each of the Meloidogyne species tested including M hapla we have been able to confirm the presence of the gene However similar experiments do not yield amplification products from the cyst nematodes we tested Although other interpretations can be made these results are consistent with nodL being acquired by an event b HGT see Figure 1 Meloidogyne nodLtruly is a nematode gene A question that arises in analyzing eukaryotic sequences with strong matches to bacterial proteins especially when the match is unique is whether the gene in question truly was isolated from a eukaryote or whether it represents a prokaryotic contaminant any nucleic acid matches of ESTs to prokaryotes which probably would be contaminants were removed before database submission 28 Claims of nematode genes having been acquired by HGT 17 18 19 23 have addressed this issue in a number of ways To provide experimental evidence that the Meloidogyne nodL sequences represent nematode loci we cloned and sequenced a full length transcript from M incognita Mi NodL Identification of the SL1 trans splice leader at the 5 end of the message 41 and a poly A tail at the 3 end confirmed that this is a bona fide nematode gene Figure 3 Analysis of genomic Mi NodL sequences revealed an intron Figure 3 further reinforcing the notion that this gene is integrated within the M incognita genome In cases of a recent HGT it has been suggested that the nucleotide composition of the transferred gene might reflect that of the donor species rather than the recipient species 42 To establish a baseline nucleotide composition of M incognita transcripts we calculated the average G C content for our entire M incognita WMi sequence dataset obtaining a value of 34 3 By contrast the average G C content of rhizobial species ranges from 57 to 65 43 Consistent with the average for M incognita the G C content of Mi NodL is 36 This value is strikingly different for the nodL genes in Rhizobium leguminosarum 57 G C and Mesorhizobium loti 68 G C We similarly examined the G C content of all 12 HGT candidates and found the values to be consistently representative of Meloidogyne Another way to consider nucleotide composition is through codon usage In particular we considered how similar the Meloidogyne codon usage is to that of a typical rhizobial protein by using the codon adaptation index CAI 44 From an R leguminosarum codon usage table we calculated the CAI for those amino acids precisely conserved between Mi NodL and the rhizobial NodL protein to be 0 621 and 0 703 respectively To evaluate the null hypothesis that the expected codon usage between the two nodL genes is identical the difference in CAI values was adopted as a test statistic The observed value of this test statistic was 0 082 and its null distribution was approximated by simulating 10 000 datasets as described in Materials and methods Because the absolute value of the test statistic calculated from the simulated datasets exceeded 0 082 only 62 of 10 000 times we reject the null hypothesis of identical expected codon usage in the M incognita and R leguminosarum nodL genes and conclude that codon usage in these genes is significantly different between the species Collectively comparison of the nematode and rhizobial nodL genes suggests that each is adapted for function in the organism in which it resides and despite the high degree of similarity between the amino acid sequences of these genes the DNA sequences are strikingly different From the Lawrence and Ochman model 42 in which differences in G C and codon bias are diagnostic for HGT events it might be argued that our findings on the base composition of bacterial and nematode sequences are inconsistent with HGT However analyses in which synteny and phylogenetic information were also considered suggest that codon bias and G C content are poor indicators of HGT 45 A role for amelioration whereby structural characteristics of the foreign gene are eventually homogenized to resemble those of the recipient species has been assumed but the rate was postulated to be the same as the rate of random forward mutation 42 In addition to alterations in codon usage as reflected in G C content for a bacterial gene to function efficiently in a nematode presumably requires acquisition of regulatory elements including a promoter and structural elements including a poly A tail and optionally a trans spliced leader Other elements such as introns might also be acquired It is possible that a careful phylogenetic analysis comparing rates of evolution of Meloidogyne genes acquired by HGT with those present in the more ancient nematode lineage might shed light on the rate of amelioration of gene structure following inter kingdom HGT Patterns of HGT from rhizobia In the absence of an assembled genome sequence for Meloidogyne it is not yet possible to examine conserved genome wide gene order of HGT candidates between nematodes and the hypothesized bacterial donor Nevertheless because the origin of many of the nematode HGT candidates appeared to be rhizobial we wished to investigate the organization of the bacterial homologs Unlike many prokaryotes in which the genome resides largely on a single circular chromosome with varying numbers of small episomes rhizobial genomes are typically organized in a manner conceptually more like eukaryotes Sinorhizobium meliloti for example has three large single copy plasmids 43 and the primary Mesorhizobium loti chromosome is linear Rhizobia have the ability to transfer genes horizontally to other bacteria and M loti carries a symbiosis island which spans approximately 9 of its genome and has been shown to have a role in rhizobial evolution via HGT 46 This symbiosis island contains certain genes involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation functions but none of these is a homolog of the nematode HGT candidates we have identified However four of these genes do map to the same M loti linear chromosome Figure 4 including nodL and the glutamine synthetase gene both of which are involved in nodulation nitrogen fixation in rhizobia Together with the L threonine aldolase homolog candidate these three genes are found within 257 kb of each other a distance that represents only 3 65 of the M loti chromosome which is less than half the size of the symbiosis island The fourth candidate of unknown function lies approximately 149 kb from the opposite side of the symbiosis island from the other three Figure 4 Interestingly examination of the colinearity and gene arrangements between S meliloti R radiobacter and M loti indicates that the location of the genes in M loti probably represents a more primitive state 33 and is therefore more likely to reflect the proximity of these genes in rhizobial ancestral species Although it cannot be known if these genes were acquired in a single transfer event between a rhizobial ancestor and an ancestor to Meloidogyne remnants of the HGT event other than the already identified genes may remain and candidates are currently being mapped into the M incognita genome to examine possible synteny with M loti BLAST analysis of the genes in the intervening span of chromosome indicates only three significant matches to the M incognita WMi data set all with significant matches to C elegans that is they are not HGT candidates Conclusions We have demonstrated that a high throughput bioinformatics approach based on EST sequences is an efficient and effective way to identify possible HGT candidates in plant parasitic nematodes Previous reports of horizontally acquired genes have been based mainly on biochemical or immunological criteria Using an informatics approach we rediscovered previously identified candidates thus validating our method and were able to identify new candidates for HGT Strikingly a common theme underpinning the HGT candidates is their apparent direct relationship to the parasitic lifestyle of Meloidogyne 3 Also striking was our finding that phylogenetically rhizobia appear to be the predominant group of donor bacteria This is significant for two reasons First root knot nematodes and rhizobia occupy similar niches in the soil and in roots and thus the opportunity for HGT may be omnipresent Second both organisms establish intimate developmental interactions with host plants and mounting evidence suggests that the mechanisms for these interactions are also shared 31 It seems a reasonable hypothesis that the origin of parasitism in Meloidogyne may have been facilitated by acquisition of genetic material from soil bacteria through horizontal transfer Indeed such events may have represented key steps in speciation of plant parasitic nematodes Materials and methods Available data Sequences were obtained from the Parasitic Nematode Sequencing Project PNSP 30 including clustered Meloidogyne ESTs built with the NemaGene approach 28 We analyzed 1 799 M incognita WMi sequences and 3 119 M javanica WMj sequences from these PNSP clusters Additional raw sequences were extracted from the July 31 2002 NCBI GenBank dbEST build with the Entrez Search and Retrieval System Table 1 47 Meloidogyne incognita and M javanica datasets from NCBI NMi and NMj respectively contain the individual ESTs generated by the PNSP and from which the clusters for the WMi and WMj datasets were generated In addition the NMi and NMj datasets included some sequences from sources other than the PNSP M hapla sequences NMh were also retrieved from NCBI Entrez was used to extract all available nuclear sequences for D melanogaster C elegans and bacterial sequences from the GenBank non redundant nr database May 1 2002 build Candidate search algorithm Analyses of the WMi and WMj data were performed via a local installation of WU BLAST 2 0 48 Each sequence in WMi and WMj was extracted into individual FASTA format files using Perl scripts and submitted for three six phase translated WU BLASTX searches once each against the C elegans Drosophila and bacterial protein databases WU BLASTX parameters were E 10 W 3 T 12 E values were extracted for the best match for each query sequence in each of the three searches Meloidogyne sequences from NCBI were analyzed using the Tera BLAST Hardware Accelerated BLAST algorithm TimeLogic Crystal Bay NV Single FASTA files were submitted for three six phase translated Tera TBLASTX queries against six phase translated C elegans and Drosophila genomic databases Tera TBLASTX parameters were Open Penalty 8 Extend Penalty 2 Word Size 4 Query Increment 3 and Neighborhood Threshold 18 Perl scripts were employed to parse the query name and associated best e value from each of the nine analyses three each for NMi NMj and NMh As a first round of phylogenetic filtering automated comparison of e values for each sequence allowed us to eliminate sequences with a best match to either C elegans or Drosophila from further analysis The remaining sequences those with a best match to bacteria of order 1 0e 10or better provided a preliminary pool of candidates for each dataset A BLASTX search was carried out for each candidate against the nr database using the above parameters The results from this second filter were examined and any sequence with a significant match to a metazoan other than a closely related plant parasitic nematode was removed from further analysis An e value of 1 0e 10was the threshold used to declare a match The remaining sequences provided our final set of candidates for horizontally transferred genes Tables 1 3 Codon usage analysis The protein alignment of the M incognita and R leguminosarum nodL sequences was trimmed such that only identical amino acids remained and the sequences back translated retaining the correct codon usage Ten thousand pairs of simulated sequences were generated by independently permuting the homologous codon pairs in the actual data In other words the probability that the i th codon in the first simulated sequence was assigned the i th codon from the actual M incognita sequence and the i th codon in the second simulated sequence was assigned the i th codon from the actual R leguminosarum sequence was set to 0 5 and the probability that the i th codon assignments in the simulated sequences were reversed was also set to 0 5 Codon adaptation indices were computed for each simulated sequence using the EMBOSS suite of sequence analysis tools 49 Phylogenetic analysis of candidates For each candidate the protein sequences for the top 15 matches with an e value of 1 0e 10or less were extracted from the BLASTX search against the nr database If there were not 15 matches with an e value meeting this criterion all sequences with e values lower than 1 0e 10were selected Alignments of these sequences with the translated candidate sequence were constructed with CLUSTALX 50 improvements to the CLUSTALX alignments were performed manually Sequences from the same species with more than 95 identity after alignment were considered possible paralogs and deemed redundant information for this analysis Only one sequence from each of these sets was used in further analysis Poorly aligned sequences were also discarded Distances between aligned proteins were estimated with the Dayhoff amino acid replacement model 51 Tree topologies were then inferred from these distances via neighbor joining 52 and 1 000 non parametric bootstrap replicates were used to estimate clade support 53 Maximum likelihood analysis produced topologies consistent with the neighbor joining analysis All phylogenetic reconstructions were performed with the PHYLIP and PAML software packages 54 55 Additional analyses of the putative nodL gene were conducted with Version 3 0b4 of the MrBayes software 56 For these analyses the Jones Taylor Thornton model of amino acid replacement 57 was adopted and variation of replacement rates among sites was incorporated by a discretized gamma distribution with four rate categories 58 Each Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis used four heated chains and employed a burn in period of 10 000 cycles followed by 990 000 additional cycles Convergence of the Markov chain was diagnosed by performing two different runs from different initial parameter states Prior distributions for all parameters were the default distributions
