American music styles In musical terms La Onda Chicana was created by the Texas orquesta which synthesized the elements from different music styles such as ranchera and big band swing to create a blend of music that characterized Chicano music of the 1960s and 1970s La Onda Chicana also reflected a cultural and political sentiment an ethnic pride in being Chicano and working class and it also embodied a recognition of being American and accepting American popular culture The lyrics of the songs may be in English or in Spanish and sometimes both languages are used in the same song Although the conjuntos of norte o music and the orquestas of Texas were all accepted as Mexicano and Chicano the music of La Onda Chicana was purely Chicano music One band that typified this sound was Little

parts of Texas at least El Paso where on Christmas Day children go from house to house asking for treats much like on Halloween This custom was sometimes just called Oremos literally we pray Children would knock on the doors of their neighbors and chant Oremos Oremos Angelitos somos D el cielo venimos A pedir Oremos Si no nos dan Puertas y ventanas quebrar mos We pray we pray Little angels we are From heaven we come To ask we pray If we don t receive Doors and windows we will break The chant states that they re angels from heaven and are asking for gifts although if they receive none they may break doors and windows The origin of this custom is not known but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve but in Canutillo Texas around the 1920s it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day although they didn t recite the above chant The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candies Lottie C Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona saying that on Christmas Day most of them came to town all dressed in party clothes and went from house to house calling Christmas Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery 29 Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos and the chant she records is similar to the one above except that the last line is A pedir Aguinaldos y Oremos Aguinaldos are gifts given during the Christmas season See also Aguinaldos
