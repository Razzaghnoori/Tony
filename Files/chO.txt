OremosAngelitos somosDel cielo venimosA pedir OremosSi no nos danPuertas y ventanas quebrarmosWe pray we prayLittle angels we areFrom heaven we comeTo ask we prayIf we dont receiveDoors and windows we will breakThe chant states that theyre angels from heaven and are asking for gifts although if they receive none they may break doors and windows The origin of this custom is not known but some believe it is to remind society that the stranger at the door should not be forgotten Lorin Brown reports that in northern New Mexico the children went out on Christmas Eve but in Canutillo Texas around the s it was the custom for children to go door to door on Christmas Day although they didnt recite the above chant The neighbors expected them and were ready with gifts of fruits and candiesLottie C Devine makes reference to the Papago Indians in Arizona saying that on Christmas Day most of them came to town all dressed in party clothes and went from house to house calling Christmas Everyone gave them candies and apples and many of them in turn gave baskets or pottery  Cabeza de Baca refers to this custom as aguinaldos and the chant she records is similar to the one
