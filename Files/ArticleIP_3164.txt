 Jesuitical vs Talmudic An exchange occurred not long ago in California s Sacramento Superior and Municipal Courts As a lawyer attempted to excuse his client s behavior with a convoluted explanation Judge James Ford interrupted acidly with the comment That s just that s just too Jesuitical for words The colloquy continued as follows Lawyer Pardon me Judge It s too Jesuitical You probably didn t go to a Jesuit school Lawyer Certainly didn t I am of the Jewish faith Judge Then it s too Talmudic for words One can almost hear the appreciative chuckles from the spectators gallery at this bit of repartee the overreactive tension dispelling response that very mild witticisms tend to produce in solemn venues And yet someone should have risen to say Objection It is common to regard Jesuitical and Talmudic as synonymous but this does an injustice to both words Talmudic originally signified nothing more than of or pertaining to the Talmud Oxford English Dictionary the Talmud being the postbiblical Rabbinic code of Jewish laws and interpretations that is the source of authority in Orthodox Judaism Jesuitical originally signified of or pertaining to the Jesuits belonging to the Society of Jesus Jesuit OED again the Jesuits being the Roman Catholic clerical order founded by Ignatius Loyola in 1534 as an intellectual bulwark against the Reformation Whatever else may be said about them both Talmudic and Jesuitical carry connotations of great learning and meticulous attention to argument Where they diverge is in motivation Very early owing in part to English Protestant propagandists the word Jesuitical came to characterize a form of argument designed less to seek the truth than to make a case a form of argument that was aggressive and clever but perhaps not always sincere indeed one that was at times cunningly equivocal or downright deceitful Aside from pure anti Jesuit animus this nuance probably arose from the work of some 17th century Jesuit theologians who imperfectly employed a method known as casuistry in resolving questions of moral theology an approach that gave the broadest possible leeway to individual behavior This form of justification which became known as laxism may explain why Jesuit priests were the confessors of choice among Europe s Catholic aristocracy To characterize a lie as an economy of truth would be a Jesuitical formulation To say that one had smoked marijuana but did not inhale would be a Jesuitical distinction Bill Clinton received his undergraduate degree from Georgetown University a Jesuit school William Safire argues that Jesuitical has by now developed a sense devoid of any overtones of prevarication subtle intricate moralistic reasoning informed by a rigorous logic is his definition I am not as sanguine as Safire and believe that using the word will always carry some slight risk It may be wielded as a slur and received as a compliment or vice versa Talmudic carries none of this baggage The Talmud with its commentaries on the Torah and its commentaries on the commentaries the process goes on and on cannot be faulted for using guile to arrive at a congenial truth But the word has its own negative connotations Talmudic scholarship is famous for the tortuous and painstaking manner in which truth is pursued and established if it can be established at all It is assumed by Talmudic scholars that the language of the Talmud is precise and that each word is therefore of surpassing significance As a result even infinitesimal details are treated with the utmost seriousness Also while Talmudic scholarship is sometimes aimed at practical affairs for instance civil and criminal law dietary laws the status of women it also considers issues that have no practical application at all and sometimes delves into matters that may seem utterly fanciful In his book The Essential Talmud rabbi and scholar Adin Steinsaltz recounts a famous absurdist parody A rabbi asked his disciple why the letter peh p
