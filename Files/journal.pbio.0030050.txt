                            As a species we pride ourselves on the uniqueness of our brain Relative to our body        size the human brain is bigger than that of any other animal It may also contain unique        structures and patterns of organisation that presumably underlie our intelligence and        ability to manipulate our environment But how did our unique brain originate and under        what selective pressures did it evolve Some of the answers may lie in the genetic        differences that researchers are now uncovering between us and our closest relatives                    What Is So Different about the Human Brain        When we compare our brain to those of other animals the first thing that strikes us is        its size Human brains weigh on average  grams a squirrel brain weighs six grams        Some of this difference is because as larger animals we need more brain to run our        bodies However the brains of our nearest relatives the great apes weigh only         grams even though their body size is similar to ours Figure  Humans sit on the top of        the pile when it comes to relative brain size notes geneticist Bruce Lahn University of        Chicago Illinois United States see Box         Throughout mammalian and primate evolution there has been a gradual increase in brain        size superimposed with spikes of fast growth such as the tripling in human brain size        that occurred about  million years ago  million years after the human lineage diverged        from that of the great apes Even in the ape lineage the brain has been expanding but        along the human lineage it has really taken off says Lahn        In addition over time different parts of our brain have increased in size at different        rates The cerebral cortex has expanded more than other areas and within the cortex some        areas have expanded differentially while others have lagged behind                  Humans sit on the top of the pile when it comes to relative brain size                Paleoanthropologist Ralph Holloway Columbia University New York United States uses        endocasts to look for macroscopic differences in the brains of our human ancestors We        fill human fossil skulls with vulcanised rubber and once it has set we pull it out of the        large hole at the base of the skull and the rubber snaps back into the shape of the skull        Holloway explains Endocasts are particularly useful for comparing brain sizes but they        also provide information on when the asymmetries that are present in our brain first        appeared These often reflect cerebral specialisation and Holloway believes that some of        the asymmetries he sees in human fossil skulls may indicate when our ancestors acquired        language        More details about how the shape of our brain differs from that of our closest living        relatives are emerging from the work of neuroscientist Karl Zilles Institute of Medicine        Research Center Jlich Germany He prepares magnetic resonance images of monkey ape and        human brains and then uses a nonlinear elastic algorithm to transform one brain into        another Figure  We know what forces we have to apply to the images to do this he        explains which tells us which areas of the brain have changed most during primate        evolution Zilles and his colleagues also are currently using molecular imaging techniques        to update the existing maps of the different areas within our brains Until we have this        information it is hard to make meaningful comparisons between our brain and that of        chimpanzees Already Zilles has discovered that there is much more interindividual        variation in human brain organisation than anyone suspected This means says Zilles that        a general statement like the neocortex is bigger in human brains than in ape brains        actually tells us very little It gives us the general direction that evolution has taken        but not whether an ape brain is different because of its sensory motor or association        areas        Scientists are also using other techniques to investigate more subtle changes in the        organisation of the human brain compared to the brains of other mammals and primates        Indeed says Holloway the reorganisation of the brain during evolution has been at least        important as its increase in size Neurobiologist John Allman California Institute of        Technology Pasadena California United States and his collaborators for instance have        discovered that a special type of large spindleshaped neuron first described in the early        th century by Constantin von Economo is unique to apes and humans and much more numerous        in the latter These neurons are found in brain areas that are implicated in decision        making in uncertain situations so Allman speculates they may help humans to interact        rapidly in complex social situations                    Costs and Benefits        A bigger more complex brain may have advantages over a small brain in terms of        computing power but brain expansion has costs For one thing a big brain is a metabolic        drain on our bodies Indeed some people argue that because the brain is one of the most        metabolically expensive tissues in our body our brains could only have expanded in        response to an improved diet Another cost that goes along with a big brain is the need to        reorganise its wiring As brain size increases several problems are created explains        systems neurobiologist Jon Kaas Vanderbilt University Nashville Tennessee United        States The most serious is the increased time it takes to get information from one place        to another One solution is to make the axons of the neurons bigger but this increases        brain size again and the problem escalates Another solution is to do things locally only        connect those parts of the brain that have to be connected and avoid the need for        communication between hemispheres by making different sides of the brain do different        things A big brain can also be made more efficient by organising it into more        subdivisions rather like splitting a company into departments says Kaas Overall he        concludes because a bigger brain         per se would not work brain reorganisation and size increase probably        occurred in parallel during human brain evolution The end result is that the human brain        is not just a scaledup version of a mammal brain or even of an ape brain        For natural selection to work the costs of brain evolution must be outweighed by the        advantages gained in terms of fitness For many years explains ecological psychologist        Robin Dunbar University of Liverpool United Kingdom people thought that the ability to        hunt or forage better was what drove the evolution of our brains But a better diet had to        come before we could grow a bigger brain Dunbar believes instead that brain evolution in        primates and more generally in mammals has been driven by the need to manage social        relationships and in primates in particular to coordinate coherence in social groups        through time and space More complex social interactions he says mean that individuals        are better able to pool resources to solve problems like finding food and so they survive        better        This theory says Dunbar is supported by a correlation between social group size and        neocortex size across primates and modern humans Furthermore during primate brain        evolution the trend has been to add more material to the front than the back of the brain        The front of the brain is where information from the rest of the brain is interpreted and        the capacity to interpret information underlies social interactions says Dunbar The        number of problemsolving cognitive tasks you can do may well depend on how much frontal        lobe volume you have and how it is organised Just think of how few moves you can run a        chess game into the future with a s personal computer compared to a st century        mainframe machine he suggests                  The human brain is not just a scaledup version of a mammal brain or even of an ape          brain                            The Genetics of Human Brain Evolution        Selective pressures like those considered by Dunbar and before him by scientists like        Holloway work on the raw material of random gene mutations and molecular biologists now        have some clues to the gene changes that may underlie brain evolution Take brain size for        example Figure  Research groups including those led by Lahn neurologist Christopher        Walsh Harvard Medical School Boston Massachusetts United States and clinical        geneticist Geoffrey Woods University of Leeds United Kingdom wondered whether the genes        that cause microcephaly an inherited human disorder in which brain size is greatly        reduced might include genes involved in human brain evolution In  mutations in the        genes         ASPM abnormal spindlelike microcephaly associated and         microcephalin were identified as two causes of microcephaly Three groups        have since reported that both these genes have been under selective pressure during primate        evolution         ASPM encodes a protein involved in spindle formation so it is tempting        to think that changes in its sequence might result in an increased rate of cell division        and hence brain size But cautions Walsh we really have no idea yet how or even if         ASPM is involved in brain evolution        Both Lahn and Walsh believe that         ASPM and         microcephalin may be only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to genes        that have helped to shape our brains For example Walsh has recently reported that        deletion of a gene called         Nde produces mice with very small brains Our experiments indicate that        the loss of         Nde causes neurons to mature prematurely This stops them dividing so        the mice end up with small brains explains Walsh who is now investigating whether human         NDE variants have been positively selected during human evolution        Lahn is also searching for additional candidate genes that might help to explain how our        brains evolved In a recent         Cell paper Lahn and his colleagues identify several hundred genes that        are involved in nervous system biology and show that as a group there are significantly        higher rates of protein evolution in these genes in primates than in rodents Protein        evolution rates are particularly high in the lineage leading from ancestral primates to        humans notes Lahn so some of these genes may regulate brain size and behaviour        However he warns as with         ASPM and         microcephalin  definitive proof for this will only come from functional        studies which are difficult to do                    Enter Glutamate Dehydrogenase        For one gene evidence for an effect on brain function may be emerging Geneticist        Henrik Kaessmann University of Lausanne Switzerland studies the origin of new genes in        primates in particular genes that arise when a DNA copy of an mRNA transcribed from an        existing gene is integrated back into the genome Usually this new retrocopy is not        expressed but if the DNA inserts near an active promoter it can become a transcribable        retrogene This is the origin of         GLUD  a retrogene derived from         GLUD  which encodes glutamate dehydrogenase         GLUD  which first appeared  million years ago in hominoids        probably immediately picked up a brainspecific promoter and then over the next few million        years acquired two critical amino acid changes explains Kaessmann These allow         GLUD encoded glutamate dehydrogenase to work better in the brain than        the         GLUD encoded enzyme Because glutamate dehydrogenase recycles the        neurotransmitter glutamate the presence of         GLUD may permit a higher neurotransmitter turnover and greater neuronal        activity in hominoid brains than is possible in monkey brains which lack         GLUD  suggests Kaessmann                    Gene Expression        Kaessmann plans to search his extensive database of retrocopies in the human genome for        other functional genes that could like         GLUD  be implicated in brain evolution By contrast evolutionary        neurobiologist Todd Preuss Yerkes Primate Research Center Emory University Atlanta        Georgia United States hopes to identify genes involved in human brain evolution by        comparing gene expression patterns in different primates Preuss who began training as a        paleoanthropologist before turning to neuroscience has been comparing postmortem human        and chimpanzee brains since the mid s believing that if we want to understand human        brain evolution we really have to compare humans with chimpanzees our nearest relatives        even though chimp brains have been evolving separately from ours for  million years        But warns Preuss we have to do these studies now There are few chimps left and if we        lose the opportunity to study them and their brains we will lose forever a fundamental        source of insight into our own species        To begin with Preuss used staining techniques that exploit antibodies to examine the        neural components of chimpanzee and human brains Then in  he was asked to collaborate        in a microarray project My antibody approach was very labour intensive so I jumped at the        opportunity to screen  genes at once he says        Preuss and his collaborators now know that more than  genes are differentially        expressed in chimpanzee and human brains Importantly when we go back into tissue with        probes for these gene products in some cases there are remarkably different spatial        patterns of expression in humans chimps and macaques notes Preuss We dont know yet        what these differences mean in terms of functional organisation in these different brains        but our results open up new and exciting vistas particularly since many of the        differentially expressed genes have not previously been considered as being potentially        involved in brain evolution The microarray data produced by Preuss and other researchers        also indicate that many of the gene expression changes that have occurred during brain        evolution involve gene upregulation For example there is increased expression of genes        involved in metabolism synaptic organisation and synaptic function All told it seems        that the human brain may be more dynamic than ape or monkey brains says Preuss The        human brain seems to be running hot in all sorts of ways                    Scratching at the Surface        As far as understanding how our brains evolved more questions remain than have been        answered One problem is that we dont really know enough about how our brains differ from        those of other mammals and primates although work by Zilles and others is helping here We        also know very little about how the areas of our brain are physically linked up and we        need to understand that before we can see how we differ from our nearest relatives And as        far as identifying the gene changes that were selected during evolution although we have        several candidates we dont know how or if these gene variants affect our cognitive        abilities It is one thing concludes Dunbar to identify genetic or anatomic differences        between human and ape brains but quite another to know what they mean in terms of actual        cognitive processes
