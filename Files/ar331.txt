 Introduction IL 1 is a proinflammataory cytokine that has myriad effects on cells increasing proliferation activating inflammatory responses and inducing matrix remodeling through the production of neutral proteases Since most cells can both express and respond to IL 1 complex signaling programs are likely required to modulate the timing and magnitude of responses to this cytokine 1 It is well documented that elevated expression of IL 1 in the joint results in the activation of inflammatory and degradative programs in synovial cells contributing to the progression of rheumatoid arthritis 2 Recent work by Hasty and coworkers 3 has demonstrated that local expression of IL 1 by articular chondrocytes activates autocrine gene expression which contributes to the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis OA Furthermore IL 1 receptor antagonists are effective inhibitors of inflammation and connective tissue destruction in animal models of arthritis 2 4 5 Together these studies implicate IL 1 as a central mediator of pathogenesis in arthritis Activation of this pathologic process is complex most likely involving the activation or repression of numerous signal transduction pathways with subsequent effects on many genes Our previous work has focused on the pathways by which IL 1 induces several members of the family of matrix metalloproteinases MMPs enzymes that are active at neutral pH and that collectively degrade the various components of the extracellular matrix Specifically we have focused on MMP 1 and MMP 13 interstitial collagenases that have the unique ability to initiate cleavage of the triple helix comprising the stromal collagens types I II and III Elevated expression of MMP 1 and MMP 13 by stromal cells and chondrocytes in response to IL 1 contributes to the pathogenesis of connective tissue disorders 6 7 8 9 10 11 Studies from this laboratory and others showed that IL 1 activates MMP 1 and MMP 13 gene expression through common signaling pathways 11 12 13 14 15 Specifically nuclear translocation of NF B and mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK stimulation of activator protein 1 AP 1 are required for transcription of cytokine induced MMP 1 and MMP 13 Furthermore cycloheximide blocks mRNA expression of both collagenases 11 16 indicating that expression of immediate early genes is required for MMP 1 and MMP 13 gene expression Thus IL 1 activation of collagenase gene expression requires the increased expression of a panel of essential transcription factors and signaling intermediates as well as the initiation of signaling cascades that activate these factors IL 1 also contributes to the pathogenesis of arthritis by increasing the proliferation of mesenchymal cells and by enhancing the expression of other inflammatory mediators 17 18 19 This complex alteration in cellular phenotype probably involves the coordinated increase and decrease of genes for cytokines and growth factors adhesion molecules and signaling intermediates The recent availability of microarray technology has made it possible to perform an extensive analysis of IL 1 modulation of genes in cells that are central players in arthritic disease We therefore carried out a microarray analysis of IL 1 stimulated chondrocytic cells in order to identify immediate early genes that could contribute to phenotypic changes relevant to OA In these studies we used the human chondrosarcoma cell line SW1353 for three important reasons First we and others have found that when treated with IL 1 SW1353 cells serve as an appropriate model for primary chondrocytes in OA 11 20 21 22 Second the amount of total RNA required for microarray analysis precludes the use of primary human chondrocytes for these studies Third the inherent genetic variation in primary human chondrocyte cultures could bias the gene expression profile and lead to erroneous conclusions We found increased expression of a large cohort of transcription factors cytokines growth factors and signaling intermediate genes that are potential regulators of metalloproteinase gene expression proliferation and sustained inflammation Alternatively this was accompanied by a decrease in a modest number of genes also belonging to these categories suggesting that IL 1 substantially reprograms gene expression in chondrocytes A subset of these IL 1 stimulated genes was then confirmed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT PCR This characterization of IL 1 induced immediate early genes in chondrocytic cells identifies candidate mediators of the expression of colla genase genes in arthritis Materials and methods Cell culture SW1353 chondrosarcoma cells were grown to confluence in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium supplemented with 10 fetal bovine serum Hyclone Logan UT USA penicillin streptomycin and L glutamine Cellgro Mediatech Herndon VA USA At the beginning of each experiment cells were washed three times with Hank s buffered sterile saline Cellgro to remove traces of serum and were placed in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium containing 0 2 lactalbumin hydrolysate Gibco BRL Rockville MD USA Then cells were either left unstimu lated or treated with 10 ng ml recombinant IL 1 Promega Madison WI USA This concentration of IL 1 was found to be optimal for activation of MMP 13 gene expression in these cells data not shown Harvest and microarray analysis of mRNA For microarray analysis two confluent 150 mm plates of SW1353 cells were cultured in lactalbumin hydrolysate or lactalbumin hydrolysate plus 10 ng ml IL 1 for 2 hours Cells were then washed with Hank s buffered sterile saline solution and homogenized in 2 ml Triazol Reagent Gibco BRL and RNA was purified in accordance with the manufacturer s instructions The RNA pellets were stored in 70 ethanol and shipped on dry ice to Clontech Laboratories Palo Alto CA USA via express courier Clontech analyzed the RNA using their Atlas Human Cancer 1 2 K array 1176 unique genes and AtlasImage 1 0 software We chose this data baseline because it represents a large number of genes that may be expressed during development and again during disease pathology We further classified genes that increased or decreased by twofold or more and sorted them using Microsoft Excel Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction A subset of genes whose expression was increased by IL 1 was then confirmed using a radioactive RT PCR assay Briefly RNA was treated with DNAse I and then 2 g was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligodT primers One tenth of the reverse transcriptase reaction was amplified using gene specific primers Platinum Taq DNA polymerase and 33PdATP Single band products were resolved on native acrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography Table 1shows the gene specific primers that were used Results and discussion Table 2shows the results of an analysis using Clontech s Human Cancer 1 2 K Array and total RNA from SW1353 cells treated with IL 1 10 ng ml for 2 hours This analysis revealed substantial increases or decreases in the expression of several known IL 1 responsive genes These include transcription factors panel A cytokines growth factors and their receptors panel B proteases matrix proteins and adhesion molecules panel C as well as signaling intermediates and tumor suppressors panel D We focused on genes for transcription factors because they have been reported as IL 1 responsive immediate early genes in chondrocytes 23 Members of the NF B AP 1 and ets families of transcription factors substantially increased in the Human Cancer 1 2 K array see Table 2 panel A To confirm the effect of IL 1 on AP 1 family members we assayed Jun family members by RT PCR Fig 1 We found that the c Jun and JunB genes increased transiently within 1 hour of IL 1 treatment before the induction of the MMP 13 gene The expression profiles for c Jun and JunB were similar to the profile for egr 1 another immediate early gene in IL 1 stimulated chondrocytes 23 In contrast the JunD gene was constitutively expressed and IL 1 increased this expression modestly These data show that in IL 1 stimulated chondrocytes all three Jun family members are expressed and can contribute to MMP gene expression Furthermore RT PCR analysis of the JunB gene Fig 1 validated the gene expression profile derived from the Human Cancer 1 2 K array Table 2 panel A Transcription factor genes that were modulated by IL 1 included members from the NF B family relB p100 p52 p105 p50 I B c rel and p65 the AP 1 family fra 1 and junB and the ETS family ets 1 While it is well established that NF B proteins translocate to the nucleus upon IL 1 stimulation 24 we were surprised to find so many family members expressed simultaneously This suggests that in IL 1 stimulated chondrocytes NF B family members may compete for dimerization partners and for binding sites in responsive genes Members of the AP 1 family of transcription factors are essential transcriptional activators for both the MMP 1 and MMP 13 genes 25 26 27 and these transcription factors are activated by extracellular stimuli through MAPK pathways 28 JunB was identified as an IL 1 inducible gene in chondrocytes by the Human Cancer 1 2 K array Table 1 and this finding was confirmed by RT PCR Fig 1 Levels of JunB mRNA peaked within 1 hour of IL 1 stimulation and began to decline after 2 hours This was somewhat surprising since MAPK pathways do not activate JunB 29 and in some systems JunB antagonizes transcriptional activation by c Jun 30 Since c Jun JunB and JunD are all expressed in IL 1 treated SW1353 chondrocytic cells it is not clear which family member is responsible for transcriptional activation of collagenase genes Perhaps the functional transcriptional complex is determined by induced expression and activation of AP 1 accessory proteins such as the Fos family member Fra 1 or the ets family member ets 1 31 This cohort of AP 1 Fos and ets family members may also preferentially bind to different AP 1 sites in MMP promoters with subtle effects on gene expression 32 egr 1 is an IL 1 inducible immediate early gene in chondrocytes 23 and has been implicated in the elevated MMP 1 gene expression observed in rheumatoid synoviocytes 33 34 Surprisingly egr 1 expression was increased only 1 3 fold in this Human Cancer 1 2 K array data not shown However when this gene was analyzed by RT PCR we found a robust increase in egr 1 mRNA within 1 hour of IL 1 stimulation which declined significantly by 2 hours Fig 1 Thus the relatively short half life of egr 1 mRNA resulted in an underestimation of IL 1 induction of this gene in the microarray It is therefore probable that an array using RNA from cells treated for 1 hour with IL 1 would identify additional important genes IL 1 repressed three transcription factor genes including HOX 4A the retinoblastoma like protein 2 and mothers against dpp homologue 4 SMAD4 SMAD4 contributes to transforming growth factor TGF dependent transcription of the alpha 2 I collagen COL1A2 35 and aggrecan 36 genes Furthermore our microarray data demonstrated that IL 1 inhibited Col2A1 expression by 1 6 fold in SW1353 cells data not shown It has been reported that IL 1 inhibition of Col2A1 gene expression requires the p38 MAPK pathway 37 Perhaps inhibition of SMAD4 synthesis is another component of IL 1 dependent Col2A1 gene repression While IL 1 promotes cartilage degradation through MMP synthesis and inhibits matrix deposition by reducing Col2A1 gene expression TGF has the opposite effect on chondrocytes 3 Thus it is tempting to speculate that IL 1 antagonizes the effects of TGF by blocking expression of essential signaling intermediates such as SMAD4 Cytokines and growth factors and their receptors were a major group of IL 1 modulated genes in chondrocytes Table 2 panel B For instance leukemia inhibitor factor precursor LIF was substantially induced by IL 1 in SW1353 cells and this is consistent with previous reports of LIF as an IL 1 responsive gene in chondrocytes 38 39 Recently LIF was reported to induce MMP 13 gene expression 40 and this may contribute to the role of this cytokine in arthritis pathology 38 IL 6 expression was increased in IL 1 treated cells and while this may affect a variety of cellular functions in chondrocytes this cytokine does not seem to be required for IL 1 induced suppression of proteoglycan synthesis in cartilage 41 Interestingly there was a concurrent increase in expression of platelet derived growth factor PDGF subunits and a decrease in PDGF receptor subunits Perhaps this is a mechanism of ensuring paracrine but not autocrine effects of PDGF in cytokine stimulated chondrocytes The role of growth factors in IL 1 dependent effects is not clear cut since IL 1 can both induce and inhibit proliferation of chondrocytes 17 However in the present model of SW1353 cells under serum free conditions we did not observe a mitogenic effect of IL 1 data not shown Bone morphogenetic protein 4 BMP4 is a member of the TGF superfamily of proteins and is required for chondrocyte differentiation and cartilage maintenance 42 43 The observed suppression of its expression in chondrocytes by IL 1 Table 2 panel B is consistent with a previous report in osteoblastic cells 44 and suggests that IL 1 may enhance cartilage degradation by blocking an essential autocrine signal for chondrocyte maturation and function IL 1 induction of several MMP family members is seen including collagenase 3 MMP 13 matrilysin MMP 7 and metalloelastase MMP 12 Table 2 panel C The collagenase 1 MMP 1 gene was not significantly induced in this array and this is consistent with our previous findings that MMP 1 is expressed at lower levels than MMP 13 in SW1353 cells 11 Furthermore the magnitude of increase observed for these MMP genes was modest despite the fact that MMP genes are strongly induced in response to IL 1 However the most likely explanation for the low level of induction seen here is the fact that MMPs are not early response genes Rather they are the downstream targets of the signal transduction pathways and transcription factors that do represent early responses Indeed RT PCR confirmed that MMP 13 mRNA continues to increase 4 hours after IL 1 treatment Fig 1 This is consistent with our previously published finding that steady state MMP 13 mRNA levels peak 12 hours after IL 1 treatment of chondrocytes 11 Tenascin an adhesion molecule that is expressed during cartilage development 45 was induced by IL 1 in SW1353 cells Table 2 panel C Interestingly the tenascin gene has been reported to be IL 1 inducible in synovial cells and chondrocytes and its expression is enhanced in rheumatoid arthritis and OA 46 47 A possible physiologic consequence of IL 1 induced tenascin expression is that it may promote chondrocyte migration towards the sites of lesions in OA 47 IL 1 coordinately reduced expression of integrin a1 a cell adhesion molecule that chondrocytes use to bind to type II collagen 48 Thus IL 1 treatment may modify adhesion molecule expression so that matrix adhesion is compromised We found that IL 1 changed the expression levels for several signaling proteins and tumor suppressor genes Table 2 panel D but the significance of these changes is not clear Proteins associated with G protein signaling were both increased rho6 Gem and regulator of G protein signaling and decreased rho7 RAD1 and p160ROCK Jagged which is a transmembrane ligand for the Notch signaling pathway 49 is induced by IL 1 Interestingly jagged 1 is important for epithelial mesenchymal cell interaction in development 50 and mutations in the jagged gene lead to Alagille syndrome a congenital connective tissue disorder whose hallmarks include craniofacial and vertebral deformities 51 Zhao and colleagues 52 identified frizzled denoted FZD2 as the human homologue of the Drosophila polarity determining gene Of potential importance is the fact that frizzled family members have recently been implicated by Carson and colleagues in rheumatoid arthritis 53 A new frizzled family member that is expressed in chondrocytes and is involved in skeletal morphogenesis has been described 54 Perhaps down regulation of frizzled family members by IL 1 is deleterious to chondrocyte function and can contribute to OA Conclusions Along with confirming changes in gene expression already known to be associated with IL 1 stimulation chondrocyte biology and MMP gene regulation this microarray identified several other induced and repressed genes whose roles in chondrocyte biology are yet to be defined While the significance of these findings in terms of understanding IL 1 effects on chondrocytes is still uncertain the documentation of these changes in gene expression may provide the basis for future studies on the molecular effects of IL 1 on chondrocytes and on other cell types as well Abbreviations AP 1 activator protein 1 COL2A1 procollagen 2 alpha 1 egr 1 early growth response gene 1 ets erythroblastosis gene twenty six IL 1
