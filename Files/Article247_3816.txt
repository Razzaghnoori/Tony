 Round One ABC News 1 Metabolife 0 Chatterbox finally logged on to Metabolife s up yours 20 20 Web site As explained in previous items see Metabolife s Lawyer Assures C box He Won t Sue and Metabolife Read This No Wait Don t Read This Metabolife felt ill used by 20 20 s Arnold Diaz when he interviewed its chief executive officer Mike Ellis about the safety and efficacy of Metabolife s popular herbal diet pills So the company put an unedited videotape of the interview made by Metabolife s technicians with an audio feed from ABC on a special Web site and invited consumers to compare that with 20 20 s report which has yet to air Chatterbox believes the behavior of the press merits no less scrutiny than the behavior of companies like Metabolife Therefore he declines to join ABC News in its whiny denunciation of Metabolife s attempt to turn the tables However now that Chatterbox has examined Metabolife s annotated transcript of the 20 20 interview Chatterbox lacked the patience to download the video he is ready to pronounce the opening round of this public relations battle a victory for ABC News Before proceeding Chatterbox needs to state a few caveats 1 Chatterbox went into this with no knowledge and no opinion about the safety and efficacy of Metabolife s herbal drug supplement 2 Chatterbox knows a little more now that he s read the transcript but not enough to render a reliable judgment on whether Metabolife is safe and effective 3 Chatterbox obviously can t judge the fairness of a 20 20 episode that hasn t aired yet the best he can do right now is try to evaluate whether the reporter Diaz conducted a professional and responsible interview Which unless the unseen tape reveals Diaz physically pummeling Ellis while he asks his questions Diaz seems to have done The bulk of the interview consists of Diaz asking Ellis in various ways whether Metabolife is safe and effective The form these exchanges mostly take is a debate about whether Metabolife in its labeling and its promotional material accurately presents what scientific study has found about the product Diaz keeps accusing Ellis in effect of exaggerating the assurances given by the scientific community Ellis in turn says Diaz is misinterpreting various scientific studies or misstating who the lead scientist on this or that study was Notes interjected by Metabolife into the transcript point out that some of the scientists Diaz cites have economic ties to rival diet products Though Chatterbox won t attempt to referee the scientific questions Diaz at least gives the impression of being fairly well informed while Ellis often gives the impression of being evasive At one point for instance Ellis states flatly that certain language cited by Diaz declaring Metabolife to be safe and effective is not on the Metabolife Web page But later Ellis concedes You know to be honestly fair with you I do not know what our Web site looks like Probably the most accessible part of the interview is when Diaz quizzes Ellis about his criminal past Diaz Now you developed this product while you you developed the product while you were on probation for a drug conviction Ellis That s correct Here Metabolife interjects the following explanatory note Nine years ago Michael Ellis received five years probation for the use of a telephone to facilitate a drug trafficking offense committed in 1989 Diaz Now talk to me about that You were a former police officer and yet you got caught setting up and dealing methamphetamine Ellis Well it s correct I was a former police officer and it s correct that I did receive probation for using a telephone to further a drug transaction And that s something I m not proud of I think that happening to me is the nightmare of my life and I ve made it a point to kind of try to do the right thing ever since that It s not something I m proud of Diaz How does a former police officer get involved with running a laboratory making illegal speed Ellis Well I don t think I was running a laboratory I think that s a misconception But I made a grave error just a bad mistake on my part Chatterbox predicts that this exchange will end up airing in the 20 20 broadcast When asked to explain this bad mistake Ellis elaborates Ellis You know it s one of the people that were involved in that it s a very personal issue with him and why I got involved he s like a brother to me he s like my best friend and I allowed emotions to get in the way of probably better judgment Diaz then tells Ellis that unsealed court records show that you were involved in a very large methamphetamine lab manufacturing speed but that Ellis pleaded to a lesser charge that was nonetheless a felony Ellis Yes I did Diaz OK So the key ingredient in the illegal drug speed is ephedrine ephedrine is the key ingredient in the Metabolife pills that you re making now Is that a coincidence At this point Metabolife interjects another explanatory note A DEA approved lab found that Metabolife could not be converted into illegal speed using the method published in the Journal of Forensic Sciences Vol 40 No 4 July 1995 Then the transcript proceeds to Ellis response Well when I designed Metabolife in those days especially I mean it was known as ma huang It s only recently has been where everybody became aware of a lot of the active alkaloids in it And that Metabolife specifically has been tested and has been through rigorous testing through DEA and FDA certified laboratories to determine if in fact you could make methamphetamine out of Metabolife it was concluded you could not do that Score one badly needed blow for Ellis But within moments Diaz is up off the ropes Diaz W hy did you make the man who was convicted with you Michael Blevens a partner in the company Chatterbox predicts this question and the following answer will also make the 20 20 broadcast Ellis Well Michael Blevens had his personal reasons why he got involved and Michael Blevens is like a brother to me I may not approve of a lot of things a lot of people do like my children I would not approve of certain things they do but it doesn t stop you from loving them I still love Michael Blevens he was raised like a brother with me and I knew his mother especially that was like a mother to me And so because of an incident that I am just you know I made poor judgment also that I m not going to sit back and judge the real character that the person might be When asked by Diaz whether Blevens still plays an active role in Metabolife Ellis says he hasn t for almost a year To summarize Round one goes to ABC News Chatterbox will judge round two after 20 20 airs its Metabolife story
