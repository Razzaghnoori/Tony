 Not Gotcha My Slate colleague Jacob Weisberg argues that the let s call it the unfolding of Vice President Gore s position on the great Joint Chiefs Gay Litmus Test issue was not sufficiently flip floppy to constitute a reversal Many commentators in Slate s Fray echo this view dismissing the whole controversy as a phony media game of gotcha I respectfully disagree First of course it was a reversal Initially Gore said he would require that any Chiefs nominee be in agreement with his gay policy Then he came back and denied there should ever be any kind of inquiry into the personal political opinion of officers in the U S military The only litmus test explained his adviser Robert Shrum was the banal constitutional one civilian control of the military Under Gore s Position No 1 Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf get bounced Under Position No 2 it would seem they don t since they presumably agree with the principle of civilian control Weisberg says no there is little functional difference between demanding agreement and Gore s second position demanding constitutionally required support since Gore knows that those who disagree are likely to sabotage his policy The only difference Weisberg says is that demanding support leaves open the theoretical possibility of appointing a military officer so honorable that he will work assiduously to implement a policy he personally disagrees with But under Gore s second position Gore won t know who personally agrees or disagrees with his policy since he says he won t inquire into the actual views of Chiefs candidates Don t Ask Don t Tell More important Weisberg assumes that Gore would never appoint somebody who disagrees and might therefore sabotage the policy among disagreers only the theoretical perfectly honorable officer would pass muster But it s exactly that assumption that bothers those who worry about a litmus test the idea Gore would give a privileged position to the gay issue ruling out a candidate who was otherwise a military genius and inspirational leader solely because he had in Gore s mind retrograde views on gays That implication in Gore s answer No 1 is what made it genuinely troubling a legitimate gaffe It suggested the vice president was so keen on his gay policy that he would give it higher priority than other military issues such as how to win wars or counter the Chinese and Russian threats Actually given the crippling effect of the gay controversy on the first six months of Clinton s presidency it implied Gore was willing to give the gay issue priority over non military issues as well Not that again you could almost hear voters saying There are other more important concerns for a president than integrating gays into the armed forces It s time for some sensible gay leader to point this out Andrew Sullivan are you still reading this At best Gore s gaffe revealed a candidate so eager to pander to a Democratic constituency that he lost his bearings and overstepped the bounds of good political judgment That s certainly forgivable but wasn t Gore s unique selling proposition supposed to be his dull but sound reliability You mean he s boring and a bit of a hothead too P S Weisberg s right to ridicule Gore s Position No 2 why shouldn t a president inquire into the personal views of a Joint Chiefs candidate and try to appoint someone who agrees with him A general who disagrees with a policy is indeed likely to implement it unenthusiastically Gore could have said Yes I ll consider a candidate s views I d be naive not to but I ll look at the whole man and the whole range of military issues not just this one issue In somersaulting from personal views are a litmus test to I ll never consider personal views Gore leapt completely over this sensible obvious answer But that doesn t make his performance any less of a reversal or any more reassuring
