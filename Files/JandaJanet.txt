 Last summer over the Fourth of July our family decided to take a vacation We decided to go to Myrtle Beach SC We left early on a Thursday morning around 10 00 It was about a five hour drive It seemed like a ten hour drive with three children in the car wanting something to drink They were fighting They were cooped they didn t like being cooped up in their seat belts so we had to stop quite often We finally got to Myrtle Beach in the afternoon We checked into a motel room at the south end of Myrtle We were right on the beach It was great After we checked into the motel room we decided to take a walk on the beach It was a beautiful afternoon about 80 degrees We walked for about thirty minutes and then came back and sat on the beach After we sat on the beach we decided that we should get ready to go out to dinner After we got ready to go about to dinner we drove around looking for a restaurant We finally found an all you can eat seafood buffet They had crab legs crab cakes shrimp oysters clams It was great We ate until we were all stuffed After we ate dinner we decided to go and play some games in the arcade The kids went bowling shot basketball and just ran around crazy It was getting late but we decided that we should go on the bumper cars The bumper cars were a blast We kept stalling and bumping and going around in circles and we just had a wonderful time on the bumper cars By then we decided we should go back to the room It wasn t that late it was only about nine o clock so we decided to get some flashlights and go for a walk on the beach We went out on the beach and started to hunt for little sand crabs They are so much fun to try and catch You blind then with the flashlight and then you catch them from behind But watch out because it s they like to pinch We got about ten sand crabs in a bucket and then decided to let them all go They all went crazy The beach was beautiful the stars were out It was calm It was a great night just to sit and relax The next day we got up around nine o clock and decided to go sit out and play on the beach The kids built sandcastles and played in the waves and laid out in the sun My two boys decided to bury each other They dug a humongous hole my husband helped them We put one boy in one hole and the other one in the other hole and we covered them all the way up to their shoulders and their heads were just sticking out They thought it was a blast We decided to just leave them there for a while because they couldn t get into any trouble They finally got themselves out of their deep holes and they went in the ocean and took some rafts and tried to ride the waves By then it was time for lunch We decided just to go down to a hotdog stand and get some hotdogs to eat And to chill off in the shade since to was getting kind of hot So we sat around and ate hotdogs and milkshakes and then went back out in the sand for a while longer I took a nap and my husband and the boys played Frisbee It was the Fourth of July so we decided that we should get off the beach for a while and let the kids take a rest After their rest we decided to eat dinner out on on the beach at a little restaurant they had a nice little band The firecrackers were already being set off Children were running around with sparklers It was getting wild and it wasn t even dark yet We sat around and listened to music and then decided it was time for us to let some of our own firecrackers off We had a blast The kids had a blast Everybody was going crazy It was a fun Fourth of July I was afraid I was going to step on a hot firecracker because they were all over the place People weren t even looking where they were shooting them off It was just Bang Bang Bang But they were really pretty and it was a wonderful evening We took a walk on the beach and so we could see some more fireworks They were everywhere We went down to a dock and someone was letting them off on a dock They were all so pretty it was so much fun Well it was getting late so I think it is time to go home So we went back to the room and we all fell asleep We were going to have to leave the next day so the next day we decided to play on the beach until late in the afternoon and late in the afternoon we decided that we had better get on the road The kids were exhausted They slept in the car all the way back and that is the story about our long weekend vacation during the Fourth of July
