 A Strategy of Tactics This spot produced by the dean of Democratic media consultants Bob Squier begins by indicting the Republicans for another negative attack Initially it doesn t even bother to identify the substance of the attack Survey research shows that one of the most effective negative charges is that the other side is being negative This ad seeks to create a context of doubt for any and all Republican attacks on Bill Clinton In fact both sides run negative ads Eventually the ad implies that its subject sort of is immigration The purpose is to pre empt another natural Republican issue Immigration continues to be social and political dynamite and this spot tries to take the match out of Republican hands The Buchananesque toughness of the pictures validates the toughness of the language leaving the impression that Clinton is as anti immigrant as any Republican The spot now shifts to its own negative fusillade against Republicans They opposed protecting U S workers from replacement by foreign workers The actual issue is not explained but the charge taps into the populist anger about stagnant wages foreign competition and the globalization that both Clinton and Dole in fact have supported Next the spot says the Republicans opposed Clinton on more police and anti drug programs another effort to pre empt or even reverse a perennial Republican advantage During this attack phase the ad alternates film of House Speaker Newt Gingrich with vaguely relevant footage What s inside the rug an American job or an illegal alien while repeatedly referring to the Dole Gingrich budget But where is Dole His picture can t be used because in theory if not in effect the ad is an act of legislative advocacy paid for by the Democratic National Committee not the Clinton campaign and legally Dole as an ex senator can t be its obvious target The Clinton campaign converts a legal restriction into a political virtue marrying Dole to the grainy black and white visage of America s most unpopular politician By contrast Clinton appears intermittently in decidedly presidential footage The Clinton campaign doesn t want to be about one or two big things this year it s not the economy stupid This spot is the vivid expression of a strategy of many tactics There is no message here but an almost telegraphic mix of hot button words Robert Shrum
