 La Rochefoucauld Has the Last Laugh Good morning Brent Well it s almost as good as an old fashioned morality tale isn t it something from the Grimm brothers or La Rochefoucauld The fox tries to have it both ways breakfast of chickens maybe and lunch on their eggs But somehow the farmer foils the little predator s scheme and he ends up with nothing neither chicken nor eggs So now with Hillary The FALN terrorists have accepted Bill s clemency offer and she ends up with nothing but egg on her face Downstate liberals and ethnic activists will never forgive her for opposing the commutation deal but she has nothing to show to more conservative upstate New York voters either The Puerto Rican terrorists go free and not only is she proven utterly powerless to stop them but most people suspect that she was responsible for the clemency offer in the first place It s a happy ending for people like us and you and I do seem really in agreement on this who think that one of the worst things about politics these days is all these gutless candidates trying to have it both ways The moral of the story la La Rochefoucauld Trying to have it both ways usually gets you neither But all this brings me back to where I started yesterday I know I could be gloating but somehow in the end the whole thing is just depressing Surely America deserves politicians who can do better than this But the truth is when I think about it I wonder if that s so Maybe we get precisely the politicians we deserve because after all we usually reward the ones who pander to us or try to have it both ways And those who take on thorny issues or take strong stands or worst of all try to find a truly honorable and principled middle ground are usually only punished for their trouble Think about the presidential 2000 beauty contest Gore and Bradley have got themselves into a shameless arms race each one trying to outdo the other in flattering and cajoling minority voters They ve trooped around to the civil rights groups annual meetings They ve sworn emotionally how much the race issue means to them how searing it was to witness bigotry against fellow Knicks that s Bradley of course or in Gore s case to watch his father battling Jim Crow Both have promised to do just about anything Jesse Jackson asks them and Bradley even paid an homage visit to the Rev Al Sharpton It s pandering of the worst kind and neither man has taken on a single tough issue But both will be rewarded for their unctuousness by minority voters while they would get absolutely nothing for staking out more thoughtful positions Surely to take the most obvious example there are better ways to open up opportunity than with preferences Even Clinton claimed he wanted to mend affirmative action But neither Gore nor Bradley would go near that now It just wouldn t pay off with black or white voters There s more to be said about this I m sure you and I could have long discussion of preferences But in the end I think we get the politicians we deserve It s easy to criticize them but really we ought to be looking inward All best Tamar
