                    Background        Recently DNA chip or microarray technology has been        developed that allows researchers to measure the expression        levels of thousands of genes simultaneously over different        time points different experimental conditions or different        tissue samples It is based on the hybridization of DNA or        RNA molecules with a library of complementary strands fixed        on a solid surface Oligonucleotide chips contain thousands        of features with genespecific sequences about  bases        long These oligos are then hybridized with labeled probe        derived from a given tissue or cell line The resulting        fluorescence intensity gives information about the        abundance of the corresponding mRNA This is the Affymetrix        DNA chip technology Alternatively cDNA can be spotted on        nylon filters or glass slides Complex mRNA probes are        reverse transcribed to cDNA and labeled with red or green        fluorescent dyes This technique is often called the        spotted array or cDNA array In both methods thousands of        mRNA concentrations can be measured in parallel        potentially revealing complex gene regulatory networks        One important application of the microarray gene        expression data in medicine is to study the relationship        between tissue phenotypes and gene expression profiles on        the wholegenome scale The phenotype could be several        different types of cancers     responses of cell        lines to different chemical compounds   or time to        tumor recurrence after treatment For binary phenotypes        such as two different types of cancers the problem becomes        the classification of patients samples It has been        suggested that gene expression may provide the additional        information needed to improve cancer classification and        diagnosis   For continuous phenotypes such as drug        sensitivity the problem of interest is to relate gene        expression patterns to sensitivity to drugs and therefore        aid in the process of drug discovery and provide a        rationale for selection of therapy on the basis of the        molecular characteristics of a patients tumor        From the statistical point of view the challenge is        that the microarray gene expression data are often measured        with a great deal of noise and that the sample size of        tissues or cell lines denoted by         n is usually very small compared to        the number of genes in expression arrays denoted by         p  This results in the large         p small         n  problem   Most current        approaches to dealing with this problem first select genes        that can best separate tissues of different types by        performing univariate analysis The expression levels of        these genes are then combined linearly in a weighted way to        form compound covariates These covariates are then used in        the standard regression models for model fitting and        prediction West         et al    proposed a Bayesian        binary regression approach using the singular value        decomposition to first reduce the dimension of the variable        space          p  to the number of samples          n  They called the resulting linear        combination of the expression levels of all the genes the        expression of the supergenes All these approaches reduce        the variable space by making one or several linear        combinations of the expression levels of some or all of the        genes Linear combination may not however be the best way        of reducing the dimension of the variable space        Another popular approach to analyzing gene expression        data is to use clustering methods to simultaneously cluster        both samples and genes in order to determine some clusters        of genes that are mostly correlated with some clusters of        samples Examples of such an application include analysis        of gene expression data and drug response for the  human        cancer cell lines of the National Cancer Institute NCI        data   and analysis of cancerous and normal colon        tissues   However the clustering approach is purely        exploratory and requires an external similarity measure        Methods that can be used to assess the significance of the        clustering results are needed        The Rasch model RM and its extensions    are an        important staple of psychological research and are used in        other fields such as sociology educational testing and        medicine The idea of the RM is that one can indirectly        infer a persons position on a latent trait from hisher        responses to a set of wellchosen items For example the        RM has been used to infer the quality of life of cancer        patients from their answers to a welldesigned        questionnaire   or to measure disability from        activities of daily living   For these applications        data are usually given in a matrix with rows being        individuals and columns being responses to a set of items        Microarray gene expression data are also given in a        transposable matrix form with rows being genes and columns        being samples and vice versa The RM can therefore be used        to explain the observed patterns over different columns        Here we propose two different formulations of the        polytomous RM for analysis of microarray gene expression        data The first formulation treats samples as persons and        genes as items The idea is to infer several latent        factors associated with a given sample on the basis of its        expression profile over many genes We combine a        modelbased clustering method   with the RM to define a        small set of latent factors associated with samples For a        given sample we assume that genes in the same cluster        determine one latent factor associated with this sample        and use the RM to estimate this latent factor for each gene        cluster These latent factors are then used in a regression        analysis of the observed phenotypes The rational of this        approach is that genes of similar function yield similar        expression patterns in microarray hybridization experiments            Coregulated genes may share similar        expression profiles maybe involved in related functions or        regulated by common regulatory elements   Therefore        if genes are clustered together it is impossible from a        statistical point of view to differentiate one gene from        the other In this case a better way of studying these        genes is to treat them as a cluster Consideration of genes        in the same cluster can potentially reduce noise associated        with a single gene        The second formulation is to treat genes as persons        and samples as items The idea is to infer several latent        factors associated with each gene based on its expression        levels across samples from different tissue or cell types        This formulation provides simple summary statistics for        genes based on their expression profiles over samples and        helps to identify genes that are more likely be over or        underexpressed within samples of the same type or between        samples of different types We first briefly review some        key ideas of the polytomous RM and its estimation We then        present two different formulations of the RM for the gene        expression data Details involved in these formulations are        given We apply our proposed methods to the analysis of the        leukemia dataset   and the NCI dataset   and        conclude with discussion of our method                    Results                  The Rasch model RM          The RM was originally proposed as an itemresponse          theory model in the psychological test or attitude scale            The idea is that the use of a test or scale          presupposes that one can indirectly infer a persons          position on a latent trait from hisher responses to a          set of wellchosen items Assume that we have           I persons and           J items Let           Z                       ij            be the response of individual           i to the item           j where the response can take one          from           m   possible ordinal categories                     m One version of the RM which we          use in this paper called the partial credit model            assumes the probability of response           h as                     for           i             I            j             J and           h              m where                                  jl            is the itemspecific parameter which expresses the          attractiveness of the respective level           l of item           j                       i  is the person parameter that          expresses the latent factor of the           i th person that is measured by the                    J items It is easy to verify that          the probability of the response is monotonous in both          person and item parameters For example for           m   Figure plots the Rasch          probabilities as a function of the value of the latent          factor a for two sets of itemspecific            values It can be seen from these          plots that for a given item persons with larger            value tend to have greater          probability of expressing high scores and for a given          person the response probabilities are different for          items with different            values To make the model           identifiable the following constraints are required          Therefore there is a total of           Jm   unconstraint itemspecific          parameters          The item parameters can be estimated based on the          conditional likelihood given minimal sufficient          statistics for the person parameters For a given person          the minimal sufficient statistic is the sum of the          category weights corresponding to the observed responses          After the  parameters are estimated the person          parameters can then be estimated by maximizing the          likelihood function Details on the conditional          likelihood estimation of the item parameters can be found          in Anderson                            Relating gene expression profiles to          phenotypes                      Outline of the approach            Our goal is to infer several latent factors            associated with each sample based on its gene            expression profile and relate these latent factors to            the observed phenotypes Using the terms of the RM we            treat each gene as an item each tissue sample or            cell line as a person and treat the expression level            as the response of a given tissue to a given gene The            unidimensional RM may not however hold for the            complete set of genes generated by microarrays Here we            assume that genes with similar expressions determine            one latent factor and that the RM holds for each set            of genes with similar expression profiles            To identify genes with similar expression profiles            over samples we first use the modelbased clustering            method of Fraley and Raftery   to cluster             p genes into             K clusters based on their gene            expression profiles over             n samples Note that the            clusterstep is performed based on the observed            continuous gene expression data not the discretized            gene expression patterns For a given sample using            expression profiles of genes in a given cluster we            estimate a latent factor by fitting a RM These latent            factors are then used in a regression analysis to study            the relationship between the gene expressions and the            phenotype The method allows to investigate whether a            cluster of genes with similar expression profiles is            related to the observed phenotypes and can also be            used for future prediction by estimating the latent            factors using the maximum likelihood estimation We            give some details for each of these steps in the            following sections                                Modelbased clustering analysis            Cluster analysis based on multivariate normal            mixture models    has been used for clustering            various types of biological zoological financial and            industrial data We first set up the mixture model for            the gene expression data Let             x                           j                            x                          j                x                           nj               be the             n dimensional vector of the             j th gene expression over             n samples We assume that the            gene expression values of             p genes             x                            x                           p               arise from a mixture of             K n dimensional Gaussian            distribution with density                         where the                            k              is the probability that a gene belongs to the             k th cluster and                            n                           X                            k                                         k               denotes the density function of the multivariate            normal distribution with mean                            k              and variancecovariance matrix                            k              Possible parameterization of the covariance matrix            is discussed in Fraley and Raftery   Note that if            we assume a simple covariance structure                            k                            I  where             I is the identity matrix and             is the variance then the modelbased clustering method            becomes the Kmeans clustering method              Treating clustering as a mixture model problem            allows us to use the EM algorithm to estimate the            probability of a given gene belonging to each of the             K clusters and to estimate the            corresponding mean vector and covariance matrix for            each cluster   One advantage of this approach is            that it allows us to obtain an estimate of the number            of gene clusters Following Fraley and Raftery              we propose to use the Bayesian inference criterion            BIC   for selecting the number of gene clusters            BIC is defined as                        BIC              K                L              K               n                           K              log             p             where             L              K  is the maximized            loglikelihood             n                           k              is the number of independent parameters to be            estimated in the             K cluster model and             p is the sample size number of            the genes We will choose             K that gives the maximum             BIC              K  value            As the first step of our approach we cluster genes            into             K clusters using the modelbased            clustering method described above where the number of            gene clusters             K is determined by maximizing the            BIC scores Let             C                           k              denote the genes in cluster             k and             p                           k              denote the number of genes in this cluster for             k               K                                 Rasch model and regression analysis            We fit a RM model as in equation  for genes in            each of the             K clusters respectively treating            samples as persons and genes as items To fit the            RM equation  for genes in the             k th cluster we let             i be the sample index and             j be the gene index for             i               n  and             j               p                           k               and let                            i                                          ik              in model  be the latent factor for the             i th sample which is determined            by the genes in the             k th cluster and                            jl              be the genespecific parameter for the             j th gene The RM assumes that            the variation of the gene expression patterns observed            over different samples is due to a latent factor and            it provides a probabilistic model to describe the gene            expression pattern for a given sample            Let                           ik              be the maximum likelihood estimate of the latent            factor for the             i th sample determined by the            genes in the             k th cluster Let                           i                                        i                              iK               be the vector of the estimated latent factors            based on the gene expression profiles for the             i th sample In general we can            relate the phenotype             y                           i              for the             i th sample to the estimated of            latent factors                           i              by a regression model                         for             i               n  where  is the vector of            regression parameters                            i               is the error term and the actual model of the            regression function              f  and the distribution of the            error depend on type of the phenotype If the phenotype            is a continuous variable linear regression can be            used if it is a binary variable logistic or probit            regression can be used and if the phenotype is            survival time the Cox regression model can be used            Alternatively the generalized linear model can be            used One advantage of the proposed method is that we            can model the interactions between the latent factors            in the standard way of modeling interactions in the            regression models As only the estimated and not the            observed latent factors are available in the regression            model equation  the variance of the estimate of the             parameter has to be corrected We propose to use a            twostep bootstrap resampling procedure   to            estimate the variance of the estimate of the parameter             in the regression model First within the             k th gene cluster we resample            genes and reestimate the                            ik              parameter by fitting the RM  Second for a            given set of estimated              parameters we resample the             n samples from              y                           i                                         i               for             i               n and fit the regression model            equation  to obtain a new estimate of  We can then            estimate the variance of with these resampled            estimates                                Prediction            For a new sample with gene expression             x                           new                            x                         new               x                         new              p   these             p genes are first divided into             K clusters according to the            clustering result For a gene             j in cluster             k we first discretize its            expression level into one of the             m   categories using the            cutoff points used in the discretizationstep denoted            by             z                         new              j   We can then estimate the            corresponding latent factor                            k              by maximizing the following likelihood            function                         where                           jh              is the estimated genespecific parameter for gene             j in the             k th cluster based on the            training sample Using the estimated vector of the            latent factors  the regression model  can then be            used for predicting phenotype             Y             new                                      RM for latent factors associated with genes          The second formulation of the RM for gene expression          data is to treat genes as persons and samples as          items Assume that we have gene expression data of           p different genes indexed by           i over           n                       k            samples of the           k th sample type indexed by           j  for           k              K Note that the indices           i and           j are used differently from the          previous sections We are interested in identifying genes          that are expressed differently among these different          sample types Here each gene has its own expression          patterns over different samples For gene           i we can estimate a latent factor                                 ik            based on its gene expression profile over           n                       k            samples from the           k th sample type by fitting the RM          equation  for           k              K In this formulation of the RM          we treat genes as persons treat samples as items          and treat each genes expression level over samples as          the responses In RM            I            p and           J            n                       k                                    i                                    ik             which is the latent factor for the           i th gene determined by the samples          of the           k th type and                        jl            is the samplespecific parameter This model assumes          that the variation of gene expression patterns across          different samples among different genes is due to several          genespecific latent factors Here the latent factor                        ik            can be interpreted as some quantities related to the          transcription factors of the           i th gene which determine the gene          expression levels in samples of the           k th sample type For a given          tissue or cell line type           k genes with larger estimated          latent factor                        ik             tend to have higher expression levels than those          with smaller estimated latent factor For a given sample          type           k the estimated latent factors                       k                          pk             provide a nice way to order genes based on their          expression levels over a small number of samples of          sample type           k and to identify genes that are          relatively over or underexpressed in the           k th sample type In addition by          comparing the estimated latent factors associated with          genes across different sample types we can identify          genes that are differentially expressed among different          tissue or cell line types                          Analysis of the leukemia dataset                      Classification using clusterRM            We applied the proposed approach to the problem of            classifying acute leukemias Acute leukemias can            broadly be divided into two classes acute myeloid            leukemia AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL            that originate respectively from cells of myeloid or            lymphoid origin The two diseases appear identical            under the microscope However correct diagnosis is            critical as they respond best to different treatment            regimens Golub             et al   used a set of             leukemia samples including  AML and  ALL as            training samples set and used an additional  samples             AML  ALL as a test set for testing their            proposed method for class prediction In our analysis            we combined both the training and the test datasets            into a dataset of  samples  AML and  ALL For            each of the  samples the gene expression data were            extracted from Affymetrix expression arrays            We first selected the subset of  genes based on            an initial processing adopted by the authors of the            leukemia study The expressions summarized are the log            base  values of the actual expression levels            following this initial filtering and transformation We            then select  genes that are mostly overexpressed in            AML and  genes that are mostly overexpressed in ALL            by using the Wilcoxon rank sums test This simple rule            of selecting a smaller set of genes are also used in            Golub             et al   using slightly            different tests As expected the modelbased            clustering method assuming the common covariance matrix            clusters these  genes into two clusters with             genes in each cluster The left plot of Figure shows            the gene expression levels of these  genes for the             leukemia samples Clearly these  genes are            highly differentially expressed between the two types            of the leukemia samples            Given the  genes selected methods such as            principal component analysis partial leastsquare            regression or composite covariate predictor can be used            to further reduce the gene dimension to two or three            dimensions by taking linear combinations of the gene            expression levels Instead of taking linear combination            of gene expression levels we first discretize the            expression levels of all the  genes over  samples            into four categories using the quantiles as the cutoff            points Therefore for each gene their expression            level can take one of four possible values of               and  The same analysis was also done by discretizing            gene expression levels into eight categories the            results were essentially the same In the following we            only present the results using four categories Fitting            two RMs to these discretized gene expression levels we            estimate two latent factors for each sample one latent            factor is determined by gene expression profiles of             genes in one cluster the other is determined by the            gene expression profiles of  genes in another            cluster The right panel of Figure shows the estimated            values of these two latent factors for all the             samples This plot shows that the two leukemia types            are well separated by these two latent factors with no            overlap except that two leukemia samples one from ALL            group and the other from AML group are close to each            other in this twodimensional space            Discriminant analysis using these two latent factors            would expect to perform very well in classification We            performed a leaveoneout cross validation analysis to            estimate the misclassification rate Specifically we            leave one sample out and first estimate the            samplespecific latent factors                            ik              for the             i th gene for             k   and genespecific            parameter                            jl              using the remaining samples We then estimate the            latent factors of the leftout sample by maximizing the            likelihood function Equation  Fishers linear            discriminant analysis using the estimated latent            factors was then used to classify the leftout sample            The above procedure was applied to each of the             samples and resulted in a misclassification rate of               We use this example to demonstrate that two            latent factors carry most of the information of the            gene expression levels of the  genes                                Summary of gene expression profiles            In order to study the difference of the gene            expression profiles between the ALL and AML samples we            fit two RMs treating genes as persons The first            model uses the ALL samples as items and the second            uses the AML samples as items Therefore for each            gene we obtain two latent factors one based on the            gene expression profiles of ALL samples the other            based on the gene expression profiles of AML samples            Figure plots the estimated latent factors for each            gene together with the  pointwise confidence            intervals From these two plots we conclude that the            gene expression levels of most of the genes genes with             confidence intervals containing zero are not            significantly different in both AML and ALL samples            For the ALL samples  genes expressed at lower level            and  genes expressed at higher level compared to the            rest of the  genes For the AML samples  genes            were expressed at lower level and  genes at higher            level compared to the rest of the  genes            In order to see the difference of gene expression            between ALL and AML samples the two estimated factors            are plotted on the left in Figure  Genes in the upper            left quadrant tend to have higher gene expression level            in AML but lower expression level in ALL On the other            hand genes in the lower right quadrant tend to higher            gene expression level in ALL but lower expression            level in AML The logarithm base  of the gene            expression levels of these genes are plotted on the            right panel in Figure  Clearly these genes are            differentially expressed between the two type of the            samples Further examination indicates that all the             genes identified by the Wilcoxon ranksum test are            included in these genes                                    Analysis of NC dataset                      Relating gene expression profiles to drug            activities            Scherf             et al   reported the use of            cDNA microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in            a set of  human cancer cell lines that have been            characterized pharmacologically by treatment with more            than  different drug agents one at time and            independently This dataset offers us a unique            opportunity to relate variations in gene expression to            the molecular pharmacology of cancer The NCI set            includes cell lines derived from cancers of colorectal            CO seven cell lines renal RE eight cell lines            breast BR eight cell lines ovarian OV six cell            lines prostate PR two cell lines lung LC nine            cell lines and central nervous system CNS six cell            lines origin as well as leukemias LE six cell            lines and melanomas ME eight cell lines In this            analysis we consider only the  drug subsets whose            mechanisms of action is putatively understood and            their activity data are available from the Web We used            the  gene subset along with  individually            assessed targets for the present analysis These subset            was selected by selective filters used in   These             drugs are listed in Table of   They applied the            clustering methods to cluster cell lines basing on both            gene expression profiles and the drug expression            profiles The phenotype of interest is            chemotherapeutic susceptibility as measured by log             GI               where             GI              measures the dose needed to cause             growth inhibition We first cluster the  genes            using the modelbased clustering method described            previously using the original data of the logratios            The BIC scores in the upper left panel of Figure            indicate that there are four gene clusters with               and  genes in each cluster respectively            As a comparison we also applied the hierarchical            clustering method to cluster these genes The            dendrogram shown in the upper right plot of Figure            also indicates four gene clusters For each cell line            a latent factor is estimated using the RM based on the            gene expression levels of the genes in each of the four            clusters To fit the RM we discretize the gene            expression levels into four categories using the            quartiles The same analysis was also done with eight            catagories and the results are the same The lower            left plot of Figure shows the levels of these four            latent factors sorted by cancer types In general cell            lines with the same origin tend to have similar levels            of the latent factors therefore these factors can be            used for discriminating among the nine different cell            lines However for the third latent factor the cell            lines MDAMB derived from the pleural effusion of            a patient with breast cancer and its ErbB            transfectant MDAN have similar levels to those of            latent factors estimated for the melanoma cell lines            To verify the utilities of these latent factors in            clustering cell lines we performed the hierarchical            clustering analysis based on these four factors see            lower right plot in Figure  We note that the two            breast cancer cell lines are clustered together with            melanomas Hierarchical clustering analysis using all            the genes also resulted in clustering these two cell            lines with melanomas In general cell lines of the            same origin are clustered together on the basis of the            four latent factors estimated with the RM The            clustering result of the cell lines using these four            factors are similar to the clusters obtained using all            the genes see              Each of the  cell lines is now characterized by            four different latent factors where each latent factor            is estimated based on the expression profiles of the            genes in each of the four clusters It would be            interesting to relate these four latent factors to the            drug activity patterns as measured by log             GI              across the  cell lines For a            given drug we first performed a simple linear            regression analysis treating the drug activity as            response variable and using one of the four latent            factors as a predictor and obtained the parameter            estimate of  in the following model            drug activity    x latent factor            The left panel of Figure shows the estimated             value together with pointwise  confidence interval            for each of the  drugs using one of the latent            factors as a predictor The variance of the regression            parameter  and the  confidence interval was            estimated using the bootstrap procedure where             resamples of genes in each cluster and  resamples of            samples were used For each latent factor greater            positive parameter estimate implies that higher gene            expression level in a given gene cluster corresponds to            a higher drug activity For a given latent factor            drugs with  confidence interval of the estimated             parameter not including zero are those whose activities            are related to genes which determine this latent            factor            In order to relate the drug activity of a given drug            to all the four latent factors we performed multiple            linear regression analysis where drug activity for a            given cell line was treated as a response variable and            the four latent factors were treated as the predictors            The right plot of Figure shows the estimates of the            parameters in the multiple regression model for each of            the  drugs This plot can be used for selecting drugs            that are related to gene expression profiles For            example only drugs with at least one large parameter            estimate are important for further study as only for            these drugs their activity levels are related to gene            expression profiles                                Identifying genes differentially expressed in            different cell lines            It is also interesting to identify genes that are            over or underexpressed relative to other genes for a            given cell line type Using the RM we treat genes as            persons and cell line samples as different items            and estimate the latent factor for each gene based on            its expression profiles over all the samples of a given            cell line type Figure shows the estimated latent            factor for each gene based on the gene expression            profiles over each of nine different cell lines These            estimated latent factors provide a summary of gene            expressions over different cell lines Clearly the            gene expression profiles are different across different            cell line types            For a given cell line type we can also infer which            genes are over or underexpressed compared to other            genes based on the estimated latent factors Figure            shows the estimated latent factor and the pointwise             confidence interval for each gene for each of the            nine cell line types For a given cell line genes with             confidence interval of the estimated latent factor            not including zero show significantly different            expression from those genes with  confidence            interval of the estimated latent factor including zero            For example for breast cancer cell line the method            identified  genes or expressed sequence tags ESTs            that are relatively overexpressed the estimated latent            factor is greater than zero and is significant at the             level and  genes or ESTs that are relatively            underexpressed estimated latent factor is less than            zero and is significant at the  level in the            breast cancer cell lines Table lists the known genes            Interestingly we note that genes that are            overexpressed include             p and genes that are            underexpressed include that for tumorassociated            antigen CO On the basis of our analysis all other            genes have similar gene expression level in the breast            cancer cell line Genes that are over or            underexpressed in other types of cell line can be            similarly identified                                      Discussion        We have described two different formulations of the RM        for relating gene expression data to phenotypes The RM        provides a probabilistic model to describe the observed        gene expression patterns The first formulation can be used        for cancer class prediction and for identifying clusters        of genes with similar expression profiles that are related        to drug responses The method is based on a combination of        clustering analysis the RM and the regression analysis        The second formulation can be used for identifying        differentially expressed genes from different types of        sample We applied this method to a publicly available        leukemia dataset to demonstrate the application of the        proposed method for class prediction We also applied this        method to an analysis of the NCI data to show that the        method can also be applied to other phenotypes        The method introduced here has several advantages        First it provides a probabilistic model for describing the        gene expression patterns These models are used to reduce        the complexity of the raw data and offer a certain degree        of simplification In contrast to most of the currently        available methods for gene expression data such as        principal component analysis the model used here provides        a nonlinear method for dimension reduction Second        compared with traditional densitybased models the method        is more robust to outliers as it uses ranks rather than        actual expression levels There is a long sequence of steps        in the laboratory as well as in the image analysis before a        single number is produced for an expression level and        there are many potential sources of error Methods that use        ranks rather than the original measured gene expression        data are also advocated by A Tsodikov A Szabo and D Jones        unpublished data and Park         et al   Third in contrast to        clustering methods for simultaneously clustering both genes        and samples the modelbased approach allows formal        estimates of the variance and therefore facilitates formal        tests of null hypotheses and assignments of confidence        intervals        There are several limitations to the proposed approach        First in order to apply the RM the gene expression levels        are discretized It is clear that by discretizing the        measured expression levels we are losing information        Certainly additional information is present in the level        of gene expression but normalization or scaling errors        across subjects or slides make it difficult to determine        the precision of these numbers We believe that        discretization provides a reasonably unbiased approach for        dealing with this type of data For both the leukemia and        NCI datasets we fitted the RMs by discretizing the gene        expression levels into both four and eight categories and        obtained essentially the same conclusions Of course the        more categories we use the closer are the discretized data        to the real continuous data However this will introduce        more parameters to the model Second this approach assumes        that genes can be clustered into several subgroups based on        their expression profiles over samples This might not be        true for some studies In this case we can consider all        the possible clusters of genes in a stepwise regression        analysis as proposed by Hastie         et al   Third we used the        bootstrap resampling procedure to estimate the variance of        the regression parameter  after we have clustered genes        into several classes This procedure does not account for        possible variability associated with the clustering step        and therefore the bootstrap variance estimates are likely        to be underestimated        In our proposed method the clustering the Rasch        modeling and the regression analysis are done separately        Important research for the future is to take a joint        likelihood approach that can combine all three steps to        obtain better estimates of the number of clusters the        latent factors and the regression parameters This kind of        mixture RM provides a natural framework for unifying        statistical inference and clustering We are currently        carrying out research in this direction In conclusion we        demonstrate here the potential application of the RMs in        analysis of gene expression data RMs provide a probability        model for describing gene expression profiles measured over        different samples or over different times We are currently        exploring various other formulations of the microarray gene        expression problems in the framework of the RMs including        class discovery in cases of hidden taxonomies based on the        estimated latent factors using the RM
