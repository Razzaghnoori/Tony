 Background Recently DNA chip or microarray technology has been developed that allows researchers to measure the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously over different time points different experimental conditions or different tissue samples It is based on the hybridization of DNA or RNA molecules with a library of complementary strands fixed on a solid surface Oligonucleotide chips contain thousands of features with gene specific sequences about 25 bases long These oligos are then hybridized with labeled probe derived from a given tissue or cell line The resulting fluorescence intensity gives information about the abundance of the corresponding mRNA This is the Affymetrix DNA chip technology Alternatively cDNA can be spotted on nylon filters or glass slides Complex mRNA probes are reverse transcribed to cDNA and labeled with red or green fluorescent dyes This technique is often called the spotted array or cDNA array In both methods thousands of mRNA concentrations can be measured in parallel potentially revealing complex gene regulatory networks One important application of the microarray gene expression data in medicine is to study the relationship between tissue phenotypes and gene expression profiles on the whole genome scale The phenotype could be several different types of cancers 1 2 3 responses of cell lines to different chemical compounds 4 or time to tumor recurrence after treatment For binary phenotypes such as two different types of cancers the problem becomes the classification of patients samples It has been suggested that gene expression may provide the additional information needed to improve cancer classification and diagnosis 4 For continuous phenotypes such as drug sensitivity the problem of interest is to relate gene expression patterns to sensitivity to drugs and therefore aid in the process of drug discovery and provide a rationale for selection of therapy on the basis of the molecular characteristics of a patient s tumor From the statistical point of view the challenge is that the microarray gene expression data are often measured with a great deal of noise and that the sample size of tissues or cell lines denoted by n is usually very small compared to the number of genes in expression arrays denoted by p This results in the large p small n problem 5 Most current approaches to dealing with this problem first select genes that can best separate tissues of different types by performing univariate analysis The expression levels of these genes are then combined linearly in a weighted way to form compound covariates These covariates are then used in the standard regression models for model fitting and prediction West et al 5 proposed a Bayesian binary regression approach using the singular value decomposition to first reduce the dimension of the variable space p to the number of samples n They called the resulting linear combination of the expression levels of all the genes the expression of the supergenes All these approaches reduce the variable space by making one or several linear combinations of the expression levels of some or all of the genes Linear combination may not however be the best way of reducing the dimension of the variable space Another popular approach to analyzing gene expression data is to use clustering methods to simultaneously cluster both samples and genes in order to determine some clusters of genes that are mostly correlated with some clusters of samples Examples of such an application include analysis of gene expression data and drug response for the 60 human cancer cell lines of the National Cancer Institute NCI60 data 4 and analysis of cancerous and normal colon tissues 2 However the clustering approach is purely exploratory and requires an external similarity measure Methods that can be used to assess the significance of the clustering results are needed The Rasch model RM and its extensions 6 7 are an important staple of psychological research and are used in other fields such as sociology educational testing and medicine The idea of the RM is that one can indirectly infer a person s position on a latent trait from his her responses to a set of well chosen items For example the RM has been used to infer the quality of life of cancer patients from their answers to a well designed questionnaire 8 or to measure disability from activities of daily living 9 For these applications data are usually given in a matrix with rows being individuals and columns being responses to a set of items Microarray gene expression data are also given in a transposable matrix form with rows being genes and columns being samples and vice versa The RM can therefore be used to explain the observed patterns over different columns Here we propose two different formulations of the polytomous RM for analysis of microarray gene expression data The first formulation treats samples as persons and genes as items The idea is to infer several latent factors associated with a given sample on the basis of its expression profile over many genes We combine a model based clustering method 10 with the RM to define a small set of latent factors associated with samples For a given sample we assume that genes in the same cluster determine one latent factor associated with this sample and use the RM to estimate this latent factor for each gene cluster These latent factors are then used in a regression analysis of the observed phenotypes The rational of this approach is that genes of similar function yield similar expression patterns in microarray hybridization experiments 11 12 13 Co regulated genes may share similar expression profiles maybe involved in related functions or regulated by common regulatory elements 14 Therefore if genes are clustered together it is impossible from a statistical point of view to differentiate one gene from the other In this case a better way of studying these genes is to treat them as a cluster Consideration of genes in the same cluster can potentially reduce noise associated with a single gene The second formulation is to treat genes as persons and samples as items The idea is to infer several latent factors associated with each gene based on its expression levels across samples from different tissue or cell types This formulation provides simple summary statistics for genes based on their expression profiles over samples and helps to identify genes that are more likely be over or underexpressed within samples of the same type or between samples of different types We first briefly review some key ideas of the polytomous RM and its estimation We then present two different formulations of the RM for the gene expression data Details involved in these formulations are given We apply our proposed methods to the analysis of the leukemia dataset 1 and the NCI60 dataset 4 and conclude with discussion of our method Results The Rasch model RM The RM was originally proposed as an item response theory model in the psychological test or attitude scale 6 The idea is that the use of a test or scale presupposes that one can indirectly infer a person s position on a latent trait from his her responses to a set of well chosen items Assume that we have I persons and J items Let Z ij be the response of individual i to the item j where the response can take one from m 1 possible ordinal categories 0 m One version of the RM which we use in this paper called the partial credit model 15 assumes the probability of response h as 1 for i 1 I j 1 J and h 0 1 m where jl is the item specific parameter which expresses the attractiveness of the respective level l of item j i is the person parameter that expresses the latent factor of the i th person that is measured by the J items It is easy to verify that the probability of the response is monotonous in both person and item parameters For example for m 3 Figure 1plots the Rasch probabilities as a function of the value of the latent factor a for two sets of item specific values It can be seen from these plots that for a given item persons with larger value tend to have greater probability of expressing high scores and for a given person the response probabilities are different for items with different values To make the model 1 identifiable the following constraints are required Therefore there is a total of Jm 1 unconstraint item specific parameters The item parameters can be estimated based on the conditional likelihood given minimal sufficient statistics for the person parameters For a given person the minimal sufficient statistic is the sum of the category weights corresponding to the observed responses After the parameters are estimated the person parameters can then be estimated by maximizing the likelihood function Details on the conditional likelihood estimation of the item parameters can be found in Anderson 16 Relating gene expression profiles to phenotypes Outline of the approach Our goal is to infer several latent factors associated with each sample based on its gene expression profile and relate these latent factors to the observed phenotypes Using the terms of the RM we treat each gene as an item each tissue sample or cell line as a person and treat the expression level as the response of a given tissue to a given gene The unidimensional RM may not however hold for the complete set of genes generated by microarrays Here we assume that genes with similar expressions determine one latent factor and that the RM holds for each set of genes with similar expression profiles To identify genes with similar expression profiles over samples we first use the model based clustering method of Fraley and Raftery 10 to cluster p genes into K clusters based on their gene expression profiles over n samples Note that the cluster step is performed based on the observed continuous gene expression data not the discretized gene expression patterns For a given sample using expression profiles of genes in a given cluster we estimate a latent factor by fitting a RM These latent factors are then used in a regression analysis to study the relationship between the gene expressions and the phenotype The method allows to investigate whether a cluster of genes with similar expression profiles is related to the observed phenotypes and can also be used for future prediction by estimating the latent factors using the maximum likelihood estimation We give some details for each of these steps in the following sections Model based clustering analysis Cluster analysis based on multivariate normal mixture models 10 17 has been used for clustering various types of biological zoological financial and industrial data We first set up the mixture model for the gene expression data Let x j x 1 j x nj be the n dimensional vector of the j th gene expression over n samples We assume that the gene expression values of p genes x 1 x p arise from a mixture of K n dimensional Gaussian distribution with density 2 where the k is the probability that a gene belongs to the k th cluster and n X k k denotes the density function of the multivariate normal distribution with mean k and variance covariance matrix k Possible parameterization of the covariance matrix is discussed in Fraley and Raftery 10 Note that if we assume a simple covariance structure k I where I is the identity matrix and is the variance then the model based clustering method becomes the K means clustering method 18 Treating clustering as a mixture model problem allows us to use the EM algorithm to estimate the probability of a given gene belonging to each of the K clusters and to estimate the corresponding mean vector and covariance matrix for each cluster 10 One advantage of this approach is that it allows us to obtain an estimate of the number of gene clusters Following Fraley and Raftery 10 we propose to use the Bayesian inference criterion BIC 19 for selecting the number of gene clusters BIC is defined as BIC K 2 L K n K log p where L K is the maximized log likelihood n k is the number of independent parameters to be estimated in the K cluster model and p is the sample size number of the genes We will choose K that gives the maximum BIC K value As the first step of our approach we cluster genes into K clusters using the model based clustering method described above where the number of gene clusters K is determined by maximizing the BIC scores Let C k denote the genes in cluster k and p k denote the number of genes in this cluster for k 1 K Rasch model and regression analysis We fit a RM model as in equation 1 for genes in each of the K clusters respectively treating samples as persons and genes as items To fit the RM equation 1 for genes in the k th cluster we let i be the sample index and j be the gene index for i 1 n and j 1 p k and let i ik in model 1 be the latent factor for the i th sample which is determined by the genes in the k th cluster and jl be the gene specific parameter for the j th gene The RM assumes that the variation of the gene expression patterns observed over different samples is due to a latent factor and it provides a probabilistic model to describe the gene expression pattern for a given sample Let ik be the maximum likelihood estimate of the latent factor for the i th sample determined by the genes in the k th cluster Let i i 1 iK be the vector of the estimated latent factors based on the gene expression profiles for the i th sample In general we can relate the phenotype y i for the i th sample to the estimated of latent factors i by a regression model 3 for i 1 n where is the vector of regression parameters i is the error term and the actual model of the regression function f and the distribution of the error depend on type of the phenotype If the phenotype is a continuous variable linear regression can be used if it is a binary variable logistic or probit regression can be used and if the phenotype is survival time the Cox regression model can be used Alternatively the generalized linear model can be used One advantage of the proposed method is that we can model the interactions between the latent factors in the standard way of modeling interactions in the regression models As only the estimated and not the observed latent factors are available in the regression model equation 3 the variance of the estimate of the parameter has to be corrected We propose to use a two step bootstrap resampling procedure 20 to estimate the variance of the estimate of the parameter in the regression model First within the k th gene cluster we resample genes and re estimate the ik parameter by fitting the RM 1 Second for a given set of estimated parameters we resample the n samples from y i i for i 1 n and fit the regression model equation 3 to obtain a new estimate of We can then estimate the variance of with these resampled estimates Prediction For a new sample with gene expression x new x new 1 x new p these p genes are first divided into K clusters according to the clustering result For a gene j in cluster k we first discretize its expression level into one of the m 1 categories using the cut off points used in the discretization step denoted by z new j We can then estimate the corresponding latent factor k by maximizing the following likelihood function 4 where jh is the estimated gene specific parameter for gene j in the k th cluster based on the training sample Using the estimated vector of the latent factors the regression model 3 can then be used for predicting phenotype Y new RM for latent factors associated with genes The second formulation of the RM for gene expression data is to treat genes as persons and samples as items Assume that we have gene expression data of p different genes indexed by i over n k samples of the k th sample type indexed by j for k 1 K Note that the indices i and j are used differently from the previous sections We are interested in identifying genes that are expressed differently among these different sample types Here each gene has its own expression patterns over different samples For gene i we can estimate a latent factor ik based on its gene expression profile over n k samples from the k th sample type by fitting the RM equation 1 for k 1 K In this formulation of the RM we treat genes as persons treat samples as items and treat each gene s expression level over samples as the responses In RM 1 I p and J n k i ik which is the latent factor for the i th gene determined by the samples of the k th type and jl is the sample specific parameter This model assumes that the variation of gene expression patterns across different samples among different genes is due to several gene specific latent factors Here the latent factor ik can be interpreted as some quantities related to the transcription factors of the i th gene which determine the gene expression levels in samples of the k th sample type For a given tissue or cell line type k genes with larger estimated latent factor ik tend to have higher expression levels than those with smaller estimated latent factor For a given sample type k the estimated latent factors 1 k pk provide a nice way to order genes based on their expression levels over a small number of samples of sample type k and to identify genes that are relatively over or underexpressed in the k th sample type In addition by comparing the estimated latent factors associated with genes across different sample types we can identify genes that are differentially expressed among different tissue or cell line types Analysis of the leukemia dataset Classification using cluster RM We applied the proposed approach to the problem of classifying acute leukemias Acute leukemias can broadly be divided into two classes acute myeloid leukemia AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ALL that originate respectively from cells of myeloid or lymphoid origin The two diseases appear identical under the microscope However correct diagnosis is critical as they respond best to different treatment regimens Golub et al 1 used a set of 38 leukemia samples including 11 AML and 27 ALL as training samples set and used an additional 34 samples 14 AML 20 ALL as a test set for testing their proposed method for class prediction In our analysis we combined both the training and the test datasets into a dataset of 72 samples 25 AML and 47 ALL For each of the 72 samples the gene expression data were extracted from Affymetrix expression arrays We first selected the subset of 3 571 genes based on an initial processing adopted by the authors of the leukemia study The expressions summarized are the log base 10 values of the actual expression levels following this initial filtering and transformation We then select 50 genes that are mostly over expressed in AML and 50 genes that are mostly overexpressed in ALL by using the Wilcoxon rank sums test This simple rule of selecting a smaller set of genes are also used in Golub et al 1 using slightly different tests As expected the model based clustering method assuming the common covariance matrix clusters these 100 genes into two clusters with 50 genes in each cluster The left plot of Figure 2shows the gene expression levels of these 100 genes for the 72 leukemia samples Clearly these 100 genes are highly differentially expressed between the two types of the leukemia samples Given the 100 genes selected methods such as principal component analysis partial least square regression or composite covariate predictor can be used to further reduce the gene dimension to two or three dimensions by taking linear combinations of the gene expression levels Instead of taking linear combination of gene expression levels we first discretize the expression levels of all the 100 genes over 72 samples into four categories using the quantiles as the cut off points Therefore for each gene their expression level can take one of four possible values of 0 1 2 and 3 The same analysis was also done by discretizing gene expression levels into eight categories the results were essentially the same In the following we only present the results using four categories Fitting two RMs to these discretized gene expression levels we estimate two latent factors for each sample one latent factor is determined by gene expression profiles of 50 genes in one cluster the other is determined by the gene expression profiles of 50 genes in another cluster The right panel of Figure 2shows the estimated values of these two latent factors for all the 72 samples This plot shows that the two leukemia types are well separated by these two latent factors with no overlap except that two leukemia samples one from ALL group and the other from AML group are close to each other in this two dimensional space Discriminant analysis using these two latent factors would expect to perform very well in classification We performed a leave one out cross validation analysis to estimate the misclassification rate Specifically we leave one sample out and first estimate the sample specific latent factors ik for the i th gene for k 1 2 and gene specific parameter jl using the remaining samples We then estimate the latent factors of the left out sample by maximizing the likelihood function Equation 4 Fisher s linear discriminant analysis using the estimated latent factors was then used to classify the left out sample The above procedure was applied to each of the 72 samples and resulted in a misclassification rate of 2 72 3 We use this example to demonstrate that two latent factors carry most of the information of the gene expression levels of the 100 genes Summary of gene expression profiles In order to study the difference of the gene expression profiles between the ALL and AML samples we fit two RMs treating genes as persons The first model uses the ALL samples as items and the second uses the AML samples as items Therefore for each gene we obtain two latent factors one based on the gene expression profiles of ALL samples the other based on the gene expression profiles of AML samples Figure 3plots the estimated latent factors for each gene together with the 99 point wise confidence intervals From these two plots we conclude that the gene expression levels of most of the genes genes with 99 confidence intervals containing zero are not significantly different in both AML and ALL samples For the ALL samples 189 genes expressed at lower level and 164 genes expressed at higher level compared to the rest of the 3 753 genes For the AML samples 92 genes were expressed at lower level and 94 genes at higher level compared to the rest of the 3 920 genes In order to see the difference of gene expression between ALL and AML samples the two estimated factors are plotted on the left in Figure 4 Genes in the upper left quadrant tend to have higher gene expression level in AML but lower expression level in ALL On the other hand genes in the lower right quadrant tend to higher gene expression level in ALL but lower expression level in AML The logarithm base 10 of the gene expression levels of these genes are plotted on the right panel in Figure 4 Clearly these genes are differentially expressed between the two type of the samples Further examination indicates that all the 100 genes identified by the Wilcoxon rank sum test are included in these genes Analysis of NC160 dataset Relating gene expression profiles to drug activities Scherf et al 4 reported the use of cDNA microarrays to assess gene expression profiles in a set of 60 human cancer cell lines that have been characterized pharmacologically by treatment with more than 70 000 different drug agents one at time and independently This dataset offers us a unique opportunity to relate variations in gene expression to the molecular pharmacology of cancer The NCI60 set includes cell lines derived from cancers of colorectal CO seven cell lines renal RE eight cell lines breast BR eight cell lines ovarian OV six cell lines prostate PR two cell lines lung LC nine cell lines and central nervous system CNS six cell lines origin as well as leukemias LE six cell lines and melanomas ME eight cell lines In this analysis we consider only the 90 drug subsets whose mechanisms of action is putatively understood and their activity data are available from the Web We used the 1 376 gene subset along with 40 individually assessed targets for the present analysis These subset was selected by selective filters used in 4 These 90 drugs are listed in Table 1of 4 They applied the clustering methods to cluster cell lines basing on both gene expression profiles and the drug expression profiles The phenotype of interest is chemother apeutic susceptibility as measured by log GI 50 where GI 50 measures the dose needed to cause 50 growth inhibition We first cluster the 1 476 genes using the model based clustering method described previously using the original data of the log ratios The BIC scores in the upper left panel of Figure 5indicate that there are four gene clusters with 307 312 323 and 474 genes in each cluster respectively As a comparison we also applied the hierarchical clustering method to cluster these genes The dendrogram shown in the upper right plot of Figure 5also indicates four gene clusters For each cell line a latent factor is estimated using the RM based on the gene expression levels of the genes in each of the four clusters To fit the RM we discretize the gene expression levels into four categories using the quartiles The same analysis was also done with eight catagories and the results are the same The lower left plot of Figure 5shows the levels of these four latent factors sorted by cancer types In general cell lines with the same origin tend to have similar levels of the latent factors therefore these factors can be used for discriminating among the nine different cell lines However for the third latent factor the cell lines MDA MB 435 derived from the pleural effusion of a patient with breast cancer and its Erb B2 transfectant MDA N have similar levels to those of latent factors estimated for the melanoma cell lines To verify the utilities of these latent factors in clustering cell lines we performed the hierarchical clustering analysis based on these four factors see lower right plot in Figure 5 We note that the two breast cancer cell lines are clustered together with melanomas Hierarchical clustering analysis using all the genes also resulted in clustering these two cell lines with melanomas In general cell lines of the same origin are clustered together on the basis of the four latent factors estimated with the RM The clustering result of the cell lines using these four factors are similar to the clusters obtained using all the genes see 4 Each of the 60 cell lines is now characterized by four different latent factors where each latent factor is estimated based on the expression profiles of the genes in each of the four clusters It would be interesting to relate these four latent factors to the drug activity patterns as measured by log GI 50 across the 60 cell lines For a given drug we first performed a simple linear regression analysis treating the drug activity as response variable and using one of the four latent factors as a predictor and obtained the parameter estimate of in the following model drug activity x latent factor The left panel of Figure 6shows the estimated value together with point wise 99 confidence interval for each of the 90 drugs using one of the latent factors as a predictor The variance of the regression parameter and the 99 confidence interval was estimated using the bootstrap procedure where 50 resamples of genes in each cluster and 50 resamples of samples were used For each latent factor greater positive parameter estimate implies that higher gene expression level in a given gene cluster corresponds to a higher drug activity For a given latent factor drugs with 99 confidence interval of the estimated parameter not including zero are those whose activities are related to genes which determine this latent factor In order to relate the drug activity of a given drug to all the four latent factors we performed multiple linear regression analysis where drug activity for a given cell line was treated as a response variable and the four latent factors were treated as the predictors The right plot of Figure 6shows the estimates of the parameters in the multiple regression model for each of the 90 drugs This plot can be used for selecting drugs that are related to gene expression profiles For example only drugs with at least one large parameter estimate are important for further study as only for these drugs their activity levels are related to gene expression profiles Identifying genes differentially expressed in different cell lines It is also interesting to identify genes that are over or under expressed relative to other genes for a given cell line type Using the RM we treat genes as persons and cell line samples as different items and estimate the latent factor for each gene based on its expression profiles over all the samples of a given cell line type Figure 7shows the estimated latent factor for each gene based on the gene expression profiles over each of nine different cell lines These estimated latent factors provide a summary of gene expressions over different cell lines Clearly the gene expression profiles are different across different cell line types For a given cell line type we can also infer which genes are over or underexpressed compared to other genes based on the estimated latent factors Figure 8shows the estimated latent factor and the point wise 99 confidence interval for each gene for each of the nine cell line types For a given cell line genes with 99 confidence interval of the estimated latent factor not including zero show significantly different expression from those genes with 99 confidence interval of the estimated latent factor including zero For example for breast cancer cell line the method identified 15 genes or expressed sequence tags ESTs that are relatively overexpressed the estimated latent factor is greater than zero and is significant at the 0 01 level and 23 genes or ESTs that are relatively underexpressed estimated latent factor is less than zero and is significant at the 0 01 level in the breast cancer cell lines Table 1lists the known genes Interestingly we note that genes that are overexpressed include p53 and genes that are underexpressed include that for tumor associated antigen CO 029 On the basis of our analysis all other genes have similar gene expression level in the breast cancer cell line Genes that are over or underexpressed in other types of cell line can be similarly identified Discussion We have described two different formulations of the RM for relating gene expression data to phenotypes The RM provides a probabilistic model to describe the observed gene expression patterns The first formulation can be used for cancer class prediction and for identifying clusters of genes with similar expression profiles that are related to drug responses The method is based on a combination of clustering analysis the RM and the regression analysis The second formulation can be used for identifying differentially expressed genes from different types of sample We applied this method to a publicly available leukemia dataset to demonstrate the application of the proposed method for class prediction We also applied this method to an analysis of the NCI60 data to show that the method can also be applied to other phenotypes The method introduced here has several advantages First it provides a probabilistic model for describing the gene expression patterns These models are used to reduce the complexity of the raw data and offer a certain degree of simplification In contrast to most of the currently available methods for gene expression data such as principal component analysis the model used here provides a non linear method for dimension reduction Second compared with traditional density based models the method is more robust to outliers as it uses ranks rather than actual expression levels There is a long sequence of steps in the laboratory as well as in the image analysis before a single number is produced for an expression level and there are many potential sources of error Methods that use ranks rather than the original measured gene expression data are also advocated by A Tsodikov A Szabo and D Jones unpublished data and Park et al 21 Third in contrast to clustering methods for simultaneously clustering both genes and samples the model based approach allows formal estimates of the variance and therefore facilitates formal tests of null hypotheses and assignments of confidence intervals There are several limitations to the proposed approach First in order to apply the RM the gene expression levels are dis cretized It is clear that by discretizing the measured expression levels we are losing information Certainly additional information is present in the level of gene expression but normalization or scaling errors across subjects or slides make it difficult to determine the precision of these numbers We believe that discretization provides a reasonably unbiased approach for dealing with this type of data For both the leukemia and NCI60 datasets we fitted the RMs by discretizing the gene expression levels into both four and eight categories and obtained essentially the same conclusions Of course the more categories we use the closer are the discretized data to the real continuous data However this will introduce more parameters to the model Second this approach assumes that genes can be clustered into several subgroups based on their expression profiles over samples This might not be true for some studies In this case we can consider all the possible clusters of genes in a step wise regression analysis as proposed by Hastie et al 22 Third we used the bootstrap resampling procedure to estimate the variance of the regression parameter after we have clustered genes into several classes This procedure does not account for possible variability associated with the clustering step and therefore the bootstrap variance estimates are likely to be underestimated In our proposed method the clustering the Rasch modeling and the regression analysis are done separately Important research for the future is to take a joint likelihood approach that can combine all three steps to obtain better estimates of the number of clusters the latent factors and the regression parameters This kind of mixture RM provides a natural framework for unifying statistical inference and clustering We are currently carrying out research in this direction In conclusion we demonstrate here the potential application of the RMs in analysis of gene expression data RMs provide a probability model for describing gene expression profiles measured over different samples or over different times We are currently exploring various other formulations of the microarray gene expression problems in the framework of the RMs including class discovery in cases of hidden taxonomies based on the estimated latent factors using the RM
