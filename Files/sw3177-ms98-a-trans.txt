                 does tend to get  talked about a lot and one of the things that i like to bring up when taxation comes about or the how theyre collected is uh you know government wants to control and and rightfully so in some instances what we do with our money it it does enable them and those who have a good handle on our economic system to encourage investment by giving you a tax break if you invest properly you know things like that i can understand especially for people who are uh young and getting into a knowledge of the economy and and   but do we get a tax break for correct investments we get taxed on whatever we make on our investments   well i think i think years ago i think it used to i think the concept was good and i think that that those kind of things are all right   but we dont have that anymore do we   i no not uh not near to the extent that it was   i didnt think so theyve even cut you know who can have an IRA   right   that was to encourage you to save for the future and to you know save for your retirement and now theyve cut out you know the amount that you can have in it and that seems unfair   right i usually use that as a preface to you know its okay that the government used to do that or should do that as far as the good incentive good incentive but since theyre not doing it as well now i would be more in favor of uh not taxing anything directly in other just do straight purchases in other words if if you want to put a tax on what you buy then revenues can be generated that way   but they already tax us i mean where we live  its eight almost eight and a half percent tax   people well right but couldnt they live off of only that or if they took away the other taxes and built in what it took to make up the difference there        and the the rationale behind doing that is taxing only purchases if you notice most people tend to spend what they make   oh and then some  and then some   and then some so then youd have a tendency to be taxing uh pretty much across the board if you only made twenty to thirty thousand a year youd probably only spend X amount of that you know a small portion of that on taxable goods you know you still wouldnt tax groceries and you still you know decide whether you want to tax housing   are you talking about doing away with income tax   doing away with everything except for yeah all forms all forms of it including   i dont think well were already doing a tax on you know a sales tax i dont think that would generate enough money   well youd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent   oh i see what youre saying what do you think of just about a a straight percentage um   yeah so if you took the money out of one   off of the income with no deductions and and no no loopholes and and no gimmes and everybody pays say five percent period   well your problem in there is how do you get i mean you get people that dont report income now so if they dont report income then you wouldnt get that percentage   well if theyre not reporting the income now theyre still not paying it so whats the point   if if well if if its left in the hands of the grocer he doesnt care whether you know this guy giving him the money you know pays taxes or not but hes going to have to pay that percentage see what im saying   no   well when a guy comes in to you know hes got a hundred thousand dollars and he buys a hundred dollars worth of groceries   umhum   he pays fifteen percent tax lets say   right   and if the poor guy comes in and pays a hundred dollars worth of groceries he pays fifteen percent tax   right   so both guys paid it because the grocer was in essence collecting it   right   and the hundred thousand dollar guy could not in any way hide what he purchased because the grocer doesnt want to hide it for him whereas the hundred thousand dollar guy could tell the government he only made fifty thousand dollars and its up to the government to prove him wrong   oh i see what youre saying but if we had to have an income tax which theyre never going to get rid of what about instead of this graduated the more you make the more you pay   see so im saying theres   what about having a straight across the line income tax just a flat thing and do away with all the deductions i realize all the CPAs and   right  right   HR Blocks would be out of  of a job but uh   so you you tax yeah you tax per body and and then if you made more you got to keep more yeah thats a rational way to do it   yeah i never have understood why they dont do that   yeah it it does seem   and no one can explain it to me   it does seem fair it does take away all their ability to control which you know initially they they had some good ideas but they dont seem to be following them anymore   no no   so   i dont know i i guess theres never a an answer nobody ever asks   thats true thats true not being an economy major i guess theyd never ask me anyway     they dont ask me at all      oh   i always thought a straight percentage though would make a whole lot more sense because some of the people who make the most they have so many quote deductions by the time they get through with their deductions they dont pay anything   right   and i question their i i i just think that theyve made it almost a joke all the deductions in the the way you can send
