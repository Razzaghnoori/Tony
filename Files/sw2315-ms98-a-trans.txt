 okay it says what kind of car would you buy next what kind of car would you buy next well we ve been thinking about buying a van because it d be nice to uh pack the kids and the dog in and yeah a lot of people are you going to buy one of those minivans or you going to buy a full size well i don t know uh a friend of ours let us borrow their full size van last year we took a trip across cross country and it was really nice uh but they are harder to drive because they re so much bigger was the gas mileage decent or we got about eighteen miles a gallon oh that s not bad yeah it wasn t that bad and uh but they are big and they re kind of hard to drive uh definitely next car we ll get will be a used car because we can t afford a new car they re so expensive well oh i ve never i ve really never had a new car i mean i m pretty young so but a lot of people they go out and buy new cars yeah you know i ve i ve been employed for ten years so i i have enough money to go out and buy a new one but instead i go out and buy toys and things oh um but yeah yeah see my situation s really different because i always had an older brother that always worked on cars and he got into business and he only worked on one kind of car is that right yeah and what happened is he his he had a business and they and they bought a lot of cars a lot of the same kind of cars what ended up he eventually had his own private junkyard which is terrible to look at very illegal but it was very cheap for us to run our cars because pretty much everyone in the family and there s seven of us kids would have one i mean me and my husband have the same kind of car my brother and his wife drive the same kind of car my sister has the same kind of car and my father has the same kind so it s you know when we get together and go places yes and we meet places it s like gee you guys don t like one kind of car do you it s a very strange car i don t know you if you have them down there but it s a Saab oh yes i ve seen them yeah they re not that popular down south i don t i maybe it s something to do with the front wheel drive and they re supposed to be good in snow but they re very popular up here in Vermont and a lot of people used to bring his car their cars that might be i don t know yep to him to get them fixed because he was he was really good at it and uh he didn t charge as much as the dealer so and he also was really nice to people and that s the way to go he d help them out a lot if they were broke down he d try to go fix their car on the road instead of calling the tow truck so that saved them a lot of money yeah yeah one thing i like to do is is go to a police auction and get a car because i ve heard you can get pretty good deals but you have to be kind of patient because you can t always just go in and get something right away like like like the Dallas Police Department has a car auction every Monday morning from like nine till twelve yeah i ve heard that that s a really good way to get cars up here they they only come around like once a year in the summertime they have a state auction but but they don t um they don t repossess that many cars up here figure in a big metropolitan area there would be a lot of uh where they repossess they uh take their cars for illegal activities you know it yeah because Dallas is a pretty big area we got i don t know a million people or a million and a half people or something can imagine you have a good you have you could have a good uh choice of cars but then of course there s more people interested in them too that s true huh i don t know but i know someone who goes to Massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they probably they might have been stolen and yeah the insurance company buys them and they sell them and i ve known people who have got really nice late model cars very cheap but but they have a dubious background they have salvage stamped on their title there s is that right yeah there one of my friends got one that the the whole underneath the car the frame was twisted hum and they didn t really know it it was a real nice late model car real pretty on the outside but they couldn t keep tires on it it kept eating the tires yeah but if you can get a good deal you know if you can save five thousand dollars five thousand dollars buys a lot of tires yep i know a lot of people who ve boughten other cars the same way and and have done very well yeah one thing about i mean i the my car that i drive came out of um a salvage yard but i see see it wasn t um wasn t in an accident it had burned the whole inside of it burned the wire and cable burned and of course my brother being the clever person he was had an identical car but it had been in an accident oh boy huh huh so we took the wiring harness out and the engine and the transmission and everything else and we put it into the the the shell that was burned we had the shell all sandblasted and painted and he he pretty much built me a car so that s a pretty good deal yeah i was i was pretty happy i got what i pretty much wanted i could have had it any color i wanted i think the next car we get too might also be one of those uh import kinds because i don t trust American made cars now i don t think they have the quality and that s that s too bad because i mean i have to keep the money in the country but on the other hand with my money i m spending i want to get something that s worth my money that s true but you know i always thought American cars weren t any good but i uh rented a car i rented a Ford Taurus and i was impressed i really liked it uh huh is that right yeah and uh i was talking to my older sister the other day and uh she said she had to get a new car and they were thinking of getting something big enough she s got two teenage kids and they go camping a lot yeah and she was thinking of getting a Ford Taurus wagon she says they re not very pretty but like she was really impressed but i liked them a lot because they resembled the Saab when i got inside the door was big you know it wasn t it wasn t like a Volkswagen Rabbit you know i i mean it had a full size door handle on it and it was the interior yeah that s right was very plush and padded it it was just i liked the car a lot and when you shut the door it made a real solid sound yeah that s nice yeah and the performance it you know it it you could make it do anything on the interstate you wanted that s nice so i was really impressed if i if i didn t have have if i didn t buy uh used Saabs you know if i didn t have a father and a brother that help me out i would even think about buying something like a Ford Taurus as opposed to a Volkswagen Rabbit or a Toyota um hum but that s one thing about cars my husband wants a Toyota pickup truck and i can t talk him into a Dodge pickup truck or a Chevy pickup he wants a Toyota pickup truck and they are they re very popular and i guess they run yeah uh huh they they you they just keep running and running and running they have a really good track record yeah i knew a guy here had a a Nissan pickup truck and he had like a hundred and twenty thousand miles on it and only had to change the oil never had a problem with it yeah i know this this this person they go they have this old Toyota truck and he goes yep i say you know this thing s been running for me for two years he goes boy i wish i had the money to treat it right i m like what do you mean he says i haven t tuned it up in two years and i change the oil about every four months because he can t afford to um change the oil as often as as he would like and he can t afford to tune it up yeah yeah so it it s amazing even when you abuse them yeah my wife s brother had a he lives in California and he had a Honda Accord i think and he had like a hundred fifty thousa nd miles on it and he sold it and uh never had a problem with it whereas i got a Chevette and it s the car s almost almost twelve years old and i got seventy one thousand miles on it is all and i ve had problems with it just all the time all the time yeah well i i have problems with my car i m not saying it s not perfect or anything but i wouldn t trade my Saab for anything i i bet now isn t that isn t that a Swedish car yeah or Norwegian or something it it s a Swedish car i m just being stupid and sentimental it s just because it s about the only kind of car i ve ever had i had a Volvo once you know it s like if i had to go out if i to buy a truck i could i could go out and easily buy a truck but i d have a hard time going out and buying another car if it wasn t a Saab i don t know yeah well how did you like your Volvo um it was it was fine but it was an old one and um uh huh it was pretty much it uh uh was something that i bought to resell because it was really uh it was a nice old Volvo and at that time i was going to college and i liked to go camping and bajaing and going up dirt roads and i was ruining the car so i sold it and i saved some money by buying a junkier Saab that i could beat around yes so it it worked out pretty well i ve never had problems really getting getting cars it s it s refusing them because uh people always come to my father and brother and try to sell their old cars to them because they know that they deal and sell them yes my father s very shrewd with them that s that s a pretty good deal i always told my wife that if i had to do it over again i would uh have my own car dealership and used car dealership and uh she d be be a travel agent that way if i needed another car i just go get it and whenever we wanted to go someplace we just get tickets for a real good discount and take off yeah that s a good way to do it um the thing about it is you got to you got to like to work on cars to be a mechanic if you want to be involved and that s a hard job yeah yeah it is well i you know i always dream of buying a new car but yeah i don t it just the money just isn t worth that that shininess yeah who can afford twenty thousand yes they re very expensive i mean even
