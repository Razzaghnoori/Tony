 The Third Way vs Having It Both Ways Afternoon Brent Thanks for your message First things first please call me Tamar After all we re having breakfast and effectively lunch together all week long More interesting still on this at least we don t seem to disagree all that much Maybe we should dine together more often As you can see even though I write about politics I don t really relish or even like the battle part of it It s sappy I know and maybe because I m a girl or a rationalist but I always want people to find common ground and settle on some middling third way solution That s why I think of myself as a New Democrat I ve also been known to vote liberal Republican which I gather you do not like And as you suggest it s what New York s left leaning political establishment Congressmen Jose Serrano and Charles Rangel and the rest really don t like about Hillary Sure these people are unhappy that she didn t come to them to kiss their rings and inquire before she took a stand on any issues they claim to care about But more than that what they really can t abide and you don t like so much either I gather is that she isn t going to turn out to be the all or nothing never compromise hard core leftist candidate many people have always expected she would be So I should be pleased right Well not so fast Because I don t think she s a New Democrat either she s certainly no credit to the New Democratic movement I m sometimes drawn to New Democrat doesn t just mean political opportunist It doesn t mean tacking and trying to have it both ways as Hillary is indeed trying to do and her husband has been doing for years now Unlike these two opportunists and others like them politicians who truly occupy what s sometimes called the vital center find a way to go beyond ideology with practical problem solving positions that borrow from both sides and appeal to voters across the spectrum When it s done right it s not about hedging It s about real political creativity and the much needed balancing of conflicting political interests And it usually ends up alienating political regulars on both sides of the aisle True enough I concede in advance there aren t many pols out there who actually live up to this standard but let s not give the vital center a bad name by pretending that it s no more than dishonest tacking As for Hillary well I m not a big fan of those lefty ideological positions that Rangel Serrano et al hoped she would champion but in the end I would have respected her more for that than for the unprincipled hedging that you so rightly point out is apparently going to be her hallmark All these years I thought she was urging Bill to stick to his left wing guns But now it turns out she s the one who s been arguing all along that the administration should trim and hedge and give voters whatever it is they seem to want Nancy Reagan s advice was Just say no Hillary s is apparently Just say anything as long as the public wants to hear it It s going to be a great campaign to watch and write about but I agree with you following her is going to make us all dizzy Whoops It s almost cocktail hour and I m going on as if it were still breakfast Let s talk tomorrow about the two parties appeal for minority voters Looking forward to it whatever it is All best Tamar
