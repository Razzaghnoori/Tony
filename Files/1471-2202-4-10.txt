 Background It was originally thought that GPCRs and tyrosine kinase receptors functioned independently to mediate different signaling events but it has become clear in recent years that some functions and signaling pathways are shared for reviews see Marinissen and Gutkind 2001 1 Luttrell 2002 2 and van Biesen et al 1996 3 For example some classical neurotransmitters such as 5 HT have short term effects on ion channels and other effectors such as adenylyl cyclase but also have growth factor like effects in developing brain 4 and mitogenic effects on fibroblasts reviewed in Gerhardt and van Heerikhuizen 1997 5 The peptide hormones insulin and IGF 1 have both short term metabolic effects and long term actions on cell growth and differentiation Insulin and IGF I bind and stimulate tyrosine kinase receptors which interact with a large number of effectors 6 7 Complex interactions occur between these two types of signaling pathways that are the subject of intense investigation The 5 HT 2C receptor displays a heterogeneous distribution in the CNS 8 and is not found in peripheral tissues It is abundant in choroid plexus where it modulates the production of cerebrospinal fluid CSF and in limbic regions and hypothalamus where it may play a role in motor behavior and appetite control The 5 HT 2C receptor has been implicated in anxiety migraine movement disorders eating disorders and neuroendocrine regulation 9 The importance of the 5 HT 2C receptor in regulation of food intake is evident in a knockout mouse developed by Tecott et al 10 The obesity found in these mice is due to excessive food intake and this phenotype along with increased plasma levels of insulin and leptin is analogous to Type 2 diabetes The knockout mouse is also susceptible to epileptic like seizures suggesting that the 5 HT 2C receptor has a role in tonic inhibition of neuronal excitability 5 HT 2C receptors and insulin IGF 1 receptors share some functional roles both have trophic effects in the brain and modulate appetite 5 HT 2C receptors 8 and insulin IGF 1 receptors 11 co localize in several areas in the brain including choroid plexus olfactory bulb cerebral cortex hypothalamus and hippocampus Interactions between insulin and serotonergic pathways may have important consequences for their known roles in appetite modulation and trophic actions in the brain We chose to look for these types of interactions in choroid plexus because both 5 HT 2C receptors and insulin IGF 1 receptors are abundant in this tissue and because the 5 HT 2C receptor is the only 5 HT receptor present in these cells The 5 HT 2C receptor is a member of the GPCR family GPCRs stimulate heterotrimeric G proteins which release activated G and G subunits to interact with a variety of effectors The function of GPCRs is tightly regulated by phosphorylation by second messenger activated kinases protein kinase A and protein kinase C and G protein coupled receptor specific kinases GRKs Arrestins bind phosphorylated receptors and further down regulate receptor activity by inhibiting G protein interaction It is well known that GPCRs can regulate the activity of tyrosine kinase MAP kinase pathways However there is little evidence for reciprocal regulation MAP kinase effects on GPCR function Here we report such evidence insulin mediated MAP kinase regulation of 5 HT 2C receptor activity Results Effect of insulin signaling on 5HT 2Creceptor function in choroid plexus cells We examined the effects of insulin signaling on 5 HT 2C receptor function in isolated rat choroid plexus cells Activation of 5 HT 2C receptors in choroid plexus stimulates phosphoinositol hydrolysis 12 and increases intracellular calcium 13 We measured changes in intracellular calcium in response to serotonin 5 HT with the calcium indicator fura A robust increase in intracellular calcium was seen in response to 5 HT Fig 1aand 1c and this response could be completely blocked with the selective 5 HT 2C receptor antagonist mesulergine data not shown The response to 5 HT was significantly attenuated 40 inhibition when choroid plexus cells were treated with insulin before superfusing serotonin Fig 1band 1c Pretreatment with PD 098059 a MEK inhibitor blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin Fig 1c but had no effect on the serotonin response when used alone These data indicate that insulin inhibits 5 HT 2C receptor activity and MEK is an obligatory component of insulin s action implicating the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway Characterization of the mechanism of insulin s effect on 5HT 2Creceptor function in Xenopus oocytes To delineate the mechanism of insulin s action on the 5 HT 2C receptor we used the Xenopus oocyte expression system Oocytes contain endogenous insulin and IGF 1 receptors 14 They also have many of the proteins in the RAS and MAP kinase pathways which have been implicated in cell cycle control and re entry into meiosis 15 16 We expressed two GPCRs a serotonin receptor 5 HT 2C and an M1 muscarinic acetylcholine Ach receptor Both receptors utilize G proteins for signaling they stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis and increased phospholipase C activity which leads to transient activation of a Ca 2 dependent Cl current in the oocytes Activation of either receptor can cross desensitize the other suggesting that they share the same G protein pathway To determine the effect of insulin receptor or IGF 1 receptor activation on GPCR s cells were treated with insulin or IGF 1 The Cl currents elicited by subsequent 5 HT or Ach stimulation were compared with those without insulin IGF 1 treatment As shown in Fig 2 treatment with insulin or IGF 1 resulted in a significant reduction of the peak Cl current in response to 5 HT but did not affect the response to Ach Insulin alone did not induce an ionic current under these conditions data not shown Insulin treatment did not affect the general characteristics of the Cl current induced by 5 HT or Ach i e a depolarizing current with a rapid transient peak and slower oscillatory phase Figs 2aand 2b top Instead insulin specifically reduced the peak Cl current in response to 5 HT by 83 compared to untreated controls 1513 138 nA vs 261 78 nA Fig 2a middle with no change in the magnitude of the Cl current in response to Ach 2681 281 nA vs 2785 186 nA Fig 2b middle Similar to the effect of insulin IGF 1 treatment specifically reduced the magnitude of the Cl current in response to 5 HT by 56 1665 222 nA vs 737 181 nA Fig 2a bottom without affecting the response to Ach 1275 272 nA vs 1220 243 Fig 2b bottom These data indicate that the inhibitory effect of insulin IGF 1 is specific for the 5 HT 2C receptor Insulin and IGF 1 receptors activate several different regulatory proteins including RAS MAP kinase PI3 kinase S6 kinase and protein tyrosine phosphatase 6 7 17 Initiation of this transduction cascade requires the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of the insulin IGF 1 receptors To determine whether or not tyrosine kinase activity was required for the action of insulin IGF 1 the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein was used As shown in Fig 3a in oocytes pretreated with genistein before IGF 1 administration the reduction in 5 HT induced Cl current was abolished whereas genistein treatment alone had no effect on the 5 HT response in oocytes not treated with IGF 1 The insulin IGF 1 pathway diverges into RAS dependent and independent paths To identify which path is involved an anti RAS antibody that can neutralize RAS activity was injected into oocytes before IGF 1 treatment This RAS antibody Y13 259 has been shown in oocytes to block the re entry into meiosis or germinal vesicle breakdown induced by IGF 1 18 Antibody injection blocked the effect of IGF 1 on the 5 HT response Fig 3b demonstrating that the inhibitory effect of insulin IGF 1 was RAS dependent RAS activates a cascade of kinases including RAF MAP kinase kinase MEK and MAP kinase The involvement of this pathway in regulation of 5 HT receptor function was examined Pretreating cells with PD 098059 a specific MEK kinase inhibitor 19 blocked the effect of IGF 1 on the 5 HT response whereas inhibition of protein kinase C did not Fig 4a These results suggest that MEK is involved in mediating the inhibitory effect of the insulin IGF 1 pathway MEK s primary role is activation of MAP kinase through threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation of MAP kinase which in turn phosphorylates and regulates the function of several nuclear proteins such as transcription factors as well as cytosolic and membrane associated proteins such as the insulin and EGF receptors To determine whether MAP kinase is involved in mediating the insulin IGF 1 effect activated MAP kinase 20 was injected into oocytes before testing the 5 HT response Active MAP kinase reduced the 5 HT response by 56 compared to untreated controls Fig 4b demonstrating that active MAP kinase is capable of mimicking the inhibitory effect of insulin IGF 1 on the 5 HT 2C receptor The 5 HT 2C receptor contains a putative MAP kinase site 21 at serine 159 in the second intracellular loop between the 3rd and 4th transmembrane domains To ascertain whether MAP kinase directly modulates the receptor function this amino acid was changed to alanine by site directed mutagenesis As shown in Fig 4c insulin no longer inhibited the peak Cl current activated by the mutant receptor S159A indicating that serine 159 is likely the site of MAP kinase modulation Discussion The 5 HT 2C receptor is a member of the G protein coupled receptor superfamily and one of over 30 cloned serotonin receptors Except for the 5 HT 3 receptor which is an oligomeric ion channel all serotonin receptors are GPCRs and are divided into seven subfamilies based on sequence homology gene structure and signaling pathways 22 23 The 5 HT 2C receptor like other members of the 5 HT 2 family stimulates phospholipase C and increases IP 3 and DAG which leads to increased intracellular calcium and mediates many cellular processes In general 5 HT 2 receptor types are growth regulatory and stimulate cell division However unlike the 5 HT 2A 24 and 5 HT 2B 25 receptors the 5 HT 2C receptor is not known to activate MAP kinase The 5 HT 2C receptor activates multiple signal transduction cascades in vivo and in heterologous expression systems see Raymond et al 2001 22 and Gerhardt and van Heerikhuizen 1997 5 for reviews In choroid plexus the 5 HT 2C receptor stimulates PI turnover increases cGMP formation and activates Cl channels In heterologous expression systems the 5 HT 2C receptor can couple to two different K channels 26 and in some cases either activation or inactivation of adenylyl cyclase has been demonstrated in addition to the well known activation of phospholipase C and PI turnover The regulation of the 5 HT 2C receptor has been the focus of several studies but the results have been difficult to interpret for several reasons including the complex pharmacology of this receptor The presence of spare 5 HT 2C receptors 27 in choroid plexus has also complicated the study of desensitization in vivo However it has been demonstrated that denervation of 5 HT neurons supersensitizes 5 HT 2C receptors 28 in choroid plexus suggesting that these receptors are under tonic control by 5 HT In primary cultures of choroid plexus cells repeated 5 HT application desensitizes 5 HT induced increases in intracellular calcium 13 Down regulation of receptor binding sites in choroid plexus cells is seen after agonist treatment 29 However inverse agonists can either down 29 or up regulate 30 5 HT 2C receptor binding sites dependent upon cellular context The mechanisms underlying desensitization or down regulation of the 5 HT 2C receptor are unknown but these reports suggest finely tuned control of 5 HT 2C receptor function and density Several studies have utilized heterologous expression systems to identify mechanisms of 5 HT 2C receptor regulation Phosphorylation most likely has a prominent role in regulation of the 5 HT 2C receptor Westphal and colleagues 31 demonstrated that the 5 HT 2C receptor exhibits basal phosphorylation and that agonist treatment was associated with increased phosphorylation and receptor desensitization in transfected cells The expressed 5 HT 2C receptor exhibits homologous and heterologous desensitization in oocytes 32 mediated by protein kinase C 33 34 35 A calmodulin dependent kinase may also be involved in homologous desensitization 36 In contrast a recent study indicates that neither PKC nor calmodulin dependent protein kinase II are involved instead desensitization of the 5 HT 2C receptor is dependent on GRK activity 37 Interestingly tyrosine kinase involvement in the agonist mediated phosphorylation of the rat 5 HT 2C receptor has also been reported 38 although as yet no report has shown that the 5 HT 2C receptor directly activates tyrosine kinases The 5 HT 2C receptors are subject to another form of regulation by means of mRNA editing 39 RNA editing 40 is a type of posttranscriptional modification that occurs when double stranded RNA deaminase converts genomically coded adenosines to inosines thereby changing the coding sequence of specific RNA transcripts RNA editing of the rat 5 HT 2C receptor was first described by Burns et al 39 and editing at four nucleotide sites alters three amino acids within the second intracellular loop RNA editing of the 5 HT 2C receptor is conserved among species 41 and at least 7 major isoforms with tissue specific expression patterns have been described in rat brain 39 suggesting a functional importance The mouse cDNA clone used in our study codes for the fully edited form Val157 Ser159 Val161 of the receptor The putative MAP kinase site Ser159 we identified and mutated in this study is also a site of mRNA editing in this receptor i e Ser159 is only present in edited forms The fully edited rat 5 HT 2C receptor exhibits reduced agonist efficacy or ability to interact with G proteins compared to the unedited receptor Ile157 Asn159 Ile161 in transfected cells 39 Interestingly 5 HT elicits a larger response see Fig 4c in cells expressing the mutant receptor S159A compared to the fully edited mouse receptor and the mutant receptor is not regulated by insulin Binding of radiolabelled mesulergine was similar in the edited 5 HT 2C and S159A mutant receptors in transfected cells data not shown These results suggest some intriguing possibilities Either the mutant receptor S159A couples more readily to G proteins compared to the fully edited 5 HT 2C receptor or the edited Ser159 containing receptor may be phosphorylated to some extent in the basal state We hypothesize that the phosphorylated receptor may couple less efficiently to G proteins but this hypothesis remain to be tested Our results indirectly suggest that 5 HT 2C receptors containing Ser159 may be subject to yet another form of regulation i e phosphorylation by MAP kinase The 5 HT 2C receptor is very abundant in choroid plexus 8 42 and is the only 5 HT receptor present on these cells Choroid plexus cells line the cerebral ventricles form the blood CSF barrier and are responsible for the production of cerebrospinal fluid CSF 43 Although the mechanisms have not been delineated the 5 HT 2C receptor is thought to regulate CSF production and the expression of transferrin For example upon intraventricular injection 5 HT 2C agonists decrease the production of CSF 44 and in primary cultures of choroid plexus 5 HT agonists increase the expression of transferrin 45 46 an iron carrier protein which has trophic effects on the brain In addition choroid plexus expresses insulin IGF I and IGF II receptors 11 47 as well as large amounts of IGF II that is secreted into the CSF 47 CSF contains insulin IGFs and 5 HT 48 in concentrations high enough to activate their respective receptors in choroid plexus suggesting that this signaling mechanism may occur in vivo It has been suggested that 5 5HT 2C receptors in choroid plexus may be tonically activated due to CSF 5 HT concentrations near the EC 50 thus tonically inhibiting CSF production Our data suggest that insulin may reduce 5 HT 2C receptor activity thereby increasing CSF production and decreasing transferrin production As a consequence insulin inhibition of 5 HT 2C receptor activity may change the volume and composition of CSF and indirectly may alter the concentrations of many potentially important signaling molecules in CSF MAP kinase regulation is potentially an important mechanism of modulating GPCR function however the prevalence of this type of modulation is unknown Our results suggest that the 5 HT 2C receptor is a MAP kinase substrate whereas the M1 Ach receptor is not The optimal consensus site for MAP kinase phosphorylation isPro X Ser Thr Pro however in some cases the upstream Pro is not required and a minimal sequence of Ser Pro or Thr Pro is phosphorylated for review see Davis 1993 21 The 5 HT 2C receptor site is just such a minimal sequence of Ser Pro and it is the only MAP kinase site we identified within the receptor s presumed intracellular domains This site is not conserved within the M1 Ach receptor or other 5 HT 2 type receptors Although all of these receptors contain Ser Pro or Thr Pro sequences within intracellular domains it is difficult to determine the importance of these sites For example despite the fact that insulin did not inhibit Ach receptor signaling in our experiment the rat M1 Ach receptor contains several MAP kinase sites including one Thr Pro sequence in the 2 ndintracellular loop and 3 Ser Pro and one Thr Pro in the 3 rdintracellular loop The reason for this apparent discrepancy is unclear but may be related to a spare receptor phenomenon in the oocyte expression system Alternatively additional sequence or regulatory elements which have not been identified may be required for MAP kinase phosphorylation Determining the prevalence and specificity of MAP kinase modulation of GPCR s will await future studies Conclusions Taken together our results demonstrate that insulin IGF 1 signaling down regulates 5 HT 2C receptor function in choroid plexus and Xenopus oocytes via MAP kinase and that the 5 HT 2C receptor is a substrate for MAP kinase To our knowledge this is the first description of MAP kinase regulation of a GPCR and suggests that this form of regulation may be more wide spread than has been previously recognized Furthermore since some GPCRs can modulate MAP kinase activity MAP kinase regulation of GPCR function may then serve as a form of negative feedback control in much the same way that protein kinase A protein kinase C and the G protein coupled receptor kinases GRKs regulate GPCRs Methods Chemicals and Reagents Cell culture reagents and enzymes including MEM HAM s F12 D
