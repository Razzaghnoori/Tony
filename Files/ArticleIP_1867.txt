 Hunter S Thompson The release of the movie Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and its attendant publicity have revealed what may be a surprising fact to some Americans Hunter S Thompson is alive Thompson so belongs to a bygone era that he probably should have had the good sense to die along with it Years of self destructive living have taken their toll but he remains with us 60 years old mumbling shambling drunk stoned and addled Thompson is a useful icon to have around For right wingers he s a visible casualty of 60s sybaritic excess for rebellious kids he s a token or is that toke of nostalgia for more exciting times The implied question in most criticism of the Fear and Loathing movie is Why on earth did we ever think this crap mattered The book and movie chronicle Thompson and his lawyer s drug fueled invasion of Las Vegas in 1971 Critics have admired the film technically but have deplored Thompson s vision Fear and Loathing s psychopharmacological obsession is dated and dull further proof that drugs are not only destructive but banal The two lead characters are vicious crude solipsistic and adolescent All in all it s a bad memory of a silly time in American history a relic of a national embarrassment But the criticism does injustice to Thompson Now is the worst possible moment for a Thompson revival This is a tranquil era and considered in tranquility Thompson is indeed a horror His writing seems archaic and crude and its self indulgence seems stunning even in an age of memoirs Thompson is often compared unfavorably with his New Journalism comrade Tom Wolfe Wolfe is undoubtedly a better writer than Thompson but he s also an easier writer Wolfe has worn well because his detached irony suits us His cool style is ours Wolfe responded to his lunatic age with bemusement Thompson responded to it with ferocity and ferocity is not comfortable these days Between 1967 and 1973 when Thompson was he wrote with crazed out of control phantasmagoric violence But he was living in crazed out of control phantasmagoric violent times A nation that had been placid suddenly raged with race riots and assassinations manipulated by a crooked villainous president and trapped in a terrible war Thompson an idealist was appalled He reacted to madness by writing and behaving madly A quarter century later the prose looks deranged and it is But it came by its derangement honestly Thompson s first gonzo piece the mishmash of raw notes and vitriol that became his trademark was a feral account of the Kentucky Derby It was not intended to run in raw form but according to the most appealing account Thompson was so horrified by the Kent State massacre which occurred while he was writing that he was unable to make his notes into a coherent piece Thompson s notoriety has also overshadowed his fine early style Hell s Angels and the two Fear and Loathing Las Vegas and On the Campaign Trail 72 books seethe His words club and bully Thompson s screeds and ad hominem attacks are worthy heirs to H L Mencken As much as any writer of his generation Thompson shook American political writing from the coma of the 50s His savage profane descriptions of Nixon his mockery of Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey his characterization of any enemy as a Nazi or the fourth Reich or the sixth Reich enlivened and yes debased political debate Click for a couple of examples When Dan Burton calls Clinton a scumbag he owes a tip of the cap to Thompson But if the young Hunter is being rejected too easily the elderly Hunter is being welcomed too kindly In a certain segment of lefty society Thompson has become a much revered elder The current image of Thompson is that of a hilarious endearing old goat who s coasting out his three score and ten He doesn t merit such niceness Thompson has more than just squandered his talent what prodigy doesn t he has betrayed himself He s a romantic who has become a cynic He was once filled with passion Now he fakes it for money Thompson of course is not the only 60s vet who is disillusioned But he gave no quarter to anyone who disappointed him so he certainly doesn t deserve any quarter from us now Today Thompson is part Beavis part whore He still behaves like an adolescent moron He s a freakish Peter Pan the juvenile delinquent who wouldn t grow up He ignites kegs of dynamite in his Aspen Colo backyard To ring in the new year in 1997 he reportedly blew up a Cadillac He gropes female guests watches porn drinks monstrously smokes more and uses drugs There s something unbearably sad about a 60 year old man who still takes drugs Thompson s real problem isn t that he indulges himself it s that he s lazy He once called himself with a flash of perfect insight a mean lazy hillbilly Thompson used to be a fabulous reporter He reported masterfully on the 72 campaign and the Hell s Angels He exaggerated and lied but he was there he befriended weirdos and freaks made common cause with the dregs of society stirred trouble listened At some point in the 70s Thompson realized he didn t need to bother He was a celebrity Thompson s writing retreated from the outside world He hasn t had a new thought for 20 years A shocking number of his recent articles are based on something he saw on television Thompson is no longer Hunter S Thompson He performs a Hunter S Thompson routine Doonesbury s Duke character is not the only Thompson cartoon Thompson himself is a Thompson cartoon He works himself into a fake froth does some calculated halfhearted gonzo writing then collects a fat check He has become as repetitious pontificating and slothful as the worst D C pundit as ridiculous as the political reporters he mocked in Fear and Loathing On the Campaign Trail 72 Thompson poured acid on Nixon because he honestly believed Nixon was a devil He pours acid on Clinton because well that s what someone pays him to do Editors though fewer and fewer of them still shell out top dollar for this Hunter S Thompson routine Colleges still pay for his slurred mangled speeches His books are still astonishingly best sellers even his wretched new ones Apparently there are enough 18 year old book buyers in the first flush of marijuana to keep Hunter in tequila and narcotics for the rest of his life In 1967 a 14 year old kid wrote Thompson a fan letter saying that Hell s Angels had inspired him to join a motorcycle gang An alarmed Thompson replied by telling the boy to do his own thing not imitate others and warning him about what was wrong with the Angels The best of the Angels the guys you might want to sit down and talk to have almost all played that game for a while and then quit for something better The ones who are left are almost all the kind who can t do anything else and they re not much fun to talk to They re not smart or funny or brave or even original They re just Old Punks and that s a lot worse than being a Young Punk They re not even happy most of them hate the lives they lead but they can t afford to admit it because they don t know where else to go or what else to do That s what makes them mean That is what Thompson is today an Old Punk not smart or funny or brave or even original And he sure doesn t know what else to do Click to read about Thompson s glory days and for two of his political profiles
