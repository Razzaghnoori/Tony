 Background The prevalence of negative school behaviors remains a significant health problem in the U S 1 For example with respect to behaviors that contribute to intentional injuries according to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey 36 6 of high school students reported having been in a physical fight in the past month with 14 8 of the fights occurring on school property 3 5 were injured in a physical fight and five percent of students missed school because of feeling unsafe 1 Results of studies attempting to reduce such aggressive behaviors in schools have been mixed A school based violence prevention curriculum reportedly reduced self reported aggressive behaviors among middle school boys in 2 of 6 classes only 2 On the other hand an 18 session violence prevention curriculum 3 resulted in decreased frequency of self reported violence and other problem behaviors in 6 thgrade boys but not in girls 4 Few studies have focused on observable behavioral outcomes and findings have been mixed 5 Students for Peace a multi component violence prevention project with 9000 middle school students failed to reduce fights at school and absenteeism due to feeling unsafe at school 6 Violence prevention education has been reported to reduce suspension rates 7 It has been hypothesized that the high prevalence of negative school behaviors is in part due to greater exposure to chronic psychosocial stress e g inadequate economic resources family disintegration information overload media violence 8 9 10 11 Self reported feelings of anger have been shown to be predictive of aggression in youth 12 The escalating prevalence of anger and violence in youth has been associated in part with increased levels of anxiety and stress 13 School systems are increasingly interested in reducing negative school behaviors however they have had difficulty identifying programs that are effective and easy to implement on a broad scale 14 Given the urgent need and the readiness of school boards to address these needs the testing and implementation of promising intervention programs is of great urgency One approach to the growing problem of school related conduct problems may be to provide skills in stress reduction Few studies have examined whether stress reduction programs improve school behavior in youth Research suggests that behavioral stress reduction via the Transcendental Meditation TM program may hold promise in the improvement of school related behaviors in youth Research has demonstrated that TM produces improvements in mental health including reduction of various forms of psychological distress such as depression anxiety hostility and emotional instability 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 TM has been shown to reduce aggression 22 and to increase overall relaxation in adults 23 Black college students and adults increased significantly on an overall mental health factor and showed a greater reduction in self reported anxiety and neuroticism after one year of TM practice 24 Although findings have not been entirely consistent 25 improved academic performance has been reported in high school students practicing TM 26 and in African American college students practicing a simple meditation process 27 In a medium sized chemical manufacturing company with employees practicing TM over a six year period days lost through illness or injury decreased by 50 per cent and absenteeism declined by 89 per cent 28 These findings suggest that examination of the effects of TM on improving school related behaviors in youth is warranted This study was part of a larger study examining the impact of stress reduction via TM on high normal blood pressure levels in adolescents The results of this study on blood pressure have been reported previously and indicated a beneficial impact of TM on cardiovascular functioning at rest and during stress 29 This is the first report of a controlled trial of stress reduction via TM as a means of improving school related conduct behaviors In the present study African American youth with high normal blood pressure BP were randomly assigned to either a 4 month TM program experimental group or a health education control group Based on previous findings it was predicted that youth who practiced TM would exhibit greater decreases in school absenteeism rule infractions and days suspended from pre test to 4 month post test than controls Methods Procedures Measurements Permission to conduct the study was granted by the Superintendent of Richmond County Public Schools and the Medical College of Georgia Human Assurance Committee All pre and post intervention assessments testing was conducted at the Georgia Prevention Institute of the Medical College of Georgia After consent and assent forms were signed subjects completed an expectation of benefits questionnaire and parents completed a demographic information form Subjects completed the Spielberger Anger Expression Scale 31 as well as measures of lifestyle and environmental stress including television viewing before and after the 4 month intervention period 32 A Detecto CN220 scale with height rod Cardinal Scale Manufacturing Corp Webb City MO was used to measure the height and weight according to standard protocol 33 Suspension rates The number of days suspended before and during the 4 month intervention was determined from school records The change in the number of days suspended between the period 4 months before intervention and the 4 months during the intervention period was the primary outcome measure Suspension categories specific to violence included fighting classroom disruption as well as other categories involving high risk behaviors such as illegal absences disregarding commands excessive tardies and leaving campus without permission Tardies and Absenteeism The accumulated numbers of tardy and absentee class periods in the 4 month intervention period were compared with the 4 month pre intervention period Grades The grade percentage achieved at the end of the 4 month intervention period was compared with that of the 4 month pre intervention period Rule infractions A separate measure of rule infractions total number of infractions as defined by the Augusta Richmond County Board of Education such as dress violations excess tardies disruptive classroom behavior fighting was determined from the school records The number of rule infractions during the 4 month intervention period was compared with the number of rule infractions during the 4 month period before the intervention Interventions Stress reduction The rationale for the selection of TM rather than a standard meditation technique is that TM is by far the most studied mental relaxation technique 23 The TM technique has been described as a simple mental procedure practiced for 15 min twice a day while sitting comfortably with eyes closed 34 The TM technique has its origin in the ancient Vedic approach to health 35 and does not require changes in personal belief lifestyle or philosophy 36 No mental effort is required toward intentionally altering physiological processes e g respiration rate muscle relaxation etc The ordinary thinking process becomes quiescent and a distinctive state of psycho physiological restful alertness a wakeful but deeply restful state is gained 37 38 The TM technique was taught by a certified TM instructor using the standard seven step program presented on consecutive days The first and second steps are introductory and preparatory lectures presented in a group The third and fourth steps are conducted individually and consist of a personal interview and instruction The remaining three steps are verification and validation of the practice and are presented in a group format Health Education Control A didactic series of lessons was presented focusing upon the role of weight management diet and physical activity in the prevention of essential hypertension and their beneficial influence upon blood pressure and other CVD risk factors based on National Institutes of Health guidelines on weight loss diet reducing salt and sodium intake and increasing physical activity See http www nhlbi nih gov health prof heart index htm Subjects attended daily 15 minute school sessions during the 4 month intervention period Statistical analyses The comparability between the two groups at pre and post intervention on all sociodemographic and anthropometric variables e g age weight height was assessed via a series of 2 intervention group TM vs CTL by 2 time pre vs post intervention repeated measures analyses of variance ANOVA with time as the repeated measure Absentee periods grade point average tardies and days suspended were analyzed as dependent variables using 2 intervention TM vs CTL by 2 time pre vs post intervention repeated measures ANOVAs Anger in anger out and anger control were analyzed as dependent variables using 2 sex male vs female by 2 intervention TM vs CTL by 2 time pre vs intervention period repeated measures ANOVAs Gender was included in the analysis due to previous reports of gender differences in self reports of anger coping styles 39 Results Descriptive characteristics Descriptive characteristics of the TM and CTL groups are presented in Table 1 There were no significant main i e group time or interaction effects for any parameter all ps 10 indicating the groups did not differ significantly at pre intervention in any anthropometric or demographic parameters The groups did not differ at pre intervention in expectation of benefits p 10 Compliance From the attendance monitored at sessions at school and self reports to document meditations at home which included 240 possible school and home meditation sessions a determination of average compliance of the TM group for twice daily practice was calculated as 71 6 Compliance ranged from 5 8 to 97 4 with 15 25 subjects determined to be greater than 70 compliant

the first clinical trial examining the impact of a behavioral stress reduction intervention on a quality of life related issue school behavior in youth This study examined the impact of a four month participation in the TM program on absenteeism rule infractions and suspension rates in adolescents with high normal BP The findings were not attributable to baseline differences in anthropometrics since the TM and control groups were similar on these parameters at pre and post intervention and both groups were similar in their expectations of health benefits at pre intervention Evaluation of impact of possible moderators such as exposure to environmental stress i e neighborhood stress showed no differences between the groups All subjects resided in the same geographical locale i e lower socioeconomic status neighborhoods and none participated in any formal lifestyle programs during the intervention period besides school sports and or physical education Counterbalancing interventions between schools controlled for school to school variations in which unknown characteristics of a particular school population or policies of operation could have differentially impacted implementation of the protocol A previously reported beneficial impact on cardiovascular functioning was shown by decreases in systolic blood pressure from pre to post intervention in the TM group compared to controls 29 The TM group also exhibited greater decreases in systolic blood pressure reactivity to acute laboratory behavioral stressors 29 These physiological benefits are corroborated with behavioral and psychological benefits in the present study The present findings compare favorably with the results of another skills based approach upon conduct related behaviors Changes in suspension status among 1523 high school students was compared across groups exposed to school based violence prevention Those exposed in a class specific violence prevention education intervention showed a 71 reduction in suspension rate 7 The present study showed a reduction in suspensions of 83 during the 4 month intervention Improvement in overall mental health factor and reduction in anxiety and neuroticism in African American college students was previously shown after one year of TM practice 24 These findings are encouraging and indicate a combination of anger management conflict resolution skills testing and stress reduction may be particularly beneficial and need to be examined The present study extends previous findings with incorporation of a randomized controlled study design and use of documented records of behavior rather than typical self report data which are open to the problem of social desirability Counterbalancing treatment assignment by school decreased likelihood of within school intervention contamination owing to potential inter subject interactions and unanticipated between school differences Efforts were made to provide comparable instruction time and attention at school to both groups Similar to the present findings previous findings using health education as a control reportedly did not impact the attitudinal or behavioral preferences for non aggressive conflict resolution among 6 thgrade students 40 One strength of the intervention is that the TM technique was taught in a standardized manner by a qualified TM instructor Subjective meditation experiences were monitored by the TM instructor via self reports and additional instruction was provided when necessary Daily group TM practice in the presence of the instructor facilitated successful practice The present findings are supported by other TM studies which have shown reductions in aggression 22 anxiety 41 stress related neuromodulators such as cortisol 42 and blood pressure 43 in Caucasian American adults Since the present study was conducted in inner city public high schools with African American students with high normal blood pressure empirical evaluation is needed to determine if the findings may be generalizable to other students Although the present findings are promising there are several limitations of the study First the limited sample size and duration of evaluation was not long enough to provide sufficient frequencies of occurrences for several measures such as specific categories of suspension rates such as physical fighting weapon carrying and drug possession A similar sample size of 34 subjects was sufficient to demonstrate the impact of TM on blood pressure and cardiovascular reactivity to stress in adolescents 29 Second a follow up evaluation beyond that of the 4 month intervention to determine whether the TM effect was sustained or if students reverted to negative behaviors was not conducted Future studies should attempt to determine the mechanisms responsible for the impact of TM on school related conduct problems and attendance by assessing possible changes in perceived negative affective and or behavioral impact of stressors and or utilizing mock conflict evoking scenarios to determine possible changes in behavioral response patterns Conclusions The TM group exhibited a decrease in absentee periods rule infractions and suspension days due to behavior related problems compared to the CTL group The findings also indicate a potential beneficial impact upon anger expression in African American females The successful implementation of the intervention suggests the feasibility of school based stress reduction programs in efforts to improve both physical and behavioral risk factors in youth Competing Interests None
