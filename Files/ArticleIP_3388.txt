 The Vanishing By Joe Osterhaus posted Wednesday Aug 13 To hear the poet read The Vanishing click Awful that when Frank O Hara died his close friends raced to stop his familyfrom taking his unpublished manuscripts so jimmied his apartment door to findoblivion already settling like a coiled flailon the dirty dishes clothes unopened mail As they rummaged through the pleated filesand squeezed new music from the notices what did this say of his allegiances just how impermanent they were A lifespent thinking in the theaters drinking inlike cherry soda with mind numbing fizz America s slow vanishing whose pacewas doubled not restrained by celluloid The summer nights on Fire Island proppedon hard liquor like driftwood in a scuttle the winter nights in violin backed chairs the slender tenors with their pompadours at charity events it all broke down packed up and slipped away with the winched kickof a stage set knocked down by ball peen hammers The tragedy was that his familyhad final right to claim him in the endand not the dry eyed poets in the pews who never tried to see their world in hisor how he d bled the neon of its light Just as he frightened the dolorous traditionand scatted new echoes from the mossy wells we still fall short of his ideal republicwhere we won t have to buy appliances Set sail on that ocean liner sheeras a glacier with moonlight churning below and in the ballroom take your tall seat at the bar as the ship glides from the confetti docka generation dons its clothes then vanishes and staring at the hard dew on your glass you intuit the eons that glitter and passto each side of the glacier as it movesand lift your eyes the only passenger you watch as the ballroom dopples and becomesthe inside of the glacier flawed but bright ora brick wall under a fire escape at night or the moon held in the curved arms of a bridge
