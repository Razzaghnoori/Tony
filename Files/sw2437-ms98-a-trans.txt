 are are you a uh a TIer uh no no i work there as a temporary oh really but are you at TI oh yeah so you have to do the random drug testing oh yeah yeah in in in fact with me uh this is uh it s not much to talk about i i m so much for it i don t really have much to comment about it uh there s been some interesting subjects that they ve called how many times have you called or have you been participating in this uh oh about ten ten or eleven calls oh you got ten well you you ve passed me up this is about six times yeah uh um as contract person we have to do random drug testing too so yeah it doesn t bother me i don t feel like it s really a violation of privacy or anything no i think it s good in fact uh i don t know what the statistics were but i think that they were very surprised to find it so low i think they were expecting it to find uh like the national average at TI and i think it was tremendously down i think as far as the number of drug users you mean or people huh yeah as as far as the number of people that they actually found that were drug users but i think that uh i was well you had when i was at TI of course we had all the information before they started right and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rela rehabilitation programs and i think that s what helps you know that that you know warning when you have a drug program uh you know the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs actually go and then uh usually a lot of them uh partake in uh some of the benefits of of rehabilitation and everything so right yeah so that s real beneficial for the company and the employee yeah our our numbers have been way down i don t know what they were oh when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person and so we had when we sent temporaries to TI we had to have them drug tested and we did have a couple of cases where we really yeah the person said that they hadn t used anything and their test came back positive and normally we didn t retest them but there were a couple people that we really thought that they were telling the truth and we retested them like the next day and they came back negative oh really the second time so that that s the only thing i think that might be a little bit of a problem oh yeah you re that s a good point but at TI they before they had the testing i ve forgotten it seems seems like it s a year ago September something like that they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government and and that of course that s critical just as the point that you re brought up that whoever does your testing has got to be you know have a lot of quality control that they keep track of everything they don t make mistakes that would be terribly embarrassing right for someone to really come back positive and they were not and i haven t heard of any now i m not in personnel or anything yeah but uh they say that there it s almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and and they re not you know in other words there s very few mistakes and that of course has got to be critical it s got to be if you have a drug testing program it s got to be with a very very good agency you don t just have you know some local uh group do it it s got to be a a a highly qualified agency right yeah not just some doctor s office somewhere no you don t want to do that it s got to be you know a laboratory that do quality control and and double check and i think that TI has has latched themselves up with an established group and and that would be true for any company that does it and and not to have a just a very casual thing it s got to be with a you know first class totally independent agency not local of course ours i think well i think it was in in the south somewhere but it wasn t even in Dallas you know the one that did us yeah oh really huh do you do they um have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive or do they fire them right away or oh no no they re not fired they there are they have one chance to then go in a program if you come back positive you have one chance to go in and go into they have a lot of uh rehabilitation both for alcohol and for drug use uh and they have uh a lot of uh they they have an agency where you can go for personal problems financial or whatever right and so they they they they don t no it s not firing first it s uh definitely try to encourage people to rehabilitate in fact they again before you go you know that s that s why i said when they first started it they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and if you may have taken drugs go ahead and and get rehabilitated first and and and they won t even say anything about it you know oh sure right i think that s really good i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something oh sure oh yeah no that that s not right it s really uh an illness or whatever you want to say that it is you know it s a weakness and all and who who all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another and i think that uh those people that have that and and however they got into it i have children i always worry about the the classical thing that you see on TV where the drug uh pushers give it to the kids for free you know and get them sucked in and then they sell it to them you know the classical thing is to give it away or i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party and they slip it to them i i don t know i don t even have that much knowledge to know right whether that would uh get them addicted or not you know that that s a real worry yeah some of the stories you read about cocaine that s like people try it one time and they re addicted my husband is a counselor and he works with mostly with adolescents oh you know a lot about it then yeah so yeah i hear a lot of horror stories about things like that but most of the time it s no they get into a wrong crowd first and then they start a drug problem yeah it s usually not a one time accidental thing i don t think yeah i know i i m glad of that and i have uh knock wood had uh pretty good luck with or very good luck with my daughters so far i know that they re not on it that s my phone i i i have one daughter still at home one s at UT and one s at home gets dozens of calls a night yeah oh uh no no no no no i i i don t care about that that that she she ll be on the phone all night yeah well i ll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that um yeah uh it seems just if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are that s best way to avoid trouble from what i can gather right do you have children no not yet we re expecting a baby in July so we re starting from yeah oh great oh fantastic fantastic experience i ve got two as i said i ve got one in at UT now in Austin and one at home and uh i always say that i ve learned so much more from them than i than ever taught them yeah yeah it s a uh fantastic experience you can t oh we re really excited about it oh yeah you you know one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing like on a Saturday morning if they ve been out at a party Friday night and yeah you re not too sure what s going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor s office and get them checked the the key thing that i think uh we try to do is that bring all the friends over here have our house as a place where they can come at any time so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they re always over in someone else s house so our we ve been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and right uh huh yeah i think that s a really good thing to encourage and then you can kind of keep an eye and you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want but at least you see what s going on and uh you always have your house welcome then then your children ll think that uh you know you re cool parents and all that you know right well well good luck with your your expected uh baby there uh my wife was yelling in my ear was talking in my ear she said uh reminded me to say that uh they re very cheap until they get get to start dri ving oh well thanks uh huh and we have one of course i say in college driving and and one going to drive this summer so uh kids are cost you practically nothing because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything but you wait until they go and get a car insurance and you and that s when they get expensive as they get older you know uh it it yeah yeah they they cost you practically nothing from one to five and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons but uh it s well worth it and everything gets worse yeah uh yeah i think it ll be neat be great it s a great experience really you still there okay i thought that was cut off there but yeah yeah yep i m still here well good you know i don t have much to say about drug testing uh well i can t think of no i can t think of anything else to say about that either so you you ve done this ten times yeah okay did you get did you get the booklet on as to get the gifts and all that uh no i i don t work for TI so i get cash oh okay well i i didn t know what they re they were going to do they sent us a little booklet i just got it a week or so ago saying you know so many calls will be something a prize and everything right yeah there s yeah well that
