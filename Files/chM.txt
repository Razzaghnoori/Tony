 Machismo Machismo describes a stereotypic image of a Chicano Latino man who is extraordinarily aggressive stresses dominance over his wife and family exhibits physical and sexual prowess and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity Chicano social scientists have authored studies about machismo noting that it is a stereotype often used against Chicanos to blame them for their underclass social position in American society Macho literally means male and machismo is the concept of maleness but in American culture it has come to mean an exaggerated masculinity A masculinity associated with violence self centeredness chauvinism or alcoholism is not a macho concept recognized by most Chicanos For Chicanos un hombre macho is a man who symbolizes dignity takes care of his family has respect for all women especially his mother and possesses a strong sense of self identity and character Many Chicanos grew up influenced by Mexican movies with characters like Pedro Infante Cantinflas Antonio Aguilar and Jorge Negrete as men who sang to the beautiful girls and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality These were positive images of machos The famous Mexican folklorist Vicente Mendoza has stated that the concept of machismo and the word macho were not prevalent in Mexican corridos ballads and popular culture until the 1940s Supposedly the word gained popularity after Avila Camacho became president of Mexico because in ballads macho easily rhymed with Camacho In an article published in 1975 Jos Armas describes machismo as a mode of behavior necessary for an individual to live life with integrity self reliance and dignity He states Machismo is a personal code of honor that is self imposed in a world devoid of universal moral law or justice It is maintained and sustained by individual pride and dignity 56 A Latino men s group calling themselves Hombres Latinos was formed in California with the purpose of redefining the image and concept of machismo This was reported in a Los Angeles Times article in 1992 written by Christopher Heredia The group is organized on the the compadrazco system meeting regularly and holding yearly retreats Their definition of the Macho is 1 He who is dignified 2 He who is a protector 3 He who is responsible 4 He who is nurturing 5 He who is spiritual 6 He who is faithful 7 He who is respectful 8 He who is friendly 9 He who is caring 10 He who is sensitive 11 He who is trustful 12 He who provides Tello ca 1988 For some Chicanos machismo is an emblem that symbolizes resistance to social and historical control Excessive masculinity is seen by some as adaptive behavior in situations where Chicano men feel racial oppression and discrimination The idea of exaggerated masculinity has crept into American popular culture and language so most Americans have an idea of the meaning of machismo and we find it regularly used by the media For instance the Marlboro Man is viewed as a macho man strong and independent as he rides his horse herding cattle This was a model that many young men grew up trying to emulate but this symbol is no longer acceptable to modern American society See also

or bad eye is commonly known as the evil eye It may also be called mal de ojo or just ojo It is a syndrome a folk illness believed to be transmitted by certain individuals witches some think who have a special power Mal ojo may be transferred by a peculiar person who gazes at a weaker person a woman or a child and the ill effects are felt immediately Socially it can indicate that a person has been more familiar with another person than social and cultural manners permit The glance or power of a stronger person causes an adverse consequence on the weaker person who is often a baby or a child The fear of mal ojo also indicates that mothers and other adults are distrusting of a person who acts in a more familiar way than is culturally appropriate It is thought that people with weak blood sangre liviana are more susceptible to receiving mal ojo The symptoms of mal ojo are vomiting diarrhea loss of weight and sometimes even death Witches can deliberately give someone the evil eye other times it is done unintentionally by persons who just happen to have a powerful gleam A person may give another the evil eye because of a feeling of jealousy or covetousness If a person covets or is envious of a child he or she may give that child the evil eye Preventive measures that may diminish the possibility of a child getting mal ojo are to touch the child s cheek or make the sign of the cross on the child s forehead Sometimes the evil eye may be undone and the illness avoided if the person who cast the glance pats the person s head or temples immediately relieving him or her of the curse If the illness is induced by a witch another type of remedy must be sought Belief in the evil eye or that someone can harm another by looking at him or her in a certain way is found all over the world It has been documented in Mediterranean countries eastern Europe North Africa Central America Mexico and in the southwestern United States In many of these countries the evil eye is associated with envy and malice Various cures for mal ojo exist one well documented method is to barrer con un blanquillo sweep with an egg sweep the ill person with an uncooked unbroken egg The egg is swept over the body of the person without touching them while prayers are recited such as the Hail Mary and the Our Father The egg serves to extract the fever from the ill person and is then broken into a bowl of water and placed under the bed of the person During the night the egg is believed to still be extracting fever from the patient and in the morning if the egg is found to be cooked it is a sign that the patient had mal ojo The egg is then thrown over the shoulder of the mother in the direction of the sun References Baer and Bustillo 1993 Dundes 1992 Hand 1981 Jaramillo 1972 Kearney 1976 Martinez and

Although of noble birth she was sold as a child into slavery to Mayan merchants supposedly by her own mother In 1519 she was one of the women given to Hern n Cort s when he landed in Mexico She spoke both Nahuatl and Maya among other Indian languages and quickly learned Spanish becoming Cort s s translator and also his mistress Upon learning her name Cort s had her christened as Do a Marina and she became known to everyone by that name although her Aztec name was Malintzin which possibly the Spaniards pronounced Malinche so she was also called by this name She bore one son by Cort s During the whole Spanish Conquest period she spoke for the Indians to Cort s and translated Montezuma s dialogue to him According to Mexican and Chicano folklore she metaphorically represents the raped Indian woman that produced the mestizo mixed Spanish and Indian race the Mexican but she is also considered a double crosser She informed Cort s about a planned ambush at Cholula which saved his life and caused the massacre of thousands of Indians She became known as La Lengua meaning the tongue because of her work as a translator for Cort s Del Castillo believes that Do a Marina was following her religious faith and belief in a godly force the prophecies of Quetzalcoatl and did not think she was betraying her people Cort s is supposed to have stated After God we owe this conquest of New Spain to Do a Marina Because she gave birth to the first mestizo the first Mexicano she is considered the mother of la raza c smica the cosmic race In Chicano culture a person who turns his back on his people is call a malinchero or if it s a woman who has betrayed her community a malinche Contemporary Chicanas have taken La Malinche as a positive role model to illustrate and explain the survivalist psyche of the Chicana in modern society Her influence in the conquest of Mexico may be debatable but there is no doubt that she is considered a heroine almost on the same plane as La Virgen de Guadalupe Octavio Paz writes of La Malinche as the violated woman La Chingada and his writings have influenced several generations of Mexicanos and Chicanos in seeing the Mexican people as hijos de la chingada that is sons of a conquest by rape Cort s married Do a Marina off to one of his lieutenants Juan Jaramillo and they had one daughter She went with them to Central America and there died of an illness when she was approximately twenty three years of age Some scholars regard La Malinche as the archetype of La Llorona and others think of her as the original Llorona weeping woman while some consider her to be the source of La Llorona legend To many Chicanas Malinche has become a symbol for the socioeconomic and educational limitations of contemporary life They feel the defamation of her character is equal to the denigration of Chicanas The victimization and criminalization of Malinche a double oppression is parallel to the experiences of young Chicanas and Mexicanas Malinche and La Virgen de Guadalupe are two archetypes of womanhood in Mexico and in the Southwest the whore and the virgin who symbolize the precarious dilemma of being female Malinche has played an enormous role in the literary production of Chicana writing in essays and short stories but especially in poetry See also La Llorona References Alarcon 1989 Candelaria 1993 Del Castillo 1977 Glantz 1994 Harris 1996 Paz 1961 Rebolledo and Rivero 1993 Soto 1986 Zinam and Molina 1991 Mandas Promises The Spanish dictionary definition of manda is a proposal or an offer It comes from the verb mandar meaning to order or to command and the phrase mandar hacer means to have made or to command to be made In folk religious practices a manda is interpreted as a promise or contract made with a saint the Virgin Mary or God The contract is not a legal commitment nor made with the approval of a priest or the Catholic Church It is purely a personal promise made to fulfill or complete a journey a devotional act or to recite a certain number of prayers This promise is in exchange for the curing of an illness or for a solution to a problem The manda may involve the placing of a milagro symbol of a miracle at the shrine of a saint La Virgen de Guadalupe cathedral in Mexico City for example or the lighting of candles at the local church Although the fulfillment of the manda in itself may not be difficult its completion often involves some sacrifice and this aspect is also considered part of the manda Lighting daily candles could be a financial strain and a pilgrimage may take several years to complete yet neither is ever forgotten and a manda is taken more seriously than a legal written contract There may be fear of retribution from a saint if the manda is not fulfilled and sometimes individuals actually suffer this retribution If a woman makes a manda asking for a cure to her child s illness and the child is cured but she does not complete the manda the child may become ill again The woman will believe the second illness was caused because she did not complete her manda A manda may be completed after the request is fulfilled in thanksgiving or it may be fulfilled before the petition is answered with the assumption that it will be answered Mandas are very private and often only very close family members are aware that a person has made one References Cant 1991a Durand and Massey 1995

told La Mano Negra would take them away In the Ernest Baughman Collection at the University of New Mexico Library an informant narrates being told by her grandfather in Tesuque New Mexico about La Mano Negra A young woman remembers My grandfather used to tell us when we were little about La Mano Negra that appeared every time little kids were bad and that if we weren t good and helped him carry in wood and water and feed the animals la mano negra would come for us at night It would get really big take us from our beds and never bring us back home November 1974 Members of the academic electronic listserv CHICLE have held discussions and reminisced about La Mano Negra One member remembered it by the name of La Mano Pachona without knowing its origin but the fear of it was well remembered by all Marc Simmons writes about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo New Mexico An old priest dies but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night the local Indians come to listen and they see the spirit of the priest going into the church and praying They call the Hispanos to come and see and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of the padre s hand La Mano Negro Simmons states that he recalls a similar legend from Ireland 2 References CHICLE 1995 Ernest Baughman Collection Simmons 1989 Mariachi Music Mariachi music is the most traditional music associated with Mexico This type of musical group has become a national symbol of Mexico and of most Mexicanos living in Greater Mexico They are contracted to play at traditional ritual celebrations such as baptisms weddings quincea eras fifteenth birthday parties fiestas patrias patriotic festivals most festivals and sometimes funerals A traditional Mariachi group can consist of anywhere between five and thirteen musicians The uniqueness of the group is that it is composed of brass and string instruments only trumpets violins and guitars Some groups may also include a harp a guitarr n bass guitar or a string bass Mariachis have traditionally been male musicians but since the 1980s female musicians have been accepted into many groups and there are now complete groups composed of only females The attire of the Mariachis is a charro horseman suit that incorporates elements of the Spaniards dress of the eighteenth century boots tight fitting pants short waist length jackets all embroidered with braid or silver ornaments White shirts with ribbon ties made into bows and the traditional wide brimmed sombrero complete the ensemble Some outfits are all white black dark blue or even red and can be very striking when twelve or more musicians all standing start playing a typical Mexican song such as La Negra or Las Ma anitas According to Najera Ramirez the early Mariachi groups dressed like peons with white muslin shirt and pants It was not until 1901 that they started wearing charro costumes following the example established by Miguel Lerdo de Tejada and his orquesta t pica the national folkloric orchestra By the 1930s the charro costume became an institutionalized part of the Mariachi tradition when the government required Mariachis performing for official functions to wear charro outfits 1993 17 Mariachi groups have been very popular in southern California since the 1930s and currently hundreds of groups have been formed in the Los Angeles area Even students at the University of California at Los Angeles formed a group in 1970 called Mariachi Uclatl n One famous group from Los Angeles is Los Camperos de Nati Cano The Horsemen of Nati Cano organized in 1961 who perform at their restaurant La Fonda owned by Nati Cano This Mariachi performs at many Mariachi festivals and is also on a university campus circuit and can often be seen in theaters throughout California Nati Cano recorded with Linda Ronstadt on her famous Canciones de Mi Padre album and received a lot of fame from this exposure He is also an adjunct lecturer at the University of California Los Angeles In the last thirty years Mariachi festivals have become very popular throughout the Southwest They have been held in San Antonio Texas Tucson Arizona San Jose California and even Universal Studios in Hollywood originated a festival in 1985 Los Angeles is home to the largest assemblage of Mariachi musicians in the United States Theories about the origin of the word Mariachi are interesting There is the idea that it evolved from Mar a the name of the mother of Jesus Christ Another idea is that it comes from the French word for marriage But it is likely that the etymology of the word is of an indigenous nature Mariachi groups originated in the region of Jalisco even before it was named as a state a region greatly influenced by the Coca people and in fact the Nahuatl word for contemporary indigenous performers is mariachitos References Harpole 1990 Loza 1985 1993 Najera Ramirez 1994 Narv ez 1978 Pearlman 1988 Rafael 1983 Masseuse See Sobador Los Matachines Dancers The name of the dancers and the dance they perform on Christmas Eve in many parts of the Southwest In New Mexico the dance is performed by the Pueblo Indians in honor of the Madonna The dance is also performed in Mexico Texas and Arizona during other holidays and saints days Controversy over the origin of this ritual dance drama has not been resolved and the literature and research produced keep growing It is based on a medieval Spanish mystery play but in the New World version influenced by Aztec culture and customs it portrays the betrayal of Montezuma by the Spaniards and the acceptance of Christianity by Montezuma Its Iberian origins lie in the conflict between the Christians and Moors The Danza de los Matachines is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both Hispanic and Native American communities in New Mexico The word matachines can translate to mean clowning or trickery but can also mean puppet player jester and buffoon Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group the group is composed usually of twelve men but can have from ten to fourteen In sixteenth century Europe a matachin was a masked dancer an entertainer who danced with a sword It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin meaning to assume a mask There are many eighteenth and nineteenth century literary references to a matachine sword dance indicating that such a dance was performed in Europe Similar to the dance drama of Los Moros y Cristianos the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism Flavia Waters Champe s interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in 1692 In New Mexico the dance group is open only to men and it is considered an honor to be a part of it The masked men with decorated headdresses dance in two parallel rows in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of Aztec and southwest Indian in origin The main characters in the drama are El Monarca the King who represents Montezuma and four Capitanes The swords referred to earlier have become three pronged palmas palms in the New World In the performances of some groups there is a queen La Reina but in others she might be called La Malinche the Indian woman who became the mistress of Cort s who represents innocence or the Church La Reina is often a little girl dressed in a white dress In some locations it is believed the dancers represent the Twelve Apostles but in others they are just ordinary men They carry an image of the Madonna and move along in a candle lit procession One and sometimes two prominent performers are El Abuelo the grandfather and La Abuela the grandmother who act as leaders and also as clowns throughout the dance El Abuelo wears a rubber mask and is dressed somewhat like a white man sometimes carrying a whip and directing the rest of the dancers He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his whip against the ground Another dancer sometimes a small boy will represent El Toro the bull who initiates a bullfight with El Abuelo and is slain This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the dancers themselves or their families In some towns Los Matachines perform their dance on Christmas New Year s Day or the town s patron saint s day There is documentation of the Matachines dance performed during church fiestas and funerals by the Tarahumara Indians of northern Mexico In Laredo Texas the Matachines from the Ladrillera barrio venerate the Holy Cross and La Virgen de Guadalupe as their patron saint In this instance the tradition here is closely related to the Yaqui and Mayo matachines Interestingly both Native Americans in the United States and Mexicans in Mexico are still performing a dance introduced into the New World over 400 years ago This tradition performed today in the United States reinforces a heritage with roots in the culture from the eighth century Because Indians Mexicans and mestizos mixed race people perform it the dance has evolved with different interpretations and has different meanings for each group The experience of having a religion imposed on a culture is very different for the people it was imposed on than for the people who imposed it References Ancona 1995 Bennett 1935 Cant 1991b 1995

menudo blanco In parts of Mexico some people may call it panza which is a slang word for stomach In South Texas during the early 1900s menudo was called caf de hueso by street vendors and local people literally bone coffee or coffee from bone This name may refer to its understood medicinal value which is to cure a hangover known as la cruda It is typically eaten early in the morning anytime after midnight and on such holidays as New Year s Day or other big celebrations It is served in deep bowls and topped with chopped onions lemon juice crushed oregano and more chile Spicy hot with lots of

slogan Menudo Breakfast of Champions boldly printed on the front In the novel Fabricated Mexican the author Rick Rivera describes how he and his stepfather cut and cook menudo in their garage since his mother refuses to let them cook it in the kitchen because of the awful smell There is a very distinct odor to tripe as it cooks Everyone has their own way of cooking menudo and recipes can be found throughout the literature and folklore of Chicanos In many southwestern cities menudo cook offs are held as fund raisers and social events Keith Cunningham discusses the difference between the menudo from northern Arizona and that found in the southern part of the state and even compares the Tucson menudo to French cuisine References Cunningham 1980 Monta o 1992 Rivera 1995 Mermaid See Sirena del Mar Lo Mexicano An expression and concept that came into usage in Mexico around 1900 but was not completely culturally defined until after the Mexican Revolution in the late 1920s The concept had to do with Mexican nationalism and a sense of self identity with a Mexican consciousness The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of Mexicanness that was native drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje mixed race nature of the country It was in the 1920s when the term lo Mexicano became more known in association with nationalism and could be seen in the life of Mexico and in the art and literature produced after the Revolution Even in the United States the art of Mexican painters such as Diego Rivera and Jos Clemente Orozco was admired and well received because of its Mexican character The writings and research of the Mexican philosopher Samuel Ramos brought attention to the national character of the Mexicano and to a definition of Mexican identity Lo Mexicano referred to the Mexicanidad the national character of the Mexican which was mestizo mixed race and not European This essence called lo Mexicano can be found in art literature music and folklore for it encompasses the whole experience of being culturally Mexican The lore of Mexicanidad has migrated to the United States from Mexico with the waves of immigration in the last 100 years and lo Mexicano forms part of the identity of all Chicanos Am rico Paredes s life work was an attempt to understand lo Mexicano of the Chicano experience through folklore in the text of narratives and in the context of folk performances References N jera Ram rez 1989 1994 Paredes 1982 Pe a 1983 Schmidt 1978 Mexico Lindo Beautiful Mexico A nationalistic sentiment among Chicanos of the United States or el Mexico de afuera Mexico from the outside exhibited by patriotic activities such as parades fiestas patrias patriotic festivals and celebrations of Mexican holidays The expression was used to reflect a nationalistic ideology during the 1920s and 1930s in the United States that in effect reduced regional differences among the various Mexican communities throughout the United States The Mexico Lindo sentiment expressed a patriotism and a love of homeland and anything Mexican It made difficult life experiences of immigrants in the United States more acceptable The concept was popularized by a song with the same title sung to Mariachi music by the famous singer and actor Jorge Negrete The last stanza of the song states M xico lindo y querido Si muero lejos de ti Que digan que estoy dormido Y que me traigan aqu Mexico beautiful and dear If I die far from thee They should say that I am asleep And bring me back here These words have brought tears to the eyes of Mexicans born in the United States including many who have never traveled to Mexico Reference Rosales 1996 1999 Mica Green Card This is the Mexican people s slang term for the government card issued to legal immigrant residents also known as the green card in the United States The legal name of the card is Alien Registration Receipt Card Form I 151 or I 551 The card is no longer a green color but it has continued to be called this since at least the 1970s Illegal trafficking in the mica is very common and there have always been forgeries of the green card and social security cards as well Undocumented immigrants manage to learn where to purchase such forgeries In the streets of southern California a person who sells micas is referred to as a miquero It is unknown how the word mica originated as a name for the green card In Spanish a mica is a female monkey but it is used for a woman who flirts with men or a coquette The mica is definitely an enticement that lures men to the United States Illegal immigrants come from Mexico in search of work in California and other states of the Southwest and most are willing to do anything for employment The folklore generated from this experience has been frozen into legends and family oral histories The mica is a coveted trophy that opens doors to employment Sometimes it can be gotten illegally by purchase or legally by marrying an American and becoming a legal resident These experiences are dramatized in corridos ballads One corrido Mi Micaela hides the word mica in a woman s name Micaela but the first line gives it away T eres mi Mica Mica mi Micaela T representas todo lo que mi alma anhela You are my Mica Mica my Micaela You represent all that my soul desires Later in the song there is the following line Tienes que ser mi

INS and the Border Patrol The phrase hay viene la migra has been cried out in fear for many generations in Mexicano and Chicano communities and in the workplaces where they are employed Raids by la migra are commonplace and have been depicted in films novels jokes and verbal narratives for many years Migra is short for the Spanish word immigraci n and has become an important and viable character in the vocabulary and culture of Chicanos and Mexicanos alike Cartoons and jokes often depict la migra officials as overweight policemen who chase down innocent women and children In the folk dramas of El Teatro Campesino the Farmworkers Theater la migra was often characterized as an unscrupulous arrogant patrol officer who accepted bribes from the growers and ordered raids in the agricultural fields to arrest undocumented immigrants the day before payday Starting in the late 1940s and into the present la migra made raids in the San Joaquin Valley of California rounding up braceros who had overstayed their contract time allocation In recent years la migra has acquired a much more sinister image as individual abuses are shown on television evening news programs Still many Chicanos grew up being threatened by their parents that if they didn t behave te vay llevar la migra la migra would come and take them away presumably to Mexico Native born Chicano children have played a game of la

Milagros Miracles A milagro is literally a miracle but in folk religious practices milagros are tiny objects presented to a saint at a shrine or church as a token or offering intended to fulfill a vow made to that saint Sometimes these objects are called ex votos meaning from a vow and are in the shape of the object that symbolizes what the vow was about For example the milagro could be in the shape of an arm heart leg or baby In Mexico and the Southwest such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers pilgrimages and promised visits to a saint s shrine if the wish or favor is granted This is an important folk religious tradition common among Latinos and Chicanos in the Southwest Mexico and throughout Latin America A mother may make a promesa to La Virgen de Guadalupe to visit her shrine in Guadalajara if her daughter is cured of breast cancer When the promesa is fulfilled this mother may leave a tiny silver breast a milagro to symbolize the realization of the promesa Milagros are made out of wood wax or bone but the most common material is silver or a silverlike metal and they are usually very tiny objects about one inch in diameter The custom of offerings to saints goes back hundreds of years and can be traced to the Mediterranean among pre Christian Greeks Romans and Iberians The tradition as it has evolved in the New World is an amalgamation of African Native American and Spanish beliefs Saints are very important among Chicano Catholics influencing every aspect of daily life and acting as mediators between man and God Promesas made to saints and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in daily life In the Southwest this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the Spanish missionaries It is known that Hern n Cort s the conqueror of Mexico had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion which he offered to the patroness of his home Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe Spain This was in thanks for surviving the bite of a scorpion that he received in Yautepec Mexico in 1528 In the past most milagros were commissioned and the local silversmith made them out of silver or sometimes gold Today they are mass produced and can be bought at religious stores Thousands may be found in various shrines cathedrals and on saints clothing throughout the Southwest and of course in Mexico The milagros are pinned to the clothing of the saint and left there until collected by the priest or caretaker of the church See also Mandas

pejorative expression although it is sometimes used by Mexican people to describe themselves and their experience of illegally crossing the Rio Grande to come to the United States Also it is a designation used against all Chicanos with the same prejudicial meaning as greaser or spic Some Chicanos use the term to refer to recent Mexican immigrants and also to differentiate themselves from undocumented immigrants Among teenage Chicanos the word mojado is translated to English and illegal Mexicans are often just called wets Descriptions of the wetback experience have been chronicled and narrated in corridos ballads and novels In Mexico the term sometimes used is espaldas mojadas a literal translation for the word wetback In 1955 a well established Mexican director released a film titled Espaldas Mojadas which intended to persuade Mexicans not to go to the United States It was a political film that incorporated all of the standard characters that would appear in countless other films and novels of the Chicano experience the wetback the pocho half Mexican the coyote smuggler who smuggles people into the United States and the grower Mister Sterling An ironic yet justified ending shows Mister Sterling dumped into the Rio Grande by Mexicans and as he swims to the U S side of the border he is shot by the Border Patrol In a 1998 article Herrera Sobek discusses the use of

Fontanelle Ca da de mollera literally the fall of the fontanelle is a medical condition that can occur in infants is often classified as a folk illness but has obvious medical symptoms The fontanelle on the top of an infant s head is a membrane covered opening between two incompletely grown bones a soft spot that will disappear when the bones grow together as the child grows Mexican children are greatly guarded so la mollera will not fall and cause grave illness to the child The soft spot on the top of the head may fall if a child falls or is knocked around shaken too hard or suffers a trauma or an accident It is believed that la mollera has fallen when a baby becomes ill with ceaseless crying fever diarrhea and possibly vomiting Remedies for ca da de mollera involve trying to return the fontanelle to its proper position This can be done by sucking on the soft spot by pushing upward on the roof of the infant s mouth by holding the child upside down and patting the feet or by using a warm compress If the mollera is not repositioned death can occur There is considerable evidence to support the idea that the concept of ca da de mollera is of Aztec origin It is not a health concept found in Europe or even in other countries of Latin America The Aztecs believed in an inner force that provided warmth courage vitality and in children growth This force was known as tonalli and was found throughout the body but resided primarily in the head If this force was lost through violence or a trauma death could occur Children were especially at risk because this force could be lost through the fontanelle which was not yet fully closed By not cutting a child s hair and by watching the mollera and the head mothers took care to not lose the tonalli Some of the remedies for ca da de mollera reportedly performed by the Aztecs are similar to those still used by Chicano families and curanderos Many of a child s symptoms as described by mothers can be linked to medical conditions such as dehydration which can occur from diarrhea La mollera is also considered important as the child grows older Before entering a pool of water or getting wet at the beach many mothers insist that their children first wet the top of their heads so as not to catch a cold or another illness M jese la mollera antes de entrar al agua children are instructed Some Mexican Americans refer to this condition as a Mexican folk disease because American doctors may not recognize the medical conditions Often the only person who can cure ca da de mollera is a curandera See also Curanderismo

in Mexico in the year 1531 according to Bernal Diaz del Castillo There is documentation indicating it was staged by Juan de O ate in New Mexico in 1598 The drama originates in Arag n Spain during the twelfth century when Jaime I reconquered a region in southern Spain that was controlled by the Moors It used to be performed completely on horseback and seems to have traveled the world following the Spanish army into Mexico Cuba the Philippines British Guiana and California In Mexico it became a warlike spectacle involving many soldiers riding the best horses and wearing extravagant clothing Unlike the religious plays performed in New Mexico this one is secular Although it was traditionally performed on horseback since the Indians of New Mexico were not allowed to use horses they performed it as a dance The objective of the drama is to have the Moros steal the Holy Cross that sits in the center of a plaza and the Cristianos win it back by staging a sword battle between the two battalions of soldiers the Moors and the Christians Once the cross is returned to the Spaniards Christians the Moors infidels pledge obedience to the Spanish king The defeated Moors are forgiven and become Christians in the last scene In New Mexico the drama was staged to show the Indians that their subjection was already complete just as it happened to the Aztecs The ideological message is that enemies of the Spanish are not annihilated but rather absorbed as fellow subjects of the empire In New Mexico the famous Chimayo Moros y Cristianos continue to perform this drama up to the present day Lea s book reproduces the dialogue of the drama and she states that no other complete copy exists of this the first play to be presented on the American continent 23 In contemporary Spain the province of Alicante continues to have a major festival known as Las Fiestas de Moros y Cristianos that is a combination of religious and secular processions with up to 5 000 lavishly costumed participants The festival is celebrated from three to four days with several battles taking place to win back the Holy Cross For a day or two the Moors are in the lead but eventually they lose to the Christians

folklore Commonly accepted as just La Muerte she is a frequent personality in legends urban belief tales and is integrated into many family folk belief systems Death is sometimes feared but it is also accepted as the transition to another stage of the life cycle A common saying is De la muerte y la suerte nadie se escapa No one escapes from death or luck Espinosa A M 1910 404 She habitually appears late at night to men who are out alone some intentionally others innocently on their way home from work In tales collected in the Southwest La Muerte is seen standing at streetlights or waiting by a bridge or the side of the road She appears to be a beautiful young voluptuous woman wearing a long flowing white dress with her face covered or averted Once she is picked up and seated in the car or on the horse she shows her face to her victim She has no face what the men see is a skull In South Texas she is called La Vieja Blanca the old lady in white and she acts as a siren enticing men but when they get a look at her face they see her hideous white skull instead The men faint run away or become deathly ill of susto fright In most tales of La Muerte her appearances occur after midnight to men who have nonmoral or immoral schemes The basic structure of the legend of La Muerte will involve a man alone at night in his car buggy or he may be on a horse and he sees a woman in white often with blond hair standing by the side of the road or near a river The man is immediately attracted and wants the woman but when he gets near her and sees the skull face he faints and hours later awakens in the hospital with his wife and family surrounding him Tales of La Muerte are narrated by relatives parents grandparents and friends to reinforce an adherence to social cultural norms and marital fidelity The legend of the appearance of another woman La Llorona is structurally similar to stories of La Muerte and sometimes the same story will use both characters interchangeably La Muerte is also known as Do a Sebastiana in New Mexico She is found in the death cart of the Penitentes in the form of a skeleton sitting and carrying a bow and arrow During Holy Week ceremonies Los Penitentes pull the death cart along in their processions See also La Carreta de la Muerte Do a Sebastiana La Llorona Los Penitentes References Espinosa 1910 Flores Turney 1996 Glazer 1980 1984 Miller

movement a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the 1960s It imitated the Mexican mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of Mexico s history and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness In California the mural movement started about 1970 It involved a variety of interested individuals as described by Alicia Gonzales The emergent Chicano Mural Movement brought together the self taught artist the sign painter the house painter the mass production painter from the billboard companies the college art student and the graffiti artist 155 A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of 1974 as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in working class neighborhoods and urban barrios Often these early murals were referred to as a people s art This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas women muralists Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be Close to the children close to the old people close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day the hospitals health centers clinics restaurants and other public places Cockcroft Weber and Cockcroft 107 The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of pre Columbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo mixed race heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism Images of Aztl n a concept from the pre Conquest and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos Clemente Orozco and used murals to rewrite the history of the Chicano experience Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the Mexicano What was not provided in textbooks and the classroom was flashed across walls in Chicano neighborhoods The Chicano muralists sought to paint the history they knew a history often based on oral traditions legends and myths Romo 136 Finally as Tom s Ybarra Frausto explains Chicano a art reflects a continual effort toward developing an enhanced art of resistance an art which is not a resistance to the materials and forms of art but rather a resistance to entrenched social systems of power exclusion and negation 1990 67 See also Aztl n Chicanismo References Cockcroft Weber and

story of a handsome Mexican highwayman considered a bandit by history but a great folk hero by Chicanos At a time when the Mexican people were terribly mistreated in California it is believed that Murrieta was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and this prompted him to fight for his rights and those of his people Joaqu n Murrieta whose name is also spelled Murieta and Murietta roamed the back roads and hills of northern and southern California from Mount Shasta to the Mexican border in the mid 1850s stealing horses and robbing Yankees and Chinese alike There have been countless books chapters and articles written about Murrieta or about the legend of this famous Mexican bandito According to the legend Joaqu n Murrieta was born in Sonora Mexico and migrated to California with his new bride in search of gold He became a bandit and robber after many wrongs were committed against him by Americans There are several variants of his story but all have a similar general theme as to why and how he became a bandit During the mid 1850s there were at least five men named Joaqu n all of whom are credited with committing robberies and banditry There was Joaqu n Murrieta Joaqu n Valenzuela Joaqu n Carrillo Joaqu n Ocomorena and Joaqu n Botilleras Some say that Valenzuela and Ocomorena were one and the same and when he was hanged two Joaqu ns were eliminated Although it is possible that Murrieta used all of these names as aliases it is likely that there were at least two Joaqu ns at the time Murrieta started his life of banditry and crime after his home was invaded by white miners who raped his wife Rosa and beat up Joaqu n Later he and his brother Carlos were accused of stealing a horse a crime for which Carlos was lynched and Joaqu n flogged There have been over twenty one published versions of the Joaqu n Murrieta legend The first and for many years the one considered most authentic was by John Rollin Ridge serialized in the California Police Gazette and eventually published under the title of The Life and Adventures of Joaqu n Murrieta the Celebrated California Bandit in 1854 John Rollin Ridge a Cherokee also known as Yellow Bird wrote his story one year after the death of Murrieta This is the basic story of Joaqu n that all subsequent histories are based on In 1859 the California Police Gazette printed Ridge s story in ten installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story The book was translated into French and Spanish and for many years it was better known abroad than in this country In doubting the details of the Murrieta legend researchers go back to Ridge s version which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named Joaqu n It is believed by some researchers that Ridge just applied the name Murrieta to the Joaqu n that was finally captured and decapitated As a Native American Ridge identified with the discriminatory treatment of California Mexicans and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the Mexicans Joaqu n Murrieta s life has been depicted in novels stories newspaper serials and movies Charles E B Howe wrote a play about Joaqu n in 1859 that covers his escapades from the spring of 1851 to July 24 1853 the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love It is not known if the play was ever performed but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymen Joseph Henry Jackson s work traces the history of the legend claiming all the information came from the John Rollin Ridge version and that he should be credited with starting the fictitious legend Although Jackson does quote from the San Francisco Alta newspaper demonstrating that many people suspected it was not Joaqu n Murrieta who was killed and decapitated by Captain Harry Love but quite possibly another Joaqu n every murder and robbery in the country has been attributed to Joaqu n Sometimes it is Joaqu n Carrillo that has committed all these crimes then it is Joaqu n Murrieta then Joaqu n something else but always Joaqu n Jackson 13 Marcus Stewart wrote a long epic poem in 1882 titled Rosita A California Tale in which he speculates on the life of Murrieta In this poem Joaqu n lives and flees in a ship to Mexico or South America and the body that is decapitated is actually that of his good friend Ram n Ram n s girlfriend Rosita also disappears at the time of his death and only after her death thirty years later is it revealed that she had been living the life of a man This story is commingled with the story of Charlotte Charlie Parkhurst who lived as a man in California during the latter half of the nineteenth century The Murrieta legend has also been written by Latinos and Europeans and Pablo Neruda the Nobel Prize winner wrote an opera about Murrieta entitled Splendor and Death of Joaqu n Murrieta insisting that Joaqu n was actually Chileno and not Mexican Arnold Rojas a Californian vaquero writer and memoirist writes that Joaqu n Murrieta was from the city of Alamos Sonora Mexico where church records show that he and Rosita were married When his wife was raped and he was beaten Murrieta saw the faces of his murderers According to Rojas Joaqu n lived for revenge and he searched every mining camp in California until he found all thirteen men who committed the crime and killed them After this he returned to Sonora to live out his life Supposedly he is buried in Cucurpe Sonora Major Horace Bell 1927 states In any country in America except the United States the bold defiance of the power of the government a half year s successful resistance a continuous conflict with the military and civil authorities and the armed populace the writer repeats that in any other country in America other than the United States the operations of Joaqu n Murrieta would have been dignified by the title of revolution and the leader with that of rebel chief For there is little doubt in the writer s mind that Joaqu n s aims were higher than that of mere revenge and pillage it is easy to perceive that Joaqu n felt himself to be more the champion of his countrymen than an outlaw and an enemy to the human race 100 Chicanos have taken the legend of Joaqu n Murrieta seriously and identify with his heroic exploits of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor He is viewed as a social bandit and a cultural leader and several corridos ballads describe his life and death At the University of California in Berkeley a Chicano cooperative student house first established in 1970 is named Casa Joaqu n Murrieta after this famous folk hero References Bell 1927 Castillo and Camarillo 1973 Herrera Sobek 1993b Howe 1983 Jackson 1949 Klette 1928 Leal 1997 MacLean 1977 Neruda 1966 Pitt 1966 Ridge 1927 Rojas 1979 Stewart 1882
