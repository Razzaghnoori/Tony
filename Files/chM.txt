MachismoMachismo describes a stereotypic image of a ChicanoLatino man who is extraordinarily aggressive stresses dominance over his wife and family exhibits physical and sexual prowess and places strong emphasis on masculine rigidity Chicano social scientists have authored studies about machismo noting that it is a stereotype often used against Chicanos to blame them for their underclass social position in American society Macho literally means male and machismo is the concept of maleness but in American culture it has come to mean an exaggerated masculinity A masculinity associated with violence selfcenteredness chauvinism or alcoholism is not a macho concept recognized by most Chicanos For Chicanos un hombre macho is a man who symbolizes dignity takes care of his family has respect for all women especially his mother and possesses a strong sense of selfidentity and character Many Chicanos grew up influenced by Mexican movies with characters like Pedro Infante Cantinflas Antonio Aguilar and Jorge Negrete as men who sang to the beautiful girls and defended the poor by fighting for justice and social equality These were positive images of machosThe famous Mexican folklorist Vicente Mendoza has stated that the concept of machismo and the word macho were not prevalent in Mexican corridos ballads and popular culture until the s Supposedly the word gained popularity after Avila Camacho became president of Mexico because in ballads macho easily rhymed with CamachoIn an article published in  Jos Armas describes machismo as a mode of behavior necessary for an individual to live life with integrity selfreliance and dignity He states Machismo is a personal code of honor that is self imposed in a world devoid of universal moral law or justice It is maintained and sustained by individual pride and dignity A Latino mens group calling themselves Hombres Latinos was formed in California with the purpose of redefining the image and concept of machismo This was reported in a Los Angeles Times article in  written by Christopher Heredia The group is organized on the the compadrazco system meeting regularly and holding yearly retreatsTheir definition of the Macho is He who is dignified He who is a protector He who is responsible He who is nurturing He who is spiritual He who is faithful He who is respectful He who is friendly He who is caring He who is sensitive He who is trustful He who providesTello ca For some Chicanos machismo is an emblem that symbolizes resistance to social and historical control Excessive masculinity is seen by some as adaptive behavior in situations where Chicano men feel racial oppression and discrimination The idea of exaggerated masculinity has crept into American popular culture and language so most Americans have an idea of the meaning of machismo and we find it regularly used by the media For instance the Marlboro Man is viewed as a macho man strong and independent as he rides his horse herding cattle This was a model that many young men grew up trying to emulate but this symbol is no longer acceptable to modern American societySee also PintosReferences Andrade  Armas  Baca Zinn  Castillo

folk illness believed to be transmitted by certain individuals witches some think who have a special power Mal ojo may be transferred by a peculiar person who gazes at a weaker person a woman or a child and the ill effects are felt immediately Socially it can indicate that a person has been more familiar with another person than social and cultural manners permit The glance or power of a stronger person causes an adverse consequence on the weaker person who is often a baby or a child The fear of mal ojo also indicates that mothers and other adults are distrusting of a person who acts in a more familiar way than is culturally appropriate It is thought that people with weak blood sangre liviana are more susceptible to receiving mal ojo The symptoms of mal ojo are vomiting diarrhea loss of weight and sometimes even death Witches can deliberately give someone the evil eye other times it is done unintentionally by persons who just happen to have a powerful gleam A person may give another the evil eye because of a feeling of jealousy or covetousness If a person covets or is envious of a child he or she may give that child the evil eye Preventive measures that may diminish the possibility of a child getting mal ojo are to touch the childs cheek or make the sign of the cross on the childs forehead Sometimes the evil eye may be undone and the illness avoided if the person who cast the glance pats the persons head or temples immediately relieving him or her of the curse If the illness is induced by a witch another type of remedy must be soughtBelief in the evil eye or that someone can harm another by looking at him or her in a certain way is found all over the world It has been documented in Mediterranean countries eastern Europe North Africa Central America Mexico and in the southwestern United States In many of these countries the evil eye is associated with envy and maliceVarious cures for mal ojo exist one welldocumented method is to barrer con un blanquillo sweep with an egg sweep the ill person with an uncooked unbroken egg The egg is swept over the body of the person without touching them while prayers are recited such as the Hail Mary and the Our Father The egg serves to extract the fever from the ill person and is then broken into a bowl of water and placed under the bed of the person During the night the egg is believed to still be extracting fever from the patient and in the morning if the egg is found to be cooked it is a sign that the patient had mal ojo The egg is then thrown over the shoulder of the mother in the direction

princess Malintzin Tenpal also known as Doa Marina Although of noble birth she was sold as a child into slavery to Mayan merchants supposedly by her own mother In  she was one of the women given to Hernn Corts when he landed in Mexico She spoke both Nahuatl and Maya among other Indian languages and quickly learned Spanish becoming Cortss translator and also his mistress Upon learning her name Corts had her christened as Doa Marina and she became known to everyone by that name although her Aztec name was Malintzin which possibly the Spaniards pronounced Malinche so she was also called by this name She bore one son by Corts During the whole Spanish Conquest period she spoke for the Indians to Corts and translated Montezumas dialogue to him According to Mexican and Chicano folklore she metaphorically represents the raped Indian woman that produced the mestizo mixed Spanish and Indian race the Mexican but she is also considered a doublecrosser She informed Corts about a planned ambush at Cholula which saved his life and caused the massacre of thousands of Indians She became known as La Lengua meaning the tongue because of her work as a translator for Corts Del Castillo believes that Doa Marina was following her religious faith and belief in a godly force the prophecies of Quetzalcoatl and did not think she was betraying her people Corts is supposed to have stated After God we owe this conquest of New Spain to Doa Marina Because she gave birth to the first mestizo the first Mexicano she is considered the mother of la raza csmica the cosmic raceIn Chicano culture a person who turns his back on his people is call a malinchero or if its a woman who has betrayed her community a malinche Contemporary Chicanas have taken La Malinche as a positive role model to illustrate and explain the survivalist psyche of the Chicana in modern society Her influence in the conquest of Mexico may be debatable but there is no doubt that she is considered a heroine almost on the same plane as La Virgen de Guadalupe Octavio Paz writes of La Malinche as the violated woman La Chingada and his writings have influenced several generations of Mexicanos and Chicanos in seeing the Mexican people as hijos de la chingada that is sons of a conquest by rapeCorts married Doa Marina off to one of his lieutenants Juan Jaramillo and they had one daughter She went with them to Central America and there died of an illness when she was approximately twentythree years of age Some scholars regard La Malinche as the archetype of La Llorona and others think of her as the original Llorona weeping woman while some consider her to be the source of La Llorona legendTo many Chicanas Malinche has become a symbol for the socioeconomic and educational limitations of contemporary life They feel the defamation of her character is equal to the denigration of Chicanas The victimization and criminalization of Malinche a double oppression is parallel to the experiences of young Chicanas and Mexicanas Malinche and La Virgen de Guadalupe are two archetypes of womanhood in Mexico and in the Southwest the whore and the virgin who symbolize the precarious dilemma of being female Malinche

command and the phrase mandar hacer means to have made or to command to be made In folk religious practices a manda is interpreted as a promise or contract made with a saint the Virgin Mary or God The contract is not a legal commitment nor made with the approval of a priest or the Catholic Church It is purely a personal promise made to fulfill or complete a journey a devotional act or to recite a certain number of prayers This promise is in exchange for the curing of an illness or for a solution to a problem The manda may involve the placing of a milagro symbol of a miracle at the shrine of a saint La Virgen de Guadalupe cathedral in Mexico City for example or the lighting of candles at the local church Although the fulfillment of the manda in itself may not be difficult its completion often involves some sacrifice and this aspect is also considered part of the manda Lighting daily candles could be a financial strain and a pilgrimage may take several years to complete yet neither is ever forgotten and a manda is taken more seriously than a legal written contract There may be fear of retribution from a saint if the manda is not fulfilled and sometimes individuals actually suffer this retribution If a woman makes a manda asking for a cure to her childs illness and the child is cured but she does not complete the manda the child may become ill again The woman will believe the second illness was caused because she did not complete her manda A manda may be completed after the request is fulfilled in thanksgiving or it may be fulfilled before the petition is answered with the assumption that it will be answered Mandas are very private and often only very close family members are aware that a person has made oneReferences Cant a Durand and Massey  Egan  Oktavec La Mano

about a legend of La Mano Negra from the town of Bernalillo New Mexico An old priest dies but the villagers believe he was unable to complete all his work because his spirit frequently returns When the bell of the church is heard ringing late at night the local Indians come to listen and they see the spirit of the priest going into the church and praying They call the Hispanos to come and see and when the priest is seen in the church one of the observers cries out At this point the priest places his hand on the missal and vanishes Burned through several pages was the scorched imprint of

music associated with Mexico This type of musical group has become a national symbol of Mexico and of most Mexicanos living in Greater Mexico They are contracted to play at traditional ritual celebrations such as baptisms weddings quinceaeras fifteenth birthday parties fiestas patrias patriotic festivals most festivals and sometimes funeralsA traditional Mariachi group can consist of anywhere between five and thirteen musicians The uniqueness of the group is that it is composed of brass and string instruments only trumpets violins and guitars Some groups may also include a harp a guitarrn bass guitar or a string bass Mariachis have traditionally been male musicians but since the s female musicians have been accepted into many groups and there are now complete groups composed of only femalesThe attire of the Mariachis is a charro horseman suit that incorporates elements of the Spaniards dress of the eighteenth century boots tightfitting pants short waistlength jackets all embroidered with braid or silver ornaments White shirts with ribbon ties made into bows and the traditional widebrimmed sombrero complete the ensemble Some outfits are all white black dark blue or even red and can be very striking when twelve or more musicians all standing start playing a typical Mexican song such as La Negra or Las Maanitas According to NajeraRamirez the early Mariachi groups dressed like peons with white muslin shirt and pants It was not until  that they started wearing charro costumes following the example established by Miguel Lerdo de Tejada and his orquesta tpica the national folkloric orchestra By the s the charro costume became an institutionalized part of the Mariachi tradition when the government required Mariachis performing for official functions to wear charro outfits  Mariachi groups have been very popular in southern California since the s and currently hundreds of groups have been formed in the Los Angeles area Even students at the University of California at Los Angeles formed a group in  called Mariachi Uclatln One famous group from Los Angeles is Los Camperos de Nati Cano The Horsemen of Nati Cano organized in  who perform at their restaurant La Fonda owned by Nati Cano This Mariachi performs at many Mariachi festivals and is also on a university campus circuit and can often be seen in theaters throughout California Nati Cano recorded with Linda Ronstadt on her famous Canciones de Mi Padre album and received a lot of fame from this exposure He is also an adjunct lecturer at the University of California Los AngelesIn the last thirty years Mariachi festivals have become very popular throughout the Southwest They have been held in San Antonio Texas Tucson Arizona San Jose California and even Universal Studios in Hollywood originated a festival in  Los Angeles is home to the largest assemblage of Mariachi musicians in the United StatesTheories about the origin of the word Mariachi are interesting There is the idea that it evolved from Mara the name of the mother of Jesus Christ Another idea is that it comes from the French word for marriage But it is likely that the etymology of the word is of an indigenous nature Mariachi groups originated in the region of Jalisco even before it was named as a state a region greatly influenced by the Coca people and in fact the Nahuatl word for contemporary indigenous performers is mariachitosReferences Harpole  Loza   NajeraRamirez  Narvez  Pearlman  Rafael Masseuse See SobadorLos Matachines DancersThe name of the dancers and the dance they perform on Christmas Eve in many parts of the Southwest In New Mexico the dance is performed by the Pueblo Indians in honor of the Madonna The dance is also performed in Mexico Texas and Arizona during other holidays and saints days Controversy over the origin of this ritual dancedrama has not been resolved and the literature and research produced keep growing It is based on a medieval Spanish mystery play but in the New World version influenced by Aztec culture and customs it portrays the betrayal of Montezuma by the Spaniards and the acceptance of Christianity by Montezuma Its Iberian origins lie in the conflict between the Christians and Moors The Danza de los Matachines is probably the only ritual dance that is danced by both Hispanic and Native American communities in New MexicoThe word matachines can translate to mean clowning or trickery but can also mean puppet player jester and buffoon Matachines refers to the men who dance as a group the group is composed usually of twelve men but can have from ten to fourteen In sixteenthcentury Europe a matachin was a masked dancer an entertainer who danced with a sword It is likely that the Moors transplanted the dance to Europe and that matachin may come from the Arabic word mutawajjihin meaning to assume a mask There are many eighteenth and nineteenthcentury literary references to a matachine sword dance indicating that such a dance was performed in EuropeSimilar to the dancedrama of Los Moros y Cristianos the dance of Los Matachines was taught to the subjugated Indians by the Spanish missionaries as a custom to celebrate on Christian feast days but also as a means of converting them to Catholicism Flavia Waters Champes interpretation is that the dance was brought to New Mexico by Spanish and Mexican settlers who came with De Vargas at the time of the second conquest in In New Mexico the dance group is open only to men and it is considered an honor to be a part of it The masked men with decorated headdresses dance in two parallel rows in bright costumes decorated with long ribbons that appear to be a combination of Aztec and southwest Indian in origin The main characters in the drama are El Monarca the King who represents Montezuma and four Capitanes The swords referred to earlier have become threepronged palmas palms in the New World In the performances of some groups there is a queen La Reina but in others she might be called La Malinche the Indian woman who became the mistress of Corts who represents innocence or the Church La Reina is often a little girl dressed in a white dress In some locations it is believed the dancers represent the Twelve Apostles but in others they are just ordinary men They carry an image of the Madonna and move along in a candlelit procession One and sometimes two prominent performers are El Abuelo the grandfather and La Abuela the grandmother who act as leaders and also as clowns throughout the dance El Abuelo wears a rubber mask and is dressed somewhat like a white man sometimes carrying a whip and directing the rest of the dancers He calls out songs and dance instructions and cracks his whip against the ground Another dancer sometimes a small boy will represent El Toro the bull who initiates a bullfight with El Abuelo and is slain This side battle symbolizes the battle between good and evil The music is usually played with nonindigenous instruments like the violin and guitar The costumes and masks of the dance are very important and are usually made by the dancers themselves or their familiesIn some towns Los Matachines perform their dance on Christmas New Years Day or the towns patron saints day There is documentation of the Matachines dance performed during church fiestas and funerals by the Tarahumara Indians of northern Mexico In Laredo Texas the Matachines from the Ladrillera barrio venerate the Holy Cross and La Virgen de Guadalupe as their patron saint In this instance the tradition here is closely related to the Yaqui and Mayo matachinesInterestingly both Native Americans in the United States and Mexicans in Mexico are still performing a dance introduced into the New World over  years ago This tradition performed today in the United States reinforces a heritage with roots in the culture from the eighth century Because Indians Mexicans and mestizos mixedrace people perform it the dance has evolved with different interpretations and has different meanings for each group The experience of having a religion imposed on a culture is very different for the people it was imposed on than for the people who imposed

and concept that came into usage in Mexico around  but was not completely culturally defined until after the Mexican Revolution in the late s The concept had to do with Mexican nationalism and a sense of selfidentity with a Mexican consciousness The term conceptualized a new identity and an awareness of Mexicanness that was native drawing on the indigenous and the mestizaje mixedrace nature of the country It was in the s when the term lo Mexicano became more known in association with nationalism and could be seen in the life of Mexico and in the art and literature produced after the Revolution Even in the United States the art of Mexican painters such as Diego Rivera and Jos Clemente Orozco was admired and well received because of its Mexican character The writings and research of the Mexican philosopher Samuel Ramos brought attention to the national character of the Mexicano and to a definition of Mexican identity Lo Mexicano referred to the Mexicanidad the national character of the Mexican which was mestizo mixedrace and not EuropeanThis essence called lo Mexicano can be found in art literature music and folklore for it encompasses the whole experience of being culturally Mexican The lore of Mexicanidad has migrated to the United States from Mexico with the waves of immigration in the last  years and lo Mexicano forms part of the identity of all Chicanos Amrico

reduced regional differences among the various Mexican communities throughout the United States The Mexico Lindo sentiment expressed a patriotism and a love of homeland and anything Mexican It made difficult life experiences of immigrants in the United States more acceptable The concept was popularized by a song with the same title sung to Mariachi music by the famous singer and actor Jorge

definitely an enticement that lures men to the United StatesIllegal immigrants come from Mexico in search of work in California and other states of the Southwest and most are willing to do anything for employment The folklore generated from this experience has been frozen into legends and family oral histories The mica is a coveted trophy that opens doors to employment Sometimes it can be gotten

offering intended to fulfill a vow made to that saint Sometimes these objects are called exvotos meaning from a vow and are in the shape of the object that symbolizes what the vow was about For example the milagro could be in the shape of an arm heart leg or baby In Mexico and the Southwest such vows may be called promesas or mandas and can be fulfilled by prayers pilgrimages and promised visits to a saints shrine if the wish or favor is granted This is an important folk religious tradition common among Latinos and Chicanos in the Southwest Mexico and throughout Latin America A mother may make a promesa to La Virgen de Guadalupe to visit her shrine in Guadalajara if her daughter is cured of breast cancer When the promesa is fulfilled this mother may leave a tiny silver breast a milagro to symbolize the realization of the promesaMilagros are made out of wood wax or bone but the most common material is silver or a silverlike metal and they are usually very tiny objects about one inch in diameter The custom of offerings to saints goes back hundreds of years and can be traced to the Mediterranean among preChristian Greeks Romans and Iberians The tradition as it has evolved in the New World is an amalgamation of African Native American and Spanish beliefs Saints are very important among Chicano Catholics influencing every aspect of daily life and acting as mediators between man and God Promesas made to saints and the milagros presented are a reflection of their strong predominance in daily life In the Southwest this custom has been documented since the colonial period and was undoubtedly introduced by the Spanish missionariesIt is known that Hernn Corts the conqueror of Mexico had a milagro made in the shape of a gold scorpion which he offered to the patroness of his home Our Lady of Guadalupe in Guadalupe Spain This was in thanks for surviving the bite of a scorpion that he received in Yautepec Mexico in  In the past most milagros were commissioned and the local silversmith made them out of silver or sometimes gold Today they are massproduced and can be bought at religious stores Thousands may be found in various shrines cathedrals

the fontanelle is a medical condition that can occur in infants is often classified as a folk illness but has obvious medical symptoms The fontanelle on the top of an infants head is a membranecovered opening between two incompletely grown bones a soft spot that will disappear when the bones grow together as the child grows Mexican children are greatly guarded so la mollera will not fall and cause grave illness to the child The soft spot on the top of the head may fall if a child falls or is knocked around shaken too hard or suffers a trauma or an accident It is believed that la mollera has fallen when a baby becomes ill with ceaseless crying fever diarrhea and possibly vomiting Remedies for cada de mollera involve trying to return the fontanelle to its proper position This can be done by sucking on the soft spot by pushing upward on the roof of the infants mouth by holding the child upside down and patting the feet or by using a warm compress If the mollera is not repositioned death can occurThere is considerable evidence to support the idea that the concept of cada de mollera is of Aztec origin It is not a health concept found in Europe or even in other countries of Latin America The Aztecs believed in an inner force that provided warmth courage vitality and in children growth This force was known as tonalli and was found throughout the body but resided primarily in the head If this force was lost through violence or a trauma death could occur Children were especially at risk because this force could be lost through the fontanelle which was not yet fully closed By not cutting a childs hair and by watching the mollera and the head mothers took care to not lose the tonalli Some of the remedies for cada de mollera reportedly performed by the Aztecs are similar to those still used by Chicano families and curanderos Many of a childs symptoms as described by mothers can be linked to medical conditions such as dehydration which can occur from diarrheaLa mollera is also considered important as the child grows older Before entering a pool of water or getting wet at the beach many mothers insist that their children first wet the top of their heads so as not to catch a cold or another illness Mjese la mollera antes de entrar al agua children are instructed Some Mexican Americans refer to this condition as a Mexican folk disease because American doctors may

completely on horseback and seems to have traveled the world following the Spanish army into Mexico Cuba the Philippines British Guiana and California In Mexico it became a warlike spectacle involving many soldiers riding the best horses and wearing extravagant clothing Unlike the religious plays performed in New Mexico this one is secular Although it was traditionally performed on horseback since the Indians of New Mexico were not allowed to use horses they performed it as a dance The objective of the drama is to have the Moros steal the Holy Cross that sits in the center of a plaza and the Cristianos win it back by staging a sword battle between the two battalions of soldiers the Moors and the Christians Once the cross is returned to the Spaniards Christians the Moors infidels pledge obedience to the Spanish king The defeated Moors are forgiven and become Christians in the last scene In New Mexico the drama was staged to show the Indians that their subjection was already complete just as it happened to the Aztecs The ideological message is that enemies of the Spanish are not annihilated but rather absorbed as fellow subjects of the empire In New Mexico the famous Chimayo Moros y Cristianos continue to perform this drama up to the present day Leas book reproduces the dialogue of the drama and she states that no other complete copy exists of this the first play to be presented on the American continent In contemporary Spain the province of Alicante continues to have a major festival known as Las Fiestas de Moros y Cristianos that is a combination of religious and

and she acts as a siren enticing men but when they get a look at her face they see her hideous white skull instead The men faint run away or become deathly ill of susto fright In most tales of La Muerte her appearances occur after midnight to men who have nonmoral or immoral schemes The basic structure of the legend of La Muerte will involve a man alone at night in his car buggy or he may be on a horse and he sees a woman in white often with blond hair standing by the side of the road or near a river The man is immediately attracted and wants the woman but when he gets near her and sees the skull face he faints and hours later awakens in the hospital with his wife and family surrounding him Tales of La Muerte are narrated by relatives parents grandparents and friends to reinforce an adherence to social cultural norms and marital fidelity The legend of the appearance of another woman La Llorona is structurally similar to stories of La Muerte and sometimes the same story will use both characters interchangeablyLa Muerte is also known as Doa Sebastiana in New Mexico She is found in the death cart of the Penitentes in the form of a skeleton sitting and carrying a bow and arrow

movement a nationalistic political struggle waged by Chicanos during the s It imitated the Mexican mural art that was created during the postrevolutionary period of Mexicos history and was intended to promote political action and raise consciousness In California the mural movement started about  It involved a variety of interested individuals as described by Alicia Gonzales The emergent Chicano Mural Movement brought together the selftaught artist the signpainter the house painter the massproduction painter from the billboard companies the college art student and the graffiti artist  A statewide meeting of Chicano mural artists was held in September of  as a means of developing cooperation and communication for the artists working throughout California The early murals were considered public folk art because of the common themes of community and civil rights and because most of the murals were located in workingclass neighborhoods and urban barrios Often these early murals were referred to as a peoples art This concept was well expressed by a group of women artists in San Francisco who called themselves Mujeres Muralistas women muralists Our interest as artists is to put art close to where it needs to be Close to the children close to the old people close to everyone who has to walk or ride the buses to get places We want our art either out in the streets or in places where a lot of people go each day the hospitals health centers clinics restaurants and other public places Cockcroft Weber and Cockcroft The scenes of many early Chicano murals consisted of preColumbian indigenous themes and motifs that reflected a mestizo mixedrace heritage and a Mexican cultural nationalism Images of Aztln a concept from the preConquest and other Aztec symbols represented cultural pride and national loyalty Chicano and Chicana artists turned to symbols that portrayed the traditions of Chicanos traditions that distinguished them from mainstream American culture These images can still be found in murals located in Chicano communities across the United States Chicano muralists followed the tradition of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera David Alfaro Siqueiros and Jos Clemente Orozco and used murals to rewrite the history of the Chicano experience Murals were also intended to educate the community on the antiquity and ancestry of the Mexicano What was not provided in textbooks and the classroom was flashed across walls in Chicano neighborhoods The Chicano muralists sought to paint the history they knew a history often based on oral traditions legends and myths Romo Finally as Toms YbarraFrausto explains Chicanoa art reflects a continual effort toward developing an enhanced art of resistancean art which is not a resistance to the materials

Chicanos At a time when the Mexican people were terribly mistreated in California it is believed that Murrieta was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and this prompted him to fight for his rights and those of his people Joaqun Murrieta whose name is also spelled Murieta and Murietta roamed the back roads and hills of northern and southern California from Mount Shasta to the Mexican border in the mids stealing horses and robbing Yankees and Chinese alike There have been countless books chapters and articles written about Murrieta or about the legend of this famous Mexican bandito According to the legend Joaqun Murrieta was born in Sonora Mexico and migrated to California with his new bride in search of gold He became a bandit and robber after many wrongs were committed against him by Americans There are several variants of his story but all have a similar general theme as to why and how he became a banditDuring the mids there were at least five men named Joaqun all of whom are credited with committing robberies and banditry There was Joaqun Murrieta Joaqun Valenzuela Joaqun Carrillo Joaqun Ocomorena and Joaqun Botilleras Some say that Valenzuela and Ocomorena were one and the same and when he was hanged two Joaquns were eliminated Although it is possible that Murrieta used all of these names as aliases it is likely that there were at least two Joaquns at the time Murrieta started his life of banditry and crime after his home was invaded by white miners who raped his wife Rosa and beat up Joaqun Later he and his brother Carlos were accused of stealing a horse a crime for which Carlos was lynched and Joaqun floggedThere have been over twentyone published versions of the Joaqun Murrieta legend The first and for many years the one considered most authentic was by John Rollin Ridge serialized in the California Police Gazette and eventually published under the title of The Life and Adventures of Joaqun Murrieta the Celebrated California Bandit in  John Rollin Ridge a Cherokee also known as Yellow Bird wrote his story one year after the death of Murrieta This is the basic story of Joaqun that all subsequent histories are based on In  the California Police Gazette printed Ridges story in ten installments and this publicity helped to further disseminate the story The book was translated into French and Spanish and for many years it was better known abroad than in this country In doubting the details of the Murrieta legend researchers go back to Ridges version which some say was based on newspaper stories about the various bandits named Joaqun It is believed by some researchers that Ridge just applied the name Murrieta to the Joaqun that was finally captured and decapitated As a Native American Ridge identified with the discriminatory treatment of California Mexicans and he stated that he wanted to do justice to the MexicansJoaqun Murrietas life has been depicted in novels stories newspaper serials and movies Charles E B Howe wrote a play about Joaqun in  that covers his escapades from the spring of  to July   the day he was captured and killed by Captain Harry Love It is not known if the play was ever performed but the portrayal of Murrieta is moving and especially interesting because of all the negative publicity following his capture and death Howe portrays him as an aristocratic intelligent leader and a man who commits crimes to avenge the wrongs committed against himself and his countrymenJoseph Henry Jacksons work traces the history of the legend claiming all the information came from the John Rollin Ridge version and that he should be credited with starting the fictitious legend Although Jackson does quote from the San Francisco Alta newspaper demonstrating that many people suspected it was not Joaqun Murrieta who was killed and decapitated by Captain Harry Love but quite possibly another Joaqun every murder and robbery in the country has been attributed to Joaqun Sometimes it is Joaqun Carrillo that has committed all these crimes then it is Joaqun Murrieta then Joaqun something else but always Joaqun Jackson Marcus Stewart wrote a long epic poem in  titled Rosita A California Tale in which he speculates on the life of Murrieta In this poem Joaqun lives and flees in a ship to Mexico or South America and the body that is decapitated is actually that of his good friend Ramn Ramns girlfriend Rosita also disappears at the time of his death and only after her death thirty years later is it revealed that she had been living the life of a man This story is commingled with the story of Charlotte Charlie Parkhurst who lived as a man in California during the latter half of the nineteenth century The Murrieta legend has also been written by Latinos and Europeans and Pablo Neruda the Nobel Prize winner wrote an opera about Murrieta entitled Splendor and Death of Joaqun Murrieta insisting that Joaqun was actually Chileno and not MexicanArnold Rojas a Californian vaquero writer and memoirist writes that Joaqun Murrieta was from the city of Alamos Sonora Mexico where church records show that he and Rosita were married When his wife was raped and he was beaten Murrieta saw the faces of his murderers According to Rojas Joaqun lived for revenge and he searched every mining camp in California until he found all thirteen men who committed the crime and killed them After this he returned to Sonora to live out his life Supposedly he is buried in Cucurpe SonoraMajor Horace Bell  states In any country in America except the United States the bold defiance of the power of the government a half years successful resistance a continuous conflict with the military and civil authorities and the armed populacethe writer repeats that in any other country in America other than the United Statesthe operations of Joaqun Murrieta would have been dignified by the title of revolution and the leader with that of rebel chief For there is little doubt in the writers mind that Joaquns aims were higher than that of mere revenge and pillage it is easy to perceive that Joaqun felt himself to be more the champion of his countrymen than an outlaw and an enemy to the human race Chicanos have taken the legend of Joaqun Murrieta seriously and identify with his heroic exploits of stealing from the rich and giving to the poor He is viewed as a social bandit and a cultural leader and several corridos ballads describe his life and death At the University of California in Berkeley a Chicano cooperative student house first established in  is named Casa Joaqun Murrieta after this
