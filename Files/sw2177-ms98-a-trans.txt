 Cindy have you seen Dances With Wolves no i haven t have you oh that is a wonderful movie uh huh it s not the length isn t too long no oh goodness no you don t even you don t even realize it you know uh huh oh well really i ve heard different opinions about it uh uh huh one that you know yeah it was too long and they thought that you know at certain points that it was going to end and it didn t and it kept going on and uh huh really oh i thought it was great yeah really now i ve seen you know some different clips of it um and it it looks good it s just i haven t had the time to go to the movies lately well yeah and i heard a story about there s a there s a certain scene in the movie where there s um where they re where they re on a buffalo hunt and they have a particular child actor uh who s who s being supposedly run down by a buffalo uh huh uh huh and when they were trying to film that the buffalo that they used for that scene was Neil Young s buffalo i can t remember what they said his name was but he has a fetish for Oreo cookies uh huh uh huh oh and they got him to run like he was running down the kid by luring him with Oreo cookies hey that d work for me let me tell you i thought that was really funny uh huh uh huh now i ve seen another clip of um the guy that plays in Murphy Brown i don t know his name but he s he played the uh the the character in it that was very like gross i mean very dirty and oh i saw the one clip of him and ugh it when he was first i guess he was taking Kevin Costner to oh yeah like the site where he was going to be or whatever oh yeah that was rather um gross yeah the wagon the wagon driver yeah yeah but other than that i ve heard the the you know the um the scenery in it is absolutely beautiful yeah and uh the costuming uh huh really yeah was the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that it didn t that that um the Indians all appeared to be wearing new things oh really and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more probably you know age to age the material so they they did very authentic reproductions of the uh huh uh huh uh huh the styles uh huh of the actual stuff but they didn t they didn t age it uh huh quite enough it seemed but it was a very good movie uh huh uh huh uh huh well i guess i will have to see it then what have you seen lately um actually have been to the movies um i think the last movie i saw was Misery oh i didn t see that oh very suspenseful i don t i don t like Stephen King i really don t either but i went with someone and once i was there i couldn t believe i mean it s an excellent movie yeah really i wasn t sure because uh just generally you know that kind of scary stuff i i just don t want to have anything to do with it it s not necessarily it it s not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful i mean it s not yeah i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something you know no in in the book apparently she cuts his feet off but in the movie she she disables him but not by cutting his feet um she she breaks both of his ankles hum ugh and that i couldn t watch and but you know you could tell when it was coming yeah so yeah um that was so that he couldn t leave her cause she it still just seems a little twisted to me i m not sure i would have enjoyed that at all yeah yeah i mean uh yeah well as far as that goes yeah i mean you wouldn t like to see anybody anything happen to anybody but it was just how she got so caught up her emotions yeah and you know and and she feel madly in love with this writer and it was just uh huh but she was a killer and the the character was you know prior to that had had been someone that had killed other people but no one knew that yeah oh yeah so but so yeah we just haven t had the time to go to the movies lately i know we don t see movies at the movies a lot the last we did go see Dances With Wolves and we went to see Not Without My Daughter but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape and then we rent them uh huh uh huh oh right right now i want to see Sleeping With The Enemy oh yeah that looks really good too um that yeah it looks good and there were a couple others that i just haven t had the time now see i and Silence of the Lambs i m i m intrigued by it but i m not sure i want to go see it yet yeah i don t think i want to see that either i know i don t i don t think i could i think well now we had some friends that went to see it and they said it was okay so it might not be as i think they may be playing up um some aspects of the movie that aren t the main aspects really really uh huh know now we went to see the Jagged Edge and that yeah so it s it seems like you know that kind of the thriller suspense and not not real um oh well i liked that movie yeah uh huh strange in other ways uh huh hum well i guess that s about it okay it was nice okay it was nice talking to you bye bye maybe we ll talk to you again alright bye bye
