              do you yall do you get together with family reunions or   yes we try to uh we have not in some years now and i think we are going to try to have one this summer   oh that will be fun if you havent done it in a while   my aunt is planning it   oh where is your family from   uh Missouri   oh   southwest part of Missouri   so you are going to have to go there   that will will be where it is uh if if she gets it planned i have been out of town so i do not know what she has been doing but uh   yeah   they are all getting very very old all my aunts and uncles so we need to see them soon   oh yeah my family is from Kentucky most of them is down there   uhhuh   i have got an uncle in Louisiana and another sister here in Texas   right do you all get together often or   we did when i was growing up it was every summer we got together now my grandmother just passed away this last year so   uhhuh right   you know she was the   i think as we get older it is difficult more difficult to uh when all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now so it is uh   uhhuh   i have to uh i will probably have to take charge and do it one of these uh one of these days   yeah   but uh   well it   i still have elderly parents alive so uh it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date you know that   it sure does   and if they are   well we in Kentucky it wasnt hard because everybody lives so close together we just did it word by mouth you know by word of mouth   right   you know my uncle in Louisiana he is the only one that you know had to travel   uhhuh   and now i have got a sister in Germany and   oh my gosh   we are just scattered all over the place so it is going to be hard this time but we have got a huge family   yeah so the yeah and we need to have more and more of them i hope i think i hope that is not a lost art that people getting together as they do spread out all over the world   yeah because it is so fun i mean   yeah it is     we my mother has got like thirteen brothers and sisters   oh i see   yeah she has got a huge family and every one of them have five or six kids and most of them you know have got kids   uhhuh sure that makes a big crowd   yeah it we just we had two baseball bleachers full of people and there are still about eight or six eight or ten people taking pictures   yeah is that is that right   yes and it was just the last time we had one it was so fun   that is wonderful i hope   yeah   well we need to have another one i hope my aunt is successful as uh later well it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them i it was supposed to be this June so i dont imagine there is anything coming this is hardly almost June   yeah well i   so   we have always had ours in a park or something but it has away been the same park and there is nothing really special there only thing is it is big and it is open   uhhuh yeah thats we have it usually at this uh at this one park because there is a pavilion there in case it rains and   umhum   and uh you have to have it uh fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there   uhhuh in Missouri   in Missouri yeah it is too muggy it is not it is just uh very humid and the old people cannot take it anymore   well that was part of the problem with well that was part of the problem with the ones we have now the kids would sneak off and we were just being kids and we found what we thought was just an old water hole so we was going swimming   uhhuh   and like i said we was just stupid kids we was like eight and ten years old   umhum   and our parents came and caught us we had been  playing in the  sump it was part of the sewage cleaning system     isnt that great       yeah yeah   Kyle dont  i have got a four year old   yeah well that keeps you busy yeah     yeah but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something i thought that would have been much better   yeah it would have been something for the young people to to do but   yeah well they there was uh i am sorry there was uh i remember now there was like uh a baby pool just  about a foot deep   umhum yeah   yes i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it we were all kids anyway      every family has all that going on i am sure so   oh but i love it all the different foods because that yeah   oh i do too that is the best part of it   thats the yeah   everybody bringing something for a potluck picnic and oh grand yeah   so how long did you say it has been since you all had one   i do not know i think it has been uh four three or four years or five even uh since they have had it tried to get everybody together they are just spread out so much and and we really need to uh no matter how what kind of crowd they get   yeah   i hope   well i have been married almost five so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one and since then weve lost   umhum   oh well just our grandmother that is surprising   yeah well time flies so fast it may have been that that long since we have one it is hard to remember but i think it has been about four or five years   umhum   so uh anyway i i hope both our families get to have one soon   oh if i can ever get down to Kentucky it has been like four years since i have been home   yeah it is difficult with little ones i know when we had had our   yeah that is the reason that is the reason i dont i would get on a bus any day by myself but i wont do it with the babies   umhum   because uh i have got uh a four month old and a four year old   sure oh Lord   so i am just starting and i just quit too   oh i am telling you thats uh   uh i wont be adding any more to the family reunion   no i hope       it i know it takes a lot of effort right with with that with two little ones like that   yeah they are good kids though   yeah   so uh i am not too upset anyways ive enjoyed talking to you   enjoyed talking to you good luck in everything   all right all right you too byebye   byebye
