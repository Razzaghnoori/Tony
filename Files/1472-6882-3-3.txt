 Background The increasing research in Complementary and Alternative Medicine CAM and the importance placed on practicing evidence based CAM require ready access to the CAM scientific literature The optimal retrieval of a literature search in biomedicine depends on the appropriate use of Medical Subject Headings MeSH descriptors and keywords among authors indexers and investigators 1 It has been recognized that available online databases covering CAM differed in their thesaurus construction and indexing procedures making effective and efficient searching difficult 2 The controlled vocabulary for biomedicine has been developed and continuously updated by the National Library of Medicine NLM It is referred to as the NLM Medical Subject Headings MeSH The purpose of MeSH is to provide uniformity and consistency to the indexing of the biomedical literature 3 With the recent development of CAM on PubMed 4 5 MeSH descriptors for CAM have been expanded As of December 2002 there were a total of 21 973 MeSH descriptors found in the NLM Medical Subject headings Annotated Alphabetic list 2002 6 While the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine NCCAM has identified over 360 healing modalities MeSH currently included only 83 descriptors for CAM arranged hierarchically under the sets of terms in Complementary Therapies 7 In 2001 there were only 41 MeSH descriptors for CAM arranged under Alternative Medicine 8 Cross references have been available to assist searchers in finding the most appropriate MeSH Heading for example Alternative Medicine see Complementary Therapies 9 Therapeutic Cults was the MeSH descriptor between 1963 and 1993 It was only in 1994 that the term Alternative Medicine was implemented in the NLM MeSH thesaurus Medicine Tibetan Traditional was the only new MeSH descriptor added under Complementary Therapies in the 2003 NLM Medical Subject Headings 10 Other biomedical databases that include CAM literature such as CINAHL Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature 11 and MANTIS Manual Alternative and Natural Therapy Index System 12 also use MeSH as their standard thesaurus with a list of supplement terms in their subject areas The CINAHL medical subject headings include also a broad range of terms for research methodology including for example 12 subject headings for validity 13 The main purpose of database indexing is to enhance the yield and accuracy of search results Indexing is done either manually or generated by computer programs Indexers carry out indexing manually in MEDLINE CINAHL and MANTIS according to their own perceptions and understanding of the study contents In comparison computer programs generate indexing in the Web of Science database These programs pool words or phrases and group them by frequency of use 14 Computer generation of keywords is referred to as semantic indexing while assigning controlled vocabulary by humans is referred to as analytic indexing 15 16 Web of Science provides Author Keywords and Keywords Plus Author Keywords are taken from a list of keywords that the authors provided in their papers Keywords Plus are taken from references cited by authors Therefore Keywords Plus often include important terms not listed in the study title abstract or list of author keywords 17 Several studies on indexing practices have focused on areas other than complementary and alternative medicine A recent study looked at the process of indexing and retrieving medical information for populations of different ethnicity in several major health related databases The researchers found that information might not be obtained if the health professionals were not familiar with the indexing policy They noted that databases were not in agreement about the definition and use of most of their search terms 18 Another study compared 28 articles that happened to be indexed twice Comparing the two indexers the investigators found significant differences in depth of indexing e g the prevalence of major and minor descriptors check tags and subheadings and choice of subject headings 19 This study illustrated that indexing practices are often inconsistent and little is known about indexing and retrieving information from databases on CAM Searching databases for a CAM topic can be confusing and ineffective if terms are not used correctly If authors are reporting studies without using standard controlled vocabulary indexers might not assign the appropriate terminology to represent the studies Indexers are constrained further by the specifications of the controlled vocabulary 20 In particular a relatively small number of descriptors pertaining to CAM are contained in the controlled vocabulary 21 thus limiting indexers further in their choice of assigning specific subject terms The objective of this study was to compare indexing practices in four selected databases in relation to key terms used by authors and search terms used by investigators to locate studies on the validity of spinal palpation as a model for CAM searches We posed four questions 1 What are the key terms used by authors in the fields of chiropractic physical therapy allopathic and osteopathic medicine in defining the validity of spinal palpatory diagnostic tests in patients with spinal neuromuscular dysfunction 2 What MeSH terms and descriptors are available to indexers in different databases on the subject of validity of spinal palpation 3 How frequently do indexers assign appropriate MeSH terms or descriptors to represent the terms used by authors in titles and abstracts 4 What are the key terms used by investigators to conduct a literature search on the validity of spinal palpation We investigated the frequency of use by authors indexers and investigators of search terms for validity spinal palpation and musculoskeletal dysfunction We evaluated and compared analytic manual indexing to computer program generated semantic indexing Methods Develop Key Concepts and Identify Search Terms This study was conducted at the Susan Samueli Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine University of California Irvine between 2001 and 2002 A multidisciplinary team of investigators including researchers clinicians and a health sciences librarian undertook this study Our research question was What is the validity of spinal palpatory procedures for diagnosis in patients with spinal neuromuscular dysfunction The first step for conducting a literature search was to break down the research question into four key concepts 1 validity validity assessment 2 spine 3 palpation procedures 4 neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction The multidisciplinary team identified MeSH terms descriptors and potentially related keywords for these four key concepts see Table 1 We then verified the MeSH terms mh using the National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings Annotated Alphabetic List 2001 which was the current thesaurus at the inception of the study In addition to MeSH we used subject headings sh in the CINAHL online thesaurus and the descriptors de in the online MANTIS thesaurus to prepare searches in other online databases Searching and Selecting Studies for Comparison Using the identified search terms listed in Table 1 we conducted multiple search strategies The search in general can be stated as follow Search queries 1 accuracy OR accurate OR analysis of variance OR construct validity see Table 1 column 1 Validity terms AND cervical vertebrae OR cervical OR lumbar vertebrae OR lumbar see Table 1 column 2 Spinal terms AND diagnosis OR manual OR manipulat see Table 1 column 3 Procedure terms AND apophyseal OR asymmetry OR back pain see Table 1 column 4 Neuromuscular Dysfunction terms Search queries 2 galvanic skin response OR measure OR pain measurement see Table 1 column 1 5 Validity assessment terms AND cervical vertebrae OR cervical OR lumbar vertebrae OR lumbar see Table 1 column 2 Spinal terms AND diagnosis OR manual OR manipulat see Table 1 column 3 Procedure terms AND apophyseal OR asymmetry OR back pain see Table 1 column 4 Neuromuscular Dysfunction terms Search strategy Search queries 1 OR 2 We began the search in PubMed and continued in the other three databases We proceeded with hand searching and contacting experts and arrived at 4 945 citations including overlapping and non relevant studies Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify relevant studies Inclusion criteria consisted of a document pertaining to manual spinal palpation procedures measurement of validity or accuracy primary research study published in a peer reviewed journal in any language and made available between January 1 1966 and September 30 2002 Exclusion criteria consisted of a document pertaining to non manual procedures lack of sufficient tests or data and anecdotal speculative or editorial reports A thorough review of titles and abstracts resulted in the identification of 38 unique studies that were indexed in at least one of the four selected databases see Appendix I Additional file 1 for citations Five of these 38 studies were indexed in all four databases 22 23 24 25 26 In order to compare the use of CAM terminology among authors and indexers we focused the study on the standard practice of using MeSH among various databases Based on the subject area of the research question and the availability of two institutions library database subscriptions we were able to evaluate databases like PubMed MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL in comparison to a semantic database Web of Science Additional file 1 Click here for file Databases Selection PubMed MEDLINE is the most widely used and comprehensive scientific literature database in biomedicine and it has a subset focusing on complementary medicine MANTIS a specialized database was selected because it covers subject areas of interest to the research question including osteopathic medicine chiropractic and manual medicine CINAHL was included because the database covers literature related to nursing and allied health including physical therapy radiologic technology occupational therapy and social service health care The thesaurus of MANTIS and CINAHL are based on MeSH with supplements for certain subject areas For comparison we added one database Web of Science which relies on computer generated indexing terms i e Keywords Plus in addition to key terms provided by authors i e Author Keywords Similar to the other selected databases Web of Science covers a wide area of life sciences Compilation of Key Terms We verified how many of the four databases actually indexed each of the 38 studies We downloaded and imported the citations with title abstracts and controlled vocabulary into EndNote This resulted in 38 titles with 37 abstracts PubMed indexed 29 studies MANTIS 28 studies CINAHL 13 studies and Web of Science 26 studies Across databases we eliminated overlapping abstracts but retained the controlled vocabulary We then used the EndNote search field to identify the key terms controlled vocabulary in titles abstracts and indexes We calculated and tabulated the frequency of search terms that were used by authors and indexers The tabulation for validity and validity assessment terms is shown in Table 2 for spinal terms in Table 3 for procedural terms in Table 4 and for neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction terms in Table 5 The controlled vocabulary of the five studies that were indexed in all four databases is provided in Table 6 For the purposes of this study we printed in bold the controlled vocabulary and capitalized the first character of each term The free key terms were set in quotation marks A wild card search is represented by a truncation symbol e g palpat will include palpation palpated palpatory etc Results Validity and Validity Assessment Terms The frequency of use of validity and validity assessment terms is presented in Table 2 The most frequent validity term used by authors was accuracy accurate 3 38 titles 10 37 abstracts Web of Science generated Diagnostic accuracy as Keywords Plus 1 26 Accuracy was not a controlled vocabulary in the selected analytic databases Even though Validation Studies is a publication type in MEDLINE we did not find any study from our initial search result classified in this category CINAHL provided a cross reference to see Validity as a search term for subject heading We found 3 13 studies indexed either under Criterion Related Validity or Validation Studies in CINAHL Authors used various terms containing valid in 7 38 titles and 6 37 abstracts while MEDLINE and MANTIS did not have the actual terms like valid validation and validity as controlled vocabulary Web of Science indexed 2 26 studies for validity i e Keywords Plus Validation Disorders and Author Keyword Predictive validity Reproducibility of Results was the most frequently assigned validity term in MANTIS 13 28 studies and MEDLINE 7 29 studies even though Reproducibility of Results is a reliability term Among the 13 studies in CINAHL we did not find a study indexed as a subject heading under Reproducibility of Results Instead CINAHL indexed 10 13 studies using various validity terms from the extensive list of validity indexing terms available in the CINAHL thesaurus Predictive Value of Tests was the next most frequently assigned validity term by NLM indexers 6 29 MEDLINE studies While MANTIS and CINAHL also contain Predictive Value of Tests in their thesaurus the term was indexed only once in these two databases Web of Science listed Predictive value once as Author Keywords Authors used Sensitivity and Specificity in 2 38 titles and 7 37 abstracts compared to 3 29 studies indexed in MEDLINE none in MANTIS 2 13 in CINHAL and 2 26 in Web of Science as Author Keywords listed individually Several of our validity search terms such as Content Validity Convergent Validity Discriminant Validity and Face Validity were CINAHL but not MEDLINE or MANTIS Subject Headings We did not find authors or indexers using these terms Similarly Likelihood Functions Reference Standards and ROC Curve were Medical Subject Headings for MEDLINE and MANTIS but none were used by indexers in the analytic databases Reference Values a Medical Subject Heading for all three selected databases was the only controlled vocabulary used by authors and indexers that was not included as a search term Instead we used Gold Standard as keyword and Reference Standards as the Medical Subject Headings in our search See Table 2 Gold Standard was used once in an abstract neither authors nor indexers ever used Reference Standards The most frequent validity assessment terms was used by authors were measurement or Pain Measurement as well as Radiography Indexers also assigned these terms in all four databases See Table 2 Spinal Terms The frequency of spinal terms is presented in Table 3 The spinal term most frequently used by authors and indexers was Spine or Spinal Fourteen of 38 titles and 21 37 abstracts contained Spine or Spinal MEDLINE indexed Spine or spinal as an adjective in 15 29 studies MANTIS in 8 28 and CINAHL in 4 13 studies Web of Science generated 8 26 studies as Author Keywords and Keywords Plus Of these eight studies two were found as Keywords Plus i e Spinal Manipulation and Lumbar Spine Authors and indexers preferred Cervical Vertebrae to Neck Cervical Vertebrae or cervical as an adjective was used in 10 38 titles and in 15 37 abstracts and indexed in 8 29 studies in MEDLINE 7 28 in CINAHL and 2 26 in Web of Science as Author Keywords In comparison Neck was never used by authors in titles and in only 5 37 abstracts It was indexed in 5 29 studies in MEDLINE 2 28 in MANTIS 2 13 in CINAHL and none were generated in Web of Science Thoracic Vertebrae or thoracic as an adjective was used infrequently by authors and indexers Palpation Procedural Terms The frequency of palpation procedural terms is presented in Table 4 The most frequent palpation procedural terms used by authors as well as indexers were Palpation or palpat These term were used frequently 7 38 titles 19 37 abstracts 11 29 studies in MEDLINE 16 28 in MANTIS 6 13 in CINAHL and 4 26 in Web of Science as Author Keywords Authors frequently used palpation procedural terms that were not in the controlled vocabulary e g manual exam manual diagnosis or manual tests 3 38 titles and 9 37 abstracts and manipulat 2 38 titles 7 37 abstracts From the controlled vocabulary for manipulation authors often chose Spinal Manipulation rather than Chiropractic Orthopedic or Osteopathic Manipulation While MEDLINE indexed Manipulation Orthopedic as the only manipulation term MANTIS indexed Chiropractic Orthopedic and Spinal Manipulation Neither authors nor indexers used Manipulation Osteopathic This was also the only palpation procedural term used in the search strategies that was not used by authors or indexers Indexers in MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL selected Diagnosis most frequently as a palpation procedural term 17 29 studies in MEDLINE 23 28 in MANTIS and 7 13 in CINAHL Diagnosis was usually indexed in combination with a neuromuscular dysfunction term as a subheading While Physical Examination was not included in our search strategies authors occasionally used it in the abstracts MANTIS indexed Physical Examination in 15 28 studies compared to MEDLINE 5 29 CINAHL 5 13 and Web of Science 3 26 as Author Keywords and Keywords Plus Neuromusculoskeletal Dysfunction Terms The frequency of neuromuscular musculoskeletal dysfunction terms is presented in Table 5 Of the 22 dysfunction terms used in the search strategies only Low Back Pain and Back Pain were used relatively frequently by authors in titles 5 38 and in abstracts 8 37 Also the four selected databases indexed these terms with highest frequency 6 29 studies in MEDLINE 12 28 in MANTIS 4 13 in CINAHL and 4 26 as Author Keywords and Keyword Plus in Web of Science While authors used mobility and dysfunction relatively frequently these terms were not part of the controlled vocabulary in MEDLINE MANTIS and CINAHL Motion a controlled vocabulary was used by authors in 7 37 abstracts but was not indexed in MEDLINE and CINAHL Three of 28 studies in MANTIS indexed Motion as a descriptor Web of Science indexed Motion twice as Keywords Plus and once as Author Keywords Subluxation a widely used term in chiropractic medicine and a controlled vocabulary in MANTIS and CINAHL was not used by authors in titles and abstracts but frequently indexed in MANTIS 9 28 studies Of the 22 neuromusculoskeletal dysfunction terms used in the search strategies 6 were never used by authors or indexers apophyseal blockage hypomobility manipulable lesion motion unit and quality of motion While motion palpation was not used as a combined search term MANTIS indexed Palpation Motion in 9 28 studies Authors used motion palpation in 3 38 titles and 3 37 abstracts Motion palpation was not a MeSH or subject heading and therefore it was not indexed in MEDLINE or CINAHL Comparison of Five Studies Indexed in all Four Databases Of the 38 studies five studies were indexed in all four databases as shown in Table 6 The comparison of validity terms showed that two of these five studies included a validity term in the title 23 26 and two studies had a validity term in the abstract 22 25 The study by Kristiansson et al 24 did not provide a validity term in either title or abstract but PubMed and MANTIS indexed validity terms for this study PubMed and CINAHL did not pick up the validity term that appeared in the abstract by Gracovetsky et al 22 MANTIS recognized and indexed the validity terms for all five studies CINAHL indexed two of the five studies with validity terms 23 25 In Web of Science three of the five studies included Author Keywords for validity 22 25 26 Three studies published after 1996 generated Keywords Plus from the references cited by the authors but only one study included a validity term 22 All five studies included a neuromuscular dysfunction term in the title Authors included Back Pain in the title and abstract in three studies 22 24 25 and Neck Pain in the title and abstract in one study 26 One author used thoracic end play in the title and no other neuromuscular dysfunction term in the abstract 23 All four databases indexed Back Pain Low Back Pain and Neck Pain in the four respective studies 22 24 25 26 In Web of Science these terms were provided by the authors as Author Keywords and not generated from Keywords Plus Discussion Current Status of Standard Glossaries in Manual Medicine In 1975 the National Institutes of Health sponsored a multidisciplinary research conference on status of spinal manipulative therapy 27 The orthopedic osteopathic and chiropractic representatives reported on the understanding and use of the terminology in each respective profession There was no consensus within or amongst professions at that time Searching the Internet for orthopedic terminology for professionals we located many glossaries designed to facilitate patient comprehension of orthopedic terms For example the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons provides a glossary of orthopedic diagnostic tests online which seems to be designed for patients 28 At this web site we did not identify a glossary of standard terminology for orthopedics The osteopathic profession developed a standardized Glossary of Osteopathic Terminology in 1981 that has been updated annually ever since 29 The online version is available at the AOAnet Yearbook and Directory 30 The osteopathic literature database OSTMED went online October 1 2002 31 For standard indexing practice the database uses the NLM MeSH terms and about 70 terms that are uniquely osteopathic called Osteopathic Subject Headings OSH To further assist in accessing the osteopathic literature database Manipulation Osteopathic became a MeSH term in 2002 6 The Chiropractic Library Consortium CLIBCON published the first list of chiropractic thesaurus CHIROSH in 1979 to improve access to the chiropractic literature The consortium produced the first version of the Index to Chiropractic Literature in print in 1980 and added the online version in 1985 The standard indexing practice is based on NLM MeSH and CHIROSH 32 Chiropractic librarians but not the chiropractic practitioners use this CHIROSH thesaurus Presently there does not seem to be a universally accepted glossary of terms in the chiropractic profession 33 In recent years PubMED MEDLINE articles that were submitted by publishers do not contain MeSH vocabulary This increasingly common situation contributes to the data retrieval problems that we have presented here and furthers the argument for authors to use controlled vocabulary or commonly understood terminology in the titles and abstracts of their publications in order to facilitate retrieval of their studies by key terms In the field of CAM semantic indexing might be more useful than analytic indexing because keyword indexing is generated by computer programs that pool words or phrases used by authors at least twice For instance if the author mentioned subluxation at least twice in the title or abstract the term will be indexed regardless of professional agreement about the definition of the term Strengths and Limitations of the Controlled Vocabulary and Keywords In our study the limitations of semantic indexing in Web of Science produced the lowest yield of relevant studies While Web of Science indexed 26 38 studies only a few of these had been retrieved by the search strategy Instead we arrived at the 26 studies by individually verifying the 38 studies that we knew to exist by using author name and title words Of the 26 studies indexed in Web of Science nine had been generated with both Author Keywords and Keywords Plus and six studies with Author Keywords only Web of Science did not generate any keywords for 11 26 studies If investigators relied on searching by Keyword Plus the search strategy might miss many potentially relevant studies At the same time if investigators are not familiar with the terms used by authors a search strategy might miss relevant studies as well In Web of Science Author Keywords have only been available for search since 1991 This limits users ability to find relevant literature prior to 1991 A search of earlier years has to rely on title word searches It is likely because of this limitation we found relatively few Author Keywords or Keywords Plus for our four search concepts For databases that utilize analytic indexing like MEDLINE the NLM Medical Subject Headings Section staff continually revises and updates the MeSH vocabulary While there were major changes in the 2002 NLM MeSH thesaurus for CAM the current 2003 edition added only one CAM therapeutic modality It would be helpful if investigators information specialists and CAM practitioners become more active in contributing to the selection process of CAM descriptors in NLM MeSH and other database descriptors Individual subscribers and subscribing institutions as well have significant influence on the modifications and updating processes of databases The NLM Web site has a page for suggesting MeSH changes with a one or two sentence statement the reason for the change and one or two authoritative citations 34 Since the NLM Medical Subject Headings are the standard controlled vocabulary for the allied health and biomedicine investigators and authors in the fields of osteopathic medicine chiropractic and physical medicine should take the opportunity to establish consistent terminology in the field of validity of spinal palpation for neuromuscular dysfunction We recognize the difficulties of adding new descriptors and updating the existing controlled vocabulary because searching for a new concept requires a dynamic thesaurus while searching retrospectively requires stability and continuity 35 Fortunately the National Library of Medicine implements changes to the MeSH thesaurus in MEDLINE retrospectively Conclusions Searching databases on CAM related topics is challenging due to the diversity in the use of controlled vocabulary and indexing procedures in different databases Collaboration is needed among indexers authors investigators and information specialists to develop standard terminology in CAM Furthermore database vendors should augment their control vocabulary in CAM particularly in the fields of manual medicine A standard terminology then could be used and referred to by investigators in conducting their search strategies and authors when writing titles abstracts and submitting keywords for publications As the CAM literature grows dissemination and knowledge of the controlled vocabulary will become even more important Competing

lose financially from the publication of this paper in the past five years Authors Contributions LM conceived of the study designed and carried out the searches analyzed the search outcomes and the
