 Introduction The synovial tissue in rheumatoid arthritis RA contains synovial fibroblasts and stromal cells as well as macrophages Synovial stromal cells and fibroblasts are thought to proliferate in situ 1 On the contrary macrophages do not proliferate but rather differentiate from monocytes that migrated from the peripheral blood and are activated to differentiate in the synovial tissue Macrophages in RA synovium secrete many inflammatory mediators IL 1 IL 6 IL 8 tumor necrosis factor TNF and PGE 2 and a variety of matrix metalloproteinases and are thought to play a central role in the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of RA 2 The number of macrophages in RA synovium correlates significantly with clinical symptoms and the degree of joint damage 3 Understanding the regulation of macrophage accumulation in the RA synovium should therefore provide insight into the inflammatory nature of rheumatoid synovitis Migration of peripheral blood monocytes is likely to be influenced by chemokines A number of chemokines including IL 8 monocyte chemotactic protein 1 MCP 1 macrophage inflammatory protein 1 MIP 1 MIP 1 epithelial derived neutrophil attractant 78 and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted RANTES are known to be found in RA synovial fluid 4 5 6 7 8 A number of specific chemokine receptors including CCR1 CCR2 CCR5 CCR8 and CXCR4 are also known to be expressed by peripheral blood monocytes 9 10 Despite this information the specific chemokine chemokine receptor interactions involved in the recruitment of monocytes into the rheumatoid synovium have not been fully delineated To address this issue we examined chemokine receptor expression by peripheral blood monocytes and also analyzed the capacity of supernatants from RA synovial stromal cells to induce monocyte migration The data indicate that MCP 1 secreted by synovial stromal cells plays a major role in attracting monocytes to the synovium and that IL 8 may also contribute Materials and methods Antibodies and reagents Biotinylated mouse anti human CCR1 monoclonal antibody mAb mouse anti human CCR2 mAb conjugated with phycoerythrin PE mouse anti human CCR6 mAb

used to compare the effect of CD14 cell migration and the blocking effect of mAbs The Student t test was used to evaluate chemokine production by SCLs and the fibroblast line Results Chemokine receptor expression by peripheral blood monocytes Chemokine receptor expression by CD14 monocytes was examined using flow cytometry Representative examples Fig 1 and asummary of staining results Table 1 are presented CXCR3 and CXCR4 were expressed by a high frequency of monocytes in all healthy donors More than one half of monocytes expressed CCR2 CCR5 CXCR1 and CXCR2 in seven of nine cases although a minimal number of monocytes from two donors expressed these receptors Expression of CCR6 and CXCR5 by monocytes was minimal in all subjects CCR1 was expressed by few monocytes in three donors whereas 20 40 of monocytes of the other donors expressed CCR1 These results suggest that CCR1 CCR2 CCR5 and CXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 and CXCR4 are candidates to be involved in chemokine mediated trafficking of monocytes Supernatants of cell lines attract monocytes To examine whether SCLs derived from RA synovium can attract monocytes efficiently migration of monocytes in response to culture supernatants of RA and OA SCLs and fibroblasts was examined Fig 2 Supernatants of all cell lines attracted significantly more monocytes than medium alone P 0 01 Those supernatants from RA SCLs induced the migration of significantly more monocytes than the supernatants of the OA SCL and skin fibroblasts Chemokine mRNA production by cell lines Production of proinflammatory chemokine mRNA by the various cell lines was assessed using RT PCR Fig 3 RA SCLs expressed a number of proinflammatory chemokine mRNAs including MCP 1 IL 8 MIP 1 MIP 1 RANTES and IP 10 OA SCL also expressed these same chemokine mRNAs with the exception of MIP 1 The fibroblast line expressed mRNAs for IL 8 MCP 1 and IP 10 but not RANTES MIP 1 and MIP 1 Chemokine production by cell lines Chemokines secreted into the culture supernatants of cell lines were measured by ELISA Fig 4 Production of MCP 1 and IL 8 by RA SCLs was greater than that by OA SCL and the fibroblast line The cell lines produced low levels of RANTES whereas IP 10 and MIP1 were not detected data not shown MCP 1 and IL 8 play a role in migration of monocytes Blocking experiments were carried out using mAbs to determine the chemokines that contribute to monocyte migration induced by RA SCLs Fig 5 Anti MCP 1 and anti IL 8 mAbs decreased monocyte migration significantly with the effect of anti MCP 1 being consistently greater than that of anti IL 8 Anti CCR5 blocking mAb did not effect monocyte migration The anti CCR5 mAb did have blocking activity however since migration of T cells induced by RANTES 500 ng ml was blocked by 95 data not shown Stimulation with TNF induces RA SCL to produce more chemokines and attract more monocytes RA SCLs were stimulated with TNF and chemokine production and the capacity of supernatants to influence monocyte migration were examined to assess the influence of inflammatory cytokines on chemokine production and monocyte trafficking Supernatants from RA SCLs stimulated with 2 ng ml TNF produced more MCP 1 IL 8 RANTES and IP 10 Fig 6 and attracted more monocytes Fig 7 than those that were unstimulated MCP 1 and IL 8 play major roles in monocyte migration by RA SCLs after TNF stimulation Anti MCP 1 mAb and anti IL 8 mAb significantly inhibited monocyte migration by supernatants of RA SCLs stimulated with TNF Anti IP 10 mAb and anti CCR5 mAb did not inhibit monocyte migration significantly Fig 8 Discussion The results of this study indicate that supernatants of SCL derived from RA synovial tissue can attract more monocytes from peripheral blood than OA SCL and skin fibroblasts MCP 1 and to a lesser degree IL 8 played the major roles in SCL induced trafficking of monocytes These results begin to provide an explanation for the extensive accumulation of myeloid cells in rheumatoid synovium Importantly RA SCL induced more monocyte migration after stimulation with TNF one of the major inflammatory cytokines produced in the rheumatoid synovium Peripheral blood monocytes express many chemokine receptors 9 10 including CCR1 CCR2 CCR5 CCR8 and CXCR4 The current analysis indicates that along with these receptors CXCR1 CXCR2 and CXCR3 are also expressed by monocytes CCR1 CCR2 CCR5 CXCR1 CXCR2 CXCR3 and CXCR4 notably appear to be expressed by monocytes obtained from most donors Ligands of these chemokine receptors are candidates to be involved in monocyte trafficking These ligands would include RANTES MIP 1 and MCP 3 CCR1 MCP 1 MCP 2 MCP 3 MCP 4 MCP 5 CCR2 RANTES MIP 1 and MIP 1 CCR5 IL 8 and CGP 2 CXCR1 IL 8 GRO and epithelial derived neutrophil attractant 78 CXCR2 IP 10 and MIG CXCR3 and stromal cell derived factor 1 CXCR4 13 Migration assays using supernatants of RA SCLs were employed to determine which of these chemokine and receptor interactions might be involved in monocyte migration in the RA synovium Stromal cells are one of the important cell populations in RA synovium SCL can produce many cytokines chemokines and can promote viability and functional activation of T cells and B cells 14 15 16 The current findings also indicate that supernatants of RA SCLs attract more monocytes than the supernatants of OA SCL and skin fibroblasts This result suggests that the supernatants from RA SCLs may contain more chemokines than or different chemokines to those of OA SCL or fibroblast lines and therefore are able to attract additional monocytes This is likely to contribute to the more marked accumulation of monocytes in RA compared with OA synovium An analysis of chemokines produced by RA SCL indicated that these cells expressed MCP 1 and IL 8 mRNAs and also secreted MCP 1 and IL 8 It is noteworthy that there were some discrepancies between mRNA expression and protein production From the mRNA expression we expected RA SCLs to produce reasonable amounts of IP 10 RANTES MIP 1 and MIP 1 RA SCLs however secreted only small amounts of RANTES and IP 10 and MIP 1 secretion was not detected According to previous reports mRNAs of MCP 1 IL 8 and RANTES were found in RA SCL or fibroblasts but only MCP 1 was reported to be secreted by RA SCL or fibroblasts without cytokine stimulation 4 5 17 18 The current study indicates a wider profile of chemokine expression and secretion by RA SCL and also a greater production of IL 8 and MCP 1 by RA SCL compared with OA SCL implying a greater proinflammatory potential Experiments with blocking mAbs were carried out to examine the chemokines in the supernatants of SCL that accounted for monocyte migration The data were consistent with the conclusion that MCP 1 and to a lesser extent IL 8 accounted for the capacity of RA SCL supernatants to stimulate monocyte migration Whether additional cytokines produced by RA SCL also contributed to monocyte migration is currently not known but the combination of the chemokine data and the mAb blocking results suggests that MCP 1 and IL 8 play a dominant role in monocyte migration measured by SCL TNF is one of the major cytokines produced in inflammatory sites such as RA synovium and it is thought to play a central proinflammatory role 2 We examined the influence of TNF on monocyte migration induced by RA SCL RA SCLs stimulated by TNF secreted more MCP 1 IL 8 and RANTES than those that were unstimulated and began to produce IP 10 Moreover supernatants of TNF stimulated RA SCLs attracted more monocytes in migration assay MCP 1 and IL 8 played the main roles in monocyte migration induced by TNF stimulated RA SCL as documented by blocking experiments It has recently been reported that T cells expressing CCR5 gather at inflammatory sites such as RA or multiple sclerosis and that interactions between CCR5 and its ligands RANTES MIP 1 MIP 1 are thought to be important in the accumulation of inflammatory cells at these sites 19 20 21 CCR5 expressed by monocytes however was not apparently active in transmitting transmigratory signals RANTES is also the ligand of CCR1 but the major receptor for RANTES is thought to be CCR5 In this regard expression of CCR1 by monocytes was lower than that of CCR5 Moreover antibody to MCP 1 and IL 8 blocked 75 and 20 of migration of monocytes respectively According to this information RANTES is unlikely to play a major role in monocyte migration by RA SCL supernatants MCP 1 has been shown to play an important role in the development of arthritis in MRL lpr mice 22 whereas the migration of monocytes into inflammatory sites was reduced in the CCR2 deficient mouse 23 These results are consistent with the current findings demonstrating the important role of MCP 1 in monocyte migration Blocking the effect of RANTES has however also been shown to be effective in ameliorating collagen induced arthritis in DAB 1 mice and adjuvant induced arthritis in rats 24 25 RANTES might therefore play a different role in the initiation of inflammatory arthritis in experimental animals compared with propagating chronic inflammation in RA The overlapping roles of MCP 1 and IL 8 in the migration of inflammatory cells have recently been highlighted in studies of neutrophil trafficking It was reported that MCP 1 plays a role in neutrophil trafficking in inflammation although neutrophil trafficking was previously believed to be regulated only by IL 8 and not by MCP 1 26 These previous results together with the current data indicate that both MCP 1 and IL 8 play major roles in regulating the trafficking of myeloid cells into inflammatory sites The role of specific chemokines in arthritis is still controversial and further investigation is necessary to delineate to specific roles of these effector molecules Moreover the role of tissue cells in regulating the migration of inflammatory cells into the synovium is also not fully established The current data however strongly imply that monocyte accumulation in rheumatoid synovium is regulated by SCL via production of the chemokines MCP 1 and IL 8 Abbreviations
