 Bob Dylan In recent photos I ve seen of Bob Dylan he s wearing a lopsided bemused grin the smile of someone who can t quite believe what s happening to him If you were Dylan you d be puzzled too In December President Clinton and Washington s elite paid homage to the singer at the Kennedy Center Honors an event that usually celebrates old respectables such as Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra Dylan shaved and even wore a tuxedo Last week it was the recording industry s turn to suck up to Dylan Having all but shut Dylan out of the Grammies for the last 35 years it lavished three awards on his new record Time Out of Mind including Album of the Year There is general agreement that the Dylan honors signify Something Very Important about the 60s The most popular explanation is a political one Dylan in a tux is the final ironic nail in the counterculture coffin The establishment has finally co opted the ultimate anti establishment figure Dylan the story goes was the icon for the lefty politics of the 60s He sang Blowin in the Wind and Masters of War and was the role model for a generation of protestors Once he sang Don t follow leaders Now sniff he s hanging out with Clinton But this is a misapprehension of Dylan He was never as much of a counterculturist as his fans believed and he was certainly never much of a politico Except for a brief awkward foray into the civil rights movement Dylan essentially ignored political activism during the 60s At a time when every musician spoke out against the Vietnam War Dylan did not He ignored presidential campaigns and lefty crusades He never preached or much sympathized with hippie rhetoric He denied and still denies that his songs had a political significance He licensed The Times They Are A Changin for a bank advertisement If there is a decade of which Dylan is a symbol it s the 70s He has always pursued self actualization rather than protest artistic fulfillment rather than politics Pause for requisite Dylan mantra He not busy being born is busy dying For a personal growth slogan this is pretty gloomy But it is a pretty grim song Neocons have always claimed that narcissism not ideology inspired the rebelliousness of Dylan s generation Dylan the most inward looking of musicians a selfish genius gives that claim credence Other musicians pander to their public Dylan has built a career designed to satisfy no one but himself In 1965 for example Dylan went electric abandoning folk s soft sound earnest politics and rabidly loyal fans When some pop musicians turned to psychedelia in the late 60s this one stripped his songs down and played basic American country A decade later at a time of high hedonism he found Jesus and composed gospel music Dylan who modeled himself on James Dean spent a vast amount of time away from music trying to build a movie career despite a total absence of acting charisma Throughout his career Dylan has frustrated fans by deconstructing his golden oldies When he plays his hits in concerts Dylan often twists them garbling their lyrics and sandblasting their melodies into strange new creations Anyone who has attended a Dylan show in the past 20 years knows the feeling He plays a song you ve always loved and you can t even recognize it That was Tangled Up in Blue Dylan got bad but he never got stale His constant reinvention and his constant touring saved him from rock geezerhood If you go to a Rolling Stones or Eagles concert and I strongly advise against it three quarters of the crowd will be paunchy baby boomers reliving their glory days They ll sing along to 30 year old songs performed exactly as they were 30 years ago Were there any more embarrassing five minutes during the Grammies than Fleetwood Mac s performance Bloated sloppy and greedy the band regurgitated a medley of 70s hits to vast applause But Dylan has been touring nonstop since 1988 winning over an entire generation of fans to his music both new and old America may be waxing nostalgic over Dylan but there has never been a musician less concerned with nostalgia In an age when celebrities expose themselves promiscuously Dylan rejects public self revelation Is there any star about whom we know less It s not that Dylan s invisible He plays 150 concerts a year and he does occasional interviews But he says little about his music and nothing about his life His marriage his divorce his personal life All are ciphers in the public consciousness He has mellowed slightly since his younger days when he took pleasure in torturing the press Reporter What do you do with your money Dylan I wear it Another reporter What are your songs about Dylan Some of my songs are about four minutes some are about five minutes and some believe it or not are about 11 or 12 And Dylan never schmoozed much within the music business His failure to win Grammies during the 60s was hardly a surprise The Grammies have always trailed hipness by a decade or more In the mid 60s when Dylan was at his peak Herb Alpert was winning Album of the Year awards Recently the Grammies have become more current by adding categories and they have begun to repay artists for years of neglect Besides honoring Dylan the academy also gave John Fogerty his first Grammy this year Fogerty never won an award for the brilliant records he made with Credence Clearwater Revival three decades ago Dylan probably won t reinvent himself again He said recently that songs don t come to him easily anymore Time Out of Mind is his first album of new material in eight years It s a wonderful record Its blues folk songs are bleak beautiful hypnotic But it sounds like a return to something old and comfortable rather than progress to something new and strange And even if Dylan does have another transformation within him his voice may not Opera singers who take care of their voices can perform only into their sixties Dylan is 56 and his voice ripped by drugs alcohol and cigarettes and never that good to begin with is much older Writing in Slate last year Alex Ross called Time Out of Mind the first great rock album of old age in part because Dylan manages to sing around his weak voice As you can hear on this clip from Time Out of Mind s Not Dark Yet Dylan s voice doesn t have much left His range already narrow will soon be just a bleat But better to go out bleating Not Dark Yet than croaking through Blowin in the Wind for the 10 000 th time
