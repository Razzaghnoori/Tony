 November 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Mr Name There is an ever increasing interest in the study of law But there is also intense competition among law schools to attract the best and brightest students At our law school 1989 applications for admission increased by 35 over the previous year in 1990 applications for admission increased an additional 20 For this year s entering class we had more than five times the number of applications for every freshman seat While the numbers are impressive scholarships often are critical in recruiting the top students with financial need Having good students is only part of the picture An outstanding legal education requires more than just classes in case analysis and legal reasoning Fundamental lawyering skills advocacy client counseling negotiation legal research and writing are vital Several professional skills programs are offered each year to students Our Civil Practice Clinic has operated for several years and we recently added a Criminal Defense Clinic The Moot Court Program and the Indiana Law Review are consistently popular with students These programs are essential to a quality legal education but they require financial support over and above that provided by the University Private giving does have a significant impact at the law school During 1989 more than 1 300 alumni and friends responded to an appeal to fund G Kent Frandsen Memorial Scholarships Their generosity produced 258 000 to invest in an endowment account In September we were able to award this prestigious scholarship to two deserving students They are among the first of many students who will benefit from alumni generosity demonstrated during the Frandsen Scholarship fund drive There are numerous other challenges still to be met I cannot emphasize enough how vital your support is not only in providing scholarships but also in meeting a wide variety of needs ranging from purchasing additional computer terminals to travel for our moot court team It takes a partnership of private support and University funding for the law school to continue to grow in stature and influence As 1990 draws to a close I know you may be reflecting on many giving opportunities Your year end gift to the law school is an investment in its continued excellence I look forward to hearing from you Sincerely Dean P S Please take a moment to review our Annual Fund brochure Then use the enclosed donor reply card to let us know how you can help Thank you
