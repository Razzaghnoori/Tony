 Setting Sun In an early 90s Dilbert an excessively trendy manager exhorted his team to search for excellence in the total quality chaos or whatever the Japanese are doing this month Only a few years ago the business sections of airport bookstores were largely given over to tracts revealing the supposed secrets of Japanese management and the menace Japan posed to the United States Then it turned out the Japanese were human after all and everyone lost interest Western pundits having once placed Japan on a pedestal now either prefer not to discuss the subject or see Japan s failures mainly as an occasion for smug self congratulation But the new story is much more interesting than the old one How could a wealthy productive sophisticated country have gone from enviable growth in the 1980s to stagnation in the 90s and now be slipping into a downward spiral of recession and deflation True Japan is not a country on the edge of chaos as Indonesia or Russia is but that only adds to the mystery Japan isn t a place where the state is weak unable to collect taxes or convince investors that their property rights are secure Nor is it a country at the mercy of skittish foreign investors who must be persuaded to roll over its debt Japan is still the world s largest creditor So what s the explanation Inefficiency Japan has many inefficiencies that limit its productive capacity too many mom and pop stores not enough computerization in the office and so on but inefficiency per se is not the immediate problem What Japan lacks right now is not supply but demand Japan s consumers and investors just aren t spending enough to keep the country s shops and factories busy And the usual remedies for inadequate demand aren t working Interest rates have been pushed down almost as far as they can go Like the Fed the Bank of Japan normally targets the interest rate on overnight loans that banks make to each other The difference is that this rate is more than 5 percent here but basically zero there The big public spending projects the Japanese government launches every now and then do create some jobs but they never seem to yield enough bang for the yen The economy keeps relapsing while government debt keeps mounting There are three common explanations for Japan s plight Explanation 1 is that it is mainly a financial problem Japan s corporations are too burdened with debt its banks too burdened with bad loans that have never been acknowledged On this view what Japan needs is a long painful financial housecleaning Explanation 2 is that the problem is mainly psychological When the bubble economy of the 1980s remember when the square mile under the Imperial Palace was supposedly worth more than all California burst goes the story consumers and investors went into a funk that has depressed the economy and the depressed economy has perpetuated the funk On this view what Japan needs is a jump start say a massive but temporary round of tax cuts and public spending programs that will restore confidence and get people spending again Although it is tactless to say this the model everyone privately has in mind is the way wartime spending jolted the United States out of the Great Depression Thank you Adm Yamamoto Explanation 1 doesn t make sense to me If Japan s problem is demand not supply how do corporate debt and bad loans cause that problem You might say that the answer is obvious Overindebted companies can t borrow more and the banks are in no position to lend anyway But Japan s investment as a percentage of gross domestic product is the highest among major advanced economies And banks have been lending too after all where do you think those excessive debts and bad loans came from The problem is that even these high rates of investment aren t enough to absorb the huge sums that consumers apparently want to save Until recently I was more sympathetic to Explanation 2 But lately I have started to wonder whether the stubborn unwillingness of Japan s economic engine to catch is as many foreigners seem to think merely because the jump start hasn t been big enough or sustained enough And so like a small but growing number of people including at least one I have started paying attention to Explanation 3 that Japan s troubles really stem from a subtle but deadly interaction between demography and ideology Here s the story Japan like the United States only much more so is an aging society Thanks to a declining birth rate and negligible immigration it faces a steady decline in its working age population for at least the next several decades while retirees increase Given this prospect the country should save heavily to make provision for the future and lacking the kind of pay as you go Social Security system that allows Americans to ignore such realities it does But investment opportunities in Japan are limited so that businesses will not invest all those savings even at a zero interest rate And as anyone who has read John Maynard Keynes can tell you when desired savings consistently exceed willing investment the result is a permanent recession If this is the problem there is in principle a simple if unsettling solution What Japan needs to do is promise borrowers that there will be inflation in the future If it can do that then the effective real interest rate on borrowing will be negative Borrowers will expect to repay less in real terms than the amount they borrow As a result they will be willing to spend more which is what Japan needs In short this explanation suggests that inflation or more precisely the promise of future inflation is the medicine that will cure Japan s ills The trouble the other half of the Japanese trap is that while the conclusion that Japan needs inflation emerges from what looks like impeccable economic logic we live in an era in which central bankers believe and are believed to believe in price stability as an overriding goal The peculiar result of the credibility of modern central bankers as inflation hawks is that no matter how much money the Bank of Japan prints now it doesn t matter It can t lower the nominal interest rate because that rate is already zero and because people don t believe that it will allow inflation to break out any time in the future it can t lower the real interest rate either This theory is offensive to many people Deep economic problems are supposed to be a punishment for deep economic sins not an accidental byproduct of swings in the birth rate Inflation is supposed to be a deadly poison not a useful medicine Above all it seems implausible that the proposed solution to such severe difficulties could involve so little pain And while I think logic and evidence are on my side that demography not crony capitalism is the villain and inflation is the answer it is certainly possible that I am wrong But Japan worries me It s not just that we are talking about a huge economy here an economy whose woes can drag down a lot of smaller countries with it What really disturbs me is this If we don t really understand what has gone wrong in Japan who s to say the same thing can t happen to us If you missed Krugman s assessment of Kazuo Ueda click
