 Rumble in Hollywood Me I m a Seagal man Don t tell me about Van Damme s fancy kicks Van Damme s a ballet dancer a girl Here s how the fight goes Van Damme simpers around the ring like Baryshnikov for a few minutes Finally he throws a kick at Seagal s head Seagal snatches the foot out of the air twists Van Damme s leg 180 degrees and tears half a dozen knee ligaments from the bone End of story Van Damme is Van Damaged He hops around the ring begging for mercy Seagal pounds his pretty face into a mushy pulp just for fun Seagal vs Jackie Chan Forget about it Seagal s 6 feet 4 inches and full of muscle He d snap Chan like a twig My friend Jonah disagrees He takes the Terminator all the way Once Schwarzenegger wraps his Mr Universe arms around Seagal it s over Seagal can juke and wiggle and shout Japanese aphorisms till he s hoarse but it won t matter Arnold will smash his head into the ground then yank Steve s ponytail till he wails like a baby Or so Jonah says Jonah and I should settle our dispute in an alley But he wouldn t know a spinning back kick if it hit him in the ribs And I haven t fought since Lars Gutenberg TKO d me in a sixth grade playground brawl But we need to resolve this It s time to answer once and for all the most important unanswered question in cinema Who is really the greatest action hero of them all Or to put it in the vernacular which actor could kick everyone else s ass The Hollywood Rumble The Competitors in no particular order Jean Claude Van Damme the Muscles from Brussels Jackie Chan Arnold Schwarzenegger Sylvester Stallone Dolph Drago Lundgren Stallone s opponent in Rocky IV Chuck Norris David Carradine for sentiment s sake Steven Seagal Wesley Snipes and because this is fantasy Bruce Lee himself The Judges The likelihood that Arnold et al will actually climb into a ring and do battle is only slightly greater than the likelihood that Bruce Lee will rise from the grave to join them Therefore Slate has secured the services of a panel of experts to predict how the tournament would unfold The all star judges include a two time Ultimate Fighting champ black belt martial artists a U S Army Ranger a fight trainer a legendary street brawler and Jackie Chan himself For a complete list and bios The Rules None Who needs em This is real fighting Two men One ring A fight to submission knockout or hey why not death Just like the The Prelims First let s get rid of the early round losers 10 Kung Fu star David Carradine is dead last and he might die getting there He s kind of lost it says Black Belt editor Jim Coleman Put it this way Lundgren kickboxes Carradine studies tai chi those slow motion exercises that old people do in the park 9 Stallone Rocky also falls in Round One He s beefy and he learned to box for the Rocky movies but that s not enough Norris says trainer Tony Blauer would have Stallone down on the ground making convulsing pig sounds 8 Snipes He s big and he studied martial arts for 10 years Those who ve seen him practice say he s tough That experience gets him past Stallone but no further 7 Van Damme Not as good as he looks The Muscles from Brussels is fabulous on screen He claims to be a karate champion but the judges doubt his credentials He s a ballet dancer not a fighter says Ultimate Fighting champ Ken Shamrock In a real fight he d probably panic says fight historian Eric Perret He d be lucky if he got one kick off before a real fighter took him down and had him for lunch 6 Chan I adore Chan Some of the judges do too Chan does stuff that professional stuntmen won t do says Blauer He s crazy and you don t want to fight someone who has fun being crazy Chan more acrobat than martial artist is quicker and more innovative than anyone but Lee If the fighters could use props pool cues ladders chairs Chan would win the whole tournament But at 5 feet 10 inches and 150 pounds he s too small to fight barehanded in a ring against monsters like Schwarzenegger and Lundgren Chan admits this cheerfully If I can use tricks I have many ways to win But if I am standing there in a ring there is no way I can win But I could run away fast 5 Norris The sentimental favorite Twenty years ago Norris would have topped this list He is the real deal America s greatest karate champion during the 1960s Norris has pure technical ability and savvy says U S Army Ranger Maj Lucas But Norris is 55 past his prime says Blauer He should do color commentary for the fight The Semifinals Schwarzenegger vs Lundgren Seagal vs Lee Aryan Warriors Lundgren and Schwarzenegger fight first This one s a tough call because opinion is divided about Arnold The purists mock him There are huge muscle bound guys all over Venice Beach who don t know what to do when they get into fights Arnold s probably one of them says a judge But other judges drool He has enough strength to cripple you If Arnold goes in there and says I have to win for my box of cigars and Maria and the kids and the 100 million for my next picture then he could beat anyone says Blauer But Schwarzenegger won t beat Lundgren The Swede doesn t have Arnold s acting range Dolph is strictly a vicious murderers kind of guy but he s a better athlete He is an expert in kickboxing and karate and he s huge 6 feet 6 inches around 230 pounds He would stay away from Schwarzenegger and fire long cruel kicks at his jaw If Arnold charged him Dolph could feint and punch him away Eventually Arnold would tire and Dolph would kick him into submission Seagal and Lee fight second Seagal is an enigma On the one hand he s got the credentials He s an aikido black belt who once ran a dojo in Japan no mean feat for an Occidental He s also large powerful and notoriously belligerent He has the will to kill says Coleman That is not the kind of guy you want to be in a fight with But doubt lingers Seagal s a braggart most great fighters are quietly arrogant He has the mannerisms of a bully someone who abuses the weak and is cowed by the strong I don t think he has the heart or stomach for a real fight it might mess his hair up says Perret Another handicap Aikido is too stylized for a real showdown Blauer says It s a wonderful movie system but you have to be fighting a very sloppy opponent to make it work And Lee would not be a sloppy opponent The Jesus Christ Elvis and Abraham Lincoln of martial arts Lee would be a flea next to Seagal at 5 feet 7 inches and 130 lbs But he was immensely strong He trained more fanatically than anyone in the history of martial arts mastering grappling boxing karate kickboxing footfighting and other styles Unlike the other actors Lee loved to fight instigating street fracases as a teen ager in Hong Kong And he was ruthless He would as soon break an opponent s arm as let him submit The Seagal Lee fight would be quick and bloody Lee would circle Seagal Once he found an opening he would aim lightning fast kicks to Seagal s groin or knees One blow would land laming Seagal The finish would be nauseating Lee might cripple Seagal by kicking him in the throat or gouging out an eye Seagal s only hope his size If he managed to grab Lee he might be able to pin him then punch him unconscious The Final Lundgren vs Lee Probably much like the Seagal Lee fight Lee would dance and feint tempting Lundgren into kicks When Lundgren struck Lee would duck the blow counterattack with a fast low kick and retreat Lundgren s chance If he landed a kick or two it might stun Lee momentarily If Dolph were quick enough he could then pull Bruce to the ground and pin him into submission But that s not likely Probably Lee s barrage of kicks would stagger and tire Lundgren When Dolph weakened enough Bruce would break his knee and win the tournament The Reality Check In closing however let me introduce you to David Tank Abbott Tank is probably the most vicious professional fighter in America He stands 6 feet tall weighs 275 pounds and bench presses more than 600 pounds In 10 Ultimate Fighting Championship bouts he has sent six opponents to the hospital I asked him how the best fighting actors would fare against him He laughed awhile Then he said OK Seagal I would knock Seagal out in 30 seconds I would just jack him up straight arm street fighting There was a big martial arts guy I fought in the last UFC He was like Seagal He lasted about 20 or 30 seconds People thought I killed him That s what would happen to Seagal Lundgren I would slam him to the mat and beat him up on the ground Lundgren s a big guy right But I don t think he s wrestled for 21 years or boxed for six or been in more than 250 street fights or been arrested 12 times for assault and battery and attempted murder Which I have And Lee I could beat Bruce Lee drunk off a liter of Stoli I could backhand him and knock him out That s just comical
