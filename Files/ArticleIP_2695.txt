 Promise Keepers 1 NOW 0 On Oct 4 hundreds of thousands of Promise Keepers assembled in Washington D C to praise Jesus repent their sins and pledge to take charge of their families and communities Nearby protesters from the National Organization for Women chanted Racist sexist anti gay Born again bigots go away Usually the media sympathize with this particular criticism of conservative Christians but not this time How did the Promise Keepers succeed where the religious right has often failed By framing old stereotypes in new ways 1 Control vs responsibility NOW s chief rap on PK is that it tells men to take leadership at home This connotes unequal power a no no among rights based liberals and feminists But leadership has two sides PK plays down the power aspect and plays up the opposite aspect male responsibility for domestic tasks This drives a wedge between communitarian and rights based liberals isolating NOW from its usual allies PK also argues that the biblical as opposed to secular meaning of leadership is service and that the Bible while instructing wives to submit to their husbands also instructs husbands to submit to their wives This has led to the bizarre spectacle of scriptural debates on TV chat shows in which PK spokesmen and NOW president Patricia Ireland argue chapter and verse PK wins not by refuting Ireland s exegesis but by displaying subtlety in its own by arguing for example that a true leader recognizes his wife s talents and takes the initiative to help them flourish The viewer comes away persuaded that PK is much more open minded than the Christian Coalition Conversely by showing no flexibility Ireland comes across as though she s against the missionary position 2 Misogyny vs masculinity Critics accuse PK leaders of crusading against the feminization of man True they goad men to action by accusing them of acting like sissies But they also teach that masculinity lies in moral strength not in money power or stoicism They preach vulnerability humility contrition intimacy sharing weeping tenderness and surrender They deride machismo Humility they say includes letting your wife pay the bills if God gave her better math skills than you and letting her pursue the professional dreams God planted in her Which explains why Ted Koppel has compared PK founder Bill McCartney a former football coach to Alan Alda 3 Segregation vs self help As with Louis Farrakhan s Million Man March two years ago feminists have assailed PK s exclusion of women But McCartney frustrates this criticism by differing from Farrakhan in two ways He has made racial inclusion a central project of PK and he has stipulated that gender segregation must be a temporary means toward integrating and reconciling the sexes McCartney s rationale for temporary segregation draws heavily on liberal themes Men he argues have been culturally uprooted and stripped of their identity They need space to protect and repair themselves This argument combines the religious right s standard defensive posture we re not imposing our values we re just protecting them from assault with liberal gender protectionism e g girls should be educated separately from boys so as to free them from cultural pressure and multiculturalism men must preserve their unique masculine culture According to Coach McCartney women dominate church attendance and have their own Christian support groups whereas PK is men s only refuge Men won t open up and cry in women s presence because it s not safe They need the company of buddies to assure them of their masculinity so that they can break down without feeling like sissies This message has induced some liberal pundits to call the Promise Keepers pathetic thereby undermining NOW s portrayal of them as dangerous bullies 4 Materialism vs idealism In politics practical benefits usually beat principle Most women feel less oppressed by their husbands pretensions to authority than by the work that falls to them because of their husbands neglect PK leaders have won over many women and assuaged feminist pundits by addressing the latter problem Be first to the dryer they tell men Turn off the television and empty the dishwasher They instruct fathers to spend more time with their kids and to forswear adultery abandonment and domestic abuse PK routinely embarrasses feminist critics by producing testimony from women who love the way PK has transformed their husbands behavior 5 Condemnation vs compassion Opponents make much ado of PK s injunctions against abortion and homosexuality Ireland has lambasted McCartney for speaking at Operation Rescue rallies years ago and for promoting a Colorado ballot measure that would have restricted laws protecting gay rights Usually the media view these positions as mean but PK leaders take a softer approach They never speak of gays as an organized threat And when asked about homosexuality they always subsume it in a general rule against extramarital sex 6 Reproach vs repentance For decades feminists have criticized moral conservatives who blame women for untimely pregnancies and abortions Now along comes PK to blame men Instead of advocating legislation against abortion PK instructs men to stop having sex outside marriage and to stop pressuring their wives and girlfriends to have abortions To critics who construe this as an attack on abortion rights PK s defenders paraphrase the liberal slogan that NOW famously applied to abortion If you don t like Promise Keepers don t marry one The Promise Keepers talk far less about abortion and homosexuality than their critics and the media do They re more interested in spiritual self flagellation and renewal Their ventures into social topics focus on alcohol drugs domestic violence adultery divorce illegitimacy crime and urban decay 7 Puppets vs persons NOW accuses PK of being too friendly with the bad boys of the religious right media mogul James Dobson who gave PK its initial seed money and promotes it on his radio network Pat Robertson who promotes PK on television and Gary Bauer who heads the Dobson backed Family Research Council PK denies engaging in politics with these men but Ireland says PK is acting as their religious right marketing tool Far from protecting PK s reputation the boys keep trying to get inside its blouse PK President Randy Phillips urged men at the Washington assembly to set aside politics and focus on God but Operation Rescue and the FRC showed up to distribute pamphlets The FRC invited the men to sign petitions for the Partial Birth Abortion Ban thereby adding their names to its political database Others who have signed up for PK have subsequently turned up on Republican mailing lists 8 Imperialism vs enlightenment Even if PK isn t in bed with the religious right many liberals predict that its commitment to restore traditional morality will inevitably draw it into right wing politics The group s military culture plays into this indictment as do Coach McCartney s hideous sports metaphors Men he says have dropped the ball They need a halftime pep talk and a new game plan They must defend morality like offensive linemen protecting the quarterback Many of the group s speakers and supporters are prone to using Christian war metaphors battleground army of God civil war of values This kind of talk spooks most folks PK spokesmen emphatically deny a political agenda They describe the group as a revival movement aimed at changing hearts not a reform movement aimed at changing laws They point out that they postponed the Washington assembly from 1996 to 1997 to avoid getting embroiled in last year s election Unlike the Christian Coalition they don t keep a membership list and they expect to disband when God decides that PK s revival mission is complete In this dispute tone matters more than content PK needs to show less of its macho side and more of its sensitive side So its leaders have begun to play down the war metaphors They have turned the other cheek to NOW s attacks In Washington they asked the assembled men to pray for the country s political leaders instead of judging them They have also instructed the Promise Keepers to seek civic assignments from their local pastors not from the movement s elite We stop short of prescribing what that agenda should be because it s beyond our competence says PK s vice president By projecting this kind of humility PK puts its critics in the posture of aggressors Ireland s hair trigger charges of intolerance have backfired convincing the media that NOW is intolerant Ireland persistently denounces PK for excluding anyone who is not Christian roughly equivalent to denouncing a synagogue for confining its membership to Jews NOW s objections to the PK lifestyle have prompted some journalists to question where NOW gets off second guessing women who embrace that lifestyle By now it s clear who has won the war Many feminists including the president of the Ms Foundation have expressed sympathy for the Promise Keepers and an interest in coaxing them toward gender equality rather than opposing them NOW s vice president in retreat says NOW was only trying to educate people that PK isn t purely benign Ireland complains that PK spokesmen won the war because they re slick like Ralph Reed Actually they won because they aren t They admit ignorance and error They answer no win questions They listen to criticism and openly contemplate changing their ways If they were selling anything but integrity they d be a disaster
