 Background Schizophrenia and associated mental illness are complex psychiatric disorders each affecting about 1 of the world population Genetic evaluation of Schizophrenia and associated mental illness have suggested an important role for genetic factors 1 2 3 4 however no specific gene or biological marker has yet been identified Genome scans have mapped several loci in various ethnic groups Replications of these scans were positive in some cases and negative in others 2 5 6 These data as well as reports of the specific candidate genes beginning to be identified implicate genetic heterogeneity of susceptibility genes 7 8 and also sex specific differences 9 in the molecular basis of disease phenotype Linkage analyses of all published genome scans for Schizophrenia genes have identified chromosome 13q32 as one of the regions with evidence of linkage to Schizophrenia In independent genome scans Bipolar disorder has also shown linkage to this region 10 11 12 13 The linkage region for both disorders spans approximately 10 cM on chromosome 13q32 q33 14 The region between D13 S71 and D13S274 showed linkage to Bipolar disorder based on a whole genome scan with an average marker spacing of 6 cM on 13q32 Fine mapping of this region using nine additional markers with an average spacing of 0 9 cM confirms the evidence of linkage to 13q32 around markers D13S79 D13S225 15 Association analyses with GASSOC TDT and ASPEX Sib_tdt showed linkage disequilibrium signals with several markers including D13S280 which need follow up by typing more markers in the region in a larger sample size 15 Meta analysis of whole genome linkage scans further strengthens the susceptibility locus of BP on chromosome 13q32 13 All these studies clearly point towards further efforts in the identification of susceptibility genes for this disorder Based on evidence of linkage a comprehensive linkage map was developed around this region 14 Complete annotation of this region may include as many as 200 genes One approach to identify susceptibility locus is to use the candidate gene approach Studies are underway at our center to identify susceptibility variants by mutation screening of candidate genes in this region on a small series of Bipolar families showing linkage to 13q32 For the present study we have selected two candidate genes viz human peptide transporter SLC15A1 and human glypican5 GPC5 for mutation screening from this region SLC15A1 is an intestinal oligopeptide transporter also referred to as HPEPT1 that belongs to solute carrier family15 It is expressed in intestine kidney liver and brain 16 The function of SLC15A1 is to absorb and transport small peptides 17 18 The efficiency of absorption and transportation of L DOPA and its metabolite dopamine which are neurotransmitter candidates is increased by SLC15A1 19 Therefore it is an important potential gene for future drug design delivery and targeting 20 GPC5 belongs to the cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycan family and is expressed in limb kidney developing central nervous system and brain tissue 21 22 In vertebrates 6 glypican family members belonging to the proteoglycan family have so far been characterized 23 Although there is a high degree of conservation of polypeptide sequence among family members they are localized to different chromosomes Glypican5 is structurally correlated to glypican3 and localized to chromosome 13q32 Deletion of the 13q region is associated with human 13q syndrome a developmental disorder 24 Some of the proteoglycans play important functional roles in neurogenesis axon guidance synapse development 25 and cellular growth and differentiation 26 27 23 Mutations in GPC3 cause Simpson Golabi Behmel syndrome 28 29 however no mutations were detected in the GPC5 and GPC6 genes 30 The glypican1 gene has been suggested to be a good candidate for brachydactyly type E 31 Given that GPC5 is highly expressed in brain and mutations in other genes of the glypican families are associated with developmental disorder GPC5 could be a potential candidate gene for Bipolar disorder In order to identify a possible role for these candidates SLC15A1 GPC5 as susceptibility genes we performed mutation screening of the coding regions in 7 families n 20 affected with Bipolar disorder showing linkage to 13q32 First the accurate gene structure of SLC15A1 GPC5 was defined by analysis of the available draft human genomic sequence Next PCR primers and conditions for amplification and sequencing of each exon were developed and sequencing was performed Results Genomic structure We determined genomic structure of both the genes by aligning cDNA sequences with available human draft genomic sequences http www ncbi nlm nih gov The entire SLC15A1 gene was represented in one BAC clone sequence AL357553 and GPC5 in 6 BAC clone sequences Alignment of SLC15A1 cDNA sequence accession number U21936 with the genomic sequence accession no AL357553 revealed that it is a large gene with a coding sequence of 3105 bp long having 23 exons spread over 68 85 kb of genomic sequence The splice junctions follow the GT AG rule Table 1 Alignment of GPC5 cDNA accession number U66033 with the working draft sequence revealed a genomic organization of 8 exons which was represented in 6 BAC clone sequences The coding sequence of GPC5 gene is 2558 bp long and encodes 572 amino acids The first two exons of the GPC5 gene are present in BAC clone accession number AL138714 exons 3 4 5 in AC027429 exon 6 in AL162456 exon 7 in AL163537 and exon 8 in AL157363 Table 2 Most of the splice junctions follow the GT AG rule Mutation analysis No mutations were identified in the GPC5 gene in the 7 families affected with Bipolar disorder Two polymorphic variants were discovered in SLC15A1 gene one in exon 17 and another one in exon 23 Sequence analysis revealed a T to C Figure 1A substitution in third position of codon encoding alanine at 1403 position of mRNA and A to G Figure 1B substitution at position 2242 of mRNA Of these 6 individuals 3 affected and 3 normal were homozygous CC exon 17 15 11 affected and 4 normal were heterozygous TC exon 17 and three were heterozygous AG exon 23 Discussion Gene mapping studies using microsatellite markers have identified chromosome 13q32 as one of the putative loci for Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder 10 11 12 13 15 To begin identification of a susceptibility gene for Bipolar disorder we have screened two candidate genes SLC15A1 and GPC5 on the basis of their genetic localization within the 10 cM region of chromosome 13q32 14 The entire SLC15A1 gene was represented in one BAC clone sequence AL357553 and GPC5 in 6 BAC clone sequences Alignment of SLC15A1 cDNA sequence with genomic sequence accession no AL357553 revealed that it is a large gene with a coding sequence of 3105 bp long having 23 exons spread over 68 85 kb of genomic sequence The splice junctions follow the GT AG rule Table 1 A wide variety of transporters are found in the intestine and several genetic disorders have been shown to result from deficient intestinal transporters 20 SLC15A1 consists of 708 amino acids with putative 12 transmembrane domains and 2 putative protein kinase C phosphorylation sites Exon intron boundaries occur mostly in the loops connecting transmembrane segments 32 suggesting a modular gene structure reflecting the TMS loop repeat units in SLC15A1 Computer modeling and site directed mutagenesis studies suggested a list of amino acids for the transport functional activities Tyrosine Y167 and histidyl residues H57 H111 and H121 are two of these amino acids playing important roles in the function of transporters 33 34 35 36 In our mutation screening of families with Bipolar disorder we did not find variants at these positions However we did identify two variants in the SLC15A1 gene one in exon 17 and another one in exon 23 Sequence analysis revealed a T to C substitution in the third position of codon encoding alanine at 1403 position exon 17 of mRNA Of these 6 individuals were homozygous CC 29 and 15 were heterozygous TC 71 exon 17 However there was no amino acid change Substitution of T to C in normal members as well suggests it is a polymorphic variant and not a pathogenic mutation In exon 23 the variation observed was an A to G substitution in the untranslated region at position 2242 of mRNA Of these eighteen were homozygous AA 86 and three were heterozygous AG 14 The variant in exon 17 was also found in the SNP database NCBI SNP cluster ID rs1339067 although the population frequency was not reported An association study of this variant in a large population will aid in understanding the potential role of the SLC15A1 gene in Bipolar disorder Alignment of the GPC5 cDNA with the working draft sequence revealed a genomic organization of 8 exons which was represented in 6 BAC clone sequences Table 2 The whole GPC5 gene is 2558 bp long and encodes 572 amino acids The first two exons of the GPC5 gene are present in BAC clone accession number AL138714 exons 3 4 5 in AC027429 exon 6 in AL162456 exon 7 in AL163537 and exon 8 in AL157363 Table 2 Most of the splice junctions follow the GT AG rule The exon structure was confirmed by comparing the cDNA with nucleotide contig NT_009866 While we finished screening this gene for mutations its genomic structure was published and confirms the presence of 8 exons with exon intron boundaries following the AG GT rule with a size of approximately 2 Mb 30 No mutations or polymorphisms were identified in the GPC5 gene in the 7 families affected with Bipolar disorder decreasing the likelihood that this gene is involved in the etiology of Bipolar disorder Several disorders have been reported due to mutations in glypican gene families 31 37 and interestingly due to deletion of region on chr 13 q32 24 38 It would be interesting to study the occurrence of Schizophrenia or other associated mental illnesses in individuals with these deletions Mutation screening of the glypican genes in these patients might give clue to Schizophrenia susceptibility locus Absence of pathogenic mutations in the two genes GPC5 and SLC15A1 studied in seven families of Bipolar disorder suggests that these genes are presumably not involved in the susceptibility locus for Bipolar disorder in the families screened However due to the complex nature of these diseases no definite conclusions can be drawn We cannot rule out genetic heterogeneity for these genes and suggest studying more families For example the NOTCH 4 gene that is located on chromosome 6p21 3 confers susceptibility to Schizophrenia in the British population but not in the Japanese population 39 Genetic heterogeneity is very common in hereditary deafness 40 also the prevalence of mutations in the connexin 26 gene is a major cause of non syndromic autosomal recessive deafness that varies in different populations 41 Considering the complex nature of the disease and the supportive evidence of linkage to chromosome 13q32 13 15 it would be worth while to continue further studies to find out Schizophrenia susceptibility genes at this critical region As the human genome reference sequence is nearing completion the analysis of genetic variation is becoming important Our plans are to annotate all the genes for a 10 mega base region on chromosome 13 and develop a high density SNP map Aim is to identify variants in the critical region to predict haplotypes from numerous variants observed and perform mutation analysis by direct sequencing with the ultimate objective of identifying specific sequence haplotype associated with the disease phenotype Methods Study Subjects A total of 7 nuclear families n 20 affected with Bipolar disorder were selected The seven families consist of five normal parents five affected parents seven affected patients one normal sib and two affected members These families were selected from four known pedigree series with evidence of linkage to chromosome 13q32 15 Genomic structure determination The genomic structures of SLC15A1 accession number U21936 and GPC5
