 okay are are you an exercise fanatic are you well i m sort of an exercise fanatic i m big on swimming oh really yeah well that s way north too i guess you have to swim inside huh yeah i uh i i i find i do more swimming in the wintertime than i do in the summer really yeah wow uh my wife has a sailboat so i wind up on the sailboat a lot in the summertime um hum but it s the winter months that i can get serious about swimming oh well that s good that s that s one of the best ones i understand no stress on the joints well it winds up being a little stress on the shoulder joints after a while yeah i guess so but as far as the weight bearing yeah well i find that uh if i want to lose some weight that uh i can t do it unless i exercise as well yeah that s true plus even if you lose weight and don t exercise it ends up just looking you know looking unhealthy yeah well last year i had a campaign to lose about uh twenty pounds and uh i wound up swimming about three hundred and sixty miles during the year wow do you swim like at a at a Y or yes uh Fairfax County has uh a number of uh park authority uh recreation centers and all of them have uh at least a twenty five meter or twenty five yard uh swimming pool oh and in fact out here in Oakton we have uh there s a fifty meter uh pool called Oakmar and it s sort of a uh uh a landmark pool it s a very uh excellent design you know top rated pool hm and good uh gallery facilities for competitive uh events and things like that really is it like Olympic size it s Olympic size yes wow are you are you a TI employee no i uh work for E Systems what which is which is another Dallas company but i m at the uh Melpar division here in uh Falls Church yeah well the reason i ask you i i m a TI employee and uh we have a fitness center you know that s on site hum that makes it real real convenient because i tend to find that once i get home that s it you know yeah i tend to not want to go anywhere after that but this way you know you can go to the fitness center right from work and they have aerobics and you know all this machines and all that sort of stuff we re not we re not high rollers like Dallas we don t have a pool but yeah yeah well i have we have a uh recreation center which is almost right across the street from our uh office oh that s good and so i hit there at seven o clock in the morning get in a half hour swim and still make it to work on time oh that s great yeah morning is usually a better time to exercise but i usually find that after work is when i have the time to do it um well i get to put work after work i i have to hurry home and uh and help out with the kids and you have honeydews yeah fix things around the house and all those kind of chores honeydews so the morning hour is my time to myself yeah well that s great i i like to to work out some in the morning but it s not like you know i usually use the video or something like that to do oh you plus i like to dance you know oh you do the aerobic uh dancing then um hum um hum and and on Saturdays i go to a jazzercise class that s my yeah well that looks that looks like so much work to me i oh it s fun jazzercise is really fun yeah but you put out a lot of energy uh keeping up that pace yeah there there s a lot of energy i i i like to belly dance too but there s not the same you know you don t get the aerobic yeah workout as much but jazzercise is what it s it s so much fun that you forget you re exercising you know aerobics you don t forget hum you know you re exercising oh and we started the bench aerobics too i don t know if you ve seen that i haven t seen that no that s a fairly new thing it s just like uh one step yeah you know it s like a box and you just step up and down and up and down and up down do different variations you know change feet and and you d be surprised how quick that gets the pulse rate up oh okay it s a it s a lot quicker and and that way it s completely low impact here s no jumping or you know no jarring on the knee bones yeah i i see some of these exercise machines that uh it looks like you re constantly walking up stairs yeah uh huh and uh i think that should get your heart rate right up there at the maximum and keep it there yeah that will do it yeah we have one of those too but it s boring yeah yeah i can see that well i a lot of people complain about swimming that that s uh boring oh but that wouldn t be boring like walking up stairs but i find that uh over over the years i ve developed the ability to keep track of my uh workout and at the same time uh do some creative thinking while i m swimming yeah so i i can write letters to congressman and uh organize reports and uh right well do you count your laps or do you just have a time segment that you i i count them i i swim a sixteen fifty every day and uh so that s sixty six lengths of the pool jeez and uh i sometimes i may not be conscious of keeping count but uh you know every now and then when i do check up and say where is my count i check it relative to the clock and and i also wind up coming out even even side of the pool yeah yeah well that s neat do you do you look forward to doing it or do you sometimes have to force yourself until you get started i usually uh look forward to it uh and in fact some mornings i uh almost feel a necessity yeah to uh to get out and uh go for the swim i think uh there is something to this endorphins yeah uh thing but uh when i m exercising regularly i i feel the need to to do more exercise um hum and then when you don t for some reason you feel real lethargic yeah it seems like like the the the less you exercise the tireder you are i m sorry um hum yeah yeah that s true sometimes i find i have to kick myself though to get started and once i get started you know it s it feels good and yeah well sometimes sometimes uh i ve had the effect that if i swim in the morning uh i get an urge to go back and swim again at lunch time wow do you have time to do that in your job and just barely it amounts to running out the back door and uh heading for the pool jumping in swimming some sprints or something like that and then running back again course you probably i have i have waist length hair so you probably don t have that problem yeah you know that s a problem with with getting getting that much wet um hum but well i ve i ve lost most of my hair so that s no real problem oh then nobody really complains if i uh if i come in sort of half wet yeah well gee well that sounds neat and you do that like like almost every day or what about weekends almost every day i uh this spring has been uh a little hard to keep up the pace because uh we ve had a lot of family activities my wife has taken up skiing oh and uh she she twisted water skiing or snow skiing snow skiing she did water skiing when she was uh young oh um hum and uh i think she was uh pretty competitive at one point she had a bad accident that uh put her out of competition oh really uh but she s taking up snow skiing and she got me involved oh that s good exercise so i was out there you know stark terror coming down the side of the hill God really and we had another expedition where we took the three little kids up and uh taught them to ski how how old are your kids are they and uh seven eight and ten oh that s a good age to start something like that yeah it was it was delightful watching them uh learn they uh they went out with their individual personalities and picked it up in their own little way um hum uh the one we thought would be the most timid uh turned out to be the one that stuck with it and was the first to learn really and the other two got jealous and they went out and says well i m going to go and do it too so so they learned too little competition there and uh we went to a good resort and the instructors were there uh took a liking to the kids so next thing you know they re they ve got the kids off on the uh some of the bigger slopes really did they have a separate uh like class or something for the kids or is it everybody together the place where we went has a separate area for beginners it s called the Sun Bowl um hum and they just put instructors out there and you you sign up for instruction and they just give you an arm band and if you see an instructor who s not doing anything you just tap him on the shoulder and ask him questions and they ll show you things oh and so they re pretty much available all day long um hum and you can either take instruction or practice or or just enjoy yourself whatever you like yeah and the instructors are very enthusiastic and of course they picked up the kids and and took them on some of the more advanced slopes yeah did you all start this year or last year uh yes my wife did some last year um hum and got started and so she grabbed me by the ear and made me do it this year do you all have have you had a good snow this year we were lucky um we were going to Seven Springs up in Pennsylvania and the first time we went up there the instructor said that was the first uh really good weekend that they d had this year really and uh Charlotte went up in the uh middle of the season
