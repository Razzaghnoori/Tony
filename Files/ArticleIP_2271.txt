 Newt Descending He was persecuted tormented and crucified But at Easter he rose That at least is what Newt Gingrich s apostles are saying about him pointing to their man s successful trip to the Far East and his return to public visibility following the congressional spring recess Newt is sounding like his old self again Wednesday he called for abolition of both the capital gains tax and the estate tax For more on the capital gains debate see this Dialogue between Michael Kinsley and John C Goodman In an hour long speech to GOPAC Monday night he boasted about the Contract With America s influence in Mongolia Once again the historical pedant he explained why the Clinton campaign finance scandal which he previously called merely worse than Watergate is actually tantamount to the fall of Rome In ancient times sending lobbyists and offering bribes to Rome became the easiest and most profitable route to wealth and power for many local leaders Gingrich said If it is proven that the Chinese Communists were trying to funnel money into a presidential defense fund then the Roman model of foreign corruption will indeed be raising its head within the American system Contrary to the media hype and rumors floating around Washington Gingrich will probably not be deposed before the next election To get rid of him would require not just a few dozen defections but a majority vote of the House Republican caucus There is still no fully plausible successor and sacking Gingrich would mean Republicans running in 1998 on a record of catastrophe rather than mere inaction At the same time the precariousness of Newt s position is making him and other Republican leaders act in weird unpredictable ways The speaker s shakiness has turned the House into a strange and somewhat silly place The most obvious effect of Gingrich s insecurity is on his own behavior which has consisted lately of dramatic lurches first to the left then to the right Before his China trip Gingrich s comeback strategy was to show that he was not the radical right ogre of Mother Jones direct mail He made nice with Jesse Jackson and announced that he was dropping affirmative action as an issue He warmly received Alec Baldwin and other liberal actors who came to lobby on behalf of the National Endowment for the Arts Though Baldwin had been quoted calling him evil Gingrich invited him and the other thespians back for dinner and declared that the NEA might not be such a bad thing after all Conservatives who were annoyed by Newt s nice guy act were truly outraged when he suggested that one way to get a balanced budget agreement might be to put off tax cuts This gambit was based on what was at least a plausible political calculation If Republicans could separate their tax cuts in the public mind from the domestic budget cuts necessary to balance the budget Democrats could no longer accuse them of throwing old people into the snow in order to save money for Steve Forbes The idea was also to do with taxes what House Republicans had shrewdly done with welfare reform in 1996 holding the president s feet to the fire by sending him a politically popular stand alone bill But the result of Gingrich s suggestion was blind fury on the right Eleven of the freshman hotheads elected in 1994 openly challenged the speaker s leadership In a short shocking article in the Weekly Standard Rep Peter King of New York called Gingrich political road kill In the last Congress Gingrich didn t have to stand for this kind of insubordination Faced with an episode of dissent back then he stripped one nonconformist freshman of a choice committee assignment Now however Gingrich lacks the power to punish and can do little more than suck up to his conservative critics He apologized profusely for the misunderstanding about his comments on tax cuts His GOPAC speech was filled with right wing red meat such as a proposed crackdown on the political influence of unions and a demand that the Internal Revenue Service be brought to heel On April 9 he surprised everyone by proposing a more aggressive tax cut than any of his more conservative GOP colleagues calling for an end to all taxes on both capital gains and estates changes that would cost the Treasury some 300 billion over five years In keeping with conservative newspeak Gingrich referred to these as the taxes on savings and job creation and the tax on death benefits Gingrich is not the only one behaving erratically As he moves to shore up his right wing credentials his more authentically conservative rivals are trying to establish their own credibility in the eyes of moderate Republicans The first to suggest that going after the NEA again might not be such a hot idea was not Gingrich but the libertarian Majority Leader Dick Armey When he came out with his put off the tax cuts suggestion Gingrich was actually endorsing a proposal by ultracon Republican Whip Tom DeLay DeLay has been taking sudden umbrage at accusations that he is a tool of corporate lobbyists Armey has been losing weight and restraining his proclivity toward quasioffensive humor At one press conference earlier this year he joked I m happy to be black I mean back and chided journalists about their preference for the Old Testament Gossip swirls about the four way rivalry among the top Republicans who rank just below Gingrich Armey DeLay John Boehner and Bill Paxon The latest rumor has Armey and Paxon teaming up as speaker and majority leader All this jockeying has forestalled any real Republican agenda Compared with the hyperactive 104 th Congress the 105 th has been a joke What little time it has actually been in session it has spent on issues like a resolution supporting the Georgia judge who posted the Ten Commandments in his courtroom and a congressional gold medal for Frank Sinatra Last week the House passed a resolution banning the use of federal funds for assisted suicide Of course no federal funds go to assisted suicide In a caucus meeting last week Gingrich reportedly said that Republican critics who complained he had no agenda weren t smart enough to understand it The most damaging consequence of Gingrich s weakness is the difficulty of negotiating what might be the GOP s proudest achievement an agreement to balance the budget The paradox is that while a deal would shore up Newt s position he hasn t got enough power to negotiate one Though the GOP and the administration are quite close on the numbers those on Newt s right flank are likely to portray any agreement with the president as a capitulation born of weakness In 1995 Gingrich had the clout to make a centrist budget compromise stick Now such an agreement would probably provoke open rebellion divide the House and deprive the speaker of a working majority The result is a complex stalemate Republicans face the prospect of running in 1998 with a discredited unpopular speaker who is nonetheless impossible to dethrone and with no record of accomplishment As the Democratic National Committee sinks deeper into scandal related debt the Democrats can look forward to running without a functional party organization to support them The lame vs the destitute it could be a great race
