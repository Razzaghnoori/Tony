                oh i just want to know do tax payers get what they get back what they what they uh put into i kind of doubt it because of because of the latest check writing scandal i should have such good uh such such good use of of the public fund   okay   uh i dont know what do you think   well it seems like its a tremendous pressure to uh reduce taxes and reduce government spending but that uh somehow it just seems to go up and up and  seems like taxes go up and and benefits go down i dont quite understand it all i think it must be a result of centralization         centralization is suppose to um improve efficiency but i somehow i have a feeling it it uh reduces efficiency   well it sort of i i thinking more like the purest principle being at work you know managers such as manager managers in particularly managers bureaucracies exist to uh seek seek to multiply subordinates and not rivals       so   well i think one of the problem is again isnt really the centralization but uh the further removed uh you get from cause and effect   umhum   further removed cause and effect get the the uh more problems you have i remember an incident um   back when i was in Dallas   umhum   where there were there was a push to to put in some regional airports and uh   i dont remember exactly what it was but one of the reason for putting these in was that that they they wouldnt really have to pay for them i think theyd have to just ten percent or maybe it was twenty percent or something and they could get federal funds to do the rest   umhum   and it seemed to me that that was a crazy reason that it basically if it was not uh beneficial enough to uh the local uh economy and the local residence to have uh regional airports around the Dallas area then why the hell would it be uh important to the federal government and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why um centralization or federal funding is a bad idea and why it causes us to have um increased tax rates and yet not much to show for it   um tremendous deficit anyway uh yeah i i dont know i i uh i rather think were not going to see the end of the deficit for some time although if the entire incumbent mood holds up we may there may be some changes this fall im not sure theyre theyre kind of strange because there are a lot of incumbents running as outsiders now uh running against Washington so thats so we have the outsiders doing the insiders bid you know   hum   trying to get themselves reelected i was just thinking thats kind of strange i dont think theyre going to i dont think i dont know how many of them are going to get reelected that way especially after they after all three hundred fifty two or how ever many names got published officially you know we had Robert K Dornam whos been a gap fly of a lot of uh hes hes been uh uh Orange Countys um uh  i dont know i embarrassment i guess hes hes really terrible they um never voted down a a weapons package ever and uh he he went out and and uh said claimed that that  that one check that he he uh he he wrote that bounced was to get a uh to get a something like a statue of a Madonna for his for his for his backyard or something ridiculous like that it was it was pretty funny   well i think its easy to you know once you get in the position of power its easy to just sort of relax and uh abuse that power just naturally without hardly trying   yeah yeah i very much so um you know   its hard to be ethical i think   umhum   that must be why we see so many that i mean its hard to be ethical when you are a powerful person is what i meant to say   yeah   that may be why we see so many corrupt officials   do you think its because other people because people are spending other people money they got   uh no i just think its because power corrupt absolutely
