 A year ago I received an E mail from a research scientist at a major pharmaceutical company The scientist had read my articles on whistleblowers who had raised concerns about the undue influence of the pharmaceutical industry on American medicine My industry source had information for me about drug company practices but out of fear of career ruin would only talk on the condition that I would conceal the scientist s identity For the next year or so I had repeated contacts with the scientist As I listened to this researcher and to the other medical whistleblowers that I continued to interview it occurred to me that each whistleblower was like the proverbial blind man with a hand on the elephant Each could describe one piece of the puzzle but the full picture could only emerge by bringing these whistleblowers together With an eye to focusing on the systemic problems that have allowed American medicine to be unduly influenced by industry on May 15 2005 I brought together five whistleblowers in Washington D C I asked them each to tell their story and to suggest ways to restore objectivity to medicine and medical research The Whistleblowers Four whistleblowers attended in person and the anonymous industry scientist participated via speakerphone The whistleblowers came from an extraordinary variety of different professional backgrounds David Graham This Food and Drug Administration FDA safety officer raised concerns about the cardiovascular side effects of rofecoxib Vioxx and other Cox 2 inhibitors He testified at a United States Senate Finance Committee hearing on rofexocib the FDA and Merck 1 2 Graham attended the roundtable in his own personal capacity and was not representing the FDA Each whistleblower was like the proverbial blind man with a hand on the elephant Allen Jones This investigator at the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General led an investigation into an off the books account funded in part by drug companies from which payments were made to state employees to develop a medication treatment algorithm He filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Pennsylvania Office of the Inspector General to protect his right to publicly discuss his findings and was later fired from his job for talking to the press 3 6 Stefan Kruszewski This Harvard trained psychiatrist was hired by the Bureau of Program Integrity in the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare to oversee the state s mental health and substance misuse programs He filed a law suit in a federal court in the Middle District of Pennsylvania charging that he was fired after uncovering widespread abuse and fraud in the bureau 7 8 Kathleen Slattery Moschkau This former drug representative left the pharmaceutical industry after witnessing marketing practices that she found disturbing She wrote and directed the movie Side Effects a fictionalized account of her experiences 9 10 The anonymous research scientist This is an industry insider who said to me ahead of the roundtable that the culture of secrecy at drug companies too often results in claims that are closer to propaganda than science Lessons Learned from the Roundtable Ties between drug regulators and industry may influence new drug approval David Graham described the frustrations he had felt in his almost 20 years of experience as an FDA drug safety officer Although he was instrumental he said in getting ten drugs off the market because of safety concerns his experience was like a salmon swimming upstream a single individual against the tide The tide he said is an entire institution whose mission is to approve drugs and make industry happy The FDA said Graham is in a collaborative relationship with industry The FDA gets money from drug companies through the Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 see http www fda gov cber pdufa htm to approve new drugs and approve them more quickly The mindset at the FDA he said is that we will find a reason to approve a drug no matter how small the indication for the drug Graham explained that a senior official at the FDA had told him industry is our client When the FDA knows there is a serious problem with a new drug he said the FDA deals with this by saying well we ll handle it in labeling even though said Graham FDA knows labeling doesn t work There is no independent voice for drug safety in the United States he said The upper level managers in the FDA s Office of Drug Safety are appointed from the FDA s Office of New Drugs which approves new medicines This makes the Office of Drug Safety captive he said to the Office of New Drugs The anonymous scientist said that in order to speed up drug approval companies don t measure things like whether we are really curing the disease or prolonging life or preventing hospitalization or whether a patient is truly more functional Oftentimes we re measuring intermediate lesser things markers predictors we hope of these clinical endpoints but they may or may not be accurate And the FDA said the scientist requires just two positive studies to grant approval to a new drug but there is no limitation on how many negative studies can be done before one or two positive studies are produced This can lead to approval of a drug even when most studies are negative or show no effect Both Graham and the anonymous scientist suggested putting an end to the Prescription Drug User Fee Act and Graham argued that there needs to be independent authority for those in charge of drug safety They indicated that two bills in Congress introduced by Senator Grassley and by Congressman Hinchey at least partly address these concerns The pharma FDA complex has to be dismantled said Graham and the American people have to insist on that otherwise we re going to have disasters like Vioxx that happen in the future The race to approve new drugs without proper safety testing may be compromising the public s health Drug companies assiduously avoid acquiring information about side effects said the industry scientist Drug companies will not conduct safety studies unless they have to meaning basically that they re required by a regulator and that rarely happens High risk patients who might have a bad reaction to a drug said the scientist are excluded from studies deliberately even though when the drug is approved these patients will be targeted for sales When a safety study is proposed within the industry said the scientist a typical response will be that if we conducted a study to find out if there was a safety problem people would learn about it and think we had a problem which would destroy the image of safety that has been so carefully constructed There is no independent voice for drug safety in the United States Studies are too small and are conducted over too brief a period to properly assess safety The largest studies the phase three studies which might be several thousand people last for a few months If drugs kill one in several thousand per year this would be a public health catastrophe A blockbuster drug with that kind of hazard associated with it could be associated with tens of thousands of deaths a year and it would never be detected in studies of the kind that we routinely submit and are the basis for approval These drugs said the scientist and these kinds of risks are essentially out there now unlabeled unnoticed all beneath the radar The scientist said that to ensure that safety problems will go unnoticed we compound the problem of conducting small studies by setting a statistical threshold for acknowledging the safety problem that is so high that you know in advance it could never be reached for any serious side effect like myocardial infarction This practice said the scientist virtually ensures that if a bad side effect happens to show up it s not going to reach the arbitrary level that we call statistically significant and the company can maintain that it s just bad luck And if a bad result does happen typically a company is not going to publish the study at all If they do publish it the bad result can be omitted as not statistically important The funding of state officials by industry may be affecting prescribing patterns Allen Jones described how he believed that drug companies were acting at the state level to influence the prescribing of psychiatric medications I began to investigate an account into which pharmaceutical companies were paying money that was being accessed by state employees he said Additionally I found that various pharmaceutical companies were paying state employees directly also giving them trips perks lavish meals transportation honorariums up to 2 000 for speaking in their official capacities at drug company events They were given unrestricted educational grants that were deposited into an off the books account unregistered unmonitored literally operated out of a drawer These same state officials he said were responsible for dictating clinical policy and writing guidelines for the treatment of patients in the state system These officials were he said receiving money from companies with a stake in the guidelines The protocol they the officials were developing was called the Texas Medication Algorithm Project TMAP which began in Texas in the mid 90s It outlined detailed medication guidelines for schizophrenia depression and bipolar disorder It recommends almost exclusive usage of newer patented very expensive atypical antipsychotics SSRIs selective serotonin uptake inhibitors and mood stabilizers The Texas Medication Algorithm Project said Jones was based on expert consensus from industry supported meetings Jones said that when he wanted to investigate these findings he was shut down I was told point black Look drug companies write checks to politicians they write checks to politicians on both sides of the aisle back off He was told he said to quit being a salmon quit swimming against a stream He wouldn t back down from his investigation he said and was demoted On November 22 2002 he filed a civil rights lawsuit to preserve my job and my right to speak out His employer he said took him off investigative duties altogether Stefan Kruszewski who has filed a law suit in a federal court in Pennsylvania raised concerns to his seniors in the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare about prescribing practices in the state that he did not feel were evidence based and said he lost his job for raising his concerns For example he alerted his seniors to the off label prescribing of the anticonvulsant gabapentin Neurontin for mood disorders and addictive disorders The pharmaceutical industry is the single most powerful lobbying group on Capitol Hill outspending even the oil and banking industries said Jones It should come as no surprise that the ties go far beyond just the mental health officials who wrote the guidelines but extend to many of the politicians who in the end allowed an investigation into pharma corruption to be dropped and the investigator me to be fired Efforts to detect and deter fraud and abuse due to these conflicts he said will be likely to be undermined as long as those charged with detecting fraud and abuse like the Pennsylvania Inspector General are appointed by politicians who are themselves beholden to the drug industry Such positions should instead be filled by career civil servants and not political appointees Regulatory agencies are not being held accountable In comments that echoed his testimony to the US Senate Finance Committee Graham said that FDA was the single greatest obstacle to doing anything effective with Vioxx As a result nearly 60 000 people probably died from that drug That s as many of our soldiers that were killed in the Vietnam war who died as a result of Vioxx use And FDA had the opportunity the responsibility to stop that and didn t In fact FDA allowed it to continue In my book FDA shares in the responsibility for those deaths and yet it s not being held accountable by Congress Congress itself added Graham is deeply beholden to the drug industry since many politicians receive often quite a bit of campaign contributions from the industry Kruszewski reflected upon the problems he said he had encountered in Pennsylvania saying that there is no accountability in the system for oversight agencies He has become a stronger advocate than ever for a federal patient bill of rights Marketing departments can influence doctors prescribing habits The research scientist said that the job was attractive because of the many excellent drugs developed such as drugs to treat HIV but the scientist also saw drugs marketed in a way that will exaggerate the benefits and conceal the risks Kathleen Slattery Moschkau gave an insider s view of drug marketing practices from her former experiences as a drug rep She clutched her head in disbelief as she told the roundtable that doctors would come up to her with patients charts asking her for advice on treating patients Slattery Moschkau like most of the drug representatives she came to know over the years had no science background at all Drug companies assiduously avoid acquiring information about side effects The various techniques drug representatives were trained in to educate doctors eventually proved to be not just comical but also scary she said Whether it was hiring training what we were told to say about drugs and what we were told not to say it was marketing not science that dominated One of the techniques used by drug companies was to buy doctors prescribing records so drug representatives knew to the dime what drugs doctors were prescribing and could tailor their marketing to them Drug representatives developed personality profiles on doctors and were taught to pitch their sales to specific personality types Representatives were compensated she said by how many prescriptions we could encourage Both Slattery Moschkau and the industry scientist described tensions within drug companies between marketing departments and industry scientists The marketing spin on things said the scientist carries the day The published medical literature contains many biases When studies are published said the scientist they are frequently written not by the trained research scientist who might have designed and analyzed the study but by a designated medical writer with little if any background in research but who is trained instead to craft the findings of the study in the best possible way for the company The body of literature available to the public said the scientist is a biased sample of what companies want people to see The research scientist described a culture of secrecy which makes it hard even for industry scientists tasked with ensuring drug safety to obtain the full datasets needed to genuinely understand a drug s risk benefit profile Conclusion Whistleblowers have been compared to bees they have just one sting to use and using it may lead to career suicide 11 Many of the whistleblowers at the roundtable said they had experienced retaliation from their employers for raising concerns but all had felt obligated to speak out about practices in medicine and medical research that they believe are risking the public s health or safety Graham said he felt trapped by the truth and had to act There are bigger issues here said Kruszewski I felt right from the start that if I wallowed in self pity about being fired and having my belongings piled in the gutter that I would never understand why all these things were happening The bigger issue is that we ve got people in the pharmaceutical industry and the health care industry all acting in synchrony Each of these whistleblowers in very different ways from making a satiric film to speaking out in Congress has shone light on how this synchrony may be compromising the integrity of American medicine We should not have to rely on medical whistleblowers to alert us to these fault lines If we are to restore objectivity to drug development prescribing and safety monitoring we must be willing to examine and change all of the institutions that allow this synchrony to occur
