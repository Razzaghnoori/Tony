 Background Systematic microarray based studies are rapidly advancing the fields of biology and medicine Most commonly mRNA expression levels are measured on a global often genome wide scale Studies employing this approach have contributed to our understanding of diverse biological processes from yeast physiology 1 2 to human cancer 3 More recently microarray based approaches have been used to characterize physical properties of the genome for example by mapping transcription factor binding sites 4 5 and histone modifications 6 7 Microarray based genome mapping protocols utilize the technique of chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP to isolate genomic DNA associated in vivo with a transcription factor of interest or with histones exhibiting a particular post translational modification In ChIP whole cells are treated with formaldehyde to covalently link DNA and associated proteins and the resulting mix is fragmented by sonication Protein DNA complexes are then isolated using antibodies specific for a protein of interest e g a transcription factor or a histone exhibiting a particular covalent modification Finally cross links are reversed and protein degraded to yield purified DNA Microarrays have proven particularly valuable for the unbiased analysis and identification of DNA isolated by ChIP Microarray based mapping poses unique technical challenges For example ChIP typically yields only sub microgram quantities of DNA Hence an amplification step is required to generate sufficient quantities of nucleic acid for microarray analysis This contrasts with typical mRNA expression analyses where microgram quantities of mRNA are available for direct analysis Furthermore genomic DNA lacks a universal sequence tag for priming amplification and labeling steps Again this contrasts with expression analysis where the mRNA 3 polyA tail provides a useful priming sequence for cDNA synthesis These obstacles have been overcome by two related protocols both of which are based on the polymerase chain reaction PCR The first protocol uses a ligation mediated PCR strategy LM PCR in which ChIP DNA is ligated to short DNA linkers and then PCR amplified using the linker sequence for priming 4 The second uses a random amplification strategy R PCR in which template DNA is first copied using a specialized primer with degenerate 3 sequence and known 5 sequence and then PCR amplified using the known 5 sequence for priming 5 8 9 In both cases the PCR steps yield quantities of nucleic acid sufficient for microarray analysis Labeled product can be generated by incorporating fluorescent or otherwise modified nucleotides during PCR LM PCR has been used in several studies including a systematic genome wide location analysis of yeast transcriptional activators 10 and an unbiased search for E2F binding sites in a subset of human promoters 11 Studies employing the R PCR approach include genome wide analyses of silencing enzymes 12 and histone modifications 6 7 in yeast and a mapping of GATA 1 binding sites within the human globin locus 13 There are however limitations of a PCR based approach Due to the exponential kinetics of PCR amplification sequence dependent and length dependent biases may be amplified exponentially Furthermore theoretical considerations suggest that amplification of low abundance species can be highly variable Alternative amplification approaches have been developed for microarray based mRNA analyses A widely used protocol developed by Eberwine and colleagues uses T7 based linear amplification 14 In this procedure double stranded cDNAs are synthesized from mRNA by reverse transcription priming off the 3 polyA tail and second strand synthesis T7 promoters are incorporated during the cDNA synthesis and T7 RNA polymerase is subsequently used to transcribe multiple RNA copies from each cDNA this process is termed in vitro transcription or IVT Recent studies have applied this approach to microarray analysis and found that it faithfully preserves the initial representation of RNA species 15 16 17 Other reports suggest that PCR based amplification may also preserve this representation 18 However IVT remains more attractive from a theoretical perspective as biases should be less severe due to the linear nature of the amplification 19 To improve the accuracy of microarray based genome mapping protocols we have developed a linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA This protocol uses a terminal transferase tailing step and second strand synthesis to incorporate T7 promoters at the ends of the DNA fragments prior to IVT We find that this approach efficiently amplifies as little as 2 5 ng of genomic DNA Here the protocol is presented along with a systematic evaluation of its efficacy and fidelity Results T7 based amplification of genomic DNA The T7 based IVT protocol for linear amplification of genomic DNA is shown in Figure 1 Since ChIP DNA is fragmented randomly and lacks a universal sequence for priming we optimized a terminal transferase step to add polyT tails to the 3 ends of each DNA strand We are able to generate tails with a tight distribution around an optimal length of 30 bps by including a low concentration of a terminating dideoxycytidine nucleotide data not shown An anchored primer adapter was designed that contains a 5 T7 promoter and a 3 polyA 18 bps in length stretch terminating in a single C G or T base This adapter is annealed to the genomic DNA fragments and Klenow is added for second strand synthesis In addition to extending the primer adapter the 3 5 exonuclease activity of Klenow should trim 3 polyTs in excess of the 18 bps complementary to the adapter and allow fill in of the appropriate complementary bases Fig 1 For each dsDNA species present in the starting material these reactions generate two dsDNAs with T7 promoters at opposite ends The reaction products are used as template for IVT using the Eberwine method 14 From a starting material of ChIP DNA from 2 10 8yeast cells this protocol yields between 30 and 60 g RNA This yield compares favorably with R PCR which yields up to 15 g DNA from equivalent starting material To more precisely evaluate the efficiency and fidelity of the linear amplification protocol we generated a large pool of starting material by restricting yeast genomic DNA with Alu I cuts AGCT leaving blunt ends and gel purifying fragments within a size range of 100 700 bps We subjected 50 ng of the Alu I digest to amplification by IVT and by R PCR The IVT yielded almost 80 g RNA while the R PCR yielded 12 g DNA Table 2 We compared the Alu I digest with the amplified products by gel electrophoresis Fig 2 The IVT product retains essentially the same size distribution as the starting material In contrast the R PCR product appears to under represent lower molecular weight species Limiting primer input improves yield While analyzing the size distribution of the IVT product we noted a low molecular weight species that roughly corresponds in size to the primer adapter IVT protocols are reportedly sensitive to excess starting concentrations of the T7 primer Baugh and colleagues were able to improve yields when amplifying mRNA by decreasing the concentration of T7 primer 16 When we limited the mass of T7 primer adapter to approximately five times that of the starting material with a lower limit of 50 ng by decreasing the second strand synthesis reaction volume this low molecular weight species disappeared without decreasing overall yields data not shown In this way we were able to efficiently amplify just 2 5 ng from the Alu I digest with a yield of 10 3 g Table 2 Evaluation of linear amplification by hybridization We went on to evaluate the fidelity of the linear amplification protocol by microarray analysis Restriction by Rsa I cuts GTAC leaving blunt ends and gel purification were used to generate a second population of DNA Since Alu I and Rsa I cut at different sites the resulting digests contain different distributions of DNA species 50 ng of each pool were amplified by IVT DNA probes generated by reverse transcribing the amplified RNA were fluorescently labeled Cy5 for Alu I Cy3 for Rsa I pooled and hybridized to microarrays containing the yeast open reading frames After hybridization the microarrays were washed and scanned and Cy5 Cy3 ratios calculated We also hybridized Alu I and Rsa I probes generated by R PCR from 50 ng starting material as well as probes generated by direct labeling of 1 g starting material First we assessed the reproducibility of the IVT protocol Three Alu I Rsa I datasets were independently generated using the IVT protocol Each dataset contains 4 481 ratios that each reflect the relative abundance of DNA corresponding to a specific array feature yeast ORF in the two digests We found the IVT protocol to be highly reproducible correlation coefficients calculated between the replicate datasets averaged 0 98 This reproducibility is maintained even when only 5 ng starting material are used correlation of 0 97 The direct labeling and R PCR protocols are also highly reproducible with mean correlations of 0 93 and 0 91 respectively Fig 3A Next we assessed the fidelity of amplification by comparing the IVT and R PCR datasets with the direct labeling dataset We assumed the direct labeling dataset to most accurately represent the true distribution of species in the Alu I and Rsa I digests since no amplification was required to obtain these data The three datasets collected for each protocol were averaged and correlation coefficients calculated between the resulting composite datasets The correlation between the IVT dataset and the direct labeling dataset is 0 96 Fig 3A This value increases to 0 98 when features with ratios close to 1 are excluded from the calculation The correlation between the R PCR dataset and the direct labeling dataset is 0 68 Fig 3A It rises to 0 80 when features with ratios close to 1 are excluded Correspondingly the highest ranking features in the direct labeling dataset overlap extensively with the highest ranking features in the IVT dataset and to a lesser extent with the highest ranking features in the R PCR dataset Fig 3B The high correlation between the IVT and direct labeling datasets is evident in the scatter plot shown in Fig 4 An analogous plot portrays the lower correlation between the R PCR and direct labeling datasets These plots also illustrate another difference between the amplification protocols an examination of best fit lines calculated for each of the plots suggests that dynamic range is increased by IVT amplification slope 1 but decreased by R PCR amplification slope 1 To quantify dynamic range we determined the ratio values for data points two standard deviations above and below the mean and calculated the range between these values by dividing the high ratio by the low ratio For the direct labeling dataset the high and low ratios are 3 1 and 0 31 respectively for a range of 9 8 The range for the IVT dataset is 17 4 while that for the R PCR dataset is 5 8 Table 2 Hierarchical clustering shown in Fig 5 was used as an additional means to identify differences between the amplification protocols 20 Replicates for a given method cluster closely confirming the high reproducibility observed for each method Consistent with the correlation analysis the individual replicates for the IVT and direct labeling protocol cluster together while the R PCR replicates cluster in a separate arm of the dendrogram Most of the 4 481 features shown in the cluster diagram exhibit consistent coloring across the diagram indicating that the direction of enrichment is consistent for all replicates However the cluster diagram highlights two groups of genes purple stripes whose ratios in the R PCR dataset are inconsistent with their ratios in the direct labeling and IVT datasets Discussion We have developed a T7 based linear amplification protocol for the amplification of genomic DNA The protocol was specifically designed to amplify DNA isolated by ChIP for use in genome mapping protocols However it may be useful for other studies that require amplification of small quantities of DNA in a sequence independent manner e g DNA array comparative genomic hybridization 21 Although T7 based approaches for amplification of mRNA have been described 14 15 16 17 these rely on the 3 polyA tails for priming and incorporation of the T7 promoter Fragmented genomic DNA such as that generated by ChIP does not contain such a universal sequence Our protocol overcomes this obstacle by adding 3 polyT tails to the ends of the DNA fragments for use in priming much like mRNA polyA tails Efficient tailing by terminal transferase requires the template DNA to be free of 3 phosphate groups and is highly dependent on whether this template contains blunt or overhanging ends For DNA fragments generated by ChIP or blunt end restriction these limitations are effectively overcome by prior phosphatase treatment by using recombinant terminal transferase enzyme and by spiking a small quantity of terminating nucleotide into the tailing reaction We compared our IVT protocol to a commonly used PCR protocol that uses a partially degenerate primer to amplify genomic DNA in a sequence independent manner R PCR Initial analyses reveal specific advantages of the IVT approach First yields from IVT are significantly higher than those obtained using R PCR Table 1 with a fold amplification similar to that obtained in mRNA linear amplification protocols 16 17 Since 2 g of amplified RNA are sufficient to generate probe for a microarray experiment RNA from a single IVT amplification can be used for several analyses A second advantage is that the IVT protocol maintains the size distribution of the starting material more effectively than R PCR Fig 2 To more precisely characterize amplification bias we developed a test system involving the microarray based analysis of two distinct populations of genomic DNA These populations were generated by cutting genomic DNA from yeast with a different restriction enzyme and size purifying the resulting digest The resulting pools an Alu I digest and a Rsa I digest contain microgram quantities of genomic DNA sufficient for several amplification trials Importantly these quantities are also sufficient for direct microarray analysis by direct labeling this is not the case for the small quantities of DNA isolated by ChIP Although this direct analysis does require a single round of synthesis to incorporate dye labels no amplification is involved Hence we used direct labeling as a gold standard to validate the IVT and R PCR methods We carried out a series of hybridization experiments using the different protocols to compare the Alu I and Rsa I digests All three protocols were highly reproducible in our hands However we found the direct labeling data to be significantly more concordant with the IVT data than with the R PCR data This higher concordance is evident as higher correlations between the datasets and greater overlap among high ranking features Fig 4 Consistent with these findings when the datasets are subjected to hierarchical clustering the direct labeling and IVT datasets co segregate Fig 5 This clustering analysis also reveals discrete subsets of features whose ratios in the R PCR dataset are inconsistent with their ratios in the direct labeling and IVT datasets In addition to portraying species representation accurately the IVT dataset displays a significantly expanded dynamic range Taken together these observations suggest that IVT has considerable advantages over R PCR However our finding that IVT is more faithful than R PCR comes with its own caveats and does not necessarily imply that R PCR is an unreliable approach First of all it should be noted that the restriction digest analysis is an imperfect surrogate for ChIP experiments the random fragmentation of DNA in ChIP and the systematic cutting in the restriction analyses each place different constraints on an amplification method Many of the discordant ratios in the R PCR dataset likely result from a combination of the non random fragmentation in the Alu I Rsa I experiment and the ineffectiveness of R PCR in amplifying low molecular weight species When these discordant genes are removed the correlation between the R PCR and direct labeling datasets increases to 0 77 If the analysis is further limited to features with ratios reflective of a 1 5 fold or greater intensity difference the correlation is 0 88 compare with correlation of 0 98 for IVT versus direct Most mapping experiments are primarily interested in these enriched or depleted features Our initial experiences analyzing ChIP DNA by IVT suggest that results obtained using either amplification method are compatible with overall correlations around 0 80 C L L S L S B E B unpublished These analyses suggest that IVT and R PCR are both valid approaches for microarray based genome mapping However we expect that the greatly increased dynamic range and improved fidelity obtained through IVT will facilitate the identification of additional biological trends within these data Conclusion In conclusion we have presented a novel linear amplification protocol for genomic DNA We find that this protocol generates higher yields and better maintains the size distribution of the starting material than an alternative R PCR approach Extensive microarray based analyses suggest that improvements in yield dynamic range and fidelity render linear amplification a better option for genome mapping studies Methods Preparation of genomic DNA from yeast
