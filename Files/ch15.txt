 More than a century ago a major wave of innovations in distribution and production led to the modern department store the mail order house and the chain store and reshaped their suppliers The present transformation of retail and manufacturing engendered by new information technologies production methods and management practices also fundamentally alters the manner in which industries and firms take raw materials turn them into a profusion of products and deliver them to consumers Although these developments are very much a work in progress information integrated channels of production and distribution are emerging Such channels are not unique to retail apparel textile relations but have arisen in a wide variety of consumer product industries in which retailing practices are undergoing similar changes The developments reported here offer a prototype of the new links among manufacturers other suppliers retailers and consumers In fact the transformation has been gradual and is still under way Only as recently as the mid 1990s has integration risen to critical levels providing a clear picture of what channel relations will look like in the future Information integration has reshaped much of the retail apparel textile channel yet further transformation is likely in the decade ahead not only for these linked industries but for consumer product sectors in general In this final chapter we step back to survey the ways in which information integrated channels will affect the public and private sectors The pervasive changes arising from lean retailing challenge the conventional wisdom about the future of international trade labor standards employment and even macroeconomic fluctuations At the same time these changes alter the nature of competitive strategy for businesses that supply lean retailers in apparel textile and other industries Trade Issues The New International Economics W e estimate that national income would improve if quotas and tariffs were eliminated because the cost to the economy of protecting each worker with import restraints exceeds the wage the worker is paid F or textiles the cost per job protected is 40 200 while wages are 20 000 for apparel the cost per job is 37 500 while wages are 14 000 1 We want the world to know how strongly we oppose NAFTA expansion and fast track 2 John J Sweeney President AFL CIO These quotations aptly reflect the continuing controversy over international trade policies The apparel and textile industries have played a central role in trade discussions since the inception of the United States just as they have in other developing and developed countries throughout the world These industries have often been chosen as the means for building manufacturing capacity in the developing world at the same time they have been the recipient of trade protection in developed economies More to our point information integration has added a new dimension to these long standing controversies The textile and apparel industries have often been intertwined in public policy discussions about international trade the Uruguay round of trade negotiations the role of World Trade Organization NAFTA and its labor side accords the renewal of fast track negotiating authority imports from China and human rights standards and so on This stream of general debate however is seldom related to a detailed study or analysis of the impact of such developments on the U S textile or apparel industries From the time of Adam Smith and David Ricardo down through the writings of Hechscher Ohlin economic analysis has been devoted to the consequences of trade restraints in the form of quotas tariffs and nontariff barriers on output employment and prices Traditional international economics attributes trade to comparative advantage relative labor costs and the relative costs of logistics and transportation A new international economics in the past decade has stressed that much global trade actually reflects as Paul Krugman puts it National advantages that are created by historical circumstance rather than natural resources Because comparative advantage is often created not given a temporary subsidy can lead to a permanent industry 3 Note that these economic analyses and policy prescriptions have been applied generally and are not focused on particular industries like textiles or apparel In any case since the 1970s such debates about the impact of international trade policy have been placed in a new economic context Increasingly analysts and public policy makers discuss trade issue in terms of the emergence of a significant and growing inequality in compensation between production and nonsupervisory workers on the one hand and managerial supervisory or exempt employees and professionals on the other These differences include a larger disparity in compensation between those highly educated and those who are not particularly high school dropouts In addition there has been an appreciable growth in relatively unskilled immigrants in some localities such as major metropolitan areas around the country 4 The 1997 Economic Report of the President reporting a colloquium of experts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York attributes the growth of inequality to the following technological change 45 percent international trade 12 percent a decline in the real minimum wage 10 percent rising immigration 8 percent and other factors 15 percent 5 Although such analysis and policy discussions have not singled out specific industries the nature of the occupational structure and workforce in textiles and apparel particularly the latter sector makes the general discussion relevant to these two industries It would appear that neither the market imports of textiles nor the immigration of low skilled workers has had an appreciable negative impact on the wages of the textile industry or its major sectors The average hourly earnings of U S employees in textile mill products SIC 22 went from 4 66 in 1979 to 10 02 in 1997 an increase of 115 percent and more than the increase in all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing This relative wage increase in textiles took place despite its concentration in a low wage region the southeastern Piedmont states the low level of collective bargaining and the higher than average percentage of women workers But the experience in apparel is less categorical especially because of the differential impact on various branches of apparel and other textile products SIC 23 In 1997 the average hourly earnings of apparel workers were 8 25 On the high end automotive and apparel trimmings SIC 2396 averaged 11 36 on the low end women s and misses blouses and skirts SIC 2331 averaged 7 01 Correspondingly employment in automotive and apparel trimmings increased 71 4 percent from 1979 to 1997 while in women s and misses blouses and skirts it declined by 60 6 percent in the same period Bear in mind however that blast furnaces and steel mills SIC 3312 declined in employment from 478 500 employees in 1979 to 163 300 in 1997 This 65 9 percent decline from 1979 to 1997 compares with a 31 3 percent drop for textile mill products and 37 6 percent for all apparel workers Still there can be little doubt that in a sector like women s and misses blouses and skirts in which employment is concentrated in small contract shops import competition from low wage developing countries and unskilled immigrants have contributed to its deterioration Moreover the failure to comply with federal and state employment statutes relating to minimum wages overtime rates and child labor uncovered in periodic enforcement forays have contributed to the decline of this sector The general analysis of the consequences of trade and immigration in the textile and apparel industries clearly requires a much more focused application to detailed sectors to provide reliable conclusions Moreover and as this volume indicates the offsetting influences of lean retailing and short cycle production in comparison with low foreign labor rates must be evaluated by product demand variability rather than simply making generalizations about aggregate trade and immigration For instance the information integrated channels in retail apparel textile are having some of their most significant impact on sourcing among suppliers domestic and foreign The low labor costs for sewing and short time to market from Mexico and the Caribbean countries and the provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule formerly Section 807 and 807a or currently 9802 00 80 that establish duties only on the value added to U S produced materials sent out for assembly all favor sourcing of apparel from south of the U S border rather than Asia According to the U S International Trade Commission U S imports of textiles and apparel from China and two of the traditional Big Three Asian suppliers Hong Kong and Korea continued to decline in 1996 when these countries together with Taiwan accounted for 23 4 percent of total sector trade compared with 38 5 percent in 1991 6 The information integrated channels developed in the United States which are now influencing sourcing patterns from Mexico and the Caribbean Basin have begun to affect the textile and apparel sectors worldwide For many fashion apparel products defined as those planned to last only one season the practice of sourcing on the basis of lowest labor costs may be expected to continue Indeed much of Asian sourcing has been devoted to such items with production shifting within Asia away from regions where wage levels have risen But for basic and fashion basic apparel products for which frequent replenishment orders are becoming the norm the practice of sourcing some of the assembly and sewing operations from nearby lower wage regions and countries is emerging At the same time design distribution centers marketing even cutting as well as some short cycle assembly remain in the market region As we pointed out in Chapter 13 regionalization of apparel production in three main areas has started to occur In the U S market most sewing operations take place in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin in Europe sewing operations go to North Africa Turkey and Eastern Europe and in Japan sewing operations go to various East Asian regions The formal analysis in Chapter 7 specified the factors that determine whether production of items under rapid replenishment policies should be done domestically or outsourced to low wage countries For textiles with their high capital costs lower labor content and emphasis on high quality and finishing operations the concentration in the southeastern United States Korea and Japan and industrial Europe may be expected largely to continue But the longer term viability of American textile centers will depend on the development of infrastructures capable of supporting advanced textile production in countries close to the U S market such as Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America Macroeconomic Implications Inventories Business Cycles and Price Levels In an information integrated channel the historic market relationships between buyers and sellers change significantly It is true that textiles firms still sell to apparel makers which in turn sell to retailers which ultimately sell to consumers Markets certainly have not disappeared but these relationships have been transformed Different channel players now share detailed information on daily sales investments in technologies mutually benefit both retailers and suppliers and because of the effective use of information and manufacturing technologies risk has been reduced across the entire channel The adoption of standards in the supply channel such as those that specify packaging labeling and marking of products have reduced further time to market and enhanced efficiencies this expedites transit and ensures floor ready merchandise for consumers at the end of the channel from suppliers As a result the traditional boundary lines between firms are blurring as the cost of transacting business within and across industries falls dramatically 7 Note that the technologies and standards that made these information integrated channels possible were a product of private sector activities individual enterprises trade associations and consulting firms The fundamental standards of product identification through bar codes and related technologies have become compatible worldwide without the prescription or regulation of a Bureau of Standards or government regulatory agencies Falling transaction costs between sectors allow an economy to increase the total output of goods and services it can produce for a given set of resource inputs 8 The dramatic decrease in transaction costs across many sectors parallels the wide scale changes at the end of the last century which in the words of Alfred Chandler reduced the number of transactions involved in the flow of goods increased the speed and regularity of the flow and so lowered costs and improved the productivity of the American distribution system 9 Yet it often takes time for an economy to reflect the impact of such fundamental shifts In fact the current combination of changes in information technology management practice and manufacturing strategy may be one of the places where the impact of computers on the economy has been hidden until recently 10 The falling costs of conducting business between retailers and their suppliers may also explain why there has been relatively little vertical concentration across industries in the channel no textile firms have gone into the manufacture of apparel or retail and few apparel firms have set up their own retail outlets 11 Indeed an effective information integrated channel probably works against vertical integration Sharing information and current knowledge of the market across channel players achieves some of the same objectives at lower cost of formally reaching forward or backward into markets Enterprises in different parts of the channel can therefore concentrate on their business strengths Lean retailing and the restructuring of manufacturing supply have also affected the economy as a whole in the area of inventories Lean retailing itself implies a dramatic reduction in the amount of inventory held by retail enterprises Chapter 14 documents the large inventory reductions of apparel suppliers that draw fully on information technology in concert with new managerial and manufacturing practices in some cases they have decreased inventory levels by half The impact of these new policies on retailing and manufacturing sectors may have begun to show up in economy wide measures of inventory The overall ratio of inventories to final sales of domestic business fell considerably in the past decade from 2 78 in 1987 to 2 34 in 1997 12 It has long been known that inventories at the macroeconomic level affect the depth and length of business cycles 13 The connection between recent changes in inventory policy and the business cycle have only begun to be studied in a systematic fashion 14 As noted in the 1988 Economic Report of the President Adoption of just in time inventory management by manufacturers also represents a significant development since changes in inventories have often been an important source of business cycle fluctuations Whether just in time inventories will be able to dampen future business cycles however remains to be seen 15 Our work on apparel supplier adjustments to lean retailing suggests that an economy characterized by an increasing level of modern manufacturing and retailing practices should experience lower levels of inventories relative to sales Because a reduction in the I S ratio means that changes in sales will be matched by a smaller change in inventories a lower ratio also implies lower inventory volatility This is important because aggregate inventory volatility has historically made up a significant portion of the volatility of Gross Domestic Product GDP If the effects documented for retail apparel textile channels are more pervasive across other sectors similarly affected by channel integration these changes could imply lower GDP volatility This macroeconomic link may prove to be the most profound implication of the adoption of firm level information technology and manufacturing practices Fundamental changes in inventory policies in retail and manufacturing may significantly affect price levels as well The increased volatility of producer and consumer prices in a number of sectors since 1995 has been attributed in part to the adoption of new inventory polices related to lean retailing 16 Some have suggested a connection between these policies and price fluctuations 17 According to one view an information integrated channel may lead to increased volatility in aggregate prices because the impact of shifts in supply and demand is more rapidly reflected in consumer prices without the buffering impact of inventory Competitive information integrated channels may also reduce aggregate price levels as expressed by price markup policies that in the past have reflected the incomplete information of channel participants 18 Whatever the effect the more widespread adoption of information integrated channels documented in this book raise a central question for future models of industry and macroeconomic price movements 19 Labor Standards The Problem of Sweatshops The most effective weapon used by American capital in weakening the power of organized labor has been to hire immigrant workers I mmigrants are cheap and controllable The conditions they toil under make a mockery of the already low American labor standards the most regressive among the advanced industrial nations 20 For more than a century the U S federal and state governments have investigated sweatshops in the garment industry including the role of immigrants and have adopted legislation to ameliorate their impact on workers and consumers At the turn of the last century unsanitary conditions in addition to low wages long hours and child labor were the biggest concerns State inspectors were authorized to attach a tenement made tag to garments produced by violators The Consumers League organized in 1899 adopted a voluntary label to be attached to garments made by manufacturers that abided by labor standards that is they obeyed state factory laws manufactured on their premises employed no children under 16 and used no overtime work 21 In 1938 the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA for industry generally specified minimum wage rates overtime after forty hours of work per week and a prohibition of child labor The so called hot cargo provisions of the statute Section 15 made it illegal to transport or sell goods in commerce produced in violation of the provisions of the Act 22 Despite these strict legislated standards with wage levels updated from time to time widespread violations in apparel workplaces have become commonplace in the 1990s Labor conditions have deteriorated for a number of reasons the decline in the coverage of collective bargaining agreements with their provisions for regulation of contract shops the difficulty of policing contributions for health and pension funds from employers in this sector the increase in immigrants legal and illegal concentrated in certain areas the intense competition from imports and the sharp drop in employment in apparel in some markets 23 Sweatshops it seems have always been with us The El Monte plant in southern California with immigrants working behind barbed wire caught the nation s attention in 1996 Federal investigators reported in 1997 that two thirds of the establishments in New York City s garment industry violated overtime or minimum wage laws 24 The U S Labor Department reports that independent surveys as well as federal and state compliance data show minimum wage and overtime violations of the FLSA occurring in 40 to 60 percent of investigated establishments The policy question is what if anything can be done to control or eliminate sweatshops and noncompliance with statutory standards in the United States And what can be done to ameliorate sweatshop conditions in developing countries that produce and export half of the apparel purchased in this country Historically U S governments have employed three general approaches to the problem of sweatshops First the federal and state governments used powers of enforcement to seek compliance with labor standards For the federal government the Fair Labor Standards Act and its regulations specify the standards and enforcement procedures 25 But sole reliance on traditional government enforcement activities has serious limitations 26 The Department of Labor has fewer than 800 investigators to enforce employment statutes for 800 000 apparel industry employees in about 24 000 establishments not to mention the other 122 million employees in 6 5 million workplaces around the country Monitoring compliance with wage and hour provisions and pursuing violations is an extremely complicated and time consuming process A second method has involved mobilizing public pressure on consumers retailers and manufacturers to raise the incentives for voluntary compliance with labor standards For example the Secretary of Labor has used his or her bully pulpit to call attention to the problem urging the public retailers and manufacturers to avoid purchasing products made in workplaces that do not meet the standards 27 Various reports have also publicized government enforcement actions to deter contractors jobbers manufacturers and retailers from violating the standards such as the release of a series of government reports on the extent of violations and the penalties assessed against violators 28 In yet another example Duke University s adoption of a code of conduct to ensure that apparel items bearing the university s name are not made in sweatshops has received public support 29 Indeed efforts to use public concern and at times outrage to tackle the sweatshop problem go back to the early part of this century The most famous case involves public reaction to the fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Company on March 25 1911 in which 146 women died The fire started in a loft of the factory during the workday The women and girls working in the factory could not escape because the company had locked the doors to the stairs from the outside ostensibly to prevent theft by employees The lack of fire extinguishers within the factory and the inability of fire ladders to reach the windows made escape impossible In this case public outrage led to early workers compensation and factory inspection legislation But in general the effectiveness of focusing public attention on sweatshops and poor labor conditions has been limited by the difficulty of keeping consumers voters students or other groups working on this issue for sustained periods of time Such avenues are at best a means for focusing the attention of key parties in order to build longer term mechanisms that remain even after public attention wanes Finally voluntary agreements among channel participants to ensure compliance which sometimes have arisen from efforts to increase public pressure have been employed at various times For instance in 1995 the Labor Department sponsored the Apparel Industry Partnership in which a number of U S apparel manufacturers UNITE the National Consumers League the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility and others agreed to monitor compliance with labor standards of contractors 30 Yet these initiatives also have limitations It is difficult to select an organization to do the monitoring establish the procedures to be followed and determine who should serve as outside or independent monitors 31 Voluntary compliance measures and agreements in the United States outside of collective bargaining have thus far had a history of short term viability and limited effectiveness Policies to reduce repugnant workplace conditions by U S standards in developing nations that export apparel to the U S involve an even more complex range of issues What are the appropriate labor standards Is one only to apply the standards and regulations of the exporting country or are some higher international standards to be used How are such standards to be established recognized and enforced 32 One approach would be to extend the conventions and standards established by the International Labour Office ILO and to enhance the effectiveness of its enforcement The ILO held a convention on child labor in June 1998 and is considering a proposal for an annual global report on countries that have not ratified certain core workers rights such as freedom of association abolition of forced labor nondiscrimination and equal remuneration and minimum age 33 Even with such international standards adopted by the ILO the task of enforcement remains daunting In the United States a number of programs have been adopted that seek to change labor practices in workplaces overseas The Department of Labor provided 500 000 to the International Program for the Elimination of Child Labor in a joint effort with the ILO to end the use of children in the manufacture of soccer balls in Pakistan In 1994 35 million soccer balls were produced there one quarter by children 34 Mattel Nike and Kathie Lee Gifford exemplify manufacturers brand names and celebrities who have adopted programs for overseas inspections to mitigate criticism of their possible sweatshop imports The Council on Economic Priorities has established a global variable social accountability standard that companies can follow to prove they adhere to an array of labor standards and pay their workers a sufficient income 35 The U S and European Union through the Secretary of Labor and Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs have sought to develop among labor and management an acceptance of international standards to assure consumers that the products they buy are not made in sweatshops 36 In a significant sense such efforts to deal with labor standards in apparel production simply illustrate the larger issues of trade labor and environmental standards that are likely to be a focus of international economic discourse over the decade ahead In fact it is doubtful that these issues can be separated to the extent they have been over the past decade There are sharp differences in the United States between organized labor and business and in the political arena as well Persistent efforts in the labor standards field indicate that separating trade labor and other social issues will no longer be as acceptable in the era ahead The fact that U S Secretary of State Madeleine Albright took up the issue of global sweatshops is a striking example of this reality 37 The complexity of sweatshop problems makes any silver bullet solution as unlikely now as it has been throughout this century Nonetheless our analysis suggests a number of steps that might be taken to improve compliance with U S labor standards in the presence of information integrated channels Given the inherent resource limitations in U S government enforcement inspections must be carefully targeted to yield maximum impact One method for improving targeting would be to require each garment to include a bar code label that shows the place and time of fabrication This would take advantage of the same technology that has been so fundamental to the changes examined in this book Information from the bar code could more directly be used by the Wage and Hour inspectors to sample compliance and more rapidly isolate violations Such requirements could arise either as a result of voluntary agreements among retailers and apparel suppliers or be mandated through regulation 38 Past experience suggests however that in this field voluntary measures need to be reinforced by regulatory authority The viability of collective bargaining as a means once again to regulate sweatshop conditions largely depends on the ability of UNITE to rebuild its collective bargaining and membership base in a smaller and more efficient industry responsive to lean retailing 39 Efforts by the union and apparel employers to link compliance with wage and working condition standards to efforts to improve the competitive viability of the industry offer promise such as through sponsoring training of apparel managers or by helping to build more responsive networks of apparel contractors to deal with retailers But these initiatives are still at an early stage of development 40 Finally the central role played by retailers in development and operation of the channel points to the fact that any measure whether taken by the government through voluntary compliance programs or via collective bargaining must include their participation and support The reliance of lean retailing on the promulgation of standards of performance has been well documented in this book A logical extension of those practices might be the adoption of procedures or systems related to labor standards in domestic or offshore sourcing operations The Coming Competitive Landscape Since the end of World War II textile mill products and apparel have both been characterized by substantial reductions in employment at the same time these sectors show substantial increases in output including shifts to higher value products and higher productivity Total employment in U S textiles is projected to continue its decline reaching 588 000 workers by 2006 with apparel down to 714 000 at the same date Meanwhile outputs are projected to increase 22 and 4 percent respectively in the 1996 2006 period 41 These are scarcely moribund industries with inflexible product and labor markets The textile industry in particular has been characterized by rapid technological changes and automation shifts to large scale establishments restructuring and consolidation of enterprises in spinning weaving and knitting substantial capital investments in these activities and finishing operations and a shift to products with expanding markets Wages have risen relative to the average of all manufacturing or nondurable manufacturing Exports have been within a few billion dollars of imports in recent years The economics of these channels depend on the costs of the separate steps and transactions from manufacture including inventory costs through distribution costs retail and sales including markdown and stock out costs The costs of time to market also matters This view of costs examined throughout this book yields quite different estimates from the traditional resort to comparative direct labor costs of manufacture as a sole basis for supply choice decisions Previous chapters have demonstrated that the lowest purchase price from a supplier does not necessarily yield the lowest costs at the point and time of sale or the largest profit An established channel in which the various parties focus on time to market results in markedly different supply decisions and dynamics than those dictated by conventional direct labor costs of supplies Given these crucial changes the following sections review the competitive horizon for each of the industries that make up the channel The Retail Horizon Information integration is one of the major factors contributing to increasing concentration in the retail sector Previously manufacturers and suppliers to a number of retailers were often in a better position compared with any one retailer to report on shifting styles and tastes and estimate market direction In many situations they chose SKUs and set volumes for retailers Now point of sales information provides retailers with reliable information on market developments and hence gives them more leverage in dealing with direct suppliers and others further from ultimate consumers In other words direct measurable information of consumer behavior translates into market power The lean retailer can also transfer to its suppliers the functions and costs of creating floor ready merchandise activities that traditional retailers handled in the past Bear in mind however that the information integrated channel requires substantial investment in technologies by retailers Although small scale retailing continues it is clear that an increasing proportion of retailing will be concentrated among a decreasing number of larger enterprises 42 The Internet has been often cited as an alternative to retailing and presumably a potential challenge to the dominant role played by lean retailers In this regard Tracy Mullin President of the National Retail Federation NRF notes The NRF fields a deluge of calls each week about the Internet s impact on retailing The most common question we get from reporters How long will it take for the Internet to completely replace physical retailing We have observed that traditional retailers are taking a cautious approach to the Internet Yet most understand its great potential even if they openly admit they don t have all the answers 43 A limited number of retailers are currently experimenting with the Internet although only 9 percent of those surveyed in 1998 indicated that they currently sell products this way 44 Retailers are currently reluctant to go on line both because they believe that their products are ill suited for Web sales and are concerned about specific technical limitations such as the security of electronic financial transactions 45 A number of developments many linked to issues we have discussed indicate both the potential and limitations of electronic retailing In one sense the Internet offers opportunities akin to mail order retailing for playing a very lean game For example Lands Ends became an early leader in adopting certain lean retailing elements into its catalog operations and has aggressively entered Internet retailing This retailer launched its Web site in 1995 the first major apparel retailer to do so Its site incorporates an encryption system to protect customers against credit card thefts 46 The Internet provides some of the advantages of mail order sales with even lower transaction costs However the obstacles to virtual retailing remain formidable Product offerings are limited in Web retail sites the Lands End site for example offered only 500 products in 1997 In addition just as in other areas of modern retailing a company must have a distribution system capable of getting products out efficiently on an order by order basis either through internal resources or use of third party consolidators The economics of distribution for Web retailing like catalog retailing are therefore quite different from those developed even by advanced in store lean retailers Finally measurement fit color and texture remain central components of apparel sales In apparel unlike the sale of goods via the Internet such as computers software or tools people want to see feel and try on the products These aspects of selling apparel items do not fit well with virtual retailing The mail order business already contends with this problem and these retailers cope with returns that sometimes go over one quarter the value of sales in a given year Consider Lands End once more In 1991 well before its entrance to the Internet it was forced to cope with returns of 132 000 shirts Each return was associated with a processing cost roughly equivalent to 25 percent of its value 47 Thus although Internet retailing will certainly grow as a channel of distribution the most essential longer term developments will involve the expansion of lean retailing principles to a wider and wider variety of goods sold by a decreasing number of major retailers The Apparel Industry Horizon A central feature of information integrated channels indeed the basis for our term lean retailing is the effective management of inventories at the SKU level Throughout the modern channel lean inventory management reduces the risk of selling perishable products thus enhancing profits The capability to compete increasingly depends on an enterprise s ability to manage operations according to the logistics of time and flow of product reducing time to market and the costs of holding inventory We have made clear that holding inventory can be expensive to a supplier whether it manufactures or sources its products in several ways These include capital tied up in work in process or finished goods the costs of facilities used the risks of failure to sell and price markdowns to dispose of products At the same time the inability to supply product to retailers or customers is another costly risk These risks and costs may be minimized and profits enhanced by using a combination of short cycle and longer cycle production lines The short cycle line turns out products faster but usually at a higher unit cost The long cycle line takes longer to produce items but at lower costs Balancing these lines by establishing for each SKU the precise pattern of expected variability in demand and point of sale information provides the means for maximizing profits Our research suggests that the cycle time of a fast production line should be no more than a week or two to be an effective alternative for the lower costs of a long cycle line or plant The balancing of short cycle and long cycle production alternatives has direct application to the choices manufacturers and retailers face between domestic sources with potential short cycles and foreign sources with longer ones The future of the domestic apparel industry rests on those items made using short cycle production which are often those with high weekly variations in sales Such short cycle production necessarily requires methods like modular or UPS assembly rather than the lengthy progressive bundle system At the same time it requires an ability to use incoming information on sales in a sophisticated manner to allocate production in this way In a related vein the future of domestic producers also relies on their development of capabilities for supplying fashion products on a replenishment basis Once again this requires a combination of practices by using advanced forecasting methods and innovative production techniques apparel makers may be able to respond in very short periods of time to point of sale information regarding sale of products with higher fashion content In addition as we discussed in Chapter 8 suppliers attempting mass customization of apparel products such as jeans will need similar capabilities The Textile Industry Horizon Textile markets in the United States no longer depend primarily on apparel as they did in the past Currently no more than approximately 35 percent of textile shipments are for apparel items Textile firms now furnish a range of household products such as sheets bedding towels and rugs and some knit products T shirts directly to retailers Such channels have adopted the information integration described earlier as textile products have been upgraded from greige goods in a brokers market to those that involve complex finishing operations and extensive product proliferation A number of integrated channels have therefore been developed among textiles retailers and their customers Significant markets have also grown for industrial textiles in a wide range of industrial enterprises such as automobile interiors and tire cord The range of industrial products is expanding including knapsacks tea bags tents fishing nets hammocks air bags and parachutes Even if textile products flowing to apparel sewn in this country or in Mexico and the Caribbean Basin where contractors assemble garments using U S textiles decline it is realistic to assume that some U S textile exports will increase in the near term and that there will be substantial increases in domestic industrial markets Still at least one feature of textile markets warrants attention in their relations to apparel The size of many orders preferred by the apparel industry is considerably smaller than that preferred by textile firms Apparel makers confront frequent changes in styles and new SKUs while textile manufacturers seek long runs to keep capacity operating round the clock In the retail apparel textile channels there is a need for an information sharing integrated system some form of packager to assist in ameliorating these differences Once again the development of Web sites to undertake some of these connections represents an important first step in this direction The Future of Information Integrated Channels As we have stated throughout textiles and apparel remain significant sectors of the U S economy In 1997 together they provided more than 1 4 million jobs and in 2006 they are projected to have combined employment of over 1 3 million nearly 8 percent of all projected jobs in manufacturing These sectors are far too vital to their communities and the country and have proven sufficiently vibrant to be dismissed by the conventional doctrine of comparative labor costs Indeed rather than turning the future more bleak the introduction and the widespread adoption of lean retailing by all participants in the retail apparel textile channel provides new opportunities for the textile and apparel industries at least in some segments We see a viable future for these industries with a few caveats These revived opportunities do not apply with equal effect to all branches of apparel or all parts of the fashion triangle Garments amenable to rapid replenishment principles have the most potential for U S production Our less pessimistic view of the future of these industries should not be misinterpreted The textile sector appears more promising because it has become more directly connected to retailers and industrial users Yet survival in both sectors belongs only to the fittest adopters of the new order of retailing and the channel Employment levels are not projected to turn around Instead employment will gradually decline in both industries while output and productivity increase the best that any industrial sector can expect over time in the modern economy The new order in apparel places more of a premium on scale and size along with investments in the requisite technologies The traditional contractor shop and small enterprise will have a smaller and even less secure role unless linked to sophisticated intermediary agents in the channel In short the paths these industries follow will be determined by their interconnection with one another Providing a stitch or a package of pasta a home computer an automobile in time requires a growing degree of integration among business enterprises within and across industries Whether it is Federated Department Stores or Home Depot s use of point of sales information for inventory control Levi Strauss s or Black and Decker s efforts at customizing products to suit very specific consumer groups or VF s or Dell Computer s innovations to provide product diversity more efficiently channel integration is driving the current industrial transformation and will continue to do so in the period ahead
