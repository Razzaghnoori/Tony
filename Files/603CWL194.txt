 I have a place where dreams are born And time is never planned It s not on any chart You must find it with your heart Never never land Dear As I settle into my first season as artistic director of one of Indiana s most treasured institutions the Civic Theatre embarks on her 82nd year with a heritage built on dreams The title of the oldest continuously operating community theatre in the nation means that through prosperity and depression war and peace through the best and worst of times Civic has continued to produce quality family entertainment for our community Also since the 1940 s Junior Civic has been instilling in children an appreciation not just for the arts but for the dreams of which theatre is made I made my Indianapolis debut as a stage director a month ago with Inherit the Wind a classic of the American stage attended by more than 5 500 junior high and high school students My second production at Civic wi11 be Peter Pan a tribute to children and we re expecting at least 6 000 such youngsters to attend The board and staff of Civic Theatre believe that the future of the arts is in the hands of these little people and we strive to insure the future of live theatre with programs like the Holiday Family Production the Student Matinee Series the Young Adult Summer Musical Junior Civic programs and Kid Connection I hope that the theatre is still as important to this community as it was in 1913 when a group of dreamers got together to begin the legacy that is now the Booth Tarkington Civic Theatre of Indianapolis I hope that dreams of flying and pirates and fairy dust are still part of the magic of childhood And I hope that you will support the artistic and educational efforts of Civic Theatre again this year Yours sincerely Robert Sorbera Artistic Director
