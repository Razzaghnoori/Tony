 Short End of the Stick for Hick Dear Chris Thanks for your excellent recap of Eleanor Volume 2 I d probably quarrel with some of your emphases and certainly with the strength of that adjective irresponsible I did think you unfair in characterizing it as Whig History for the PC era full of paeans to same sex love and so on You especially underrate Cook s careful narrative of ER s emotional life in suggesting that her bio is given to sweeping generalizations about emotional needs But you touched unerringly on all the elements of ER s life that give Cook s work its fascination I found her portrait of the Roosevelt marriage in most ways rich in other ways frustrating She s definitely broken new ground in establishing how thoroughly bifurcated their extended family was Franklin s circle Eleanor s circle Franklin s place Warm Springs Eleanor s places Val Kill and Campobello Franklin s surrogate spouses Lucy Mercer and Missy LeHand Eleanor s surrogate spouses one time state trooper and bodyguard Earl Miller and Lorena Hickok That the Roosevelts managed to keep all these plates in the air while also raising five children and sharing the presidency of the United States is just another big reminder that any one marriage is a stranger and more mysterious land than an outsider can possibly know That it wasn t easy is suggested by the jealousies that bordered their arrangements Woe betide anyone with the possible exception of Louis Howe who tried to befriend Eleanor and Franklin equally Eleanor s friends even the lesbian ones occasionally made the mistake of falling for Franklin s easy charms In Volume 1 Cook wonderfully described two of them Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook as beginning a slow slide toward that dangerous abyss they considered neutrality But this leads me to what I found a bit frustrating Cook by no means ignores what was difficult about the Roosevelt marriage but I think she minimizes it or rather that her awareness of it seems to come and go On the one hand she writes that in relation to Franklin ER still occupied a lonely sphere which echoed the isolation of her childhood Beyond the First Family s jolly facade ER endured a lifelong sense of exclusion that represented for her an ongoing humiliation regarding FDR s domain But in between such acknowledgments that ER s independent life began as an accommodation to the deep pain FDR s philandering caused her Cook tends to present their domestic life as a settled deeply fond mutually beneficial arrangement I m sure that there s realism in this portrait a long marriage is never all amity or all its opposite But somehow I thought that Cook didn t manage to keep the mixedness of it in focus as well in this volume as she did in the last one Is this because it s so hard to admit that Eleanor s strengths came in part from being married to an impossible in the marital sense man Cook did a great job in Volume 1 of demonstrating how flawed Franklin was as a husband how he relinquished all control to his mother and absented himself from the brutal conflicts that resulted between ER and her mother in law Grrrrrr But it isn t very satisfying to say that Eleanor Roosevelt became a great woman mostly by making the best of a bad business is it I m entirely fascinated by the Hickok material in this volume You re right that Hick is a sympathetic character and in many ways a sad one Cook is entirely hip to the irony of their relationship Just as Eleanor was coming to the full command of her own powers poor Hick who quit the AP over the conflict of interest posed by her personal ties to ER was pining away over having given up the career that had lifted her out of poverty and brought her every good thing in her life up to the time she met ER It s ugly to watch ER s rather man like collusion in this process with her advantages of class and marriage she couldn t begin to imagine what Hick had sacrificed for her I didn t find it paradoxical that Cook insists on the centrality of Eleanor s lesbianism And actually insists is not the right word What she does is assume the centrality of it for the most part and leave the reader to puzzle out what it means I think Cook made quite a canny and possibly political decision to be so matter of fact about the lesbianism of Eleanor s circle It leaves us readers to grapple with our own reactions You mean the first lady was tooling around the U S on vacation in an open convertible with her lesbian lover And she got away with it Isn t that kind of wild Some other things I d like to touch on this week Did the bifurcated Roosevelt White House do a disservice in providing a model for later administrations in which poor folks and children and the lame and the halt were insidiously sentimentalized as women s work See Barbara Bush And of course the Clinton parallel but we ll need at least a whole day just for that If Eleanor Roosevelt was a force for good as I definitely believe then why does Hillary Clinton drive me mad Best Marjorie P S A personal aside Your allusion to Earl Browder fell wide of the polemical mark with me because I actually lived next door to Earl Browder as a child His son Bill was a professor in the Princeton math department and his granddaughter Julie was my best friend So I knew Browder as a somewhat gloomy but kind old gent who took a daily constitutional up the block to Nassau street where he would buy me and Julie a package of Hostess cupcakes the orange flavored ones with icing squiggles on top
