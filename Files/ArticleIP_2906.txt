 Water Works Amid the flamboyant world of 19 th century French painting no scandal attaches to the name Jean Baptiste Camille Corot no vivid anecdote or outrageous in your face work of art If Edgar Degas longed to be celebrated and unknown it was Corot a painter Degas greatly admired who achieved this paradoxical wish His self effacing devotion to his art and especially to landscape helped to pry open the jaws of academic convention He claimed to have only one goal in life to make landscapes a commitment that precluded any other serious attachment including marriage Corot was born in 1796 and his 200 th birthday is the pretext for two mesmerizing shows in New York this fall a wide ranging retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and a more specialized show at the Brooklyn Museum built around Corot s Italian visits The son of fashionable Parisian modistes dealers in hats and accessories Corot lived comfortably on a trust fund until he himself became the fashion both among wealthy industrialists who treasured his visions of the very rural serenity they were threatening and among the rising young stars of the impressionist generation Claude Monet Berthe Morisot Camille Pissarro who revered Papa Corot even as he disdained their blinding use of color He died in 1875 a year after the first impressionist exhibition Corot is often referred to as a pioneer of plein air painting but as the Brooklyn show called In the Light of Italy Corot and Early Open Air Painting makes clear the practice of making outdoor sketches in oil was well established by the time of his first Italian campaign in 1826 The show places Corot in the company of an international cast of painters including the little known Welsh painter Thomas Jones who produced some astonishing studies of moldering Neapolitan walls with drying laundry dangling from balconies all of whom worked outdoors in Rome and its environs from the 1780s to about 1840 But Corot could as well be called a pleine eau painter so fluid and watery are his works The Tiber weaves among Corot s Italian sketches of the 1820s and like several of the other painters in the Brooklyn exhibition he pays obligatory homage to the falls at the Roman resort of Tivoli Still there s something parched in these paintings where the air is crisp and even the bodies of water have a solidity of form and contour that recalls and betrays the influence of Poussin Then in 1835 after his return to France Corot painted his Old Testament scene Hagar in the Wilderness the first major painting in the Met show which portrayed Ishmael and his mother dying of thirst in the desert An angel appears above them a sort of cosmic bartender bringing a drink One thinks of Philip Larkin s poem about a religion based on water And I should raise in the east A glass of water Where any angled light Would congregate endlessly Hagar made Corot famous and for the next four decades the floodgates were loosed Water is everywhere in Corot s work The Met in an effort to show off Corot s strengths in genres other than landscape makes room for his large scale Salon paintings few of which exist in American collections In these he reprised such religious and mythical shower scenes as the baptism of Christ and Diana as she was spied upon by Actaeon During the final year of his life Corot was still fidgeting with the unconvincing antlers sprouting from poor Actaeon s head In smaller scale works Corot wrought changes on a variety of more secular riparian subjects ferrymen fishermen women washing laundry or tossing each other playfully into the current Something happened to Corot s work around 1848 as though that revolutionary year had shaken his certainties as well He moved however not toward anything resembling social protest one of Corot s rare representations of modernization a view of a textile factory with a woman sitting at a pre industrial spinning wheel in the foreground is more wistful than indignant Rather the change is stylistic All that was solid in his art begins to melt creating the vaporousness that Monet and others so admired in Corot s work The boundary between water and land so clear in the Italian sketches is increasingly blurred in the great souvenirs of the 1850s imaginary landscapes in which lakes reflections and mist enveloped trees all meld together One critic complained that Corot s foliage was like mashed peas but another praised the intoxicating limpidity of Corot s water Even if we camped out in his studio we could never learn in 10 years how he succeeds in rendering the beauty of water None other than the emperor Napoleon III himself snatched up the glorious Souvenir de Mortefontaine for 3 000 francs and hid it away in the palace at Fountainebleau where he could admire in private the great horizontal sweep of the central tree and the standing woman s posture echoed in another barer tree Corot who obviously loved the painting hung a photograph of it over his own bed Such paintings widely reproduced even during Corot s lifetime confirmed his lasting fame as a landscapist After the gloomy events of the Prussian siege of Paris and the slaughter of the Commune that followed the glistening countryscapes that Corot exhibited in 1872 seemed like a reaffirmation of La Belle France herself While Corot was drawn to the contemplative and even the monastic life he painted a peculiar series devoted to monks reading playing the cello and praying he was by no means immune to feminine charm He praised the Roman women in particular their asses are spectacular he confided to a friend though he thought the Italian whores were overpriced The Metropolitan retrospective also makes a case for Corot s figure studies many of which were painted during the final years of his life In the ravishing Lady in Blue of 1874 the adaptive model Emma Dobigny a favorite of Degas as well shows off a cascade of blue cloth she s a waterfall in repose The painting was owned by Degas good friend the industrialist and amateur painter Henri Rouart who put it on public view for the first time at the Parisian Exposition Universelle of 1900 It was the sensation of that show as perhaps it will be of the Met retrospective But the Lady in Blue is hardly representative of the more austere figure studies that line the walls in the final room of the Met s exhibition These uncompromising women with their dry marmoreal features appealed to Derain and Picasso but they ll probably send contemporary viewers back to the landscapes By the turn of the century the most advanced painters were learning all they could from Corot s example For Van Gogh Corot s reputation was fixed like the sun itself Monet taking refuge in his own liquid world of waterlilies proclaimed in 1897 There is only one master here Corot We are nothing compared to him nothing It is precisely the astonishing popular success of Monet s generation that has made it difficult today to view Corot as anything other than as a precursor The sheer profusion of these two exhibitions with their welcome mix of the familiar and the little known should prompt a much needed reassessment of Corot s subtle art To enter these shimmering shows now is as refreshing as a drink of cool water
