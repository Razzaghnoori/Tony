        is uh kind of fun its best done when you have leisure time and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now  and i grew up in an area that uh  it was just a few feet from a rather large lake and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake and we had a variety of  boats at our disposal um i worked for a camp for a number of years my father was on staff there and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats sailboats um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering  water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer couple of guys uh restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the mid thirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real huge big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves or the wind came from the side and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it if you ever got it dumped over though it was a mess to get back up it wasnt like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it uh upright again this one you had to work with you get out of the water again and get it upright and uh sailing was was kind of nice to learn the maneuvers you had to make to work your way down a lake or work back up against the the wind as it were attacking back and forth and um more than once wed get out there on a really stormy day and uh the storm or the wind was due to the storm front blowing in and soon as the front came over it was calm so youre out in the middle of nowhere with a paddle and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesnt start raining on you right away  and that didnt always work we often times got wet  but um its its a nice nice hobby to have and nowadays i dont think i could afford the boat or the time nor do we live that close to a lake anymore so things change i guess what are your memories of boating or current   um about the only memories that i have of boating um my husbands family had a a motor boat um when we got engaged and they took us out on the lake several times and uh i really did enjoy that i i dont know that i ever learned to drive it or anything but um we did some water skiing of course and and uh driving around the lake in the boat and and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting um you know they you they just didnt patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever the the laws were there and if you didnt obey them uh   right   you know there were a lot of accidents i guess but um i found the motor boating was real fun   its true yeah i remember learning how to ski oh i guess i was seven or eight years old and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to and it was maybe fifteen twenty acres and it was uh  it had a lot of um turtles in it and i got all ready to go and i was down in the water and and set to go and a and just as that boat took off a turtle bit me in the middle of the back it didnt hurt too much but it bit enough to where i let go   oh   and the boat went off without me and i reached back there and snatched pushed him away and got out of the water a a while and and uh it didnt even leave a mark it was just a little nibble and so i told everybody what happened and they go oh yeah sure you know and so i get back down in there and and ill be if he didnt do it again this time a little earlier and and i had let go before then and       before they took off this time and and swatted him away so i moved over a a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and uh managed to get up didnt go very far but i got up and it it was a nice uh nice long skiing career but now ive gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me ive ive uh done about all i dare do on skis you know skiing on one and jumping around here and there and i i i know how you can get injured doing much more than that and i just cant risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that just uh cant take the risk i did as a dumb teenager i guess so life changes a little bit in that respect  id kind of like someday to maybe end up on a pair of skis that that doesnt have a uh well what they call trick skis theyll allow you to ski backwards i havent craft managed to get a hold on that uh craft yet but uh   that sounds like a real challenge   yeah it itd be kind of nice i hadnt quite figured out i dont have anybody to teach me either thats another little thing you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do but just from what ive seen you just kind of work work your way up to it and turn around real quick you know grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around but uh i dont know maybe someday ill   uhhuh   ill get back to that as after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end uh weekend or something   hm well my son
