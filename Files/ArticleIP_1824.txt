 The Old Carolinians If you stick around Capitol Hill long enough anything can happen And during the past few weeks it did Sens Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms the villainous superannuated Carolinians became Statesmen Last month the 94 year old Thurmond was feted for breaking the Senate longevity record 41 years and 10 months if you re counting There was an outpouring of bipartisan piffle the gist of which was that Thurmond is an American miracle a South Carolinian hero a model for politicians everywhere His career was much applauded He won an election 18 years before Bill Clinton was born He challenged Truman for the presidency Why he s old enough to be Bob Dole s father Jesse Helms too is now flirting with respectability As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee he s become the object of much veneration Secretary of State Madeleine Albright who dutifully traveled to North Carolina to kiss his ring waxes fondly about her new friend Jesse Republicans and Democrats commend Helms for his good sense flexibility and bipartisanship When he struck a deal last week to repay some but not all of the United States U N debts senators on both sides hailed his compromise Even his latest act of spite the attempt to derail William Weld s nomination as ambassador to Mexico is being interpreted charitably by conservative pundits as a sign of Helms commitment to a tough anti drug policy The rehabilitation of Strom and Jesse is Washington politesse of the worst sort a twisted Inside the Beltway version of ancestor worship Call it the Grand Old Man Theory Anyone who s served as long as Strom or Jesse has can t be all bad Here s a reminder Thurmond and Helms are all bad They have done as much to despoil American politics as any two men living and they re an embarrassment to the Senate In 50 years of public office Thurmond has compiled a perfect record He has done nothing that can be called an achievement His career is an unblemished half century of efforts to impede progress inflame race relations and squelch good government So what has he done Thurmond ran for president in 1948 on what is politely called a states rights platform or accurately called a segregationist platform He conducted the longest filibuster in Senate history in a vain attempt to stop a civil rights bill one of many civil rights laws he opposed He concocted Richard Nixon s 1968 Southern Strategy the tacit appeal to white racism that became the blueprint for future Republican presidential candidates Thurmond incidentally was mentor to Lee Atwater the nastiest political strategist in recent memory Atwater had to die to get rehabilitated Thurmond just had to get very old Thurmond s apologists insist that he has mellowed And he has sort of He abandoned segregationism when South Carolina s blacks became a powerful voting bloc throwing his support behind the Martin Luther King Jr holiday hiring black staffers and recommending a black man for appointment as a federal judge But his racial politics can scarcely be described as up to date A few years ago I interviewed him about a black ex staffer who had won fame as a talk show host Thurmond told me that the staffer s success showed what those people could do This is considered great progress when a politician advances from Neanderthal man to the Stone Age As a legislator Thurmond has been a zero He doesn t have a significant bill to his name He does however have other things to his name such as the Strom Thurmond High School Strom Thurmond Student Center Strom Thurmond Federal Building Strom Thurmond Auditorium Strom Thurmond Educational Center Strom Thurmond Dam Strom Thurmond Lake Strom Thurmond Highway Strom Thurmond Soldier Service Center etc In short Thurmond spent the first three quarters of his political life as an ardent segregationist and pork barreler and the last quarter merely as a pork barreler Is that a record to honor There s even less to admire about Helms As a campaigner Helms has contributed as much as any senator to the corruption of the election process He pioneered the ab use of direct mail sending inflammatory fund raising letters to millions of conservatives He s notorious for massive campaign spending He set a record in 1984 by spending 17 million to win re election Helms has perfected the stealth campaign He relies almost exclusively on television ads eschewing rallies public appearances press conferences debates and the other niceties of traditional politics In his 1990 campaign for example he would respond only to faxed questions He has been equally destructive as a legislator A fervent anti Communist he championed right wing despots across Latin America including death squad leaders He was also the chief U S defender of South Africa s apartheid regime And his anti gay anti abortion anti NEA rhetoric has lowered standards for political civility These days Helms allies are trying to present him as a moderate accommodating figure but that image won t stick Helms is an absolutist and he doesn t stop till he gets his way He only knows the politics of the truncheon a quality that s tolerable in a backbencher but terrifying in a leader Helms can barely stomach the democratic process Last year for example he held up 30 ambassadorial nominations to force the administration to consider his State Department reform package This spring he attempted to prevent the Senate from voting on the Chemical Weapons Convention And rather than persuade colleagues that Weld doesn t deserve to be ambassador Helms is trying to spike the nomination by not scheduling a confirmation hearing So why are Helms and Thurmond getting a free pass Thurmond is so old that it s considered bad form to criticize his sorry record or dredge up his racist past Or to comment on his current incompetence it s an open secret on the Hill that Thurmond has lost it His staff shepherds him from meeting to meeting writes his public statements and cleans up after his many gaffes such as his attempted pass at Sen Patty Murray Helms benefits from a more curious phenomenon the vagary of the news cycle He s been mean spirited and vicious for so long that editors and reporters are tired of hearing about it They need a new story about him So voil Jesse Helms has matured into a diplomat Thurmond and Helms each won re election in 1996 but this is likely to be the last term for both Thurmond announced a few weeks ago that he won t run again Helms who will be 81 when his fifth term ends is increasingly frail He too may retire January 2003 that s when we should celebrate Thurmond and Helms because that s when the Senate will finally be rid of both of them
