 Background Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays referred to here as oligonucleotide arrays are widely used to measure the abundance of mRNA molecules in biological samples 1 The investigator isolates total and or polyadenylated RNA from cells or tissues generates the corresponding complementary DNA cDNA transcribes complementary RNA cRNA from the cDNA template and then hybridizes the cRNA to the array 2 There is a significant amount of assay noise associated with readouts from oligonucleotide arrays for example 3 4 For these arrays we have found additive and multiplicative noise affecting individual gene readouts typically 5 20 as well as multiplicative noise affecting entire arrays often above 20 As defined here normalization attempts to correct for only the latter type of noise The primary sources of this array level noise are between array variation in overall performance due to inconsistencies in array fabrication staining and scanning and between cRNA variation as independently prepared cRNAs have variable purity and or fluorescently labeled mass fractions Because these sources of variation contribute so significantly to array readouts normalization is a critical first step in any analysis of gene expression data Most current normalization procedures for oligonucleotide arrays are global approaches based on normalization of the overall mean or median array intensity to a common standard for example 5 6 7 Spiked standards have also been used to normalize cDNA 8 and oligonucleotide 9 10 11 arrays All these techniques are inherently linear there have been recent reports of nonlinear normalizations for cDNA 12 oligonucleotide 13 14 and other 15 arrays Few detailed comparisons of oligonucleotide array normalization procedures have been reported however 13 For oligonucleotide arrays the normalization implemented in the Affymetrix GeneChip software Affymetrix Santa Clara CA is by far the most commonly used for example 1 16 In this approach the mean hybridization intensities the average differences AD of all probe sets on each array are scaled to an arbitrary fixed level 17 In the rest of this paper we refer to this procedure as global normalization or scaled average difference AD s In practice there are at least three limitations to this method Of these the first two relate to the normalization itself and the last relates to the practical utility of the normalized readouts First global normalization makes no attempt to absolutely quantify mRNA abundances Readouts are normalized to an arbitrary scale which may vary from one operator to another or between experiments In contrast previous experiments with spiked controls 1 and comparisons with serial analysis of gene expression SAGE 18 have shown that array response can be proportional to true transcript abundance suggesting that absolute quantitation of transcripts is feasible If sufficiently accurate such an absolute scale for all array readouts could facilitate comparisons across large diverse gene expression databases Second global normalization implicitly assumes that the mean expression level of all monitored mRNAs is constant The validity of this assumption depends on the number and biological characteristics of genes monitored by an array For smaller arrays that monitor a limited set of mRNAs this assumption is invalid and may result in erroneous normalization Ideally a quantitation method for arrays would be effective even in cases where this constant mean hypothesis does not hold Third as typically applied global normalization does not deal well with transcripts expressed at low copy numbers In a typical Affymetrix GeneChip assay many low abundance transcripts are present at levels below the sensitivity of detection of the array typically about 1 100 000 mRNAs Measurements for such mRNAs are not only noisy but are sometimes negative due to cross hybridization to mismatch probes 1 Negative intensity values are meaningless and problematic because they cannot be log transformed a manipulation that is a common prelude to downstream analysis of array data Simply discarding negative values is objectionable as it can lead to missed observations of biologically significant upregulation An automated normalization method that handles noisy and negative measurements and responds to variable array sensitivity is desirable especially in a high throughput setting The primary criterion for any alternative to global normalization is that it should expand the investigator s ability to compare diverse array experiments done at different times in different laboratories In this paper we describe alternative procedures that seek to quantitate array results in terms of transcripts per unit cRNA We chose cRNA quantitation because it meets the primary criterion and for several additional reasons First cRNA quantitation is easily applied to array experiments using small amounts of starting total RNA that are difficult to quantitate accurately Second the spike reagents described here for cRNA quantitation can be used to specifically monitor the performance of individual arrays Third in our experience the reproducibility accuracy and scientific value of cRNA quantitation are at least as good as those of alternative techniques such as procedures to quantitate transcripts per cell transcripts per mass of input material transcripts per total RNA or transcripts per polyadenylated RNA We evaluated two alternatives to the standard global normalization scheme which we term frequency F and scaled frequency F s normalization These normalization procedures are based on the presence of a common pool of biotin labeled transcripts of known concentrations spiked into each hybridization Constructs for generating the control reagents are available through the American Type Culture Collection ATCC accession numbers are given in Table 1 We describe how scaled frequency normalization can be used to estimate message abundance in cRNA compute a chip sensitivity metric and provide a natural scale for damping spurious signals from below sensitivity mRNAs Using previously published replicated experimental hybridizations and new simulated data we compare the reproducibility and accuracy of frequency scaled frequency and global normalization Our results suggest that scaled frequency normalization is a useful strategy for oligonucleotide array data and has important advantages over current approaches Results and discussion The constant mean assumption A key assumption underlying global normalization is that the mean expression level on an array should be the same for all samples and all arrays This assumption is distinct from the additional implicit assumption that the fraction of polyadenylated mRNA per total RNA is constant One can certainly construct special cases where the constant mean assumption is invalid One example would be using a small array containing only genes from a single pathway in an experiment that studies variable induction of that pathway However it is unclear how well even more general array experiments satisfy this assumption To evaluate the constant mean assumption we examined the coefficient of variation CV of the mean expression level of variable sized mRNA sets across samples covering widely divergent developmental stages of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans We constructed the largest possible subset of our data that included only matched triplets of the A B and C array designs see Materials and methods The subset comprised 39 chip hybridzations 13 of each design covering all developmental stages This dataset represents a relatively strong test of the constant mean assumption because very large biological modulation of many mRNAs occurs across the dataset As the C elegans arrays monitor around 98 of all predicted C elegans mRNAs and the sum of the relative expression levels of all expressed genes must be constant by definition global normalization is well justified for the dataset as a whole Thus the 13 experimental hybridizations of each array design were globally normalized and subsets of the 19 031 total mRNAs monitored by the arrays were selected at random For each subset the CV of the mean expression level of the subset across all 13 hybridizations was computed Subsets ranged in size from 10 to 19 031 genes 0 05 to 100 of this transcriptome Figure 1 The CV of the mean expression level is below 7 for any set of mRNAs larger than roughly 10 of the total As this CV is no larger than the typical contribution of other noise sources in the readout we conclude that the constant mean assumption can be supported for arrays that monitor on the order of 20 100 of a transcriptome This is typical of current commercial arrays for several bacteria yeast mouse and human These results only apply when genes monitored by an array are randomly selected with respect to their expression characteristics The example noted above all genes on an array from a single pathway is an extreme case of nonrandom selection Other common ways of selecting genes for arrays may also violate this assumption including selection based on matches in specific cDNA libraries Nonrandom selection of even large mRNA sets for individual arrays can also lead to between array inconsistencies in mean expression level For example consider the case of two arrays each monitoring a large equal percentage 20 of a transcriptome where the first array monitors mRNAs with confirmed cDNA library matches and the other array monitors mRNAs whose sequences are based on lower quality expressed sequence tag EST sequence matches or computational gene predictions While the constant mean assumption is justified for each array in isolation comparison of globally normalized expression levels between the two arrays will give erroneous results because the mean expression level of transcripts on the first array is higher than that on the second Spike in based normalization The limitations of global normalization suggest the use of spiked transcripts to normalize array data Our spike in normalization method which we call frequency normalization uses spiked transcripts for two purposes First they allow us to calibrate the arrays transforming AD to cRNA frequency F estimates quoted in transcripts per million Second the spiked transcripts enable us to estimate the minimum detectable frequency on the array the array sensitivity value The array sensitivity is useful as a quality control metric for individual hybridizations and is also used to adjust signals from low level transcripts Specifically frequency values below the array sensitivity are averaged with the sensitivity estimate to generate damped frequencies that lie between 50 and 100 of the array sensitivity This adjustment introduces a small systematic error into the damped data but in return it eliminates problematic negative values and retains low level readings that can be biologically informative in the context of additional experiments Figure 2shows a typical plot of the spiked transcript readout from a single hybridization containing 2 g of cRNA and a corresponding amount of spike in transcripts The specific hybridization intensity AD value for each of the 11 spike in controls is plotted as a function of transcript frequency in units of transcripts per million The points are fitted with a generalized linear model that is then used as a calibration curve to compute frequencies from the AD values of the other genes on the array Using logistic regression we define the chip sensitivity as the frequency where we estimate a gene to have a 70 probability of being called Present We will use the capitalized terms Absolute Decision Present Absent and Marginal when referring to a specific value that is calculated by the Affymetrix GeneChip software described in Materials and methods In Figure 2 the vertical line at a frequency of 4 5 indicates the computed sensitivity estimate for this array Fitting a power law model AD k F n to the data in Figure 2yields the exponent n 0 93 This indicates mild curvature in the response consistent with progressive saturation of array readout for the highest abundance mRNAs Experiments using 0 1 to 10 g cRNA per hybridization with corresponding amounts of spike in transcripts as well as high and low gain settings on the scanner indicated that readout saturation not hybridization saturation accounted for most of the observed curvature in the spike in response The use of approximately 1 g cRNA in each hybridization or reduced scanner gain largely eliminated saturation with no penalty in sensitivity Scaled frequency normalization Frequency normalization is appealing theoretically and effective even when the constant mean assumption is known to be invalid However our experience suggests that frequency estimates might be biased by experimental limitations on the accuracy with which control transcripts can be spiked into cRNA Specifically because of the combination of small fluid handling uncertainties and potentially larger variation in the purity of cRNA preparations the actual ratio of the spiked transcripts to cDNA template derived cRNAs might be significantly skewed from one array to another One source of variable impurities in cRNA preparations could be oligo dT primer dependent cRNA product 19 Such cRNA impurities would result in erroneous normalization in which all readouts from one array would be systematically higher or lower than those from another array We use the term spike skew to denote this multiplicative skew in frequency values among multiple hybridizations One expected symptom of spike skew would be replicate hybridization readouts that are highly correlated but have widely divergent mean expression levels We developed the hybrid scaled frequency F s normalization method to mitigate the effects of spike skew F snormalization is based on the principle of removing technical variation in the ratio of spiked transcripts to cDNA template derived cRNAs by averaging the response to spiked cRNAs over multiple hybridizations To compute F svalues globally scaled average differences are first computed for all arrays in a set This initial step implicitly makes the constant mean assumption A calibration function is then computed by fitting a single linear model to the scaled average differences of all spiked cRNAs on all the arrays in the dataset pooled together Individual array sensitivities are still computed as described above and the same damping of low end frequencies is carried out using the sensitivity values for each array To compare F and F smetrics consider an experimental set of ten arrays To compute F values ten linear models are fitted to the ten distinct unscaled AD responses to the spiked cRNAs yielding ten different calibration factors one for each array In contrast when computing F svalues a single linear model is fitted to the pooled spike response curve consisting of 10 11 121 globally scaled AD values and a single calibration factor generated for all ten arrays If there was no technical variation in the ratio of spiked transcripts to cDNA template derived cRNAs in the ten experiments both approaches would give the same quantitation up to a random error term arising from the difference between fitting ten 11 point responses versus a single 121 point response If in one of the ten arrays the ratio of spiked transcripts to cDNA template derived cRNAs is different for technical reasons then spike response for that array will be skewed and the F metric readout for that array will be skewed relative to the other nine arrays In contrast such a skewed array will only affect the F smetric to the extent that the single skewed response shifts the fit to the pooled spike response The skew for the single problematic array will be removed because all arrays in the set will be scaled and calibrated with a single factor In other words F svalues are estimates of transcript abundance in cRNA based on the average response to the spiked cRNAs over multiple hybridizations and on the sensitivity of each individual array F values provide the same estimate but based solely on the response to spiked cRNAs in a single array hybridization Comparison of normalization methods reproducibility We compared the performance of four metrics AD globally normalized AD AD s frequency F and scaled frequency F s The basis for comparison was experimental data consisting of four sets of replicated hybridizations each n 3 or 4 of the same array design the C elegans A array Performance of each metric was measured by the median absolute coefficient of variation MEDACV of probe sets across the replicated hybridizations MEDACV is a measure of reproducibility for which a value of zero indicates perfect agreement of all transcript readouts in a set of replicated hybridizations We compared MEDACV for two classes of mRNAs those called Present in at least 50 of replicated hybridizations referred to as Present mRNAs and those Present in fewer than 50 of the replicated hybridizations referred to as Absent mRNAs All metrics showed higher worse MEDACVs for the low abundance Absent mRNAs than for the higher abundance Present mRNAs Figure 3 as expected from the presence of background noise on the arrays For Present genes AD swas more reproducible than AD as expected Scaled frequency F s was as reproducible as AD sfor Present genes in all replicate sets and yielded trivially higher reproducibility than AD sfor Absent mRNAs owing to damping of background noise Frequency appeared equivalent to F sand AD sin the first set of experiments the 0 hour timepoint but had a higher MEDACV than F sin the other three replicate sets We also computed Pearson correlation coefficients for the same replicate readouts Unlike MEDACV correlation coefficients between replicate readouts were similar for all metrics in the range from 0 978 0 996 To better understand the reasons for the markedly different MEDACV performances of the four metrics on experimental replicates we performed simulations These simulations incorporated several adjustable noise parameters We estimated values for these parameters iteratively based on experimental data see Materials and methods The similarity in the CV distributions of experimental and simulated data indicated that for our purposes the simulations recapitulated the major error properties of real array data Figure 4 We tested if spike skew could account for the relatively high CV of frequency in three of the four replicate sets Figure 3 by comparing experimental data to simulated data with known levels of spike skew To approximate spike skew the concentration of the spike in transcripts in simulations was multiplied by a random noise term Over a series of simulations we varied the standard deviation of the noise term from 0 to 40 to model the effect of increasing spike skew MEDACV values were then computed from the simulation results in the same way as for the experimental data in Figure 3 As expected only frequency was sensitive to spike skew Figure 5 The F smetric which uses a single standard curve pooled from each dataset to normalize all arrays in that dataset effectively eliminated spike skew effects In the simulations a spike skew level of 20 led to MEDACV values for frequency in simulated replicates that were much higher than those of AD sor F s These results were highly reminiscent of the 36 48 and 60 hour experimental replicate sets compare Figures 5and 3 Taken together the experimental data and the simulations suggest that spike skews of roughly 20 can explain the sometimes inferior MEDACV but consistently high inter replicate correlation coefficients of the frequency metric Comparisons across array designs We next considered the reproducibility of readouts of the same mRNA on different array designs For this analysis we selected the three mRNAs that were monitored by identical probe sets on each of the A B and C array designs and were called Present in all hybridizations of the 0 hour cRNA sample The observed CV of the AD smetric was in all cases larger than that of the F or F smetric and was greater than 0 55 for all three mRNAs indicating very poor agreement of readouts from different array designs when global normalization was used Figure 6 In contrast the CVs of both F and F smetrics were lower with CVs for F sin particular averaging 0 19 range 0 13 0 29 The mRNA K11C4 5 was expressed at 10 fold lower levels than either of the other two mRNAs and thus had higher CV values for both F and F sthan the other two mRNAs Comparison of the across array design CVs to the within array design CVs for the three transcripts in Figure 6indicates that the reproducibility of AD swas substantially poorer when comparing across array designs rather than within arrays Specifically AD sacross array CV was 3 2 to 6 4 fold higher than the within array CV In contrast the across array CV for F swas only 1 3 to 1 6 fold higher than the corresponding within array CV Table 2 The reason for the poor agreement of AD sreadouts across distinct designs was that the mRNAs monitored by the A array are on average expressed at higher levels than those on the B or C array as confirmed by two independent lines of evidence First the mRNAs on the A array were intentionally selected because they were represented in C elegans cDNA libraries whereas the B and C array genes many of them computational predictions were generally not represented in cDNA libraries Second A array mRNAs were more likely than B or C array mRNAs to be detected in the developmental time course by the Affymetrix Absolute Decision metric 10 Because of this systematic difference between gene sets the mean AD of all A array genes was substantially higher than that of the genes on the B or C arrays The AD smetric scales data under the assumption that mean expression levels for all arrays should be equal Therefore AD svalues for genes on the B and C arrays were inappropriately inflated relative to AD svalues from the A array Comparison of normalization methods accuracy Normalization methods should accurately measure true biological variation We tested the accuracy of the four methods using simulated data As a baseline we chose the experimental data from one of the 0 hour replicates on the A array We generated 19 simulated experimental conditions to produce 20 raw average difference values for each of 6 617 genes For each of the four metrics computed fold changes between the modulated condition and the baseline considering only messages called Present were compared to the true fold changes Accuracy was defined as the fraction of computed fold changes that were accurate within twofold and determined for assumed levels of spike skew from 10 40 percentage is the ratio of standard deviation SD to mean of the random spike skew term in the simulation Three simulations were carried out at each level of assumed spike skew AD sand F smetrics performed equally well and best overall with accuracies above 99 regardless of spike skew As expected frequency was the only metric with a significant dependence on the level of spike skew At 10 spike skew frequency accuracy was mean SD 0 9951 0 0006 at 20 0 96 0 02 and at 40 0 82 0 06 For comparison the accuracy of AD was 0 88 0 07 at 10 spike skew and did not change significantly at higher spike skew levels We stress that the overall accuracy levels reported here are highly dependent on adjustable parameters in our simulation model see Materials and methods Nevertheless the simulations demonstrate that at levels of spike skew consistent with our experience scaled frequency is as accurate as globally normalized AD s this observation is robust to changes in the model parameters Absolute quantitation of cRNA and cellular RNA There are several potential sources of inaccuracy in the cRNA quantitiation given by the scaled frequency metric Our results suggest that there is significant uncertainty in the molar ratio of spike in mRNAs to template derived cRNAs in any hybridization the spike skew effect The MEDACV for the F metric in Figure 3is likely one measure of this uncertainty as it probably arises primarily from cRNA purity variation This uncertainty leads to proportional differences between frequency metric readouts and true cRNA transcript abundances However in the scaled frequency method the simultaneous normalization of larger datasets reduces these differences through averaging We anticipate that inaccuracies of cRNA quantitation arising from this effect will be reduced by improved methods for quantitation of cRNA preparations For F and F s heterogeneity in probe response will lead to gene specific biases in quantitation Our data contains two observations that allow us to estimate the degree of heterogeneity among spiked probe sets Cursory examination of the calibration curve Figure 2 suggests relative responses of the 11 distinct probe sets shown do not vary more than two fold no observations fall more than about a factor of two from the fitted line A more rigorous evaluation of probe set heterogeneity can be done by comparing the ratio of AD values from two distinct probe sets that monitor the same transcript in a single hybridization This ratio estimates the difference in readout that would be observed for a single transcript if a different probe set were selected This comparison was made for the 11 spiked transcripts each array contained two probe sets for each of these mRNAs On the basis of 138 ratio measurements from the C elegans arrays the 10th 90th percentile range for the ratio was 0 39 1 44 10 indicating that for the set of control transcripts the uncertainty in cRNA quantitation due to heterogeneity in probe set responses for 80 of transcripts was less than threefold In addition to these factors leading to inaccuracies in cRNA quantitation there are at least two important factors leading to differences between cRNA abundances and cellular RNA abundances in the starting biological material First because cRNA is generated from the polyadenylated fraction of total cellular RNA by a linear amplification process frequency estimates will not reflect sample specific changes in the fraction of polyadenylated RNA in total cellular RNA This may be a desirable feature of frequency estimates in cases where per total RNA abundance is less relevant than per polyadenylated RNA abundance Second any gene specific biases in the cRNA amplification procedure will lead to gene specific differences between cRNA and per total RNA quantifications Evidence to date suggests that these biases are small 1 and reproducible 19 Taken together the above noted sources of inaccuracy suggest that there can typically be around two to threefold differences between scaled frequency per cRNA estimates and per polyadenylated RNA abundances in the starting material These differences could be reduced by improved cRNA process control and quantitation and by improved probe selection algorithms Conclusions We have shown that cRNAs spiked into hybridization solutions at known concentrations covering two to three orders of magnitude can be used to normalize array data and to estimate array sensitivity However frequency normalization based solely on these control transcripts can be adversely affected by variations in the purity of cRNA preparations These observations underline the need for meticulous quality control during the production of cRNA samples and accurate quantitation of the resulting material With better control of these processes the frequency metric may provide a robust spike based normalization that unlike all the other metrics described here does not rely on the constant mean assumption In the presence of variation in cRNA purity the F smetric provides a compromise between the robustness of the AD smetric and the more absolute quantitation scale of the frequency metric in cases where the constant mean assumption is valid In addition the F smetric provides a common scale for comparing data from distinct array designs This is an important advantage over other metrics For example the F smetric allows comparison of the expression levels of all worm mRNAs on all three of our array designs with comparable confidence to within array design comparisons This is not possible with globally normalized average differences We believe that cRNA quantitation and the damping of low amplitude signals provided by the F snormalization make this metric a valuable format for reporting diverse gene expression array results Materials and methods Experiments and arrays Array experiments used the Genetics Institute C elegans Affymetrix GeneChip oligonucleotide arrays a set of three arrays denoted A B and C which in aggregate monitor approximately 98 of the 19 099 predicted worm mRNAs in the October 1998 worm genome sequence release 20 The total number of probe sets on each array was 6 617 A array 5 768 B and 6 646 C Each probe set consists of 20 distinct probe pairs each probe is a 25mer designed to monitor a single transcript On the C elegans arrays described here probe sets monitoring the spiked transcripts were each tiled twice with a different set of oligonucleotide probes On arrays that are commercially available from Affymetrix one probe set is tiled to monitor each of the spike in transcripts The probe sets are not fully randomly distributed across the arrays although on the C elegans arrays the different probe sets are tiled in widely different regions of the arrays Experimental array data described here were taken from the developmental time course dataset reported in 10 Specifically we examined individual replicate hybridizations of the A array from the worm developmental time course at each of 0 n 4 36 n 3 48 n 4 and 60 n 4 hours after synchronization of worm eggs by bleach as well as a larger set of 13 hybridizations of all three arrays to samples ranging from oocytes to 2 week old worms Replicate hybridizations in the datasets included independently generated complementary RNA cRNA preparations from the same starting total RNA Primary data for all transcripts on all arrays including all replicates of all three array designs is contained in the supplementary Excel spreadsheet see Additional data files Spike in transcript pool A pool of biotin labeled spike in control transcripts was derived by in vitro transcription of 11 cloned Bacillus subtilis genes using the methods described in 21 The spike in pool was added into hybridization cocktails in proportion to the UV quantitated cRNA mass in the hybridization so as to achieve the desired final concentration of spike ins The spiked transcripts and their final concentrations in the hybridization cocktails are listed in Table 1 Final concentrations in pmol and parts per million ppm for each spiked transcript were computed from the known length of each spike in assuming a total mass of 2 g worm cRNA in a 200 l hybridization volume and an average length of 1 000 bases for in vitro transcribed worm cRNAs Metrics for transcript abundance Average difference AD is the basic measure of transcript abundance that is calculated by the Affymetrix GeneChip 3 1 software The calculation of AD is described in detail in the Affymetrix GeneChip User Guide 17 Briefly a background intensity is computed for each of 16 rectangular sectors on the array This local background is subtracted from the intensity values of each probe cell in all sectors After background subtraction the difference between perfect match PM and mismatch MM feature intensity is calculated for all probe pairs in each probe set in our case 20 probe pairs in total The AD for each probe set is the average of the PM MM differences after outlying values are removed A second important metric generated by the GeneChip software is the Absolute Decision The Absolute Decision is a categorical call for each transcript either Present Absent or Marginal The Absolute Decision is a heuristic metric based on the number of probe pairs for a given transcript that show strong specific hybridization signals See the Affymetrix GeneChip User Guide 17 for a detailed description of this metric Because of array to array variation in overall signal strength AD values from different arrays are usually normalized to a common scale We reproduced the scaled AD normalization of the Affymetrix GeneChip 3 1 software The calculation is described in detail in the Affymetrix GeneChip User Guide 17 Scaling is done by equalizing the average intensity of all arrays in a given dataset where the average intensity is defined as the trimmed average of the AD values of every probe set on the array excluding the highest 2 and lowest 2 of the values This normalization works on the assumption that the summed expression level of all genes on the array is constant across experiments and that differences in expression levels between arrays can be corrected by array specific scaling factors We denote the normalized AD values as scaled average difference AD s The calculation of frequency F values involved two steps first conversion of AD values to frequencies by use of the calibration curve and second estimation of the chip sensitivity of detection and damping of frequency values below this sensitivity The calibration curve for each hybridization was constructed from the AD values for each of the 11 control transcripts and their known frequencies Table 1 AD values that were negative or associated with Absent or Marginal Absolute Decisions were removed from the curve in order to improve the robustness of the fit This calibration curve was fitted by a linear function with zero intercept using a generalized linear model 22 fitting procedure in the statistical software S PLUS Insightful Corp Seattle WA The fitting procedure assumed a gamma error structure appropriate for data with constant coefficient of variation and utilized iterative reweighting of errors The single coefficient of this linear fit was multiplied with the average difference values for each gene on the array to yield initial frequency estimates Calibration curves for the hybridizations described here were examined visually to rule out poor curve fits Chip sensitivity of detection was estimated from the Absolute Decisions Present Marginal or Absent for the 11 spike in transcripts in one of two ways In the general case Absolute Decisions were considered as a binary response Absent 0 Present 1 with Marginal calls treated as Absent to be conservative This response was regressed against the log transformed known frequencies using a generalized linear model with a logit link function The chip sensitivity was then defined as the frequency at which the predicted odds of a Present call were 70 In the special case where all spike in mRNAs called Absent were lower abundance messages than all spike ins called Present the sensitivity was defined by linear interpolation as the frequency 70 of the distance between the highest Absent call frequency and the lowest Present call frequency Frequency values for all genes on the array that fell below the sensitivity were damped as follows Negative frequencies corresponding to negative AD values were adjusted to one half of the chip sensitivity Frequencies between zero and the chip sensitivity were adjusted to the average of the frequency and the chip sensitivity The rationale for this adjustment was threefold First one half the chip sensitivity was a reasonable a priori estimate of abundance for many genes that were not reliably detected Second the adjusted frequencies were guaranteed to be positive valued making downstream analyses of frequency values for example log transformation significantly easier Third retaining the adjusted low level frequency estimates was preferable to discarding them because discarding the values would make it impossible to detect potentially important regulation of these genes in future experiments Frequency normalization could be adversely affected by technical uncertainties in cRNA preparation see Results and discussion To attenuate these effects an additional frequency variant termed scaled frequency F s was introduced F swas a hybrid of ADs and frequency and was computed as follows AD swas first computed for a set of two or more arrays exactly as described above Then a linear model with zero intercept was fitted to the pooled AD svalues for the 11 spike in transcripts from all arrays ignoring negative AD svalues or those associated with Marginal Absent Absolute Decisions The slope of this linear model was the single calibration factor for the entire dataset This slope was multiplied with the AD svalues from all arrays to yield F svalues Per array sensitivity values were computed exactly as described for F and F svalues on any array that were below the array sensitivity were adjusted as described above Simulated data Array data was simulated as follows First a single experimental dataset one of the 0 hour replicates was chosen as a baseline for generation of all simulated data To this baseline dataset several random noise sources were added to reproduce key sources of variability in array data The relation describing the simulated data was AD ij b ij ADB i a j m ij s ij r ij where AD ij simulated AD for the i th mRNA on the j th array ADB i baseline gene expression data for the i th mRNA b ij background noise for the i th mRNA on the j th array a i array intensity offset for the j th array m ij multiplicative noise for the i th mRNA on the j th array s ij spike skew factor for the i th mRNA on the j th array unity for all nonspiked mRNAs r ij regulation factor for the i th gene on the j th array unity for all spiked mRNAs Background b ij was Gaussian with a standard deviation SD that varied randomly from one array to another The background noise SD had a mean of 20 AD units and a standard deviation of 5 AD units Array intensity offsets a j were Gaussian with a mean of one and SD of 0 3 Multiplicative noise m ij was drawn from a normally distributed zero mean noise source with a constant CV of 0 1 Spike skew factor s ij was a single random factor for all spiked cRNAs on a given array and unity for all other messages The spike skew factor for the spiked cRNAs was Gaussian with mean 1 and a SD that was adjusted from 0 1 to 0 4 in percentage terms 10 40 Regulation factors r ij were generated by a procedure in which the base 10 log fold change for each gene was selected from a normal distribution with mean 0 and SD 0 5 Extreme random regulation factors were limited so that the regulated gene expression values had the same range as baseline data After multiplication of each gene by its regulation factor the mean expression level of all genes was adjusted so that the overall mean expression level was unchanged by regulation Additional data files Primary data for all experimental hybridizations are available as an Excel spreadsheet 20 325 Kb Additional data file 1 Primary data for all
