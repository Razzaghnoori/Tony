 How I Learned To Love Labor and Hate the Bomb Issue 1 is the Senate s defeat of the nuclear test ban treaty Issue 2 is the AFL CIO s endorsement of Al Gore Issue 3 is campaign finance reform The punditocracy splits over the political and substantive fallout if you will of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty which the Senate overwhelmingly defeated last week after President Clinton had begged the GOP to delay the vote Conservative pundits such as Robert Novak NBC s Meet the Press and CNN s Capital Gang Brit Hume Fox News Sunday and Paul Gigot PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer think the defeat resulted from Clinton s hubris and the GOP s sound appraisal of the national interest Liberal pundits such as Mark Shields NewsHour and Capital Gang Margaret Carlson Capital Gang and Juan Williams Fox think the GOP is risking an arms race in order to humiliate Clinton Some opinion makers such as Steve Roberts CNN s Late Edition think that the treaty s defeat heralds a Buchananite lurch toward isolationism in the GOP Moreover Alfonse D Amato Fox and Juan Williams Fox think Clinton will inevitably win the public relations war given the public s overwhelming support for the treaty But conservatives such as Paul Gigot NewsHour and Tucker Carlson Late Edition counter that many former foreign policy advisers including some Clinton appointees opposed the treaty and that when it comes to foreign policy as a campaign issue Republicans still have the advantage On Capital Gang Sen Mitch McConnell R Ky notes that only one of the six Republicans up for re election next year voted for the treaty But even Carlson thinks Al Gore s un glitzy pro test ban TV ad was smart and Susan Page Late Edition thinks Gore s pro treaty stance will help him with women voters who worry about nuclear apocalypse more than men and Iowa Democrats who have a lingering nuclear freeze streak in them from the 1980s Only John McLaughlin PBS s McLaughlin Group actually addresses whether we still need to test nukes McLaughlin thinks we do For more on the treaty defeat see The Week The Spin and International Papers Most of the commentariat thinks that Al Gore s endorsement by the AFL CIO and the NEA represents a small victory Labor notes Al Hunt Capital Gang is still a powerful organizing tool in Iowa Nevertheless many pundits point out that the Teamsters and the UAW have not yet endorsed Gore and that Bill Bradley now has as much money as Gore does And many also criticize the vice president for telling the Washington Post that he might not seek any campaign assistance from Clinton that may be a smart strategy in the general election say Susan Estrich Fox and D Amato but Clinton can still energize the Democratic base during the primary season To read Estrich s Dialogue on Flytrap click here A few programs discuss John McCain and the prospects for campaign finance reform On Meet the Press Sen Robert Torricelli D N J says he opposes McCain s reform bill because it s too weak while Sen McConnell says it s too strong David Broder Meet the Press and Sam Donaldson ABC s This Week would like to change the system but neither knows exactly how One generation s reform is another s problem Broder observes of the current Watergate era laws DNC Chairman Ed Rendell argues that without soft money the Democrats wouldn t have a prayer against George W Bush George Stephanopoulos This Week notes that the more McCain s Senate colleagues ostracize him for his crusade against corruption the more popular a presidential candidate he s likely to become Department of Self Plagiarism Hewing to the journalistic dictum to sell every piece twice Mark Shields has perfected the art of recycling his own sound bites Here s a sample from the past two weeks The treaty vote was to put it bluntly impeachment Betty Currie s name was never mentioned an obstruction of justice charge was never ventilated There was no chief justice of the United States sitting in the Senate but that s what it was It was Impeachment Two It was getting even with the president NewsHour 10 15 The reality is very simple This was not with Betty Currie in the room or not with Bill Rehnquist sitting up there but it was nothing less than Impeachment Two And that was their chance of getting even Capital Gang 10 16 He had as good a week this week as I ve ever seen a non incumbent presidential candidate have in New York He spent repeated time in the company of minority groups He s comfortable there This is something that most presidential Republican nominees don t do except in a week when the Democrats are holding their convention and there aren t that many cameras around He does it he does it easily comfortably He brought together George Pataki the governor and Rudy Giuliani NewsHour 10 8 Let me just say I have never seen a candidate for president in my lifetime who was not the nominee of his party have a better week than George W Bush had He goes to New York he makes two minority community appearances Usually the Republican nominees do their minority appearances during the Democratic convention when there are no families around He s comfortable he does it repeatedly He has he brings Giuliani and Pataki together Capital Gang 10 9 Last Word From Capital Gang Sen Mitch McConnell If you re going to call the Senate corrupt if you re going to call the members of the Senate corrupt you need to prove it Soft money goes to political parties Political parties don t have a vote Soft money is everything that isn t hard money let me finish my answer It finances issue discussion in this country The New York Times for example has had 114 editorials on campaign finance reform since the beginning of 1997 That s about one every nine days They are a corporate soft money issue advocacy outfit as is this party program financed by corporate soft money McCain s campaign finance proposal would single out six committees the DNC the national Democratic committees the national Republican committees and say Only those six can t engage in issue advocacy Everybody else in America will be doing it but us Mark Shields That s the last word Mitch McConnell I just have to say in closing I ve learned tonight that the millions of dollars the Democrats have received from the teachers had nothing to do with the Democrats opposition to vouchers I guess Republicans alone of all our citizens are in McConnell Maybe there were already opposed to that Shields No politicians are impervious and indifferent to large amounts of money Al Hunt It s a wonderful clean system Margaret Carlson What a great country
