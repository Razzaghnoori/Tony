 Background Maitotoxin MTX one of the most potent marine toxins known is found in the red tide dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus and is responsible in part for Ciguatera seafood poisoning In all cells examined to date MTX at subnanomolar concentrations causes a profound increase in cytosolic free Ca 2 concentration Ca 2 i 1 This occurs not by release of Ca 2 from internal stores but rather from activation of a ubiquitously expressed non selective Ca 2 permeable cation channel CaNSC present in the plasmalemma 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Channel activation is followed after a short lag by the activation or formation of large endogenous pores that allow organic molecules with molecular weights of 800 Da to cross the plasma membrane 8 The activation of these pores can be determined experimentally by following the uptake of ethidium and propidium based vital dyes These dyes of varying molecular weights are normally excluded from the cytoplasm of intact viable cells but gain access to the cell interior following pore formation where they bind to nucleic acids with a concomitant increase in dye fluorescence The large pores activated by MTX have been referred to as cytolytic oncotic pores or COP since their activation ultimately leads to the release of lactate dehydrogenase LDH an indication of necrotic or oncotic cell death 9 The cell death cascade activated by MTX is not unique to this toxin Stimulation of P2X purinergic receptors by ATP causes similar changes in cytosolic Ca 2 and vital dye uptake 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 suggesting that MTX activates a cell death cascade that is physiologically relevant although the exact role of either the P2X or MTX induced cascade in normal cellular biology remains unknown For the P2X receptor it has been suggested that the Ca 2 permeable channels grow in size to form the dye permeable pores through either aggregation of channel subunits or through dilation of the existing channel pore structure 12 18 19 20 21 In support of this model it has been found that the kinetics of ATP induced pore formation in HEK cells heterologously expressing the P2X 7 receptor appears to depend on molecular size of the permeating ionic species 19 However we recently showed that although MTX and ATP activate distinct channels the characteristics of the ATP and MTX activated COP are indistinguishable 9 These results suggest that the channel and COP are unique molecular structures The aggregation or dilation model make specific predictions concerning the kinetics of dye uptake In particular this model predicts a delay between channel activation and dye uptake and this delay should be directly proportional to the molecular size of the permeating dye Furthermore if pores grow in size dye uptake should be nonlinear with time In contrast if channel activation causes the formation or activation of a molecularly unique COP with fixed pore dimensions the delay between channel activation and dye uptake should be independent of molecular size but the subsequent rate of dye uptake should be linear and inversely proportional to molecular weight To distinguish between these two models the effect of MTX on Ca 2 i vital dye uptake and LDH release was examined in bovine aortic endothelial cells a cell line particularly sensitive to the cytolytic effects of MTX The results of the present study are consistent with the activation of an endogenous COP of fixed pore dimensions The opening of large pores in the plasmalemma is expected to cause a dramatic change in the ionic concentration gradients that normally exist between the extracellular and intracellular milieus i e loss of K and gain of Na Ca 2 and Cl by the cell The concomitant flow of water into the cell as a result of this ionic redistribution will drive the cell towards the Gibbs Donnan equilibrium The change in osmotic pressure will produce cell swelling and ultimately membrane rupture and release of large macromolecules from the cytoplasm This final phase in the cell death cascade can be monitored experimentally by measuring the release of the ubiquitous cytosolic enzyme LDH The role of COP and the biophysical mechanism associated with this rather violent cellular event remains unknown However many cell types undergo membrane blebbing in response to changes in osmotic pressure Such membrane blebbing which may in a sense represent a cellular safety valve has been reported during both ATP and MTX induced cell death 19 22 but it is unclear if blebbing occurs before during or after COP formation or LDH release In the present study the effect of MTX on vital dye uptake in BAECs was correlated with changes in cell morphology using single cell fluorescence videomicroscopy The videos presented demonstrate that COP activation as indicated by vital dye uptake correlates in time with the formation of membrane blebs and that membrane lysis i e LDH release is associated with dramatic bleb dilation Results and Discussion MTX increases Ca 2 iin BAECs Fura 2 loaded BAECs were suspended in HBS placed in a cuvette at 37 C and the response to extracellular application of MTX was recorded as a function of time Fig 1 MTX produced an immediate concentration dependent increase in Ca 2 i At the highest concentration of MTX examined 3 nM Ca 2 i rapidly increased within 1 2 minutes from a mean SE resting level of 63 4 nM to an apparent Ca 2 i value close to fura 2 saturation We previously showed that MTX induced activation of COP allows leakage of fura 2 from human skin fibroblasts 8 Thus the apparent saturation of the fluorescence ratio observed in BAECs reflects at least in part a contribution from extracellular fura 2 This is particularly true at later times Nonetheless the major effect of increasing MTX concentration was on the rate of change of Ca 2 i and the apparent ED 50 was approximately 0 3 nM MTX MTX had no effect on BAEC Ca 2 i in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 data not shown demonstrating that MTX activates Ca 2 influx but does not cause the mobilization of Ca 2 from internal stores These results are similar to those obtained in human skin fibroblasts mouse THP 1 monocytes and human embryonic kidney HEK cells 8 9 and supports the conclusion that the MTX activated CaNSC is ubiquitously expressed MTX activates COP in BAECs To evaluate MTX induced activation of COP in BAECs the uptake of ethidium M w 314 Da YO PRO 1 M w 375 Da and POPO 3 M w 715 Da was examined at various concentrations of MTX Fig 2 After a short lag MTX produced a biphasic concentration dependent increase in ethidium YO PRO and POPO 3 uptake into the cells The lag time for a given concentration of MTX was the same for each dye Fig 2Dand 2E first dashed lined but the rate of dye uptake during the initial phase was inversely proportional to molecular weight Furthermore at the highest concentration of MTX examined the uptake of ethidium YO PRO and POPO 3 during the initial phase was linear Fig 2D These results suggest that the first phase reflects activation of a large pore i e activation of COP that exhibits finite permeability for each of the dyes tested and is distinct from the CaNSC activated by MTX The molecular mechanisms responsible for the delay between MTX addition and COP formation i e vital dye uptake is unknown The delay which was also observed in fibroblasts HEK cells and THP 1 monocytes 8 9 suggests that there may be several biochemical steps between channel activation and COP formation or that the concentration of a critical second messenger must reach a threshold level before COP opens This could explain the temperature sensitivity of vital dye uptake previously noted for both MTX 8 9 and purinergic receptor induced 12 15 vital dye uptake During the second phase dye uptake was all or nothing and once initiated the rate of dye uptake was independent of dye molecular weight i e ethidium YO PRO and POPO 3 all enter the cell at the same time and at the same rate for each concentration of MTX examined These results suggest that the second phase of dye uptake is related to cytolysis MTX induces LDH release To test the hypothesis that the second phase of dye uptake reflects a large change in membrane permeability indicative of cytolysis the uptake of ethidium and release of LDH Mw 140 000 Da were compared in parallel experiments performed on the same batch of cells Fig 3 MTX again produced a biphasic increase in ethidium uptake into the cells No LDH release was observed during the first phase of ethidium uptake consistent with the hypothesis that activation of COP occurs prior to release of LDH Extracellular LDH was measurable 7 minutes after MTX addition and subsequently increased in parallel with the second phase of ethidium uptake These results suggest that the second phase of dye uptake reflects a loss of membrane integrity and provides an explanation for the all or nothing uptake of ethidium YO PRO and POPO 3 during this time frame Note that more than 90 of the cell associated LDH is released within 15 minutes of MTX 0 3 nM addition For comparison we previously reported that treatment of human skin fibroblasts for 10 minutes with 1 nM MTX caused release of 28 of cell associated LDH 8 Thus BAECs are particularly sensitive to the cytolytic effects of MTX MTX produces similar changes in dye uptake in single BAECs The ethidium uptake experiments shown in Figs 2and 3reflect the average response of the entire population of BAECs within the cuvette It is possible that the biphasic kinetics observed reflects at least in part heterogeneity within the cell population To test this hypothesis the effect of MTX was examined at the single cell level using fluorescence microscopy Fig 4 BAECs were sparsely seeded on glass coverslips and mounted on the stage of an inverted fluorescence microscope The epifluorescence in each cell was measured using a CCD camera and image analysis software The uptake of ethidium by single BAECs as indicated by the change in single cell fluorescence was biphasic Fig 4 The rate of ethidium uptake during the first phase was concentration dependent but the second phase appeared to be all or nothing as was seen in the cuvette experiments Likewise the delay between addition of MTX and the second phase of ethidium uptake although variable from cell to cell was concentration dependent Thus the overall profile observed at the single cell level recapitulated the results obtained in the population experiments One interesting difference between the cuvette and single cell experiments is the time at which the second phase begins As seen in Fig 2A the second phase of dye uptake started approximately 5 minutes after addition of 1 nM MTX At the single cell level the second phase is clearly delayed and on average begins approximately 10 12 minutes after 1 nM MTX addition Fig 3D Although we do not know the reason for this difference the population studies were performed on dispersed cells in a cuvette whereas the single cell studies were performed on BAECs attached to glass coverslips Thus adherent cells may be resistant to the gross changes in membrane structure that occurs during the second phase of the response to MTX Previous studies suggested that ATP induced pores in HEK cells heterologously expressing the P2X 7 purinergic receptor were formed either by dilation of the channel structure or by aggregation of channels subunits 19 However these studies relied on shifts in the reversal potential of whole cell membrane currents Although this is a sensitive technique for determining the time course of pore formation these experiments do not eliminate the possibility that COP and the P2X channel are separate entities In the present study the effect of MTX on membrane permeability occurred in three distinct phases The first phase reflects the activation of a CaNSC and a large and rapid increase in Ca 2 i After a short lag the activation of COP allowed uptake of vital dyes into the cell and the lag was independent of dye molecular weight At the highest concentration of MTX examined dye uptake via COP was linear and inversely proportional to molecular weight These results suggest that COP does not increase in size as a function of time as would be predicted by the dilation or aggregation model Furthermore these results strongly suggest that the CaNSC and the COP are unique molecular structures MTX causes biphasic membrane blebbing During the final phase of MTX induced effects there is a gross change in membrane integrity which allows rapid uptake of vital dyes independent of dye molecular weight This final phase is associated with release of LDH which is indicative of oncotic cell death However over the course of the single cell experiments we noticed that BAECs treated with MTX not only accumulate vital dyes but also undergo an enormous reorganization of the plasma membrane to form giant membrane blebs An example of MTX induced membrane blebs is shown in the micrograph in Fig 5which was obtained with Hoffman optics and simultaneous bright field and fluorescence illumination After 50 minutes of MTX treatment at room temperature YO PRO staining is prominent in the nucleus as expected but is also visible in giant membrane blebs seen surrounding each cell in the field of view At the present time we do not know the composition of the membrane that comprise each bleb or the structural features of the cell that would allow evagination or expansion of these membrane structures at specific sites on the cell surface However blebbing presumably requires a change in osmotic pressure within the cell and so we reasoned that the blebs may be associated with the second phase of vital dye uptake To test this hypothesis we compared the morphological changes at the cell surface with dye uptake at the single cell level using time lapsed videomicroscopy A montage showing bright field and fluorescence image pairs is shown in Fig 6and the complete time lapsed video sequence is shown in Fig 1of the Additional Data Files section Montage avi As can be seen the first phase of ethidium uptake is associated with the formation of membrane blebs Fig 6 yellow arrows with an average diameter of approximately 4 microns Blebs begin to form within 3 minutes of MTX addition to the bath solution and remain at essentially a fixed size until approximately time 22 minutes As seen in the graphic presentation of fluorescence in each cell Fig 6 bottom right bleb formation correlates with the initial phase of dye uptake From time 28 to 38 minutes the second phase of dye uptake is observed and this phase is associated with large bleb dilation Fig 6 red arrows These results demonstrate that COP activity is associated with initial bleb formation whereas LDH release i e cytolysis is associated with dramatic bleb dilation File 1 Montage avi EB uptake and membrane blebbing in BAECs BAECs on glass cover slips were perfused with HBS at 37 C A phase left and fluorescence right image pair was obtained every 30 sec for 40 min MTX 0 3 nM was added to the bath solution at time 5 min The time lapse video was created from the captured images as described in Material and Methods with a time compression of 3 5 minutes i e 7 images per second movie 1 To better appreciate the dynamic nature of bleb formation and to clearly observe the rapid nuclear staining associated with bleb dilation we created time lapsed movies in which the bright field and fluorescence images were merged into a single video Fig 2 EB aviand Fig 3 YO PRO avi Additional Data Files section By setting your video viewer to continuously loop i e auto replay and by focusing during each sequence on a single cell within the field of view it can be seen that fluorescence increases slowly during bleb formation but that intense rapid dye staining occurs during the bleb dilation phase As seen in Fig 5 and in each of these videos MTX induced blebbing results in an enormous increase in membrane surface area which may represent stretching of the membrane or an evagination of existing caveolar structures associated with the plasmalemma of endothelial cells Endothelial cells are also known to have an extensive system of intracellular vesicles which are used for transporting substances from the blood to the interstitial space i e transcytotic vesicles Thus membrane blebbing could reflect a massive exocytotic event Why this would occur at selective sites on the plasmalemma remains unknown Interestingly the videos show several examples of blebs forming on the surface of pre existing blebs during the dilation phase Thus the structural element s that are required for localized evagination of membrane appears to be membrane associated and or pulled from the cytoplasm during the initial bleb formation Irrespective of the exact mechanism the experiments reported in the present study are the first to correlate MTX induced vital dye uptake with alterations in cell morphology File 2 EB avi EB uptake and membrane blebbing in BAECs BAECs on

Material and Methods with a time compression of 3 5 minutes i e 7 images per second For this movie the phase and YO PRO fluorescence images were merged into a single video YO PRO fluorescence is given a green pseudocolor movie 3 MTX induced membrane blebbing requires Ca 2 Previous studies on human skin fibroblasts showed that MTX had no effect on Ca 2 i vital dye uptake or fura 2 efflux when the cells were challenged in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 8 Although elevating Ca 2 i with ionomycin had no effect on vital dye uptake preliminary experiments in which fibroblasts were loaded intracellularly with the Ca 2 chelator BAPTA showed that MTX induced responses were significantly delayed suggesting that a rise in Ca 2 i is necessary but not sufficient for MTX induced COP formation To determine if extracellular Ca 2 is also required for MTX induced membrane blebbing changes in cell morphology were correlated with ethidium uptake in the presence of Ca 2 free extracellular buffer Fig 7 the video showing the merged phase and fluorescence images for this experiment is given in the Additional Data Files section see Ca free avi MTX had no effect on BAECs incubated in Ca 2 free buffer Importantly no dye uptake or membrane blebbing was observed for 30 min after the addition of MTX to the bath solution Subsequent readmission of Ca 2 to the bath produced an increase in ethidium uptake that again followed a biphasic time course virtually identical to the profile observed when MTX was added to cells incubated with normal Ca 2 containing medium As seen in Fig 7and the video dramatic membrane blebbing and ethidium uptake is observed 25 min after re addition of Ca 2 to the bath Control experiments in which Ca 2 was removed and added back to BAECs in the absence of MTX showed that these responses were dependent on the presence of MTX i e no dye uptake or blebbing was detected in the absence of MTX Fig 7 These results demonstrate that extracellular Ca 2 is necessary for MTX induced COP formation and membrane blebbing and suggest that both responses require Ca 2 influx and a concomitant rise in Ca 2 i File 4 Ca free avi Effect of Ca 2 on ethidium uptake and membrane blebbing in BAECs BAECs on glass cover slips were perfused with Ca 2 free HBS at 37 C A phase and fluorescence image pair was obtained every 30 sec for 60 min MTX 0 3 nM was added to the bath solution at time 5 min and Ca 2 was re added to the bath solution at time 35 min The time lapse video was created from the captured images as described in Material and Methods with a time compression of 3 5 minutes i e 7 images per second For this movie the phase and ethidium fluorescence images were merged into a single video Ethidium fluorescence is given a red pseudocolor movie 4 Conclusions In conclusion MTX treatment of BAECs causes a specific sequence of events i e a cell death cascade that is triggered by the activation of CaNSC and a rise in Ca 2 i This is followed by formation or activation of COP which is correlated with the formation of membrane blebs COP appears to be a unique molecule associated with the plasma membrane and to have a fixed pore geometry and conductance for each vital dye examined Furthermore activation of COP provides the initial driving force for osmotic swelling and bleb formation LDH release indicative of the final phase of MTX induced cell death is associated with massive bleb dilation Although the molecular mechanisms associated with each step in the cell death cascade remain unknown MTX may prove to be an important tool for understanding the
