                                 Searching for Roots We Never Had            In the summer people cometo New EnglandVermont Cape Cod Marthas Vineyard Mainefor the naturalamenities the water the mountains the clear fresh cool air the blueskies But they also come I think in search of their roots They want notonly to find but also to identify with the America of  years ago They wantto sit on the porch of the local country store and drink coffee and eatblueberry muffins They want to browse through the flea market searching forsome memento that connects with let us say  If they are near the seathey want to eat lobsters by the peck Some of the men will grow little beardsto be shaved off after Labor Day            Some ofthe summer people have been coming to the same small town for so many yearseven for more than one generation that they are part of the local scene and dohave roots there I am thinking of the more occasional visitors Very few haveroots in smalltown New England Some may have Boston roots More have New Yorkand New Jersey roots And most have roots two or three generations back inLithuania or Ireland or Sicily But they like to think of themselves as havinga family connection with early America            These small New England towns are part of the origins ofthe political economic and social world we all live in But so arePhiladelphia and Charlottesville Va The summer people coming to these smalltowns are not tourists looking for a civics lesson They are it seems to meseeking and imagining a more personal familial connection That is what I meanby roots            I dontderide this at all On the contrary I think it is wonderful that people hereshould become so Americanized so naturalized that they come to admire andseek to identify with a history in which their families had no part It is atestament to openness and democracy in America that so many of us want thisconnection and succeed in achieving it I dont know this but I doubt thatthis absorption occurs elsewhere in the world Would a person whose family hadlived in France or Japan for three generations come to identify himself withthe French or the Japanese culture of  years ago as if his family had been apart of it I dont think so unless the person was exceptionally rich ordistinguished and so transcended national boundaries            The search for roots is a common phenomenonPeople want to see where they came from in order to understand and appreciatethemselves better The Irish like to go back to the Old Sod and see theconditions in which their grandparents lived and perhaps meet relatives theyhad not known before The same seems to be true of Italians and probablyothers But the New England phenomenon is the adoption of roots that are notreally there            Why dopeople seek ersatz roots to identify with Perhaps because the world changes sorapidly that for many people the real roots no longer exist Once on a trip toDetroit where I was born I tried to visit the scenes of my boyhood Nothingremained that had any possible connection with me The scene of my motherschildhood Brownsville in Brooklyn is now lightyears distant from theculture in which she grew up            Finding real roots is especially difficult for Jews ofeastern European origin The shtetl in Belarus that my father left tocome to America as a boy over  years ago certainly bears no traces of myoriginsif it still exists Hitler was quite thorough in cutting us off at theroots Some American Jews do go back to visit the larger eastern Europeancities in which Jews once lived But the occasion is one for mourning aseparation not for celebrating a connection Many Jews find a trace of theirroots in Israel They can look at those stony fields and think that members oftheir families lived and worked there But that was a long long time ago andthe connection grows faint            So weand now I do not speakonly of Jewscome to small New England towns to find our roots and imagine anold family connection I understand that the natives the yearroundresidents do not want to adopt the visitors into their familiesand may evenresent them But they are courteous For one thing they are all in thebusiness of selling roots And maybe in the long winter nights the nativesmay realize that they are not really natives either that there were NativeAmericans here before them who have now been cut off from their roots
