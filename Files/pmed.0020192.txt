                            I am writing in response to an essay published in the most recent issue of         PLoS Medicine by Deborah Hayden entitled Alas Poor Yorick Digging Up        the Dead to Make Medical Diagnoses  As a coauthor of the         Science piece with Lori B Andrews that Hayden references I am troubled        by her comment on our article Nowhere in that article Ethics Constructing Ethical        Guidelines for Biohistory  do we suggest that genetic testing be done on deceased        individuals for historically significant questions In fact we specifically highlight some        of the ethical legal social and scientific issues that such testing raises and recommend        that guidelines be developed in order to monitor current research that is being undertaken        in this area The article does not advocate biohistorical research This distinction is        very important and one that is quite evident upon a careful reading of our article
