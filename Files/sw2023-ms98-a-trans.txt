        all right   okay   uh weve got a lot of them  too many of them   oh yes  and i believe we all do and its its just too easy to use   yeah well my husbands real good at using them   oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much   i dont have any of them i dont carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him     um it uh you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact id rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash   yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas   uh yes   and uh thats got us in trouble   yes thats real easy to do i have to watch it   yeah   in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament um they theyve um you know theyve theyve made them too easy and too accessible at everything to to buy   the ATM machines   oh yes   those things there thats what gets us   and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down   well no he doesnt have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records   oh uhhuh oh thats good   but uh he knows when hes overspends and when he doesnt and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card  you know ive used the credit card a couple times to pay bills     oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle   yeah   as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan   yeah thats what hes talking about doing now   oh no um yeah the ATMs theyre but theyre nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed   yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me   oh thats the best way its used thats the best way yes now i think that sort of evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something   yeah       i dont know i like that he walks in you know and hes got this little gift and howd you pay for it credit  he you know said whipped out my little card     and see theres no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it   yeah id never thought about that way i dont really look  i guess i ought to sometimes     oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah   well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo   oh those are fun   yeah   you get started on them and cant quit   like credit cards  oh no never thought of it that way either hes you know hes addicted to it at times   just exactly   oh its its real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you dont have to write a check or anything   and see the thing is you know he go out and hell spend it when he wants you know and uh uh im afraid to im afraid to use that credit card   yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if   yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and hes not a yeller though but       he calmly you know you shouldnt have spent it all on that   yeah they   he likes to buy the kids toys  with the uh credit card too you you know hell go to by WalMart or something and   oh yeah thats it oh yeah theres thats a weakness there thats just you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you dont care how much it costs or what it takes   yeah well uh i dont know the uh uh the uh WalMart thats where all of our bills are for the credit card   uhhuh yeah thats uh i always end up going into WalMart and  coming out with everything that uh i didnt have on the list were just getting more than what we went in for   but we went in for uh uh something for the car one day last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the   uhhuh       a pair of shoes for me and uh lets see what else did he he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh   oh yeah its dangerous   you know we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at WalMart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids   umhum oh yeah its just too easy to do you go in for just one thing were were infamous about that and so   yeah ill second that     oh well yeah i well im im glad we have credit cards thats uh because in sometimes when theres an emergency it it comes in handy   yeah   its nice to have   i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us   yeah weve yeah weve had uh a sick animal and uh the vet you know the dog and vets are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldnt do without them   i dont think wed live   huhuh no no i think its become too much of an everyday life here theyre part of it   yeah well ive been asking my husband for the credit cards ive got all of them but one       i just hide them from him and when i feel that its necessary to pull it out ill pull it out but he keeps one of them       he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh   the balance   credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount   oh yes uhhuh so you know he cant spend too much   yeah you know uh i dont really exactly remember how much it is i think its about five hundred limit uh you know its just uh just one for him to fiddle with   yes umhum   i have to think of something else im im blank   i was i was just uh oh well lets see i guess weve talked what almost five minutes   well six minutes ive got a timer on my uh   oh   clock on my phone   oh i wish i had one of those   well we bought this with credit too  well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh   oh see there you go   popped that credit card out it was a Sears   oh your up in Memphis   no i used to be im in Texas   oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far   well i i dont know i dont know how far it goes   yeah yeah im down in Houston   are you in Texas oh im in uh down here in Sherman or Denison rather   oh okay yeah umhum well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had   first phone call this is my first one too   uhhuh my husband did one last night and he just loved it hes been getting he got a real good topic   huh   so well uh   you know we got to get back to credit cards   yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think weve pretty much said it all   it   um but so uh but yeah uh i think we couldnt make it without them   i know i couldnt uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out   umhum   and uh thats got us in a little bit of trouble now thats why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there     yeah yeah but uh we uh we try to keep a uh uh tight controls over over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays   uh uh my hubby does not have uh too much control when it comes to using that card uh  i know uh       uh for quite a while we was using them to uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent   oh goodness   you know it uh we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day   uhhuh uhhuh   and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was  paying   oh   the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and   it gets rough   it got it got real rough   thats hard   he just popped out that uh Master Card and   get that cash advance uhhuh   yeah we got big cash advance and really thats whats uh holding us back now thats     yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do theyre worth it oh well i i think weve pretty much come to an end here   yeah im trying to find out how long were supposed talk   i think it was at least five minutes wasnt it   thats what im looking for now thats why i was just trying to talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing
