 all right okay uh we ve got a lot of them too many of them oh yes and i believe we all do and it s it s just too easy to use yeah well my husband s real good at using them oh i believe that uh mine would say the same uh but uh i seem too rely on them too much i don t have any of them i don t carry them he carries them i try to take them away from him um it uh you know i seem to uh use those more than i do cash in fact i d rather carry the cards than i would the uh cash yeah well we got in a spot of trouble with uh using uh the credit cards on gas uh yes and uh that s got us in trouble yes that s real easy to do i have to watch it yeah in fact yeah uh we i can understand that predicament um they they ve um you know they ve they ve made them too easy and too accessible at everything to to buy the ATM machines oh yes those things there that s what gets us and then plus then you for end up forgetting to write it down well no he doesn t have that trouble he uh has this little slip that comes out with the uh ATM machine and he just keeps that he keeps fairly decent records oh uh huh oh that s good but uh he knows when he s overspends and when he doesn t and he knows that anytime he pops out that credit card you know i ve used the credit card a couple times to pay bills oh yeah yes uh and then then that gets into a vicious circle yeah as far as you know paying off the the the loan that you just got from the credit card to pay off the other loan yeah that s what he s talking about doing now oh no um yeah the ATM s they re but they re nice though to have in case you need to get some quick cash and everything is closed yeah well yeah i like them i i have to admit i do like my credit cards uh i love it when he decides to go in a store and buy something for me oh that s the best way it s used that s the best way yes now i think that sort of evens it out as far as uh letting them carry it so as long as they do buy us something yeah i don t know i like that he walks in you know and he s got this little gift and how d you pay for it credit he you know said whipped out my little card and see there s no secrecy to that because the bill always comes in and we know how much they pay for it yeah i d never thought about that way i don t really look i guess i ought to sometimes oh i have to open it you know they mine always charges the flowers so i can always end up saying oh you spent too much you know and so yeah well i think the best thing he bought for me off of them is a Nintendo oh those are fun yeah you get started on them and can t quit like credit cards oh no never thought of it that way either he s you know he s addicted to it at times just exactly oh it s it s real easy to get addicted to them you know you get out on a shopping spree frenzy and uh just charge it all and then you don t have to write a check or anything and see the thing is you know he go out and he ll spend it when he wants you know and uh uh i m afraid to i m afraid to use that credit card yeah is there is a a fear to it as far as what happens if yeah you know uh is he going to yell at me for buying this with this you know and he s not a yeller though but he calmly you know you shouldn t have spent it all on that yeah they he likes to buy the kids toys with the uh credit card too you you know he ll go to by Wal Mart or something and oh yeah that s it oh yeah there s that s a weakness there that s just you know you you always want to get your kids everything and uh you don t care how much it costs or what it takes yeah well uh i don t know the uh uh the uh Wal Mart that s where all of our bills are for the credit card uh huh yeah that s uh i always end up going into Wal Mart and coming out with everything that uh i didn t have on the list we re just getting more than what we went in for but we went in for uh uh something for the car one day last week and he went we went and bought a potty chair uh uh one of those Ninja Turtles for my son uh you know the potty chair for my daughter and he bought the uh huh a pair of shoes for me and uh let s see what else did he he bought a couple pairs of shoes for the kids you know i got two kids and he bought them shoes with it and uh oh yeah it s dangerous you know we went in for a ten dollar piece of thing for the car and ended up sixty seventy dollars for uh at Wal Mart and then we went to Payless and bought the shoes for the kids um hum oh yeah it s just too easy to do you go in for just one thing we re we re infamous about that and so yeah i ll second that oh well yeah i well i m i m glad we have credit cards that s uh because in sometimes when there s an emergency it it comes in handy yeah it s nice to have i know we had the car break down one time and the uh credit card saved us yeah we ve yeah we ve had uh a sick animal and uh the vet you know the dog and vet s are so expensive that uh we uh the credit card helped us a lot there too so we wouldn t do without them i don t think we d live huh uh no no i think it s become too much of an everyday life here they re part of it yeah well i ve been asking my husband for the credit cards i ve got all of them but one i just hide them from him and when i feel that it s necessary to pull it out i ll pull it out but he keeps one of them he keeps the one with the least amount of the uh uh what you call it yeah no the uh the balance credit line you know uh the credit limit i let him have the one with the least amount oh yes uh huh so you know he can t spend too much yeah you know uh i don t really exactly remember how much it is i think it s about five hundred limit uh you know it s just uh just one for him to fiddle with yes um hum i have to think of something else i m i m blank i was i was just uh oh well let s see i guess we ve talked what almost five minutes well six minutes i ve got a timer on my uh oh clock on my phone oh i wish i had one of those well we bought this with credit too well we found it with a clearance uh down in Memphis i guess and uh oh see there you go popped that credit card out it was a Sears oh your up in Memphis no i used to be i m in Texas oh your in Texas oh okay i was i was going to go goodness they really got uh this out far well i i don t know i don t know how far it goes yeah yeah i m down in Houston are you in Texas oh i m in uh down here in Sherman or Denison rather oh okay yeah um hum well oh this is uh this is great this was the first one i had first phone call this is my first one too uh huh my husband did one last night and he just loved it he s been getting he got a real good topic huh so well uh you know we got to get back to credit cards yeah well i was just trying to think uh i think we ve pretty much said it all it um but so uh but yeah uh i think we couldn t make it without them i know i couldn t uh we went and we maxed out quite a few of them before uh i started taking the uh cards away we maxed out a lot of well we had about six or seven and we maxed them out um hum and uh that s got us in a little bit of trouble now that s why we and we was using one of them to pay off the bills on the others and that got that in trouble there yeah yeah but uh we uh we try to keep a uh uh tight controls over over them but it it gets hard like especially around Christmas time and birthdays uh uh my hubby does not have uh too much control when it comes to using that card uh i know uh uh for quite a while we was using them to uh i think even one time we used it to pay our rent oh goodness you know it uh we first moved here we just had a little bit of trouble and we got in to too expensive of a house or apartment rather and uh you know he was only down here for one day uh huh uh huh and we just everything just piled up wrecked the car and you know in order to do that we had to you know we was paying oh the rent plus trying plus trying to get the money for another car another car and it gets rough it got it got real rough that s hard he just popped out that uh Master Card and get that cash advance uh huh yeah we got big cash advance and really that s what s uh holding us back now that s yeah it uh it but see it does come in handy those they do they re worth it oh well i i think we ve pretty much come to an end here yeah i m trying to find out how long we re supposed talk i think it was at least five minutes wasn t it that s what i m looking for now that s why i was just trying to talk without having to think about what i was saying and uh trying to look over this thing
