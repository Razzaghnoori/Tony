                well what are your did you like do you use credit cards   uh not very often i usually uh the ones we use is like visa and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month   huhuh so it doesnt gets uh uh the credit uh   i have uh uh right   uh interest rate is so high that youre really if youre going to use credit cards you need to use that policy i think dont you   yeah   otherwise you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that its hardly   thats right   uh its not a very good idea   do you have a lot of credit cards   well i have a lot of them but i dont use them very much though   right     i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh tuition if its you know if im short to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can the other thing i i think if you do get overextended a little bit you need to be sure and pay it off uh more than one at a time because i think you could run forever paying what they require   oh yeah   just goes on and on   which is what they want   yeah   i think a lot of people go in debt because they think oh you know i can just charge it but really i mean if they dont have the money then they arent going to have it in a month so   yeah thats true   they uh make the mistake of pushing all their cards   there are times when its when its very useful like uh emergency trip   yeah yeah   or something sometimes when you when you the the money will be available but its you know not immediately handy i think uh theyre very helpful plus the fact that its helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes   right   but uh i you really do need to be very um oh responsible about it or you end up in deep trouble   yeah i made that mistake when i first got a job and thats kind of like it took me quite a while to pay them off   uhhuh   so after after that i decided well im not going to use them at all and just try to pay cash for everything and that worked for a while and then we got married so we decided to you know if we used them we would pay them off as we go so   right right that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances the other thing about them is too if you really dont you really need to get some and use them because if you have never used them and developed and havent developed a credit thing it stops you from doing a lot of things if you if you pay for everything by cash uh there is a lot of things that a lot of people who will not give you credit when you need something like a house or   right thats true yeah   a car so so they they have become a very vital part of our of our monetary  system over the last few years   uhhuh   but uh its true you have to be very careful or you end up uh going in the deep end and uh and an awful lot of people are in trouble   umhum   we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card uh company that and he makes calls to people who have problems you know credit problems that are trying to work out of them and uh   uhhuh     poor thing he comes home very depressed every night   oh   because the world has so many problems of that sort so its uh its uh   yeah   its a really big problem i think and um takes mature people to to treat it uh so that its so that its a real advantage to you instead of a disadvantage   right i think um the way the tax system was they encouraged people to use credit cards you know with a big write off at the end of the year   yeah   but now its like its punch money because   right it doesnt do you any good now does it right   you cannot right you cannot write off your interest   even before it probably wasnt though because you didnt get anywhere near as much as what it   yeah   you didnt get to claim anywhere near what you ended up paying so well im not that uh other than that i dont have too much on credit cards but       its good to talk to you   yeah you too thanks for calling bye   uhhuh bye now
