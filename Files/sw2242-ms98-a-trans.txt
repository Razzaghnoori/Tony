 okay camping my camping experiences are uh using a trailer a Terry eighteen foot uh mobile trailer and and that s you know like going to lakes and stuff like that i see sure setting up the trailer for a weekend or a week or ten days or whatever uh what s what s your thoughts on camping uh huh well for me camping i ve never owned a trailer so for me camping is more more more has a lot more to do with backpacks and tents uh huh but i guess that this camping two kinds of camping that um i ve done one is to throw a a tent and food food and the like in the back of a car and drive to a campsise and setup the tent and have the the car right next to me um hum the other is to actually you know carry everything on your back i ve done camping out in at in the Aspen Mountains in Colorado where yeah that s up here in New England that s we call that backpacking which is the same thing which is you re you ve got everything on your back you know an aluminum camp frame uh right right exactly uh uh yeah that well um the older you get the more convenience you try to bring with you i guess so i m up to dragging the trailer around which is my next step is going to be probably Winnebago i hope if i only can afford one but that i understand oh yeah oh of course camping again is is is like you say that that your your backpacking is i guess what i would call true camping i m not right i m not sure that the other camping type of camping is nothing more than a leisure or well either way it s get i guess maybe we can define it as living away from the home that s right that s right we have we have uh around the lakes and ponds up here and stuff we have uh campsites that are uh barriers set aside for each like the each individual trailer and you have a sewer hookup and water and electricity but exactly and you back in you know and or just pull into your spot and uh some you can rent by the year some you can rent daily or nightly or by the week or whatever um hum yeah when when i mentioned i ve done this camping out of the car i ve actually done of the situation just like that but what s interesting is it s through Texas Instruments oh really yeah TI has a little uh owns a piece of land on the edge of a lake that borders that the lake is on the border of Texas and Oklahoma it s called Lake Texoma yeah they what Lake Texoma they ve got a big uh big rec centers up there right yeah that s right so that s where i ve done most of that actually is that a pretty nice place it is it s really beautiful the the lake is is outstanding it s a huge huge huge lake yeah i spent about ten years in Abilene for TI i i worked out there in Abilene in west Texas and i never did get a chance to get over to Lake Texoma i i wished i had uh oh yeah oh yeah i think you well if you every get to Dallas you can probably you know borrow you can go up there and get a space for the night for two bucks that s unreal yeah yeah so it s easy to do i m actually interested in getting one of those kind of my wife has been talking about this in the past couple of years one of those kind of campers that pop up so it s about uh maybe eight foot square and but only about two feet tall and when you get to where you re going it raises up and there s tenting material oh yeah that folds out from it it s like a crank up top thing you yeah it s you re talking of a trailer type that you pull huh yeah okay yes exactly exactly exactly my wife has a lot of interest in those and i ve actually been keeping my eye on the paper and they seem to be running between one and two thousand dollars which yeah yeah you can that s about the price of them up here they re they re uh uh Sears sells them Coleman sells them sure they have some some good buys on them and those are pretty nice i they re they re have a little galley a little uh sink that s got some compressed air and water in it and uh and a little stove that s like a propane stove yeah uh um hum couple of little cabinets and and uh sleeping on either end of the the canvas when you open it up it s just all screened in so it s pretty neat uh oh yeah yeah that the nice thing about dragging that is that it s very very convenient to travel on the highway with because it s very low i see mine is like pulling a big house behind you you know oh yeah you said yours is eighteen feet long what yeah an eighteen foot Terry uh it s completely self contained i mean i have everything a shower a TV everything in it you know but oh yeah you you the brand is Terry yeah T E R R Y Terry oh i never heard of it well they re i guess they re pretty popular up this way yeah it s a pretty rugged trailer it s a tandem wheel even though it s only eighteen foot long so there s it drags pretty good you know with a car but yeah i ve got a big Oldsmobile that i pull it with when i yeah uh if i get rid of that i ll have to get rid of the trailer because i don t i m not sure what else will be able to lug it around the hills up here well that s neat oh yeah that s something kind of hilly country up through this way but yeah um yeah well that s great well uh i i like camping i i did a lot of it i when my kids were small of course they re all grown now and gone i ve got four boys and they ve kind of all gone and we don t really do that together much anymore as they ve out two are out in California and two are still in Texas so we kind of don t get together but maybe once a year and then we just do a little fishing but right i wished i had the opportunity to do camping because i used to love to live at the lake all summer and into the fall and oh yeah yeah uh it was kind of pretty nice but uh i just wish that i had an opportunity to do a little more that s right the thing that i i then again i i tried pulling the trailer one year and i went everywhere with the trailer like to beaches and to stuff but that got to be a hassle you know breaking down and setting up and breaking down so i decided that and and right i would lease a spot a spot on this particular lake here in northern New England and go there every every spring and stay there all summer and it really worked out good for me um hum and and you can and you still do that oh yeah yeah and so you drive to work from there or you just take the summer off yeah no i d rive from the campground oh wow that s nice which uh it adds maybe twenty miles uh you know uh each way but it s not all that much uh yeah twenty miles is going is just going a little different way it s probably twenty miles longer than my normal way to work i live in Rhode Island work in Massachusetts but i see it s uh it just adds about twenty miles to it but it s worth it to get to the campground and be just be out in the country and the woods all by yourself or you know with just a few neighbors around or so right and that s that s pretty nice because you can fish and just well i envy that what a great life yeah well like i say it just uh i i enjoy doing it i wished i had more time to do it but hopefully i can get up a retirement here before too much longer and then yeah huh i ll be looking forward to to like i say with a Winnebago because as the older you get the less things you want to do i understand and i don t want to let the i don t want to let the canopy down i don t want to jack it up i don t want to do all that stuff anymore and just turn the key off and get in the back and do whatever you know that s right just want to get in and yeah yeah that s funny well but uh it s been nice uh like i really appreciate talking with you and i thought i d uh give you a call on my lunch time here today and worked out good nice talking to you too well i appreciate it and and good luck with your uh your future your hopes of buy a Winnebago yeah uh i thank you very much you re ever up this way look me up here at TI in Attleboro i ll do it nice talking to you Ray bye bye thanks sir
