 The Slate Arts Index According to the Wall Street Journal high culture is flourishing in America The evidence In a front page story published a couple of weeks ago the paper noted that Americans are drinking microbrews instead of Bud and that you can now get a cappuccino in Alpena Ark Though it might shock my Seattle based colleagues I m not sure that better coffee is the ultimate measure of a civilization But if we don t count Starbucks how do we know that the arts are flourishing in America There s some support for the notion in a recent survey of public participation in the arts published by the National Endowment for the Arts According to numbers extrapolated from a poll 97 million people or half the adult population of the United States participate in the arts in some way A full 34 9 percent of us went to an art museum last year 15 6 percent attended classical music concerts From these numbers the NEA has derived a figure of 88 million classical music concerts attended in 1997 vs 60 million in 1992 and 225 million art museum visits in 1997 up from 163 million in 1992 However the NEA points out that its 1992 numbers aren t comparable to the 1997 ones Weirdly the 1992 survey was appended to the National Crime Victimization Survey Has anyone in your household been mugged in the past 12 months Have you been to see Riverdance The bleak context may have led to underreporting The 1997 poll by contrast was free standing but one can see how it might register false positives An NEA survey that asks whether you like to go to the theater opera ballet etc subtly begs for affirmative answers And in fact the five year increase indicated by the NEA is much greater than the numbers tabulated by various arts service organizations which in some cases report a decline where the NEA sees growth But the chief limitation of using the NEA numbers as a proxy for the health of high culture is that it s a demand side picture it captures consumption rather than production It tells us nothing about the quality or quantity of high culture being created in the United States today And in fact the new study s upbeat tone cuts directly against the conclusions of a report issued by former NEA Chair Jane Alexander on her way out The American Canvas study published in 1997 argues that arts institutions are elitist complacent and largely hostile to popular audiences Last year according to the NEA the arts were sick This year they re thriving Of course numbers can never resolve the inherently subjective question of cultural health For a consensus about whether a lot of masterpieces were painted or written in 1998 check back in 100 years But it may be possible to come up with a more rounded portrait of relative cultural well being one that takes into account how well artists are doing as well as how many butts are in auditorium seats To that end I hereby initiate the Slate Arts Index This is a measure based on statistics culled from various sources that give a clue about the health of different art forms Here s how it works The baseline is 100 points composed of six separate categories It breaks down as follows 20 points for literature 20 for music 20 for the fine arts 20 for theater 10 for film and 10 for dance On the basis of the numbers I ve gathered it s hard to say how well any art form or culture as a whole is doing But in a year we should be able to say whether they re doing better or worse If the music score rises to 22 that would suggest a 10 percent improvement A total tally of 92 would mean an 8 percent decline in the health of high culture overall Literature 20 points 10 points number of weeks that literary books were on the New York Times best seller list 1997 295 5 points number of full length poetry titles published 1997 942 5 points number of Penguin classics sold 1997 3 95 million The only book question on the NEA survey is Have you read any literature in the past year Sixty three percent said yes The Slate literature index derives from three more compelling factors The first is the number of weeks new works of literature spent on the Times best seller list in the past year 295 as it turns out out of a total of 780 What is literature Rather than attempting to gauge quality I have included all books that have literary aspirations or are regarded as literature by most reviewers Cold Mountain yes The Partner no Elmore Leonard yes Carl Hiaasen no As opposed to the commonly cited figure of total book sales this number is a reasonable stand in for the question of how many Americans are reading nonpulp new novels I ve reserved the other 10 points for poetry and classic literature Our proxy for verse is a fairly crude one the number of books of poetry published For classics I m using sales from one publisher since Penguin keeps most of the world s great literature in print Music 20 points 4 points number of opera performances 1996 97 season 2 397 4 points number of opera premieres 1997 98 season 13 4 points number of trips to the symphony 1996 97 31 9 million 4 points number of new orchestral works commissioned and performed 1997 98 211 4 points jazz sales as a share of the recorded music market 1997 2 8 percent The logic here is that while the first number gives a sense of the availability of opera as whole the second number gives a sense of whether new work is being added to the standard repertoire Both statistics come from Opera America The third and fourth numbers provided by the American Symphony Orchestra League do the same thing with orchestral music It would be nice to include chamber music but there are simply no useful statistics Lastly while I wasn t able to find any reliable numbers on jazz performance the Recording Industry Association of America keeps track of jazz CD sales relative to other kinds of music Fine Arts 20 points 10 points attendance at 149 art museums 1997 42 7 million 10 points number of people employed as painters sculptors craft artists and artist printmakers 1997 251 000 Art museum attendance is a reasonable proxy for how many people are experiencing art The American Association of Art Museum Directors reports a much smaller increase in visits than the NEA Based on the constant number of museums that responded between 1993 and 1996 attendance rose from 37 1 million to 41 3 million for a slightly smaller sample group than the one used in 1997 As more people pay attention to art it s becoming easier to get by as an artist The other useful figure is the number of people working as artists According to the Department of Commerce 251 000 people made their livings as painters sculptors and craft workers last year up from 222 000 in 1993 Theater 20 points 10 points attendance at 81 nonprofit theaters 1997 11 98 million 10 points number of nonprofit theaters in the United States 1997 800 The Theater Communications Group a New York based organization keeps figures for nonprofit theaters such as the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge Mass the Guthrie in Minneapolis and the Steppenwolf in Chicago For 197 theaters surveyed in a forthcoming TCG study attendance was 17 25 million However in the interest of having an apples to apples comparison in the future I m using the smaller sample of 81 theaters tracked over time In these aggregate attendance is up slightly over the past three years from 11 79 million in 1995 to 11 98 million in 1997 This does not include Broadway musicals but then we re looking at high culture Our other measure is the total number of nonprofit theaters 800 also according to TCG Film 10 points 5 points box office receipts for independent films as a share of total 1997 3 8 percent 5 points foreign film receipts as a share of total 1997 1 1 percent According to Exhibitor Relations which provides numbers to Variety box office receipts from independent films were 239 million in 1997 out of a total of 6 3 billion for all films Foreign film receipts were 68 8 million The first number is likely to be higher for 1998 the year to date figure is 210 million while the second looks to be much lower there being no Full Monty import hit this year I m using percentages rather than dollar amounts so that I don t have to adjust for inflation in future These numbers reflect consensus trends foreign films are barely alive while independent ones are flourishing Dance 10 points 5 points average attendance at 25 largest ballet companies 1997 1 997 5 points contract hours per week for dancers at ballet and modern companies 1997 36 Dance indicators have been falling since 1991 when John Munger began keeping systematic track for Dance USA This contradicts the NEA report a discrepancy possibly explained by a rise in attendance at school performances There are two useful measures of dance strength The first is the average attendance per performance at the 25 largest ballet companies which has declined from 2 400 in 1992 to 1 997 last year The other is the average number of contract weeks for dancers at major companies which includes modern as well as ballet companies That figure was 36 in 1997 up from a low of 34 in 1994 In other words the dance audience has been declining while professional dancers are finding slightly more work This suggests philanthropy at work I couldn t come up with a plausible indicator for architecture Nor have I devised one for criticism which perhaps self servingly I consider to be an important component of cultural health Lastly the Slate Arts Index doesn t try to measure as the NEA survey does how many Americans are actively participating in the arts as amateur singers writers and painters What the Slate index does do is establish a baseline Next fall we should be able to come back and say something meaningful about what kind of year the arts have had For what it s worth I m predicting we ll hit 104
