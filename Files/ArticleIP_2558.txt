 An Old Couch Potato s Lament I watch lots of television If you are as long in years and short in energy as I am watching television is the second best occupation The best of course is sleeping but you can t sleep all the time I watch many kinds of television but some kinds I don t watch I don t watch cop shows If I wanted all that violence I would watch the local news at 10 or 11 p m I do not watch sitcoms They seem to me to consist entirely of juvenile leering about sex I am weaning myself from the talk shows about public policy that I used to think it was my duty to watch I have concluded that they are all games of Pin the Tail on the Donkey blindfolded journalists trying to stick pins in evasive politicians I watch the evening news because it comes on at dinner time and serves as background music to which we my wife and I don t have to pay much attention I think I could do with about three minutes of news a day I watch some sports especially Sunday afternoon professional football I love seeing something done extremely well and I think that throwing a pass 20 yards down the field to a precise point where the receiver catches it amid a forest of defenders is doing something extremely well I like to watch with the sound off because the sports pundits are no better than the policy pundits and if I fall asleep during the game that s fine I watch the occasional symphony concert broadcast on television I can hear better sound on the radio or on a CD but there is something special about the TV performance that is connected with doing something extremely well When I only listen I can hear Mozart or Haydn doing something extremely well But on television I can see 100 musicians doing something extremely well In the course of an hour they play I don t know how many say 100 000 notes and all those notes come out right I look at the second clarinet player He s no genius He probably makes his living by giving lessons But he always comes in with his duh at the right time As the former second clarinet in the Schenectady High School orchestra I appreciate that The heart of our TV meal is the detective story Properly done with little violence and much detection a TV detective story is the ideal nonirritating guilt free interactive program I am not sitting passively on the couch while gales of canned laughter blow over me or waves of fake blood wash over me I am doing something I am helping the detective find or prove who did it If I don t find the answer and I never do I don t feel stupid about it And if I do find a little piece of the answer noting a clue or narrowing down the list of possible perpetrators I am pleased with myself But here is my lament The detective story is disappearing from the TV screen For many years Great Britain has been the source of TV detective stories I am grateful to the British for that but their stories have never been entirely satisfactory Sherlock Holmes of course is the father of the British detectives and when he began to appear on PBS in the 80s we watched him regularly But he does not inspire repeat watchers As played by Jeremy Brett Holmes was so eccentric so mannered that all attention was drawn to him rather than to the story and after you had seen him several times he elicited giggles rather than puzzlement Hercule Poirot was my favorite among the British detective story detectives who made their U S TV debut on PBS Perhaps that reflects a connection formed 50 years ago when I used to pass the time on the train between Washington and New York reading his adventures Anyway in the TV incarnation the stories were the right length one hour and Poirot spoke clearly The clues moreover were not too obscure for the occasional one to be recognized by the viewer But there have been no new Poirot stories for a long time and although we still watch the reruns I have the feeling that his shiny mustache is getting shinier and his mincing steps even more mincing The two British detectives now appearing in new series on PBS are Chief Inspector Morse and Cmdr Dalgliesh We appreciate and watch them but we are not entirely happy with them Their stories run for two to four hours in two installments separated by a week That is too long for even a couch potato to sit still Dalgliesh mumbles Surprisingly an English actor speaking with what he thinks is a Belgian accent speaks more clearly than an English actor speaking in his own accent The clues are too faint too understated I don t feel that I am coming closer to the solution even after three hours Maybe I am just not smart enough for a modern British TV detective story as I am not smart enough for a British crossword puzzle But I often think that even Morse and Dalgliesh don t have a clue until the whole thing is revealed in the last 15 minutes My favorite detective stories are American and the most favorite of all is CBS s Murder She Wrote starring Angela Lansbury as Jessica Fletcher Murder episodes are almost always one hour in length Everyone whether a French detective an Indian chief or a Chinese banker speaks clear English The clues are not obvious but they are not too hard to get either especially after a second or third rerun The production values are high The setting wherever it might be always seems authentic not as if it were a Hollywood back lot The stories are set in different walks of life a TV studio a rodeo a bank an advertising agency a toy factory and each one seems to reflect the setting accurately Having seen so many episodes and observed the formula I have thought it would be amusing to write an episode set in a think tank But I have been unable to visualize one think tank scholar killing another For what a citation in a newspaper column But best of all there s Angela She always says the right thing does the right thing wears the right clothes She is an example of doing something extremely well She does not rely on eccentricities to create a recognizable character and that is why you can watch her over and over again Time cannot wither nor custom stale her infinite normalcy Alas no new episodes of Murder She Wrote have been made for several years We are living on reruns That is all right for now True fans can enjoy seeing the same episode four or five times They will discover something new each time But that cannot go on much longer I fear that when we reach the sixth or seventh repeat it will have become boring And what shall we do then CBS allegedly gave up programming new episodes of Murder She Wrote because of the demographics We fans of Jessica Fletcher are too old to be a good market for advertisers It is not because we are old that we like the polite civilized detective story My generation liked that when we were young we liked Nick and Nora Charles in the movies and Ellery Queen on the radio In our middle age we liked Perry Mason on television We are of the generation that likes to have its intellect teased Later generations like to have their emotions aroused But it is true that we are not a good market for advertisers We have money and spend it or invest it But we have been around too long and have had too much experience to buy something or invest in something just because we see it advertised on television Perhaps in the era of 500 TV channels there will be one devoted to new episodes of Murder She Wrote Columbo Perry Mason and to other newly conceived civilized detective stories But for many fans of that genre time is running out For the present we have to try to learn to understand the British detectives And we have to nurse the supply of old Murder She Wrote s rationing ourselves to not more than one viewing a week hoping to preserve the fascination until the need for such entertainment has passed
