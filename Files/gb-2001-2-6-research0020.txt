                    Background        Completely sequenced genomes enable the study of        relations between organisms in terms of the complete set of        genes they possess Genomic properties have been proposed        as the most convenient tool for studying these        relationships as they are global properties that may        circumvent many of the difficulties of classical molecular        phytogenies   Common gene content    or        conservation of families of proteins   are examples of        this kind of genomic information From this genomic        perspective conservation of gene order is a very        informative measure that may provide information both about        the function and interactions of the proteins these genes        encode    and about the evolution of the genomes and        the organisms themselves        Gene order is generally well preserved at close        phylogenetic distances   When the species are not        closely related the degree of gene order conservation is        usually low and consequently it was proposed that        conservation of gene order is easily lost during evolution          This loss also extends to the disruption of operons        in some cases wiping them out completely          Nevertheless some instances of especially        wellpreserved clusters of genes are known even in        divergent species The best examples are the genes for        ribosomal proteins   and the         dcw cluster   Lathe and        coworkers   recently identified genomic regions in        which gene order is especially highly conserved Even if        some rearrangement does occur in these regions the general        trend is to keep the genes closer together than in other        regions This shows that selection for gene location and        ordering could exist in some cases The operon structure        and common regulation cannot easily account for the        conservation as these conserved regions extend for more        than a single operon hence the proposed nomenclature of         uberoperons          Conservation of gene order can be due to any one of the        following three reasons First the species have diverged        only recently and gene order has not yet been destroyed        second there has been lateral gene transfer of a block of        genes and third the integrity of the cluster is important        to the fitness of the cell Only in this latter case is        gene order conservation selectable        Proposed explanations for selection for gene ordering        include helping the interaction of proteins encoded by the        genes of the cluster   favoring lateral gene transfer          or colocalization of the mRNAs in the same region        of the cell   These explanations are not mutually        exclusive Recent studies of the structure of the         dcw cluster suggest that in this        particular case conservation of gene order within the        cluster may be linked to cellular morphology thus        connecting gene order with a selectable phenotype                 The importance of gene order in the study of evolution        is starting to be recognized Even if the loss of gene        order conservation is faster than the loss of sequence        similarity a large amount of conservation remains at        medium phylogenetic distances such as that between         Escherichia coli and         Bacillus subtilis   Conservation        is a valuable clue to the relationships between organisms        and the influence of events such as lateral gene transfer        on the evolution of genomes        I present here an analysis of the extent and        characteristics of gene order conservation in prokaryotes        and attempt to answer two questions Does conservation of        gene order occur similarly throughout the prokaryotes Are        the conserved regions distributed uniformly within the        genomes                    Results and discussion                  Conservation of gene order in evolution                      General trends in gene order conservation            To address the issue of how gene order is conserved            during evolution I measured gene order conservation in            prokaryotes in relation to evolutionary distance in            terms of small subunit rRNA SSU rRNA substitutions            The results are shown in Figure             In the Bacteria conservation of gene order            apparently follows a common trend for all species The            loss of gene order conservation when phylogenetic            distance increases is clear but even at long distances            some conservation is maintained This is mainly because            of clusters of genes that remain well conserved during            bacterial evolution   Gene order is extensively            conserved at small phylogenetic distances mostly            because rearrangement has not yet had time to            occur            The distribution in Figure afits to a sigmoid            curve revealing the existence of a cooperative process            in the loss of gene ordering This might be related to            the existence of operons in which the displacement of            a single gene can facilitate the rearrangement of the            rest of the operon Previous studies proposed an            exponential shape for the distribution    This            disagreement probably arises because those studies did            not include pairs of closely related species and            therefore missed the leftmost part of the graph which            is highly significant for the sigmoid shape            Within this observed global trend several bacterial            species present small deviations from the average            Although such deviations are small in some cases they            are indicative of evolutionary processes shaping the            genomes            An interesting case is that of             Buchnera Figure bshows that the            degree of gene order conservation in             Buchnera is greater than expected            according to the phylogenetic position of this            bacterium as previously observed    As an            endosymbiont             Buchnera is experiencing            extensive gene loss due to reductive processes and            consequently lower levels of gene order conservation            could be expected However many gene rearrangement            processes are dependent on RecA activity               which could not be found in             Buchnera   As a result it            is likely that the genome of this bacterium has            experienced few rearrangement events Lateral gene            transfer also seems negligible in this case   and            therefore gene loss remains as the only process capable            of altering gene order in the             Buchnera genome With the            exception of lost genes the             Buchnera genome might reflect the            gene order it had when the bacterium became an            endosymbiont and lost             recA Accordingly it could be            used as a convenient reference point in studies on gene            order            Deepbranching species on the bacterial tree such            as             Aquifex and             Synechocystis also deviate from            the average These species have the lowest values for            gene order conservation among the Bacteria Figure b            This agrees with classical molecular phylogenies as            well as with genomic phylogenies based on            wholeproteome analysis   in which these species            are also the most divergent within the Bacteria            To study whether a common trend in conservation of            gene order occurs within prokaryotes I also included            archaeal species in the comparisons According to            Figure a the trend observed in Bacteria is not found            in the Archaea Conservation of gene order between            archaea is less than between bacteria even for very            closely related species              Pyrococcus horikoshii and             Pyrococcus abyssi  and the            point at which only residual conservation persists is            reached much faster I think that this difference is            probably artifactual and due to anomalous measurement            of the phylogenetic distances between organisms            Brinkmann and Philippe   argued that SSU rRNAs of            bacteria evolve faster than those of archaea thus            resulting in an underestimation of the phylogenetic            distances between archaea The distances between            archaea are thus probably higher than shown in Figure            aand consequently gene order conservation would fit            well into the overall trend found for the Bacteria            although the lack of points on the lefthand side of            the graph makes it difficult to extract a conclusion            Moreover measures of phylogenetic distances between            bacteria and archaea should also be higher which would            shift the BacteriaArchaea points to the right in the            plot thus eliminating the surprising artificial            overlap between BacteriaArchaea and BacteriaBacteria            points            This is a good example of the difficulties            encountered when using molecular phylogenies Phenomena            such as unequal mutation rates and lateral gene            transfer or artifacts such as longbranch attraction            may produce biased results   Here I show that            these problems seem surmountable with the aid of            genomic methods The unequal mutation rate in SSU rRNA            detectable only by careful comparison of different            molecular phylogenies can be readily discovered by            looking at gene order conservation Hence gene order            conservation could be used as an alternative measure of            distances between organisms especially when such            distances are small            Conservation of gene order between bacteria and            archaea is much lower than within each domain and is            even nonexistent in some cases There is one exception            gene order conservation between the hyperthermophilic            bacterium             Thermotoga maritima and archaea            is higher than the rest and much higher than between             Aquifex and archaea even though            the SSU rRNA distances between bacteria and archaea are            approximately equal The existence of extensive lateral            gene transfer between             Thermotoga maritima and archaea            has been claimed   This possibility is of great            importance as it suggests lateral gene transfer can            occur between different domains             Thermotoga thus provides a nice            example of conservation of gene order produced via            lateral gene transfer                                Molecular phylogenies of universally conserved            genes for better estimating distances            A different set of phylogenetic distances can be            extracted by averaging those obtained from the            molecular phylogenies of universally conserved genes            see Materials and methods The results are shown in            Figure  Distances between organisms seem to be more            accurately estimated using this set of genes and thus            gene order conservation within the Archaea follows more            closely the trend observed in the Bacteria As the            agreement between the two distributions is still not            complete however I conjecture that the estimates of            distances are still not entirely correct It is likely            that there are no differences between the amount of            gene order conservation among the Bacteria and among            the Archaea and therefore the trend of conservation of            gene order could be approximately the same for both            domains                                Common gene content and gene order            conservation            Realizing the difficulty of estimating the            relationships between organisms using molecular            phylogenies some authors have proposed a genomic            method based on the common gene content of the genomes               This method of estimating distances is claimed            to be more accurate as it is not affected by the            drawbacks of molecular phylogenies I used common gene            content as an additional estimation of distance between            genomes and compared the resulting distances with gene            order conservation The results are shown in Figure                        When using common gene content as a measure of            phylogenetic distance gene order conservation in the            Archaea follows a similar trend to that in the Bacteria            Figure a Even if common gene content has some            biases as I will illustrate below such biases are            expected to be the same for the Bacteria as for the            Archaea This reinforces the hypothesis that both            domains have a similar trend in the conservation of            gene order            In a more general sense common gene content seems            to be a noisy measure as it is affected by factors            such as the different lifestyles of the organisms For            example             Xylella fastidiosa is a            proteobacterium and one of its closest relatives in            this study is             Pseudomonas            aeruginosa Nevertheless their common gene content            is low less than  Between             E coli and             Haemophilus influenzae with a            comparable phylogenetic distance common gene content            is around  The fact is that             X fastidiosa has a very high            number of open reading frames ORFs with no known            relatives in other species unique genes The number            of unique genes is as high as  for             X fastidiosa   and it is            also very high for some other species   As a            result distances between             X fastidiosa and other bacteria            are overestimated by using common gene content This is            often the case for closely related bacteria with            different lifestyles such as             E coli and             Vibrio cholerae which share less            than half of their genes because their different            environments require different adaptations and            different systems Common gene content thus has            disadvantages as a measure for estimating phylogenetic            distances In contrast gene order conservation defines            much more precisely the course of evolution of genomes            as it is not affected by the presence of particular            sets of genes in individual genomes                                    Regions of conservation and nonconservation of          gene order in the genome          The second object of this study was to determine how          the conservation of gene order is distributed along the          genome Are the conserved regions uniformly spread or          are there instead welldefined regions of high and low          conservation The latter answer seems to be the right          one Figure shows conservation of gene order using the          genomes of           E coli and           X fastidiosa as references The          rest of the genomes are sorted according to their          phylogenetic distance estimated by SSU rRNA          substitutions to the reference genomes The gradual loss          of gene order is easily seen and it is apparent that          regions of high gene order conservation coexist with          regions in which no conservation can be found          Regions with no trace of gene order conservation are          not rare even between closely related organisms They          represent either regions in which active rearrangement          processes occur or regions with a majority of unique          genes The first case is illustrated in Figure afor           E coli in which the terminus of          replication which is a recombination hotspot has no          gene order conservation because of the extensive          rearrangement in this region An example of the second          case is shown in Figure bfor the genome of           X fastidiosa in which regions          where unique genes are prevalent are easily detected          because of their lack of gene order conservation          At the other extreme regions of high gene order          conservation exist in all the genomes Figure shows that          there is a remnant of gene order conservation even          between distantly related organisms in both the Bacteria          and the Archaea These regions of special conservation          can be thought of as being subject to selective processes          for keeping genes together I analyzed the functional          composition of these regions          To find out whether the conserved regions are related          to any functional characteristics the proteins encoded          by the genes in these regions were functionally          classified using the EUCLID system   I also explored          the correspondence of the runs of genes with          experimentally determined operons as found in the          RegulonDB database   The most conserved runs are          shown in Table  No apparent preferences for particular          functional classes were found apart from the translation          class overrepresented because of ribosomal proteins          The runs are composed of genes for proteins involved in          many different types of processes from metabolicrelated          classes to informationrelated ones With some          exceptions every run is preferentially composed of ORFs          belonging to the same functional class The selective          forces acting to keep these genes together could indeed          be different when the run is composed of different          functional classes For instance the conservation of          gene order in metabolicrelated runs is often related to          their coding for enzymes that act sequentially in a          pathway forming multifunctional complexes in several          cases For the runs related to cellular processes and          information management the selective scenario might be          more complex            The conserved runs of genes usually correspond to          operons in           E coli and combinations of two or          even three operons are common If we consider the          proposal that operons are unstable structures   the          maintenance of gene order within the operons would be          striking in itself but the conservation of combinations          of operons points to additional factors other than          common regulation acting in the conservation of gene          order Lateral gene transfer could play a part in such a          process   even if it is not easy to envisage how it          could explain such extensive conservation It is too          early to say whether the assumption that operons are          independent units   is challenged Additional          research on these conserved structures is needed in order          to elucidate the factors acting in each case                            Conclusions        Gene order is a labile genomic characteristic The level        of conservation is high when organisms are phylogenetically        closely related but conservation is lost rapidly probably        to a higher degree than other genetic or genomic features          Thus the instances in which gene order is conserved        between phylogenetically distant organisms may indicate        that strong selection pressures are keeping them together        in the cases in which lateral gene transfer is unlikely to        be the origin of the conservation Selection could be        because the operon controls the assembly of a        multifunctional enzymatic complex or the performance of an        important stage in a metabolic pathway But in some cases        other explanations should be considered in which the gene        order could influence the phenotype The existence of        conserved units bigger than operons seems to argue in favor        of other explanations           Gene order conservation can be valuable for establishing        the relationships between organisms as it is not influenced        by parameters that affect other genomic measures such as        the content of unique genes that are ultimately dependent        on the lifestyle of the species Genomic properties have        been proposed as alternatives to classical molecular        phylogenies as they measure global features of the genomes        So far no genomic property by itself can represent that        alternative and integration of information on different        properties is desirable In this perspective the        information offered by gene order conservation is        crucial                    Materials and methods        Sequences positions and orientations of genes and        corresponding proteins in complete prokaryotic genomes        Table  were obtained from NCBI   Where the genome        is composed of several chromosomes andor plasmids the        sequences were linearized and concatenated        Homologs and orthologs between genomes were detected by        BLAST   similarity searches For two ORFs to be        considered as homologous their alignment should include at        least  of the length of both ORFs and the expected        value Evalue must be less than   I will refer to        this homology relationship as bidirectional hits BHs        ORFs related in this way are not necessarily orthologous        however as paralogous genes may exist and are also        identified Therefore one gene can have more than one BH        which may introduce a bias in the count of related genes        and conserved blocks of genes between two genomes For        identifying real orthologs I look for best bidirectional        hits BBHs such that one ORF is the closest relative of        the other and vice versa All the results shown in this        article were obtained using BBHs but the use of BHs does        not alter the tendencies as only minor quantitative        differences were found        The position of each gene in the genome is converted        into a linear scale from one to the total number of genes        in the genome and the information on either BHs or BBHs        between two genomes is used to extract runs  clusters of        genes in which order is conserved A run cannot comprise        genes from different strands hence a change of coding        strand implies the termination of the run I introduce two        parameters setting the minimum length of the run and the        maximum length of gaps inserted genes within it For the        purposes of this article these parameters were set to a        minimum length of three genes allowing gaps of three genes        as well As gene duplications may exist duplicated runs        are also possible Duplicated runs are taken into account        if and only if they are present in both genomes        Otherwise the duplication is discarded By definition        duplicated runs do not exist when working with BBHs        The measure of gene order conservation between two        genomes used here is the ratio between the number of genes        located in conserved runs and the total number of related        genes BHs or BBHs        Molecular phylogenetic methods have been widely used to        determine the degree of relationship between organisms The        genes of choice are those universally conserved especially        SSU rRNA The classical molecular phylogeny of SSU rRNA was        obtained from the RDP database   and was used to        estimate distances between the organisms on the basis of        the number of substitutions between the sequences The        distances were computed using different correction methods        JukesCantor JinNei and Kimura twoparameter methods        by means of the program distances of the GCG package          The differences using different correction methods        were found to be very small less than  and did not        influence this study        Averaging molecular phylogenies of different universally        conserved genes has been proposed as a way of alleviating        the problems of individual phylogenies by compensating for        the different tendencies found in single genes           By a systematic search  genes conserved in all the        genomes used in this study were found Molecular        phylogenies of these collections of genes were constructed        using neighborjoining and maximum likelihood methods        extracting  sets of distances A unique set of distances        was obtained by averaging the  sets and used as an        additional measure of divergence between species        Common gene content between two organisms is proposed as        a genomic estimation of distances between them Common gene        content is defined as the ratio between the number of        orthologous genes found between the two species and the        maximum number of possible orthologs the number of genes        in the smaller genome        Therefore three different estimations of distances        between organisms were used in this study distances based        on SSU rRNA phylogeny averaged distances of molecular        phylogenies of universally conserved genes and common gene        content between the species
