 Background Recent U S national surveys 1 show that in 1999 18 9 of Americans were frankly obese a marked increase from 17 8 in 1998 underscoring the fact that over the last few decades an emerging epidemic of obesity has become a major cause of preventable death 2 and disease 3 Recognizing the effects of obesity on the nation s health governments and industry have vigorously pursued the genetic metabolic and environmental roots of obesity 4 5 6 7 Despite the effort it remains true that little is known about prevention of obesity and its treatment remains no less difficult or failure prone than it ever was 8 9 10 Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD is also a common disorder even if its prevalence is not precisely known In children the rate of occurrence has customarily been given as 3 to 5 but recent studies show the condition is present in 15 or more of school age populations 11 12 Persistence of ADHD into adulthood has been shown to occur in 30 to 50 or more of childhood cases 13 depending on the criteria used 14 It is clear that adults with a history of ADHD in childhood have greater difficulty functioning compared to their non ADHD peers 15 One example is the higher rate of substance use disorders in ADHD adults compared to the general population 16 such use often viewed as a kind of self medication of unpleasant emotions 16 In obesity similar patterns of eating seeking immediate gratification using food to reduce dysphoria have been observed 17 though not previously linked to ADHD It is established that obesity has serious medical sequelae and that both obesity and ADHD have psychiatric comorbidities 18 19 20 21 22 23 but surprisingly searches found no existing literature describing comorbid obesity and ADHD OB ADHD However one study 24 reported a potentially relevant correlation between symptoms of conduct disorder but not depression during adolescence and obesity in early adulthood attributed to common mechanisms underlying impulsive aggression and dysregulation of body weight The role of impulsivity in this correlation is important given that impulsive behavior is common in adolescents with ADHD pointing to a connection between ADHD and development of obesity an idea consistent with our clinical observation that impulsive eating behaviors are common in adult and adolescent OB ADHD patients With persistent effort some bariatric patients have been able to achieve and maintain a reduced level of body fat In the bariatric clinic at Behavioral Medicine Center for Treatment and Research BMedCTR in Portland Oregon among the patients who failed a subset was observed to have unusual difficulty adhering to diet and exercise plans and as a result lost less fat mass than typically occurs Diagnostic evaluation showed a substantial fraction of these patients had Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ADHD a condition that was recognized in our clinical work as a risk factor for poor treatment outcome Fortunately ADHD patients often responded to pharmacological and behavior therapies with results that included improved task persistence decreased impulsivity and distractability and for some greater success with weight control efforts Cumulative bariatric clinic experience showed OB ADHD was commonly encountered and a potent contributor to obesity treatment failure In this context it became clear that more information about OB ADHD was needed and that wider exposure of this comorbidity would be valuable and interesting to clinicians treating obese patients Consequently this report was constructed to begin exploring the basic characteristics of this heretofore unrecognized population Methods The primary working hypothesis was that the prevalence of ADHD among obese patients was higher than in the general adult population In addition it was anticipated that ADHD patients would have less weight loss fewer visits and shorter duration of treatment than their non ADHD peers Differences between groups were not expected to be widely divergent The method used to conduct a systematic examination of clinical data was a retrospective review of medical records of patients who had been treated for obesity at BMedCTR during the period Jan 1 2000 through Dec 31 2000 and enrolled in treatment by Nov 30 2000 The clinic s scheduling database referenced 215 unique individuals who were active patients during the study period Data relevant to demographic and clinical status was collected from medical records including age sex body mass index BMI at first and last visits interval between first and last visits number of visits and diagnosis of ADHD entered in the record during the course of obesity treatment This diagnosis was not determined retrospectively although the diagnosis was confirmed to be supported by the written record of behavioral observations The 215 records were were divided into 3 groups patients without ADHD NAD those with ADHD symptoms or behaviors but not meeting diagnostic criteria for ADHD ADSx and patients with ADHD AD Diagnosis of ADHD was made by the author during the course of patients obesity treatment using semi structured interviews over one or more visits Structure was in accord with DSM IV criteria that is a patient needed to have shown or given substantial history of 6 or more inattentive behaviors to be considered as having ADHD Patients who had fewer than 6 but at least 3 inattentive symptoms were classified as having symptoms of ADHD but not diagnosed as having the disorder None of the patients had as many as 6 hyperactive impulsive symptoms Patients inattentive and hyperactive impulsive behaviors were not separately tabulated during records review At the time diagnoses had been made a behavior was not considered a symptom of ADHD if occurring only in association with obesity treatment for example trouble adhering to diet or exercise plans A significant level of impairment associated with symptoms was required for ADHD to be diagnosed While many of the patients had current or past treatment for depression or anxiety these conditions were required to be in remission or insufficiently prominent to obscure or account for ADHD behavior or impairment for the diagnosis of ADHD to be made The interview method is termed semi structured because in a clinical setting the approach to each patient was necessarily individualized at least to some degree Within this constraint information was gathered in a reasonably consistent manner in that the same pieces of information were sought from each patient the same questions asked of each even if the order of inquiry varied that is to say the path through the decision tree reflected patients differences During the period of treatment and diagnosis a single exception to DSM IV ADHD diagnostic criteria was made regarding age of onset nominally 7 years for several reasons Pragmatically adult patients were often uncertain about the precise age symptoms began though often able to identify a time in early childhood when symptoms were already occurring e g in the 2nd or 3rd grade making it impossible to be certain if symptoms were present before age 7 For middle aged adults third party confirmation of early events was seldom available leaving the patient s recall as the only data source Recent studies have shown that patient memory was consistent enough with other information to be useful for diagnostic purposes 25 Patients reports were likely to be accurate but there were often gaps in memory of early experience not inconsistent with ADHD in general favoring an inference that they didn t remember their behavior rather than not having had the behavior It was concluded that the risk of misdiagnosis by modifying the age of onset criterion was much lower than the risks of not diagnosing a condition for which treatment can make a great difference in life quality In other words for this population the risks of underdiagnosing ADHD were judged to be far more consequential than risks of overdiagnosing the disorder Accordingly during treatment diagnosis of ADHD was made when all other DSM IV criteria were met and symptoms were clearly evident by 12 years of age A similar point was made by Wender 26 who argued that availability of low risk treatments for debilitating conditions warrants clinicians using less specific criteria to avoid excluding patients who may benefit A different argument was made by Barkley and Biederman 27 that requiring symptoms to have been present by a single specific point in early childhood in order to diagnose ADHD is not rational that is ADHD is better conceptualized as a disorder arising in childhood generally None of the ADHD group had a level of hyperactivity impulsivity meeting DSM IV criteria therefore all were classifiable as having Inattentive Type of ADHD Data were tested using Unix based tools including xmstat and xlispstat Significance was set at 0 05 Analysis of variance was applied to means of age starting BMI difference between starting and ending BMI number of visits and length of treatment Chi square test was used to determine significance of differences among patient groups and BMI categories NIH classification 3 of BMI was used defining Obesity III Extreme Obesity as BMI 40 Obesity classes I and II Obesity as BMI 30 to 39 9 and Overweight as BMI 25 to 29 9

characterized by a variable level of obesity divided into one of three obesity classes overweight Ov moderate to severe obesity I II and extreme obesity III and a range of symptoms AD ADSx or NAD These classifications were organized into a 3 3 array which was suitable for determining prevalence of ADHD in whole sample and looking at the differences in ADHD prevalence among the classes of obesity The whole sample of 215 obese patients partitioned by ADHD group contains 59 or 27 4 95 CI 21 1 to 32 9 with AD 72 or 33 5 CI 27 2 to 39 8 were ADSx and 84 or 39 1 CI 32 6 to 45 6 were NAD Chi

calculated as Starting BMI Ending BMI NAD achieved nearly twice the BMI loss as AD and ADSx at means of 4 0 2 6 and 2 3 respectively F 6 25 df 2 212 p 0 002 NAD was distinct from AD and ADSx Fisher

toward a difference p 0 054 CI 0 050 to 0 058 12000 randomizations Discussion The most important results are the prevalence of ADHD of 27 4 in the sample and the surprisingly strong association between ADHD and Obesity III Nearly half 42 6 of patients with Obesity III had ADHD that is the OB ADHD population was concentrated in the obesity class having the highest mortality and morbidity risks and greatest need for effective treatment Moreover at all levels of obesity patients with ADHD symptoms were less successful at losing weight than non ADHD peers Compared to NAD AD had a significantly higher starting BMI 39 6 vs 34 2 yet lost less weight 2 6 vs 4 0 kg m 2 Greater contrast is found in Obesity III with NAD in that class achieving more than twice the weight loss of AD 7 0 vs 2 9 kg m 2 while mean weight loss for ADSx did not differ significantly from AD 2 3 vs 2 6 kg m 2 implying that the presence of even subthreshhold ADHD symptoms reduces the effectiveness of obesity treatment In other words in OB ADHD treatment outcome has stronger association with symptoms of ADHD than level of obesity Effect size of ADHD for the whole sample was only about 0 2 but in Obesity III patients effect size was about 0 5 comparable for example to the moderate effect size of SSRI drugs on panic symptoms 28 Impersistence was not the cause of worse results for AD who attended more visits than NAD 56 0 vs 39 4 mean total visits over a longer span of time ADSx was no more successful than AD but had fewer visits comparable to NAD in this respect ADSx showing characteristics intermediate between AD and NAD The result is AD ADSx and NAD having similar rates of clinic visits AD had 1 5 visits month ADSx 1 2 and NAD 1 4 while NAD had the highest rate of BMI decrease NAD lost 0 14 BMI month ADSx 0 075 and AD 0 067 However these statistics have limited utility given the large variance in number of visits and months of treatment The slow aspect of task performance in ADHD has been previously reported 29 and could be described as a kind of inefficiency that is taking more time to accomplish less The reasons for a strong association between ADHD and obesity particularly extreme obesity are unknown but there are a number of reported findings that appear to be relevant and certainly interesting For one evidence exists that variations of dopamine receptor DR genes affect both conditions In obesity DRD2 and DRD4 30 31 genes and in ADHD the DRD4 32 33 gene have been implicated in the transmission of or predisposition to the disorders raising the possibility that similar overlapping or shared DR functioning or dysfunction in these disorders is related to their co co occurrence DRD2 and a range of dopamine and other genes have been associated with a reward deficiency syndrome 34 in which insufficient dopamine mediated natural reward leads to use of unnatural rewards such as substances gambling risk taking and inappropriate eating This syndrome is associated with obesity 34 and common in ADHD 22 The DRD4 gene has been associated with novelty seeking traits said to be greater in substance abusers 30 and individuals with both DRD2 and DRD4 genetic variations may be especially prone to multiple difficulties e g having both ADHD and reward deficiency syndrome 30 further suggesting obesity and ADHD could share neurobiological attributes A recent study showed the availability of striatal DRD2 receptors was decreased as a function of increasing BMI 35 supporting the idea that reward seeking behavior plays a role in the onset or continuation of obesity In other studies administration of D2 agonists resulted in decreases in hyperinsulinemia associated with obesity 36 and it is known that the brain is richly supplied with insulin receptors including the cortex and striatal areas 37 suggesting an intriguing link between insulin resistance characteristic of obesity and dopamine mediated psychiatric symptoms including ADHD No doubt this hypothesis and many far more refined hypotheses will be studied in coming years and will elucidate the complex neurophysiological connections hinted at by the above The 27 4 prevalence of ADHD in obese patients is considerably higher than found in the general adult population reported as 4 7 by Murphy and Barkley 38 Across studies of other specific populations prevalence of ADHD or ADHD symptoms was also greater than in general for example cocaine abusers 12 39 anxiety disorders 16 40 panic disorder 22 41 and substance abusers 25 42 Considering the differing methods and populations the reported prevalences are difficult to compare yet are fairly consistent with one another for the most part The prevalence of OB ADHD in this report is plausibly within the range of these studies The uniformity of the Inattentive subtype of ADHD in this adult population was not unusual or unexpected considering the well known attenuation of hyperactive and impulsive symptoms observed as children with ADHD grow into adolescence and adulthood compared to the much stronger retention of inattentive symptoms 14 This is not to say that ADHD adults don t behave impulsively simply that with maturation continuing hyperactive impulsive H I behaviors are usually expressed in less obvious ways than among their school age counterparts That is while ADHD adults frequently have impairing H I symptoms the number and types of these behaviors seldom meet DSM IV diagnostic criteria for the H I or Combined subtype of ADHD DSM IV ADHD subtyping strictly applied is likely to have limited correlation to neurobiological processes assuming processes reflect impulsivity or disinhibition since the level of symptomatic behavior required for diagnosing DSM IV H I or Combined subtypes is higher than nearly all ADHD adults will display even if substantial H I behavior is evident Another factor is that girls compared to boys have lower rates of H I symptoms which is associated with lower likelihood of being diagnosed in childhood but if diagnosed girls more frequently have the Inattentive subtype 12 It would be expected that this difference would persist into adulthood augmenting the likelihood that Inattentive symptoms would predominate the clinical presentation In a sample in which most patients are female and middle aged predominance of the Inattentive subtype is predictable Inevitably there are numerous caveats and limitations that apply to this preliminary work For one results reflect the origin of data in clinical practice hardly ideal from a research perspective Treatment settings may favor a higher case finding rate because of the opportunity to observe and assess behavior is greater than the methods of prospective research designs For example ADHD research instruments have a sensitivity of 70 90 43 44 and would likely identify fewer cases of ADHD than the gold standard of careful clinical assessment expected to find most cases For this report diagnosis had been made primarily by one interviewer which could favor consistency but also leads to potential biases that skew results In addition the modification of age of onset criterion for ADHD may increase difficulty of comparing present results to those of studies using the unmodified criterion Clearly for the purpose of comparing prevalence among diverse populations a prospective design is strongly advantageous but likely not congruent with the goals of clinical practice Bias could also be introduced by patient factors such as comorbid conditions producing symptoms which might not be easily separable from those found in ADHD and erroneously diagnosed as ADHD Several disorders common in obese patients fit into this category e g obstructive sleep apnea depression and anxiety disorders While the differential characteristics of these conditions e g relative duration pervasiveness and continuity of symptoms can help distinguish one from another the nature and interactions of these comorbidities are not particularly well delineated While careful clinical practice requires effort to avoid diagnosing ADHD if symptoms are not sufficiently distinct from those of confounding disorders reducing error requires further research into the effects of comorbidities intercurrent with ADHD Another form of bias originates in patients predisposition to endorse symptoms because of dysphoria negative affectivity or readiness to attribute distress to some preferred rather than actual source when queried by the interviewer For the OB ADHD population the idea is that some patients may have had a preference for endorsing ADHD symptoms instead of accepting more accurate explanations for distress or lack of obesity treatment progress e g failure to lose weight while being unwilling to exercise I can t lose weight because I just get so distracted Some forms of endorsement bias are readily seen in medical practice for example patients who would rather talk about somatic events than discuss their anxieties or depressed mood Implications for the OB ADHD population are hard to assess since this form of bias and its effects on research of ADHD prevalence have not received comparable study nor are there reports of the frequency of encountering this bias in clinical work with adult ADHD patients Moreover no special measures were taken to reduce or account for such biases during the course of diagnosing patients in the present sample rendering it quite difficult to estimate how much and what kind of effect biases have had on the above reported prevalences of OB ADHD At this point it remains an open question suggesting additional reasons for cautious interpretation of the results given in this report The demographic characteristics of the sample population are worth a few comments Notably about 90 of the patients were women which obviously does not reflect the general population but may not be surprising in this context because more women than men are concerned about weight gain and are more likely to seek medical care than male contemporaries The patients as a group were also distinctly middle aged no doubt reflecting the fact that older individuals are more likely to be able to afford non insured medical care obesity treatment isn t covered under most policies and the time to devote to their own needs Some effects of demographic factors on diagnosis of ADHD were discussed above Gender and age differences e g younger patients or higher male to female ratio could conceivably affect the range and intesity of ADHD symptoms that are observed prevalence findings and individual as well as aggregate response to obesity treatment In addition generalizability of conclusions based on the data in this report are limited by a modest sample size and uncertainty that the bariatric patients in the sample were truly representative of the general obese population Results could be misleading for example if the sample had a disproportion of individuals with serious medical or psychiatric problems higher weight or greater social skill deficits even if the sample is construed to be typical of those seen in similar practices Conclusion This report is explicitly exploratory and its findings need to be replicated in larger and more systematic studies Nonetheless these findings are already quite interesting and could have implications for the understanding of the etiology of obesity as well as the treatment of obesity The nature of the connections to the extent that they exist between attention and obesity is of course not at all clear but the results may point to forms of attentional components and impulsivity playing a role in the onset or continuation of obesity or that attentional mechanisms are linked in some way to metabolic and energy storage regulation Implications for clinical practice may be of more immediate consequence Treatment of obesity has been marginally effective at best particularly for extreme obesity If an attentional disorder is present conceivably its treatment could improve obesity treatment outcome which makes awareness of the ADHD obesity comorbidity pragmatically important It has been shown that reduction of body weight as small as 5 substantially reduces the morbidity and mortality risks of obesity so even if recognizing and treating ADHD is only a modest contributor to reducing body fat mass it is worthwhile on that grounds alone Moreover the impairment of ADHD is an intrinsic reason to diagnose and treat the condition because even if comorbid obesity were not changed normalizing brain function in ADHD sufferers more often than not provides substantial benefit and improved quality of life The apparent association of OB ADHD relatively poor obesity treatment outcome and high prevalence of OB ADHD 27 4 especially in the extremely obese 42 6 argue that comorbid ADHD increases the health risks of obesity and that extreme obesity itself a stressful condition adds burden to the profound impairments common in ADHD The chance that more knowledge could lead to reduction of suffering disability and economic cost offers compelling reasons for further investigation of this subject Inclusion of more diverse and non clinical populations of obese and extremely obese individuals and using research designs that better account for rater and subject biases inter rater reliability and diagnostic methodology will likely give more definitive answers to this report s questions and implications Competing interests None
