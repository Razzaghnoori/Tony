 Pat s Last Stand Issue 1 is the presidential debates both Democratic and Republican Issue 2 is Pat Buchanan s jump to the Reform Party Many pundits think Bradley won the Democratic debate in New Hampshire Gore once too stiff is now trying too hard to loosen up Gore is the Eddie Haskell energizer bunny while Bradley has the insouciance of Dean Martin and the iciness of John Malkovich says Margaret Carlson CNN s Capital Gang Kate O Beirne Capital Gang thinks Bradley s ideological similarity to Gore helps him because the voters will focus on personal style rather than policy Fox News Sunday s Juan Williams and Brit Hume think Gore s attempts to distance himself from President Clinton s behavior are hypocritical given his loyalty as vice president especially during the impeachment Wayne Slater of NBC s Meet the Press reveals that the Bush camp is privately more worried about facing Bradley than Gore in a general election But on ABC s This Week Gore appears relaxed and amiable And on Meet the Press Bradley supporter Bob Kerry admits that he doesn t know if Bradley s health care numbers add up and says that neither candidate has been intellectually honest about Social Security and Medicare reform Some pundits such as Tony Blankley and Lawrence O Donnell PBS s McLaughlin Group think Bush was smart to stay out of the GOP debate But many some of them conservative like Bill Kristol This Week and Bob Novak Capital Gang think Bush hurt himself by not engaging his rivals and may lose the New Hampshire primary Bush s absence helped McCain especially say Al Hunt Capital Gang and Eleanor Clift McLaughlin since he is the only other GOP candidate whom voters can imagine being president Meanwhile on Meet the Press Wayne Slater says the Bush camp has ruled out McCain and Dole as running mates Most pundits think Buchanan has a good shot at the Reform Party nomination but not the presidency Some such as Fox s Brit Hume McLaughlin s Michael Barone and McLaughlin s Lawrence O Donnell think he has been too damaged by his recently published views on World War II and Israeli political influence to make much of an impact Barone notes that even absent these views Buchanan s core message goes counter to the country s entire post WW II consensus on trade and foreign policy California would have to fall into the Pacific Ocean for Pat to become president he says Appearing on Meet the Press Buchanan says he will not backtrack from his pro life views and says that this will be his last campaign if he loses Buchanan was scheduled to appear on CNN s Late Edition but the entire show is given over to news coverage of yesterday s plane crash The Kmart Myth The Fox panel has fun with Time s report that the Gore campaign had been paying feminist celebrity Naomi Wolf 15 000 a month laundered through a faceless consultant agency to advise the candidate on his wardrobe and on his Oedipal relationship with Clinton among other things When you get somebody who has been some exotic consultant for the feminist psychobabble movement who s trying to teach Gore about alpha male and beta male stuff you have to wonder if Al Gore has any idea who he is proclaims Brit Hume Asked about Wolf on This Week Gore appears nervous but replies that Wolf s pay has been cut and that she has been working with his daughter Karenna on youth outreach Dept of Self Caricature McCain sounded just like a Democrat to me He started talking about homeless people and poor people and all that I don t need a Republican to tell me about that Bob Novak on Capital Gang Last Word I will say this into the camera Jewish Americans are in my campaign They are welcome to this cause They are in the Reform Party I am open to appointment of Jewish Americans to a Cabinet to a vice presidential seat They are a tremendously able group of Americans Tim let me just say this In this heart there is no malice or hatred of any individual But you are looking at someone who does enjoy fighting And if that means fighting occasionally with the Israeli lobby as liberals like to fight occasionally with the Christian Coalition that does not make you an evil person Pat Buchanan on Meet the Press
