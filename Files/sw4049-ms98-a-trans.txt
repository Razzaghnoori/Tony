              well uh i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in in specific uh very specific in this uh very specific examples such as uh transportation workers as in uh air traffic controllers bus drivers and that kind of thing   uhhuh   um i dont really  think that its uh too many i think its a severe invasion of somebodys privacy to say well were going to look at your urine and then decide whether youre uh you know worthy of working for us i really dont see that thats a very very valid uh thing for a company to say and i personally i dont think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of whats inside my body   yeah uh i guess i basically agree that uh do you think its okay for a company to reject somebody just knowing that they have take drugs i mean suppose they found out some other way   well i think i think what you i think the problem here is is that a a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs   yeah so   theres too many cases where it can you know there can be false positive results and that that sort of thing i dont think theres any definitive you know okay this person is taking drugs so we dont want him here   yeah   uh like i said some industries though i think itd be very necessary i wouldnt want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when im flying in an airplane   yeah   but uh i mean i just i find it to be pretty offensive that that its such a a big deal i mean if your employers not going to trust you or you know it i just i think its a whole trust issue i just cant see it   have you ever been in a situation where you you were drug tested or   uh yeah i have been   yeah i have once too so   i i mean i was very offended by by the whole process i mean its uh very humiliating and i mean im not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs but i uh i am totally against that sort of a uh   yeah   i mean its its a pretty personal thing when somebody says i want to look at your urine before im going to talk to you   yeah i had it during a job interview and i just thought it was dumb of the company at a point where they were trying to convince me to to want to work for them   right   to do this and im just like well uh im not even going to think much about it   yeah   if youre gonna treat me with this much respect even before   right   youve gotten to know me   right that thats basically my opinion on it right there is that its just you know i did i it was in the same sort of situation as it was a job interview and then you had a physical where you were drug tested and its i just i mean i know people who have been drug tested and who have not you know been hired by a corporation which uh you know i really The other side of it is is besides its being an invasion of personal privacy as in my its my bodily fluid and i dont really want you to look at it or or something pretty basic like that just to the fact that   uhhuh   i dont know that it is a companys business to regulate what its employees are doing when theyre not at work i mean the during the eight hours during the day when theyre supposed to be there i think they have every right to say this is these behaviors are acceptable and these are not but when it enters into what theyre doing when theyre not at work i find that to be fairly offensive also   yeah well like you say i mean if its not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt then really what people ought to be doing i mean the the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work rather than on these other factors   right right   and i mean if you are doing drugs and its causing a problem then theyll notice it for other reasons   thats exactly right   yeah   and also i just think it it gets a lot im a big uh supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies and i think that it just moves down along a line that that i really would find bad if if most people went down that line into regulating employees lives outside of work when you know theres already talk of people well were not going to hire you if you smoke       well you know i i can see how they can say in the work place we you dont want them to smoke but when somebody leaves work i dont think that its the employers right to regulate their lifestyle at all   well do you think its should be illegal for an employer to do this or   uh i really think it should be except as ive mentioned twice now in the specified industries or or jobs because there are certain things where its just vital that a person is clear minded at all times   yeah   and other than that i think i do not think it should be allowable i think it should be illegal for them to to want to do that   hum   it should its kind of the big brother syndrome  i mean i just anything like that just kind of scares me     i tend to to view it even though i dont think id work for a company that did that i sort of want to defend an employers rights as opposed to an individuals uh in addition to an individuals rights but an employer really i think has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to   right   and if they say they dont want smokers i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that   right   uh and  i dont really
