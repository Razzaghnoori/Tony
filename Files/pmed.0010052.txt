                    Arthur Caplans Viewpoint Nobody Is PerfectBut Why Not Try to Be Better        Perfection has come in for a lot of bad press recently A torrent of books and articles        has recently appeared  all raising serious ethical questions about the        wisdom and morality of trying to use biomedical knowledge to perfect ourselves or our        offspring        Biomedical scientists and physicians might be inclined to ignore this literature as just        so much abstract philosophical handwringing After all it is almost impossible to find        mainstream scientists arrogant enough to proclaim their interest in perfecting anything        much less themselves or their fellow human beings        Beating up on the pursuit of perfection is silly As Salvadore Dali famously pointed        out Have no fear of perfectionyoull never reach it Critics of those who allegedly        seek to perfect human beings know this While often couching their critiques in language        that assails the pursuit of perfection what they really are attacking is the far more        oftexpressedalbeit far less loftydesire to improve or enhance a particular behavior or        trait by the application of emerging biomedical knowledge in genetics neuroscience        pharmacology and physiology Those who might accurately be termed antimeliorists wonder        how we will ever resist the obvious temptation to put this knowledge to use to alter        ourselves They are quick to note that we have already given in to such temptationwe        augment our breasts smooth our wrinkles and pump ourselves full of antidepressants        Putting the brakes on biologically driven human betterment would have real consequences        for science Some lines of research would be slowed or restricted  Their        application would be declared offlimits or at least tightly regulated                Why is the drive to improve ourselves so disturbing to the antimeliorists Their        arguments cluster around three key worries that the pursuit of perfection by biomedical        means is vain selfish and unrewarding  that improving ourselves is unfair         and that enhancement or improvement violates human nature  and may        actually destroy it  It is the last of these arguments that is at the core of        antimeliorist concerns        It cannot simply be the pursuit of improvement that is making antimeliorists nervous        Many religious traditions and spiritual movements seek perfection  but these        evoke no negative commentary from the antimeliorists Nor do efforts to improve animals        and plants set this crowd aflutter Rather it is biomedical knowledge being applied to you        and me that is the crux of their concern They fear that in applying new biomedical        knowledge to improve human beings something essential about humanity will be lost If        biomedical tinkering is allowed we will destroy the very thing that makes us humanour        nature        Antimeliorism rests however on a very shaky foundation To support their position        the antimeliorists must state what human nature is They do not They must also be very        clear about why they see human nature as static They are not And they must advance an        argument about why human nature which has presumably evolved in response to an enormous        array of random forces tells us anything about what is good or desirable in terms of the        traits humans should possess They cannot        The fight over whether there is any such thing as human nature is a longstanding one         But one can concede that we are shaped by a causally powerful set of genetic        influences and still remain skeptical as to whether these produce a single nature that        all members of humanity possess Is there a single trait or fixed set of traits that        defines the nature of who we are and have been throughout our entire existence on this        planet Unless they can articulate this Platonic essence antimeliorists do not have a        foundation for their argument that change improvement and betterment are grave threats to        humanity        Worse still for antimeliorists we are clearly creatures who have long tinkered with        ourselves using all manner of technologies from clothing to telescopes to computers to        airplanes Our view of our nature is closely linked to the technologies that we have        invented and to which we have adapted  We are already technological creatures        Nor is there any normative guidance offered by our evolutionary history that shows why        we should not try to improve upon the biological design with which we are endowed        Augmenting breasts or prolonging erections may be vain and even a waste of scarce        resources but seeking to use our knowledge to enhance our vision memory learning skills        immunity or metabolism is not obviously either        Ultimately antimeliorism posits a static vision of human nature to which the        antimeliorists mandate we reconcile ourselves If anything is clear about human nature it        is that this is not an accurate view of who we have been or what we are now or a view that        should determine what we become                    Carl Elliotts Viewpoint Pharmas Gain May Be Our Loss        Those of us who worry about medical enhancement are usually less worried about the        technologies themselves than about the larger social effects of embracing them too        enthusiastically Just as you do not need to object to cars to worry about urban sprawl        you do not need to object to enhancement technologies to question where these technologies        may be taking us It is not just technophobes who wonder whether a society that consumes         of the worlds supply of methylphenidate Ritalin where the most profitable class of        drugs is antidepressants and where cosmetic surgeons perform liposuction on primetime        television is a society that has somehow lost its way        Lets look at three of the most commercially successful medical enhancements of recent        years selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors hormone replacement therapy and the diet        drug fenfluraminephentermine FenPhen What can we learn from these interventions        First the manufacturers of enhancement technologies will usually exploit the blurry        line between enhancement and treatment in order to sell drugs Because enhancement        technologies must be prescribed by physicians drug manufacturers typically market the        technologies not as enhancements but as treatments for newly discovered or        underrecognized disorders Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were marketed not as        personality enhancers or even only as treatments for clinical depression but as        treatments for questionable illnesses like premenstrual dysphoric disorder  FenPhen        was sold not as a mere diet drug but as a treatment for obesity which Wyeth the        manufacturer portrayed as a dangerous public health problem  Estrogen replacement        therapy was initially marketed as a riskfree way for women to extend their youthfulness        But when a  study found that estrogen replacement therapy was associated with an        increased risk of endometrial cancer the manufacturers added progesterone renamed the        combination hormone replacement therapy and recast it as a treatment for medical        problems associated with menopause such as osteoporosis         Second an alarming number of supposedly riskfree enhancements have later been        associated with unanticipated side effects some of them deadly Wyeth has set aside over         billion to compensate the thousands of patients who have developed valvular heart        disease and pulmonary hypertension after taking FenPhen  A  National Institutes        of Health study found that hormone replacement therapy was associated with such an elevated        risk of heart disease stroke pulmonary emboli and breast cancer that the study was        stopped prematurely  Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are currently embroiled        in controversy over whether they are associated with an elevated risk of suicide         Third the most successful enhancement technologies have been backed by tremendously        influential public relations campaigns These campaigns have included ghostwritten journal        articles industryfunded front groups and lucrative payments to academics professional        societies and university centers  For example GlaxoSmithKline marketed paroxetine        Paxil by promoting the previously obscure diagnosis of social anxiety disorder through        phony support groups celebrity spokespeople a directtoconsumer illness awareness        campaign and generous payments to key opinion leaders  The manufacturers of estrogen        replacement therapy marketed the hormone in the s by funding a research foundation        for Robert Wilson the gynecologist and author of the bestselling book         Feminine Forever  Wyeth marketed FenPhen by funding obesity research        centers launching public fitness campaigns contracting with a medical education company        to produce a series of ghostwritten journal articles and making generous payments to        academic physicians who then published extensively and testified for the drugs safety to        the Food and Drug Administration         The traditional worry about enhancement technologies is that users of the technologies        are buying individual wellbeing at the expense of some larger social good I may improve        my own athletic ability by taking steroids but I set off a steroid arms race that destroys        my sport I may get cosmetic surgery for my Asian eyes or use skin lighteners for my dark        skin but I reinforce the implicitly racist social norms that say that Asian eyes or dark        skin are traits to be ashamed of The worry is that some aspect of the way we live        together collectively is going to be damaged by actions that we take individually                A marketdriven healthcare system brings this worry much closer to home The        pharmaceutical industry is now the most profitable and politically powerful industry in the        United States  It also has a huge financial interest in creating a demand for        enhancement technologies The pharmaceutical industry can buy politicians to pass        industryfriendly legislation it can buy academic scientists to publish favorable journals        articles it can buy professional societies and patient support groups to spread the word        on the newly medicalized disorders that its interventions are developed to treat  It        can even buy bioethicists to dispense with any moral concerns  In this kind of        political and economic climate how likely is it that dissenting voices will have any        effect before it is too late                    Caplans Response to Elliotts Viewpoint        Elliott professes to be unhappy about enhancement What arguments does he present to        support his unhappiness Not many and the arguments that he does offer miss the point        completely        If people want to feel better sleep less have fewer hot flashes better vision or        fewer wrinkles then they may want to use enhancement technologies to achieve these things        Technology in itself isnt driving us in any particular directionI believe that we decide        where it should go Elliott however gravely warns us that you and I do not really decide        a direction when it comes to matters of enhancement It islisten carefully for the Darth        Vaderesque hissingdrug companies        The rest of Elliotts viewpoint amounts to what is his increasingly familiar harangue        against the pharmaceutical industry The drug companies sucker us into buying enhancement        by getting us hooked on pseudotherapies The drug companies rob us of our will to fend off        their sirenlike messages of better living through their chemistry And the drug companies        get us feeling so bad about ourselves that we empty our wallets on their latest overpriced        geegaws        Pharmaceutical companies may be evil incarnate And we may be putty in their pecuniary        little hands But that has nothing at all to do with the question of whether there is        anything wrong with pursuing enhancement When Elliott eagerly dons his hair shirt to        bemoan Big Pharma he finds so much sin to revel in that he forgets to give a reason any        reason why enhancement is in itself immoral        At most he presents an argument for keeping the pharmaceutical industry out of        enhancement Okay so lets take Big Pharma out of the picture If we left the        encouragement of enhancement to the government the military schools foundations        doctors or parents would this now be morally acceptable I think sometimes it would be        And nothing that Elliott says provides any reason to think otherwise                    Elliotts Response to Caplans Viewpoint        Caplan does not defend medical enhancement so much as attack its critics Or rather he        attacks a small group of conservative critics who want to preserve human nature He        dispatches those critics with admirable precision but I am not sure why he believes that        group of critics includes me My worry about enhancement technologies has little to do with        human nature My worry is that we will ignore important human needs at the expense of        frivolous human desires that dominant social norms will crowd out those of the minority        that the selfimprovement agenda will be set not by individuals but by powerful corporate        interests and that in the pursuit of betterment we will actually make ourselves worse        off        Its no secret that many Americans are deeply ashamed of their personal shortcomings and        inadequacies Nor is it any secret that these shortcomings and inadequacies can be        exploited for commercial profit But do we really want to submit our healthcare system to        the same forces that have made millionaires out of motivational speakers and diet book        authors        Skepticism about enhancement technologies is not equivalent to a wish to set back        medical research and declare some applications offlimits This is a debate about enhancing        human traits not curing human illness To say that our medical research agenda will be set        back if we restrict enhancement technologies makes no more sense than saying that cancer        surgery will be set back if the American Broadcasting Corporation cancels its cosmetic        surgery reality TV show         Extreme Makeover         We live in a country where  million uninsured people cannot get basic medical care        while the rest of us spend a billion dollars a year on baldness remedies It is not just        the inequity here that is so impressive It is the fact that we have gotten so accustomed        to the inequity that we do not see it as obscene
