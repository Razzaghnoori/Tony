 Newt Lite Try to remember if you can for a moment the old Newt Gingrich He was a man who liked to talk very grandly often describing his political program as renewing American civilization and replacing what he referred to as the bureaucratic welfare state with a new kind of society The 1994 election that brought him to power was a revolution that he cast in terms of Braveheart a gory movie about freedom fighters in medieval Scotland Republican traitors knew what to expect Gingrich blamed liberals for sensational murders and called the Clintons the enemies of normal Americans He drew cosmological charts with himself at the center and got very fat The new Newt by contrast is a humble fellow In his book Lessons Learned the Hard Way he presents himself as shorn of his old harshness and grandiosity as well as of 30 or 40 pounds On the cover he appears in faded jeans hiking boots and a leather jacket smiling as he leans against a post and rail fence bathed in soft filtered sunlight The few specific proposals he makes are stunning in their modesty For instance Gingrich advocates diabetes screening as a way to save Medicare money and thinks it is especially important for Native Americans who are highly susceptible to the disease to monitor their blood pressure He admits to mistakes such as failing to keep his mouth shut at several points mismanaging the House Republicans and underestimating his opponents He describes himself as tolerant of internal dissent even identifying with the GOP rebels who plotted a coup against him last summer Seeing Newt so shrunken is somewhat disheartening There s a poignant moment in his mostly very dull book when as his career is being torn apart by the House Ethics Committee investigation into his college course he describes visiting one of his favorite places the American Museum of Natural History in New York Communing with dinosaurs revives his spirits In the old days Newt didn t need fossils to spur him on He had the courage of his convictions and of his boorish aggression Now he comes across like a victim of some Dale Carnegie re education camp it s as if he s constantly reminding himself of his image consultant s lessons in seeming nice Where the old Newt was a compelling meanie the new one offers anodyne platitudes and empty uplift He calls at one point in his book for a serious conversation about our national future At another point he writes of the Republican agenda What we have to offer people is strength and adventure the experience of a new level of life enhancing energy and love of a great country This could be anyone talking Dick Gephardt Hillary Clinton or Marianne Williamson What happened to transform the raging bull into Caspar Milquetoast There are various theories Some think Gingrich has modified his behavior because he is still fighting for survival trying to appease the House Republicans who plotted to overthrow him and might plot again I ve heard others suggest that he is an undiagnosed manic depressive coming off a three year spree Perhaps the most common view is that Newt is merely positioning for 2000 trying to diminish his stratospheric negatives in preparation for a presidential run None of these explanations quite cuts it Whatever his past gaps in judgment Gingrich is too smart to think he has a realistic chance of being elected president His unpopularity is deep and indelible If he does run in the 2000 primaries it will be as a way of gracefully exiting his job as speaker He has to step down in 2002 anyway according to the rule he set In fact I don t think Gingrich s transformation is all that calculated To be sure his book is disingenuous at points He says the coup plot was merely a cry for attention by the GOP freshman class of 1994 not a serious attempt at getting rid of him That s ridiculous And nowhere does he mention one of his biggest mistakes the 4 5 million book deal Gingrich returned the advance but he still wrote or caused to be written two books of which this is the second and more nearly readable But Gingrich s arrogance is genuinely diminished He truly seems a different person I think the new personality modified Newt is mainly the product of his shattering experiences in 1995 and 1996 Gingrich tried to lead a revolution and ended up with his head in the guillotine In a way this catastrophe was the result of a misunderstanding Gingrich was never of the same mind as the radical freshmen Before the Contract With America he was not notably anti government To the contrary he thought the GOP had suffered as a result of its foolish opposition to popular federal programs But Gingrich had a swollen ego He thought of himself as a world historical figure so when the election of 1994 gave birth to a movement he stepped forward to lead it In fact it drove him He was thus the person standing in the intersection when the would be conservative revolution smashed into the moderate reality of American politics Gingrich is now picking himself up off the asphalt His plan for the future is to stay out of traffic Beyond that he proposes the Republican Party support something he calls entrepreneurial government He would let the private sector act wherever possible and get the government to act more like a business This is probably what Republicans would advocate if they were smart Entrepreneurial government is compatible with tax cuts and does not demand an assault on purposes and programs that the voting majority regards as essential It is a politics with great potential appeal to an electorate increasingly dominated by an independent stock owning middle class This kind of politics does not alienate women If the GOP could adopt it as a general approach while distancing itself from aggressive social conservatism Democrats would have reason to fear at the presidential as well as the congressional level But Newt s entrepreneurial idea which stresses flexibility and innovation in how government discharges its role contradicts the libertarian urge to have government simply butt out And Gingrich still wants to have it both ways or at least to make the class of 94 think he does According to his numbers government at all levels currently consumes about 38 percent of personal income Gingrich proposes reducing it to just 25 percent If you subtract the 16 percent that goes to state and local spending that means the federal government would defend the country pay for electricity to light the Capitol dome and do not much else But that s not all Gingrich intends to have it do He wants to protect Medicare dole out hundreds of billions in highway subsidies and fund research into diseases that affect Republicans Here Newt Lite has something in common with Newt Heavy His interesting ideas don t quite add up
