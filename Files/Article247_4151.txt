 George W s Frat Boy Charm Margo Forevermore I ll think of my glasses and you dear Prudie There are so many other matters for which I need your advice But perhaps it is best that I save them for a more private forum On the subject of W One cannot fully appreciate his appeal from television debates and Sunday morning interviews These settings exaggerate his weaknesses and that may be a fatal flaw But there s a reason he has raised 65 million A whiff of his frat boy charm is a powerful thing Or in my case I got a whiff of his jockish charm When I interviewed the man he had just returned from a jog Actually he doesn t really smell Approaching the Texas governor s mansion I heard a voice scream from the beyond the gates Hey U S News guy As the gates opened there was Bush dripping with sweat in shorts and T shirt I got dressed up just for you And then pointing a finger at me he joked My odor better be off the record The next thing I know he s whisked me through 10 minutes of banter offered me lunch and has me sitting out on the patio Though I had spent hours concocting a strategy for teasing information out of him he answered my toughest question nearly at the start None of his answers struck me as especially stupid or brilliant but rather they were rather convincingly earnest This question on Bush s intelligence will hover over the campaign I suspect for the duration a matter that will be hashed over in many a Breakfast Table Finally we should update readers on a priceless headline from this morning s Washington Post that has been a subject of much discussion today As Scott Shuger wrote it was a heart wrenching story about a 9 year old boy who concealed the accidental death of his mother for a month leaving her body in their home because he was afraid of being sent to an orphanage the Post goes with the bad taste headline of the year century and millennium Mother Died but Boy 9 Kept Mum For those who were wondering later editions of the Post went with a more tasteful Mother Died but Boy 9 Kept Silent This week has been a joy dear Prudie Glibness is really quite underrated Jed Purdy be damned But it s back to my job as unironic newsmagazine writer which has its virtues too Many thanks I m missing you already Massa H Coming next week Daniel and David Bell visit the Breakfast Table
