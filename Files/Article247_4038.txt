 How Will the Budget Cuts Work Yesterday the House passed a massive budget bill that included a 0 38 percent across the board budget cut How will this cut be applied Although the cut is billed as across the board it affects only discretionary spending which is less than half of the estimated 1 7 trillion budget Nearly 1 trillion in spending is deemed mandatory so it s exempt from the cuts This includes Social Security Medicare Medicaid unemployment benefits government pensions the earned income tax credit and other programs that the government is obligated to fund Although it is not considered a mandatory expense Congress also exempted military salaries from the cut as well as its own To achieve the 0 38 percent reduction cabinet secretaries will have to cut that amount from their departments total discretionary spending Congressional Republicans had originally proposed that the reduction be applied equally to each of the nearly 1 000 discretionary programs listed in the appropriation bills that is the Navy s 6 billion allocation for aircraft acquisitions and the 50 million budget of the Consumer Product Safety Commission would each have been reduced by 0 38 percent But the final measure allows the cabinet secretaries to allocate the cut as they see fit They will be able to reduce the spending of individual programs by up to 15 percent while leaving other programs budgets alone The only department not granted this flexibility is the Pentagon which is required to distribute the reduction proportionally among operations procurement and research programs Next question
