 Game Theory I don t have any statistics handy for purposes of comparison but if this isn t the largest retrospective exhibition ever mounted it is certainly the biggest I ve ever seen The uptown Guggenheim is almost entirely filled by the first part with only one of the five or six side galleries devoted to items from the permanent collection Part 2 takes up two floors at the SoHo annex and the adjunct at the Ace Gallery while a single work consists of 189 parts and measures roughly 1 000 feet in length If the task of viewing all this isn t a sufficient workout there are also two concurrent Rauschenberg gallery shows a series of frescoes and an exhibit of photographs at the Pace Wildenstein MacGill complex on 57 th Street Rauschenberg is an amazingly prolific and formally venturesome artist who over the past 50 years has nearly always risked aesthetic trespass producing work deliberately just one degree or two from being merely ugly banal kitschy gimmicky showy facile or of course excessive Those possibilities were what he was pitting himself against while his contemporaries in the 1950s for example were battling the picture plane When he has won he has won spectacularly He hasn t however always won He did have an astonishing 25 years or so though At least the first three quarters of the Frank Lloyd Wright spiral and its sideways annexes traveling up display one dazzling triumph of eye over reflex after another some of them iconic by now others seldom shown and vitally fresh Although some very good work predates it you might say that the show symbolically begins with his Erased de Kooning Drawing of 1953 Click on each thumbnail to see an enlargement It is exactly that a few smudged traces of pencil on an elaborately matted and framed piece of paper This work has always been cited as a classic killing the father act or a declaration of independence from the dogma of Abstract Expressionism It is both those things but it is also a declaration of independence from drawing He did a bit of it early on but soon realized that he had two stronger suits junk assemblage and photography He is a virtuoso of both He might actually be considered a great neglected photographer although this neglect is only a consequence of the fame of his combine paintings and prints combine paintings is Rauschenberg s own term for works that include both oil and objects on canvas The photographs in the museum show are primarily tough direct found object still lifes clearly descended from Walker Evans and related to Robert Frank His interest in both depicting and displaying found objects also links him to Evans who toward the end of his life was taking home and hanging up the bullet riddled stop signs he found on the road rather than just taking their pictures Rauschenberg however was compelled to alter such objects attaching them to canvas smearing them with paint and combining them with all manner of other substances The wall captions in this show are much more entertaining than those things usually are viz Odalisk 1955 58 a combine that includes oil watercolor pencil crayon paper fabric photographs printed reproductions miniature blueprint metal newspaper glass dried grass and steel wool with pillow wood post electric lights and Plymouth Rock rooster on wood structure mounted on four casters You can imagine the fun Rauschenberg must have had finding random detritus on the streets dragging it up to the loft and then figuring out the most perversely elegant ways to put it together There are a few studio pictures in the vast catalog but none unfortunately shows the rat s nest of tennis balls old newspapers stuffed birds cheesy bedspreads and construction debris that must have filled the place in the 1950s Lately a great deal has been made of Rauschenberg s discretion regarding his sex life with critics zeroing in on Bed 1955 a combine that includes a paint and pencil enhanced pillow quilt and sheet as well as Canyon 1959 which features among other things a mirror a pillow in a noose and a stuffed bald eagle in full wingspread Those works are presumably meant to be Realist and Symbolist respectively allusions to his homosexual identity and Rauschenberg is chided for not publicly affirming the same And such allusions they may well be although you do wonder how those critics would then interpret the iconic Monogram 1955 59 with its stuffed angora goat wearing a car tire around its midriff The quest for meaning a professor s game looks pretty pale amid the panache and humor of Rauschenberg s assemblages and combines They involve Dada nose thumbing Expressionist brio an American appreciation of pure funk a fl neur s eye for chance and juxtaposition in the streets a sensualist s feeling for the most outr kinds of texture and a scopophiliac s unquenchable thirst for images all kinds right now from industrial logos to comic strips to postage stamps to Vel zquez s Rokeby Venus He also incidentally has quite an ear capable of doing more with a one word title Rebus Currency Interview Barge Express than most writers Meaning has actually tended to be a pitfall for him as is shown by his topical posters only one of which is displayed here a dully literal item for Earth Day 1970 The lower level of the Guggenheim SoHo displays the tinkering side of Rauschenberg s nature the works he made in collaboration with engineers the star item there is unquestionably Mud Muse 1968 71 a vat of bentonite an artificial clay that bubbles and gurgles and spits like a pool of quicksand in a Tarzan movie triggered by a sound activated compressed air system This kind of stuff is engaging and occasionally more than that Upstairs and on the very highest tiers of the uptown branch is where the trouble starts Over the last 20 years or so Rauschenberg has repeated himself a lot This may be par for the course of most artistic careers the distinction here is that he has repeated himself in ever more exalted and expensive media reflective metals Japanese ceramics fresco which just gild the funk sapping its life When employing his habitual paper and canvas and burlap bags he has tended to go for discordantly smooth finishes The Ace Gallery installation a work in progress that will eventually reach a quarter mile in length is a recapitulation of themes that winds up being reductive in its very gigantism Meanwhile the best of the later work is the very simplest made from discarded gas station signs Maybe he should just limit himself to materials that cost no more than five bucks a pound
