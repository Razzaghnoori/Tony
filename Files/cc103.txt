 Introduction The term acute renal failure ARF has been used to encompass a wide variety of clinical disorders ranging from glomerulonephritis to prerenal azotemia It is generally defined as a rapid decline within hours to weeks in glomerular filtration rate GFR and retention of nitrogenous waste products Each underlying disorder has its own unique pathophysiology and separate set of etiologies Furthermore many of these clinical syndromes have specific treatments Accordingly it is not possible to consider the issue of whether diuretics or dopamine are useful in ARF without first considering the differences between these individual disorders Moreover data drawn from animal experiments where compounds such as uranyl nitrate or glycerol were used to induce ARF must be interpreted with caution 1 Still much of our understanding of these disorders and the effects of various treatments comes from these models In general diuretics and or dopamine are usually considered for the prevention or treatment of acute tubular necrosis ATN The basic rationale is that ischemic ATN should be improved by increasing renal blood flow and that tubular obstruction should be decreased by maintaining urine flow The use of diuretics to prevent or even treat renal dysfunction has become a widely accepted clinical practice Indeed management protocols for some routine patients often include orders for furosemide when urine output falls below some cutoff value Some protocols even utilize socalled renal dose dopamine in these circumstances It is therefore necessary to review the evidence in support of such practices Given the broad range of conditions predisposing to ARF and the multiple comorbidities of critically ill patients a systematic review addressing the effect of different treatments must be interpreted in light of these clinical features Therefore the purpose of this review was to evaluate the impact of diuretics and dopamine for both the prevention and treatment of renal dysfunction in the acute care setting Methods Search strategy A MEDLINE search was conducted using databases from 1966 to May 1997 Articles dealing with kidney drug effects and diuretics or dopamine were searched This pool of articles was then limited to English language clinical trials or meta analyses of human studies Bibliographies of review articles on these topics were also searched by hand for additional studies meeting the above criteria This group of articles was then screened by the author for studies addressing the use of diuretics or dopamine in the prevention and or treatment of ARF Inclusion and exclusion criteria For the purpose of this review only loop diuretics mannitol and dopamine were included Loop diuretics included the agents furosemide bumetanide and torsemide These agents have become the most widely used for the indications considered in this review Although ethacrynic acid is also a loop diuretic it was excluded because it is not commonly used in clinical practice Additionally other diuretic agents such as thiazides were excluded Similarly this review will not discuss any of the yet experimental agents such as atrial natriuretic factor The primary analysis included only studies that involved humans and were published in English Critical appraisal methods Individual studies were graded by levels according to the criteria in Table 1 adapted from Cook et al 2 When multiple studies were available the highest level study was used Clinical trials of the effectiveness of diuretics or dopamine were judged to be effective only if the outcome measures were of clinical significance eg mortality need for hemodialysis or in terms of biochemical evidence of organ function serum creatinine or creatinine clearance following the maneuver Surrogate markers such as urine output or renal blood flow were not considered as evidence of effectiveness Furthermore trials of dopamine were not considered controlled unless confounding variables such as blood pressure and cardiac output were reported Similarly for both diuretics and dopamine the volume status of the control and treatment groups must have been similar Results Radiocontrastinduced ATN Radiocontrast induced ATN is rare in patients without underlying renal cardiac or hepatic dysfunction and occurs most commonly in patients with diabetic nephropathy 43 In this group the incidence approaches 50 depending on the degree of baseline renal function and the use of ionic vs nonionic contrast media 44 Several forms of therapy have been proposed to prevent or treat radiocontrast induced ATN including saline furosemide mannitol calcium channel blockers dopamine atrial natriuretic peptide and theophylline 44 There are no placebo controlled trials testing the effectiveness of any of these therapies Virtually all studies have used hydration usually with 0 45 saline in addition to the agent being tested and most authors recommend its use However even then little comparative data exist for these potential treatments One exception is the study by Solomon et al 3 which compared the effects of furosemide plus saline mannitol plus saline and saline alone again 0 45 saline was used This randomized trial of 78 high risk patients found that both diuretic regimens were less effective in preventing ATN than saline alone relative risk of ATN using mannitol 2 5 or furosemide 3 6 vs saline alone P 0 02 Another study by Weinstein et al found that renal function significantly deteriorated in patients pretreated with furosemide 4 As shown in Table 1 to date only two clinical trials have been published using dopamine to prevent radiocontrastinduced ATN Hall et al 28 studied the effects of dopamine infusion on serum creatinine assessed at day 3 after radiocontrast administration in patients with baseline serum creatinine levels of 2 0 mg dl This level III study did show an improvement in serum creatinine with dopamine compared to a control group which received mannitol However given the evidence that mannitol may actually be harmful in this setting 3 this was probably not the appropriate control group In the only other controlled trial Weisberg et al 24 found no difference in the incidence of ATN with or without dopamine 30 40 in a small series of patients n 30 Thus for this indication we can safely conclude that diuretics and dopamine are clearly not helpful and may even be harmful while volume expansion with 0 45 saline is unproven but potentially beneficial Prevention of ischemic ATN Of the five studies listed in Table 1 only one trial used loop diuretics Hager et al 8 randomized 121 patients to receive either furosemide 1 mg h or placebo starting immediately after major thoraco abdominal or vascular surgery and continuing throughout the intensive care unit ICU stay The authors measured creatinine clearance and found no difference between furosemide and placebo Unfortunately the study was unable to address the use of loop diuretics given during the procedure The facts are even less clear regarding mannitol in vascular surgery The only controlled study available is by Beall et al from 1963 5 This study compared the outcomes of 30 patients who underwent elective abdominal aortic aneurysm repair Patients were randomized to receive either no pre operative fluid iv hydration only or iv hydration plus mannitol as required to keep urine output 60 ml min There was no change in renal function or postoperative urine output between the latter two groups Although this negative study was certainly underpowered it remains the only controlled trial of mannitol in vascular surgery to date The following year Powers et al reported the outcomes of 104 patients treated with mannitol 6 This uncontrolled study reported that all patients had an increase in urine output and none developed ATN No recent studies have been carried out to address this issue and it is unlikely that any will In other types of surgery such as coronary artery bypass 9 or biliary surgery 10 small studies have also been unable to demonstrate a benefit associated with mannitol Given these considerations and in the absence of clinical data diuretics cannot be recommended to prevent ATN Thirty clinical studies of dopamine have been published to date both for prevention of ATN and treatment of early ATN including radiocontrast induced ATN However only 20 of these used outcomes other than surrogate markers eg urine output renal blood flow and only three were positive These included the study by Hall et al 28 cited above and two others which were both methodologically inferior one level IV and one level V Polson et al 38 found a significant difference in creatinine clearance and a decrease in ARF in liver transplant patients treated with 2 g kg min dopamine The findings of this level IV study were not supported by a level II study from Swygert et al 30 also in liver transplant patients The Swygert study used 3 g kg min dopamine and found no difference compared to placebo in terms of creatinine clearance or incidence of ARF 4 in both groups The results of a small level V study by Palmieri et al 26 appear to suggest that dopamine may be useful in shortening the recovery time from interleukin 2 induced ARF Apart from these two studies the remaining 17 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 27 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 39 40 41 42 collectively enrolling over 700 patients are all negative Among these is a recent level II study by Lherm et al 14 in which dopamine infusion failed to improve renal function in patients with sepsis except for transiently increasing creatinine clearance in patients without shock Treatment of established ATN Of the three trials evaluating the use of diuretics in the treatment of ATN two fulfilled outcome criteria Both studies evaluated the effects of treatment on mortality and the need for dialysis In the first Kleinknecht et al 11 randomized 66 patients to receive furosemide or placebo Although the furosemide group did experience improved urine output there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of renal recovery days on dialysis or mortality A second study by Brown et al 12 had similar results In this study 58 patients were given a single dose of furosemide 1 g and then randomized either to receive or not receive continued diuretic therapy again there were no differences between the two groups in terms of need for dialysis or survival Unfortunately even the two studies together lack sufficient power to entirely rule out the possibility that diuretics have a beneficial effect on survival Nonetheless the available literature to date does not support a survival benefit for this therapy Discussion Diuretics and ATN Experimentally the effectiveness of diuretics in the prevention of ischemic ATN appears to be related to timing While no data exist in humans several lines of evidence from animal experiments suggest that interventions such as diuretics may be useful if given within minutes or perhaps the first few hours following a renal insult 1 Once this time limit has passed the intervention will be ineffective This is because the unifying principle is cytoprotection of the renal tubular cells which if lethally injured may only be rescued for a short time The injury to the renal tubular cells has been attributed to four major factors renal vasoconstriction reduction of glomerular capillary permeability tubular obstruction and transepithelial back leak of filtrate 45 In theory loop diuretics may be useful in combating each of these factors These agents decrease the metabolic demand of the renal tubular cell reducing its oxygen requirement and hence increasing its resistance to ischemia 46 and perhaps to other toxic insults as well A greater urine flow may also reduce the incidence of tubular obstruction and the higher hydraulic pressures may reduce the back leak of filtrate 47 In the latter case fluid resuscitation alone may produce much of the same effect 7 In practical terms these data from animal studies offer little to guide practice in the care of patients though they provide great insight into the various mechanisms of ATN This is because it is not usually possible to anticipate the renal injury and act within the time required to have an effect However there are notable exceptions such as aortic cross clamping in aneurysm repair The use of loop diuretics has become routine for this indication in many institutions Nonetheless there appears to be no evidence in support of this approach Additionally there are some situations in which the renal injury is subacute or mild and sustained Such is often the case in conditions such as rhabdomyolysis drug induced renal injury hepatorenal syndrome and ARF associated with cardiopulmonary bypass circulation in cardiac surgery especially in patients with pre operative renal impairment 48 In these conditions it is often possible to act in an attempt to prevent or reduce the renal injury as it evolves Although the specifics of renal injury vary somewhat between these forms of subacute renal failure all are exacerbated by hypovolemia and therefore any consideration of the use of loop diuretics must include a provision for adequate volume replacement This requirement makes it difficult to separate the effects of diuretics from the effects of the increased fluid given to prevent diuretic induced hypovolemia Dramatic evidence exists from a case controlled study to support the use of early and aggressive hydration along with forced alkaline osmotic diuresis mannitol for the treatment of ATN secondary to traumatic rhabdomyolysis 7 In this study delayed treatment in a series of seven patients was associated with a 100 incidence of ARF while in another seven patients prompt treatment was 100 successful in avoiding this complication even though renal injury had already begun Unlike loop diuretics mannitol functions as an intravascular volume expander at least initially and may also function as a free radical scavenger None of these patients received loop diuretics and indeed the authors have argued that hydration alone may have been sufficient to produce many of salutary effects of the osmotic diuresis 7 Once ATN is established there are no therapies that have been proven to reverse it The most a clinician can do is to manage the complications of ARF and limit further renal insult so as to assure the best chance of renal recovery Diuretics can be both useful and harmful in this regard The harm comes from reducing the circulating volume too much and adding a prerenal insult on top of the established ATN The recovering kidney may be even more susceptible to this second hit and may be profoundly injured by a relatively mild decrease in perfusion especially with the pre existing renal disease Clinicians may inadvertently produce this injury if diuretics are dosed according to the amount of peripheral edema or body weight without consideration of intravascular volume This may be of particular concern in many critically ill patients with hypoalbuminemia These patients may have coexisting total body volume overload and intravascular volume depletion However if volume status is monitored closely diuretics can be useful in the conversion to nonoliguria This goal may be reasonable in certain situations and patients are clearly easier to manage without volume overload and electrolyte imbalances In this regard loop diuretics appear to be more effective and less toxic when given as a continuous infusion rather than as a bolus In a randomized crossover trial Rudy et al 49 evaluated the effectiveness of continuous infusion vs bolus dosing of bumetanide Continuous infusion produced 48 mmol more net sodium excretion 95 CI 16 80 mmol P 0 01 and less toxicity It is also important to note that large bolus doses of loop diuretics may cause transient renal vasoconstriction Despite these potentially useful effects of diuretic therapy there is no evidence that converting oliguria into nonoliguria is effective in reducing mortality or the need for dialysis As detailed above this question has now been evaluated in two randomized trials 11 12 Medullary ischemia renal blood flow and dopamine In general ATN occurs more commonly in patients with certain types of underlying physiologic states or diseases elderly relative hypovolemia diabetes underlying kidney disease heart disease hepatic cirrhosis certain autoimmune diseases and malignancies as well as in certain clinical settings sepsis surgery trauma drug induced Indeed one of the most commonly anticipated etiologies of ATN is the use of iv contrast agents for imaging studies 43 Although the pathogenesis of renal injury secondary to radiocontrast agents is not entirely understood it appears to be due to medullary ischemia 3 50 For some time it has been postulated that this ischemic injury occurs on the basis of decreased renal blood flow secondary to renal vasoconstriction It is therefore surprising that studies have now shown that renal blood flow actually increases with radiocontrast 24 This has led some investigators to hypothesize that medullary ischemia is a demand side phenomenon In other words the ionic load leads to medullary ischemia because the medullary cellular oxygen demand becomes greater than the supply 51 52 This aspect of renal physiology also has implications for the use of agents like dopamine Like loop diuretics dopamine is frequently used by clinicians to increase urine output in ARF in the hope that such a maneuver might attenuate renal injury or improve survival Much of the enthusiasm for this agent comes from the belief that dopamine increases renal blood flow and that such an outcome is in fact desirable Additionally clinicians often interpret an increase in urine output as proof that these two assumptions are valid Indeed dopamine may increase urine output through four separate mechanisms Dopamine stimulates both dopaminergic and adrenergic both alpha and beta receptors As such dopamine may affect renal blood flow by direct vasodilatation dopamine receptors by increasing cardiac output beta receptors or by increasing perfusion pressure alpha receptors At lower doses particularly less than 2 g kg min the dopaminergic effects tend to predominate although wide variability appears to exist across patients and clinical conditions In the appropriate clinical setting any of these mechanisms might increase effective renal plasma flow and thus increase urine output Under such conditions the increase in urine output might well be indicative of improved renal function However dopamine may increase urine output by yet a fourth mechanism that of inhibition of sodium potassium ATPase at the tubular epithelial cell level 53 The effect of this final mechanism is to increase sodium excretion and thereby diuresis Thus apart from its direct and indirect effects on the renal vasculature dopamine increases urine output because it is a diuretic The natriuretic diuretic effects of dopamine are of importance not only because they may lull clinicians into believing that they are improving renal function when they observe an increase in urine output with the drug but also because this increase in urine output may come with unexpected effects Most enthusiasts use so called renal dose dopamine in the belief that they can improve renal blood flow and that this will restore oxygen delivery to portions of the kidney that are dysoxic Unfortunately as already discussed the problem may not be remedied simply by increasing total renal blood flow This is because the area of the kidney that is most at risk from ischemia is the very area least likely to benefit from dopamine infusion This area is the outer medulla Normally outer medullary cells live on the edge of dysoxia Oxygen diffuses from the descending to ascending vasa recta within the vascular bundles limiting oxygen delivery to the renal medulla 52 In addition the medulla suffers from unusually high oxygen demand related to tubular transport activity medullary oxygen extraction approaches 90 54 Thus the renal medulla is constantly on the brink of dysoxia owing to high demand and low delivery of oxygen Given these considerations it is certainly understandable for clinicians to desire to increase renal blood flow in the hope of improving medullary oxygen delivery However Heyman et al have recently demonstrated that although dopamine increased outer medullary blood flow in the hypovolemic rat it failed to improve outer medullary dysoxia 55 In fact analogous to the situation with radio contrast the increase in solute delivery to the distal tubular cells produced by the natriuretic effects of dopamine via inhibition of proximal tubular reabsorption might actually increase their oxygen consumption and therefore increase rather than decrease the risk of ischemia 56 With these myths of experimental evidence dispelled or at least severely questioned it is not surprising that clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect from dopamine infusion in the setting of treatment or prevention of ATN 57 58 Data of this sort also call into question the appropriateness of increasing urine output in the first place As we have seen with other types of diuretics converting oliguric to nonoliguric renal failure may provide certain management advantages but does not affect overall renal recovery or outcome Accordingly on the basis of existing evidence the use of dopamine to improve renal function cannot be recommended This is not to say that dopamine is not a useful drug Indeed dopamine s multiple effects even at low doses make it the perfect pressor inotropic agent when such a combination is warranted It is a common clinical scenario in which a patient is both modestly hypotensive vasodilated and has a degree of cardiac dysfunction Such a patient may well benefit from the combined inotropic vasopressor renal vasodilator and diuretic effects of this drug However as always when safer or less invasive alternatives are available they should be used first For example loop diuretics are much more effective diuretics than dopamine and are much safer Similarly dobutamine would be a better alternative for the patient who primarily requires an inotrope and norepinephrine would be a better choice for a vasodilated hyperdynamic patient Certainly dopamine has a number of potential disadvantages In a recent study Segal et al demonstrated that low dose dopamine caused earlier onset of gut ischemia 59 Even at low doses dopamine may increase cardiac contractility and systemic resistance and can cause tissue necrosis and digital gangrene 60 Furthermore even if dopamine were without risk its effects can be unpredictable This point was stressed by Flancbaum et al who demonstrated that low dose infusion alone produces a drug dependent increase in the urinary output in oliguric euvolemic ICU patients and that the maximal effect is temporally variable 13 Given the fact that the renal effects of low dose dopamine in patients with sepsis syndrome decrease with time it has been suggested that there is a desensitization of renal dopaminergic receptors 14 The above considerations argue against the routine use of renal dose dopamine for patients with renal insufficiency Conclusions The use of diuretics in the management of ARF remains controversial despite several advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis of renal failure and the mechanisms of action of the agents commonly used to manage it At the present time the limited observational and experimental evidence available moderately supports the following guidelines 1 For prophylaxsis against radiocontrast induced ATN saline infusion should be administered for optimal hydration neither diuretics nor dopamine appear effective and may be harmful 2 For the prevention of ischemic ATN although animal data suggest this intervention would be helpful there are no human data to support the use of diuretics 3 The use of renal dose dopamine has not been substantiated to improve outcome in human studies and may prove to be deleterious in certain clinical settings 4 In the management of rhabdomyolysis loop diuretics should probably be avoided although mannitol may be effective on the basis of level IV evidence 5 When loop diuretics are used in the management of ARF continuous infusion may be more efficacious than bolus administration in achieving diuresis However there is no evidence that this maneuver improves survival or renal recovery
