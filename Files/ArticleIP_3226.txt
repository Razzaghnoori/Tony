 Presumed President Harrison Ford for President It sounds like an idea whose time has come For the last few years let s be honest about it ever since Clinton got elected Hollywood has exiled our fearless leader to a kind of movie hell In The American President he was a shy lonely widower In Independence Day his wife went down in a helicopter and he got upstaged by the more manly Will Smith In Absolute Power he was a real lemon a lecherous sadist and an accomplice to murder But at long last in Air Force One the president gets to be something other than a loser or a scoundrel He s James Marshall a Vietnam War hero and a stand up guy Even rarer these days his wife played by Wendy Crewson is actually alive and he s still in love with her The only problem is that he s come to power at the dawn of a confusing new era when globalization is blurring national boundaries and the world is more vulnerable than ever before to random heavily accented terrorist villains Thank God our reigning action hero is at the helm or so you d think Actually Air Force One takes less than five minutes to demonstrate the drawbacks of Harrison Ford as the leader of the free world It opens in Moscow where President Marshall delivers a major speech explaining why he authorized American troops to capture Gen Radek the tyrannical leader of Kazakhstan Radek is dangerous and evil he says and although he presents no immediate threat to American interests it s high time for us to abandon such piddling hypocritical concerns as the national interest Out with wimpy measures like economic sanctions it s time to become uncompromising moral enforcers Marshall warns terrorists around the world that from now on It s your turn to be afraid This is a depressing scary reckless announcement and as Ford delivers it you think how disturbing it would be to have someone like him as president For all his popularity Ford has built his career on an inarticulate uncomfortable and somewhat angry persona What s saved him from grimness is his status as an outsider his flippant sense of humor and his lovable grin But Han Solo and Indiana Jones were a long time ago and lately Ford s been cultivating a look of unrelieved pain Playing a powerful public figure Ford looks as miserable and hunted as he did in The Fugitive and that s exactly the point Following his speech the president boards Air Force One to return home and for five minutes in a scene so idyllic it borders on the bizarre he s able to let down his guard and relax in the bosom of his family He kisses his wife Their daughter adorable little Alice announces that she d like to visit a refugee camp and minister to poor helpless wounded people Daddy worries that she s not old enough but Mommy laughs tenderly and says She couldn t stay your little girl forever Jim This dialogue has the eerie earnestness of a testimonial in an aspirin commercial along with a dig at Clinton James Marshall isn t a good president because he feels our pain He s a good president because he feels his pain the pain of steering the world through this chaotic period of realignment when all he really wants to do is help his daughter with her homework and smooch with his wife It s Global Village meets Family Values and once this slick high concept is established the action can begin Gary Oldman leads five dastardly followers of Radek in posing as a Russian film crew and a flirtatious moron of a White House aide lets them on the plane There assisted by a turncoat American official they quickly take control of the aircraft Oldman barking out the hysterical howls that serve as lingua franca for all cinema terrorists calls the White House and tells Vice President Kathryn Bennett Glenn Close that he ll kill one hostage every half hour until Radek is released Meanwhile the president has gone missing Everyone assumes he s left the plane in an escape pod and is floating safely to earth only the audience knows that he s stuck around first and foremost to rescue his wife and daughter and then if it s convenient to save the world What follows is one of the more joyless joy rides in recent memory The director Wolfgang Petersen made his mark with Das Boot a masterfully absorbing thriller set on board a claustrophobic German U boat You d think Petersen would have fun staging an airborne showdown but there s not a scene in Air Force One that wasn t done 10 times better in the underrated Kurt Russell hijacked airplane thriller Executive Decision That movie had the good sense to leave its absurd politics first Chechen then Middle Eastern on the margins and to focus instead on the scary ordeal of being stuck on a plane piloted by crazies With geeky charm it patiently explored the plane s engineering it literally walked you down into the underbelly a beautiful abstract maze of crisscrossing steel Air Force One rips off half the adventures from Executive Decision there s a blatantly similar scene involving the cutting of wires but the suspense never builds A number of scenes actually revolve around the astoundingly dull theme of cellular communication Here are two typical action sequences 1 The president needs to get word to Washington that he s still alive and hiding on board the plane He desperately rummages through some luggage He finds someone s cell phone and calls the White House 2 The president hatches a plan to help the hostages escape but he needs to alert the Air Force to his scheme This time it s harder because he s lost the cell phone and the terrorists have shut down the regular phones but a presidential aide reminds him that faxes go out on an auxiliary line Solemnly she leads him over to the fax station where he scribbles out a message and dials Will the fax go through Tension mounts After a few moments we hear the telltale squeak of a successful transmission accompanied by triumphal music Such scenes do not a nail biter make Harrison Ford tries to help by looking anguished as he hits kicks and shoots his way to the final duel with Oldman But again the relentless search for with it political relevance slows the film down Oldman is supposed to represent reactionary Russians enraged by the new economic reforms I m doink it for Muzzer Russia he drawls and I veel not rest unteel zee capitalists are dragged through the streets und shot The rhetoric may be modern but the character is a cartoon anachronism right down to his corny drawn out delivery which clocks in at about five words per minute And his cause seems so pathetically weak compared to the raging progress of capitalism around the world that watching him strut is like watching someone shoot a gun you know is filled with blanks There s not a single thing about Air Force One to recommend except perhaps the controlled performance of Glenn Close who does remarkably well as the recipient of several phone calls from the sky But there is something strangely comforting about how bad this movie is For a while there all those stories about weak willed presidents were worrisome It was hard not to see them as tapping in to a deep seated nationwide gloom After Air Force One though we should be able to breathe easier It is just too boring to reflect our actual fantasy life and so brazenly concerned with exploiting the Zeitgeist that it makes you wonder if it isn t Hollywood that s shrouded in gloom while the rest of us are getting along fine He will not negotiate First Lady Wendy Crewson confronts Ivan Korshunov Gary Oldman 44 seconds A fight on board Air Force One 39 seconds
