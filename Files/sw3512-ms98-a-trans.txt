        okay i now say Arlington Texas since the other day i said that and somebody said well im in Arlington Virginia     oh  well that is a different thing isnt it   yeah i was really surprised then i got one person from Utah but usually its just right around here   sure   well what what do you like in a restaurant   well i guess id i thought well i guess id have to say the food  well   i know number one thats definitely it   you know if the foods good then thats you know that sort of makes my decision i you know if i really have something good although okay the food and then the other thing id say is atmospheres real important to me you know i dont like really noisy places and   umhum you know yeah  you know i used to like to go to Fridays because i like kind of lively fun places and the last time we went there it was so horrendously noisy that i dont know if ill ever go back it was awful   yes   well when a when a i know one of my pet peeves is that you know they have the music on so loud and then people have to talk loud and then its just so noisy that you cant visit   umhum thats right oh i know   you know and normally when im eating out i you know with people and i wanna sit and talk i mean     thats the half the fun is the conversation right   right you know and i dont mind some noise but if its bearable for me so um   i really think American restaurants are all overall getting noisy and noisy people just screaming i say that because i  the time i was in Europe years ago you could be in a tiny little restaurant everyone talked lower they still seemed to have fun   id uhhuh well i dont know why i in fact ive been to places where ive asked them to turn the music down and and they say well they you know they cant that thats the the atmosphere they want to promote and i i dont understand that   umhum i dont either   you know its like that doesnt make sense to me what you know what is the fun of that   i know  i cant and uh another one you can tell i go to cheap restaurants now that i have a daughter in college and im going we we go all the cheapies but uh we go to Cheddars a lot theres one by us     uhhuh   and theyll just blast the TV where in the bar where you have to wait till they call your name you know and and im not that  excited about some baseball game or whatever theyre   umhum right   its just so loud you cant even visit while youre having a drink or anything   well another thing that is not my favorite thing is um  you know like if they have um birthdays and then they all scream  you know  clap and scream to birthday i get tired of that too   oh they all screaming run screaming in and singing yes they do too i think   so you know that that uh the atmosphere does make a difference but usually i tend to go well for two reasons i go for the food also thinking now theres certain types of restaurants that i like you know like i love Mexican food and so i go to i like Mexican food restaurants um   umhum umhum right   so i would go for that um i think did i say what kind of restaurants do you prefer or do you   oh golly uh i like most kinds of food really id never go to a barbecue place i mean i i dont mind barbecue but thats one that we just dont go out to   uhhuh   but what you know i like Italian and Mexican and i love French and   umhum   um we dont i dont even think we have a Greek restaurant in Arlington we uh i used to go to a Greek restaurant over in Dallas couple of them i thought they were great         uhhuh   um i like most everything i like seafood too course its hard to get my husband to a seafood restaurant but another thing to consider is the uh help you know   yeah umhum   uh their attitude   right   uh uh i think and uh   i i agree   some of them you know they come up with all this phony stuff too hi my names Bill im your waiter for the night oh God im tired of that   right right right just wait on me and   right i dont care about right we dont have to exchange backgrounds but um price is something to consider   ill be happy   thats true thats true um and i and i generally speaking go to moderately priced places you know places and it does matter um   but   you know depending upon what my budget is for the week as to where i go i guess um but thats yeah thats right i uh price is definitely  a consideration   right uh the more expensive the restaurant the more i want the have the waiters to really wait on you and be good you know  remember   uhhuh well they should be i mean in theory i guess   really really i think so well we went to New Orleans this fall and talk about great restaurants oh   yes theres probably no place better i i you know the food in New Orleans is just fabulous   oh oh i know and uh  really we we went to Commanders Palace and     oh   and you know supposed to be one of the better ones in America and uh our dinner that night you could choose one that had like four courses and it was thirty nine dollars a dinner but my gosh it was worth it it was just beautiful surrounding and at one time there was five people waiting on our table     yeah yes yeah ive been there it yes i have   oh really thats the first time i id been in New Orleans before it was the first time id eaten there and i thought it was worth every penny   ah it is its a fabulous place   and uh i really enjoyed that then id enjoy that more than Brennans   uhhuh   i think its better   uhhuh   but still Brennans is so lovely and the service is so wonderful   well theyre all lovely i mean basically you just cant go wrong and um the food is just so good i i i i love New Orleans and i   thats true oh i know and theyre lighthearted people there but   exactly its just a
