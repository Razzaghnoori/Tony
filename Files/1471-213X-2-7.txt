 Background The adult cuticular surface of insects is covered with hairs sensory bristles ridges scales and other structures In most body regions individual cuticular structures are aligned in the plane of the epithelium The basis for the development of this planar or tissue polarity has principally been studied in Drosophila 1 2 3 4 where it is under the control of the frizzled fz pathway 5 Many Drosophila epidermal cells produce cuticular hairs that are outgrowths from the apical surface of pupal epidermal cells The development of epidermal hairs has principally been studied on the wing where each pupal cell produces a single distally pointing hair The fz pathway controls hair polarity by directing the location for hair initiation 5 In a wild type fly hairs are formed at the distal most vertex of the wing cells and extend distally Mutations in fz pathway genes result in altered sites for hair initiation which results in altered hair polarity and in some cases altered hair number 5 Sensory bristles are found in all regions of the adult epidermis Bristles are polarized within the plane of the epidermis and in most body region neighbouring bristles are aligned in parallel and point in the same direction as neighbouring hairs The fz pathway controls bristle polarity by regulating the orientation of the spindle for the first differentiative division of the sensory organ precursor cell 6 The ommatidia of the compound eye also display a dramatic planar polarity that is under the control of the fz pathway In this tissue the fz pathway controls polarity by regulating the R3 R4 cell fate decision 7 The arista is the terminal segment of the antenna and it is comprised of a central core of epidermal cells some of which elaborate a single lateral extension 8 The laterals and the cells that form them share a number of characteristics of both hairs and bristles The laterals are longer than many bristles but thinner At the ultrastructural level developing laterals resemble bristles and not hairs 8 They contain a series of large bundles of F actin that are juxtaposed to the plasma membrane In addition microtubules are distributed throughout the central region of the lateral The developing laterals resemble hairs and not bristle in that they are formed at the apical surface of epithelial cells and they are not innervated Mutations in the genes of the fz pathway result in altered hair and bristle polarity and in some cases large numbers of cells that produce multiple hairs To determine if the fz pathway played a role in arista development we examined the aristae of various fz pathway mutants 1 5 We found that multiple wing hairs mwh which results in an average of almost 4 hairs per cell on the wing also resulted in the formation of multipled and branched laterals However unlike the situation on the wing where mwh results in altered hair polarity on the arista we did not see any evidence of altered lateral polarity We also examined aristae from inturned in and fuzzy fy mutants On the wing mutations in these genes result in altered hair polarity and in many cells forming two or three hairs 5 On mutant aristae we found that in and fy caused multipled and branched laterals but as was the case for mwh we did not see any evidence for altered polarity We did not detect any mutant phenotype in adult aristae of fz Van Gogh Vang dishevelled dsh starry night stan also known as Flamingo fmi or prickle pk mutants 1 It was surprising that upstream members of the fz pathway did not show a mutant phenotype while downstream members did We therefore examined the situation further In developing wild type pupal aristae laterals formed near but not at the distal edge of aristae central core cells 8 When we examined fz dsh and stan mutants we noted that lateral initiation was no longer restricted to the distal region of central core cells Although these laterals formed at an unusual subcellular location this did not produce a noticeable phenotype in the adult The altered location for lateral initiation in fz and other mutants was similar to their phenotype in the wing 5 Prior to hair initiation in wing cells Fz Dsh Fmi and Dgo accumulate on the distal side of wing cells Stan and Dgo are also thought to accumulate on the proximal side 9 10 11 12 13 To see if this could be the case for lateral development we examined the distribution of Fz in developing arista using a Fz GFP encoding transgene gene We found that Fz GFP preferentially accumulated on the distal side of arista central core cells much as it does in wing cells In addition we found that this asymmetric localization was lost in dsh mutants but retained in in and fy mutants as is the case in wing cells As is the case in wing cells the distal accumulation of Fz did not appear to influence lateral development in an in or fy mutant Overall the data argue that the fz pathway functions in a similar but modified way to regulate lateral morphogenesis as compared to wing hair morphogenesis We suggest that the absence of a noticeable adult phenotype in fz aristae while there is a dramatic phenotype on the wing is due to inherent differences in the cell biology of the relevant cells Results The arista phenotype of inturned and fuzzy On the wing mutations in inturned in and fuzzy fy result in both altered hair polarity and in many cells forming more than one hair 5 14 15 16 In the arista mutations in these genes do not have an obvious polarity phenotype but they do result in the production of multipled and split laterals Fig 1C We found about two lateral ends per lateral producing cell a wild type unbranched lateral has one end per lateral producing cell Table 1 Most of these cases were due to independent initiation events in the same central core cell 50 or to a split near the proximal end of the lateral 30 In phalloidin stained preparations of in and fy mutant heads we saw that early in lateral morphogenesis F actin accumulated over a larger fraction of the distal part of the cell than in wild type Fig 1I This wider distribution of F actin typically resolved into two or occasionally more actin filled laterals Fig 1J 1K On occasion we saw laterals in fy and in mutants that were branched distally Fig 1K In a wild type arista the lateral initiates close to but not at the distal most boundary of the cell On average the lateral is located at 90 of the way toward the distal edge of the cell Table 2 In in and fy mutants the proximal most lateral was located about 65 of the way toward the distal edge of the cell This was significantly different from that in wild type Table 2 When we made a series of timed observations of individual laterals in pupae we found that most cells formed multiple independent laterals at a similar time We also saw examples where laterals split during outgrowth Fig 2 The splitting was seen at a variety of stages from early in lateral outgrowth to as much as 8 hours or more after lateral initiation We did not detect any delay in lateral initiation or any notable change in the rate of lateral elongation in these mutants 17 data not shown As split laterals extended there was an increase both in the distance from the proximal end of the lateral to the branch point Fig 2B 2C and from the branch point to each of the distal tips This is similar to what we have seen with other mutations 18 19 That mutations in in and fy cause both independent lateral initiations and the splitting of single laterals during outgrowth was unexpected as the multiple wing hair phenotype produced by these mutations has been interpreted as an effect only on hair initiation 5 This result led us to reexamine in and fy adult wings and indeed we were able to find small numbers of branched hairs The presence of branched fy hairs was reported previously 15 Thus the phenotypic difference between the effects on laterals and hairs appears quantitative and not qualitative We next attempted to determine the critical time for in function in lateral development using temperature shift experiments with the temperature sensitive allele in II53 20 On the wing this allele results in a large phenotypic difference when pupae grown at the restrictive versus permissive temperatures We found that the phenotypic difference was not so dramatic on the laterals as at the restrictive condition approximately 55 of laterals were split or multipled while at the permissive condition about 35 were split or multipled This difference was still large enough to use for the shift experiments Lateral growth takes place over more than 18 hours at 29 C and more than 30 hours at 18 C giving us a wide window for shift experiments 8 In shift experiments we found that the crucial time for in function in lateral development was around the time of lateral initiation 26 hours at 29 C and 52 hrs at 18 C Fig 3 Notably temperature shifts in either direction even shortly after the start of lateral outgrowth had only minor effects on the phenotype These results are similar to those previously obtained on the wing 20 It is worth noting that in laterals will sometimes split 8 hours or more after the end of the in temperature sensitive period We suggest that this is an example where the consequences of a mutation are not manifested until some hours after the time of action of the gene On the wing single and double mutant combinations of in and fy result in a similar phenotype 5 This lack of additivity has been interpreted as evidence that these genes function and are required in a common process We compared the multipled lateral phenotypes of in and fy single mutants and fy in double mutants and found no difference consistent with in and fy functioning in the same process in lateral development Table 1 In the wing in and fy are epistatic to mutations in fz dishevelled dsh prickle pk Van Gogh Vang aka strabismus and starry night stan aka flamingo 5 21 This was also the case in the arista Table 1 The arista phenotype of mutiple wing hairs In the wing multiple wing hairs mwh results in similar polarity disruptions and a stronger multiple hair cell phenotype than in or fy 5 14 mwh aristae had almost 5 lateral ends per cell Table 1 Fig 1D The laterals were also substantially shorter than wild type 40 45 of normal length Thus in the arista laterals as in wing hairs mwh has a substantially stronger phenotype than in or fy At early stages in mwh lateral morphogenesis we saw multiple locations within individual cells where F actin accumulated Fig 1H At later stages these appeared as multiple independent laterals produced by individual cells Figure 1L 1M These conclusions were confirmed by time lapse observations 17 data not shown In addition we saw examples where a lateral split during outgrowth 17 data not shown There was no alteration in the time of lateral initiation in mwh although we did see a decrease in the rate of lateral elongation that was consistent with the short final length of mwh laterals 17 data not shown The short length and slow growth may simply be a consequence of the extreme multiple lateral phenotype as laterals that were only slightly branched were of relatively normal length In the wing all double mutant combinations of mwh and other fz pathway genes result in a mwh like phenotype 5 For the lateral phenotype we found that mwh fz double mutants resembled mwh as is the case in the wing Table 1 However mwh in and fy mwh laterals produced an intermediate phenotype in terms of the mean number of lateral ends per cell Table 1 Thus the relationship between in and fy and mwh appears different in the wing and arista presumably reflecting differences in the genetic circuitry in these two tissues The arista phenotype of fz mutants We did not see any obvious mutant phenotype in aristae from fz dsh pk Vang or stan flies Fig 1B In the wing mutations in fz and these other fz like genes result in hairs with abnormal polarity due to a failure to restrict prehair initiation to the distal most part of the cell 5 Only infrequently does this result in a cell forming more than one hair When we examined the development of fz mutant laterals by phalloidin staining we found that lateral initiation was not as restricted to the distal part of cells as is the case in wild type Fig 1F Table 2 Rather laterals formed at a wide range of locations along the proximal distal axis of the extended central core cells For fz dsh Fig 1G and stan data not shown the lateral formed at about 70 of the way toward the distal edge of the cell which was significantly different from that of wild type This was slightly more distal than we saw for in and fy but not significantly so Table 2 For pk and Vang mutants the average location for lateral initation was slightly less distal than in wild type 85 vs 90 and this difference was only marginally significant The position for lateral initiation in pk and Vang was clearly different from that of fz Fz accumulates asymmetrically in arista cells The initiation of wing hairs in the vicinity of the distal most vertex of wing cells is preceded by the preferential accumulation of Fz protein along the distal side of wing cells 10 To determine if the distal initiation of laterals was also associated with the preferential accumulation of Fz we examined aristae that expressed Fz GFP under the control of the armadillo promoter This construct is expressed at a low enough rate so that the subcellular localization of the Fz protein is still preferentially found along the distal edge of wing cells Strutt 2001 We found that Fz protein also accumulated preferentially along the distal proximal edges of arista central core cells Fig 4 This could be detected both before and during lateral outgrowth The ratio of the intensity of GFP flourescence on the distal versus lateral sides of the cells ranged from 1 7 to 2 4 in different aristae preparations This is similar to the ratio for Fz GFP that we have seen in wing cells The emerging laterals were found close to but not overlapping this region From our experiments we could not distinguish between preferential location along the distal edge proximal edge or both Based on analogy with the wing situation we suggest it at the distal edge of the cells In occasional cells that bulged out from the central core this appeared to be the case The distal accumulation of Fz GFP could be detected until late in lateral development At this time the cells become highly elongated along the proximal distal axis and it becomes difficult to assess what the distal edge is Fig 4 In the wing the accumulation of Fz at the distal edge of the cell requires the function of dsh 10 We examined aristae from dsh 1 arm fz GFP pupae and found that the preferential distal accumulation of Fz was lost Fig 4 The ratio of GFP fluorescence on the distal versus laterals sides of cells ranged from 1 2 0 9 Thus as in the wing the distal accumulation of Fz in arista cells is dependent on dsh function In the wing Dsh accumulates preferentially along the distal edge of wing cells 12 13 We found that Dsh GFP also accumulated along the distal edge of arista cells Fig 4 In the wing the distal accumulation of Fz is not dependent on the function of in or fy although in in and fy mutants the distal accumulation of Fz is no longer able to restrict hair formation to the distal edge of the cell 10 We examined the distribution of Fz in arm fz GFP in and fy arm fz GFP aristae The preferential distal accumulation of Fz was still present in these arista cells Fig 4 we obtained distal to lateral edge ratios of 1 7 2 0 although the in and fy mutant lateral phenotype was obvious Thus fz in and fy appear to have a similar relationship in the arista and wing There are a number of striking similarities in the morphogenesis of hairs laterals and bristles 8 Data presented here for laterals and previously for wing hairs 10 show that the asymmetric accumulation of Fz is prominent in these terminally differentiating cells Given these observations we might expect that this would also be true for bristles The bristle sense organ is a multicellular structure with the cells organized in a 3 dimensional arrangement making it difficult to observe Fz localization in all of these cells The socket cell that surrounds the growing shaft remains in the plane of the adult epidermis and is easy to observe in whole mount preparations of pupal epidermis The socket cell is also polarized in the same direction as the shaft as it is higher on one side than the other We examined the accumulation of Fz GFP in differentiating socket cells and found that it was asymmetrically distributed both early and late in bristle differentiation Fig 5 In most cells that we observed it appeared to accumulate on both the proximal and distal dorsal ventral etc edges of the socket cells We cannot be certain from these observations if it was accumulating in the socket cell or in the neighboring epidermal cells The level of Fz GFP appeared higher than in typical epidermal cells suggesting that we are looking at Fz GFP present in the socket cell The ratio of GFP fluorescence at high to low regions was similar 2 4 1 6 to what we obtained for wing and arista cells It was reported previously that Fmi Stan protein accumulated to a higher level in the PI cell that forms the bristle lineage 22 Previous experiments have shown that Fz regulates orientation of the spindle in the division of the PI cell of the bristle sense organ lineage and it has been thought that this is the way that fz regulated bristle polarity 4 6 Our observations suggest that fz may also play a later role in specifying bristle polarity that is analogous to its role in regulating hair and lateral development Discussion In wing cells the distal assembly of the hair is preceded by the preferential accumulation of Fz Dsh Fmi Stan and Diego along the distal edge of the cell 9 11 12 13 This provides a cortical mark that is thought to specify the proximal distal axis of the cells In these cells the region for hair initiation overlaps but is only a small part of the region where these proteins accumulate It is unclear how the cytoskeleton is activated in this restricted region One possibility is that a Fz receptor protein complex directly interacts with and activates proteins that stimulate the cytoskeleton to produce a hair Fig 6 In the arista we also see a preferential accumulation of Fz protein at the distal proximal edges of cells and this likely serves a similar function as a cortical mark It is worth noting however that the location for lateral outgrowth does not directly overlap with the location for Fz accumulation Fig 4 7 Although the lateral is formed in the distal region of the cell it is not juxtaposed to the junctional complex or lateral cell periphery where Fz accumulates Rather laterals in wild type flies form on the apical surface of arista cells Fig 7 8 Thus in arista cells it is unlikely that there is any direct connection between Fz receptor complex proteins that accumulate distally and the actin cytoskeleton of the laterals More likely in this cell type the distal accumulation of Fz and other proteins activates a signal transduction pathway that activates the cytoskeleton through a diffusible signal Fig 6 The JNK pathway which has been implicated in Fz signal transduction in the eye is a candidate pathway to be involved in this 23 24 25 We note that a diffusible signal could be part of the mechanism that is used to restrict hair initiation to a smaller part of wing cells than the region where Fz accumulates Based on the precedent from wing cells it is at first glance surprising that an alteration in the site for lateral initiation does not produce obvious phenotypic consequences 5 Pupal wing cells are relatively isotropic in terms of their shape in the planar direction The assembly of the hair at the cell periphery puts it in close proximity to the junctional complex perhaps allowing for direct interactions between the cortical and hair cytoskeletons 5 This could provide orientation guidance for the growing hair In a fz mutant where hair formation no longer takes place at the cell periphery this guidance would be lost Fig 7 In an in mutant where hair formation takes place at alternative locations on the cell periphery it would be incorrect Fig 7 Lateral forming cells are elongated in the proximal distal direction Fig 7 and laterals grow out at a large angle to the apical surface of the central core cells In this way wild type laterals resemble fz mutant wing cells 5 Thus early in their development laterals are not close to the junctional complex or the prominent cortical cytoskeleton at the cell periphery and are unlikely to be getting any orientation guidance in this way In a fz mutant lateral the location along the proximal distal axis of the cell is changed but there is no disruption of a close connection to the cortical cytoskeleton as there is in hair cells In the mutant there is no change in the dorsal ventral position for lateral outgrowth or the angle of the outgrowth to the apical surface In part this may be due to limitations inherent in a relatively large lateral growing out of a long thin cell It is also worth considering that the elongated shape of the lateral forming cells becomes much more extreme as development proceeds Fig 4 8 This brings the laterals close to the cell edges that are parallel to the proximal distal axis of the central core and the junctional complexes at these edges could provide orientation guidance Previous studies on in and fy function in regulating wing hair development have focused on their role in regulating the site for hair initiation 5 20 Observations reported in this paper show that multiple laterals associated with in and fy mutants can arise either from independent initiation events or from the splitting of an elongating lateral The splitting of laterals could be due to a need for in and fy function during the outgrowth process or to a need for in and fy function at initiation with the consequences only being manifested at a later time We carried out a set of temperature shift experiments to distinguish between these possibilities These shift experiments showed that the essential time for in function in lateral development is around the time of lateral initiation This is similar to what we previously found for in function in wing hair development 20 It is interesting that the consequences of a lack of in function in laterals are manifested some hours after the end of the in temperature sensitive period We suggest that in an in mutant there is a subtle defect in a cytoskeleton organizing center that promotes lateral outgrowth The defect is not severe enough to block or dramatically slow lateral outgrowth In some cells it leads to the formation of multiple initiation sites and in others to an unstable lateral that is subject to splitting A similar phenomenon could explain the formation of occasional branched wing hairs in in fy and mwh wings It could also explain differences in the hair lateral and bristle phenotypes of tricornered trc and furry fry mutants 19 26 In such mutants bristles and laterals are often branched In contrast trc and fry wing cells have a very dramatic multiple hair cells phenotype average more than 5 hairs per cell The multiple hairs are found primarily in clusters of independent hairs with only occasional branched hairs We suggest that there is a common defect in trc and fry bristles laterals and hairs Differences in the phenotypes would be due to inherent differences in the sensitivity of these cell types to the defective organizing centers The smaller hairs would be more sensitive to the defects leading to spitting during the initial stages of growth which would result in what appears to be a cluster of independent hairs The larger structures laterals and bristles could be less sensitive so that the consequences of the abnormal organizing center would only be manifested later in morphogenesis if at all Previous observations had indicated that the fz pathway functioned in the development of planar polarity in hairs bristles and ommatidia 5 6 7 14 Consistent with much current thinking on signal transduction pathways it has been suggested that there is a core group of fz pathway of genes that function similarly in different cell types 2 Downstream genes would function to interpret the signal from the core group of genes in a cell type specific way As attractive as this idea is a number of observations suggest that much of the fz pathway is modified in cell type specific ways For example the asymmetric accumulation of Fmi Stan in wing cells is essential for marking the distal edge of wing cells 9 However Fmi Stan does not accumulate asymmetrically in sensory organ precursor cell that gives rise to the bristle sense organ although the orientation of the pI cell spindle is altered in fmi stan mutants 22 Our observations on the arista suggest that the genetic circuitry of the fz pathway is modified in a different way in this cell type The most notable differences were the lack of a substantial phenotype in pk and Vang and that mwh is not epistatic to in and fy as it the case on the wing Conclusions In this paper we provide evidence that a modified version of the frizzled pathway regulates the development of arista laterals As is the case for the wing the asymmetrical accumulation of Fz protein appears to produce a cortical mark that is used to control where the cytoskeleton is activated to produce a lateral Materials and methods Fly strains Fruit flies were grown on standard media Many of the mutations were isolated in this lab and described previously 5 20 27 28 Several were obtained from the Drosophila stock center at Indiana University D Strutt kindly provided flies carrying the arm fz GFP transgene 10 and J Axelrod kindly provided flies carrying a dsh GFP transgene this construct uses the endogenous dsh promoter 12 Temperature shift experiments were done as previously 20 Cytological procedures Standard techniques were used In most staining experiments pupae were fixed in phosphate buffered saline supplemented with 4 paraformaldehyde Actin staining was done as described previously 8 using Alexa 568 phalloidin Molecular Probes For experiments where we visualized GFP we made an effort to use the minimum amount of fixation compatible with maintaining the morphology of the aristae Microscopy Confocal images were obtained using a BioRad confocal microscope at the Keck Center for Biological Imaging at the University of Virginia Other images were obtained using a Spot digital camera National Diagnostics on a Zeiss Axioskop microscope using bright field optics Length measurements were made using either the software provided with the Spot camera or by using the ruler tool in Adobe Photoshop To measure the intensity of GFP fluorescence we took maximal projections of optical sections and used the Psion port of the NIH Image software to analyze the data The tif images were inverted and the intensity plotted along an 8 pixel line drawn across the relevant cell boundary The background was estimated by the lowest reading along the line and this was subtracted from the highest reading to obtain an intensity measurement The same procedure was done for a line drawn along a low intensity cell border Multiple cells were scored usually 10 from the same projection averages obtained used to provide an intensity ratio Microsoft Excel was used to analyze the data calculating means standard deviation and plotting To measure the location along the proximal distal axes of arista cells we took micrographs of actin stained aristae where the lateral was small less than 1 3 the length of the cell and measured the distance from the proximal to distal sides of the cell We also measured the distance from the proximal side to the distal edge of the base of the growing lateral where it was connected to the central core The ratio of these two values is used as a measure of the location for lateral initiation Scoring of arista phenotypes Adult aristae were mounted in Gary s Magic Mountant and examined under bright field microscope In vivoimaging of the arista laterals Carefully aged pupae were washed and air dried In early experiments they were then attached to standard microscope slides with double stick tape or to shallow well slides using super glue In both preparations the animals were placed with their ventral side up Pupal cases were opened anteriorly At various time points they were examined by microscope under bright field optics in a drop of water using a water immersion objective 40 After observation water was removed from the slides and the pupae were then kept in a humid chamber at 25 C for further development and observations Most pupae tolerated the treatment reached the pharate adult stage and were morphologically normal More recently we built a chamber using rubber spacers double stick tape and a cover slip The pupae were placed on the double stick tape ventral side up and the pupal case opened A small amount of 10 gelatin 10 glycerol was place on the anterior end of the pupae and between the opened pupae and the cover slip Although the optics are not quite as good as with our earlier approaches the chamber approach is less time consuming and can be used for automated time lapse Statistical
