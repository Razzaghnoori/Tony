 Kissinger s Dream Comes True Peace hopes run highest in Germany where Die Welt and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung both led Wednesday with upbeat reports on the new flurry of diplomatic activity over Kosovo Die Welt quoted German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer as saying the next few days will be decisive The paper also reported strong speculation that German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping will be the next secretary general of NATO succeeding Spaniard Javier Solana who is expected to be appointed this week as the first foreign policy supremo of the European Union His official title will be high representative for European foreign and security policy but according to the Financial Times of London he is already colloquially known as Mr Pesc after the French acronym for the job In an editorial Wednesday the FT described Solana as an excellent choice for a position that requires both a sure footed diplomat and a super salesman It said Mr Solana will be the European on the end of the telephone to take calls from Washington a figure whose absence was always bemoaned by Henry Kissinger A front page report in the International Herald Tribune of Paris said U S officials are confident that Solana would help guarantee that EU military cooperation fits with NATO and does not challenge the Western alliance s primacy in European security Having apparently forgotten that only last week they ruled out Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic as a negotiating partner because of his indictment for war crimes most British newspapers were taking this week s Belgrade talks very seriously Crunch talks on Kosovo was the main headline in the liberal Guardian which said the discussions will decide whether NATO halts the bombing or launches a ground war Vital hours for Kosovo peace said the Times The Daily Telegraph noted that the European Union s negotiator Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari is the first Western leader to visit Belgrade since the start of the bombing campaign March 24 and that hopes were higher than at any time But the Independent s Kosovo lead was the killing of Yugoslavia s deputy air force commander Gen Ljubisa Velickovic in a NATO air raid It called this a success to be weighed against NATO s continuing blunders Another military blunder made the front page of the South China Morning Post of Hong Kong This was the death of 10 pupils during Indian shelling of a school in Kashmir As India s efforts to evict Pakistan backed Muslim guerrillas from the disputed territory entered the seventh day the daily Dawn of Pakistan led on Pakistani troops repelling three cross border raids that India denied had taken place In New Delhi the Asian Age led on a much criticized statement by Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes that India would consider granting the guerrillas safe passage back to Pakistan But Fernandes insisted that all those who have been pushed into our territory by Pakistan including their troops have to go back dead or alive The Indian press has generally advised against any escalation of the war and the Times of India ran an editorial Wednesday discounting a much reported remark by the Pakistani foreign minister that we will not hesitate to use any weapon in our arsenal to defend our territorial integrity Pakistan was crying nuclear wolf the paper said The nuclear gap between the two countries has widened in India s favor Pakistan s generals may not mind sacrificing a few hundred of their soldiers and Afghan mercenaries to Indian air strikes but they are not going to expose their own cities to needless risk Back to Kosovo The conservative National Post of Canada ran a tough editorial Wednesday saying that acceptance of Milosevic s position on the implementation of the G 8 peace plan would be little better than a surrender in stages Rather than attempting to dictate the niggling terms of peacekeeping Mr Milosevic should be obliged to negotiate on the broader subject of Kosovo s future as an independent state which has not yet been discussed at all it said The Times of London was equally tough Milosevic s purported acceptance of the G 8 general principles is meaningless in itself notable only as a hint of desperation it said in an editorial The only reason for the Finnish president going to Belgrade was to spell out exactly what Yugoslavia has to do to meet NATO s own clear demands in full But if Milosevic still needs more clearly to be told the truth is best conveyed by bombs and by the speedy reinforcement of NATO troops on the ground In Europe the other main stories were to do with food Le Soir of Brussels led with the resignation of two Belgian government ministers after a food scare over the sale of chickens and eggs containing high levels of cancer causing dioxins The story was given wide coverage throughout Europe with Corriere della Sera of Milan reporting on its front page that European Union authorities were planning the destruction of chickens and eggs from 416 Belgian farms and possibly also from some farms in France Holland and Germany that used contaminated Belgian poultry feed pellets In Britain a long running controversy over genetically modified GM crops took on aspects of a constitutional battle after Prince Charles defied Prime Minister Tony Blair by publishing an article Tuesday in the Daily Mail criticizing the regulations governing their production Blair has repeatedly insisted that genetically modified foods are safe but the heir to the throne attacked the lack of independent scientific research and said the regulations were not tough enough The Times reported that Prince Charles is infuriated by government efforts to portray anti GM campaigners as hysterics As a patron of the Soil Association which campaigns for organic food the prince is also said to be upset by an article written by the government s chief scientific adviser saying the Soil Association was run by ayatollahs as a theological movement China s Wenhui Daily reported Tuesday that Sang Lan the Chinese gymnast paralyzed at last year s Goodwill Games in New York has accused CNN of failing to help her Sang said the organizers Turner Sports assured her they would cover all costs after a highly publicized vaulting accident July 21 left her with severe spinal cord damage In the end they didn t produce a penny she told the paper
