                okay i work for a temporary service and so our benefits are a lot more limited than what you would have if you worked a regular full time job   umhum umhum umhum   we have to work a certain number of hours and then we get holiday pay and vacation pay and they if you   so do you you say you work for a temporary but do you work full time hours doing that   um i could if i wanted to id im not right now   umhum they but do they uh determine your benefits on whether or not you do work those hours or   um i have been yeah you like you have to work twelve hundred hours um within a year to get holiday pay and fifteen hundred hours within a year to get vacation pay so if youre not working enough hours to get that much time in in a year then you dont get the benefit   then they uh adjust it accordingly   yeah yeah you dont get anything at all     my uh husband works for a a large oil company and they uh and in the past has worked for a computer company and a bank so weve always uh   uhhuh   always had access to to good benefits as far as insurance and and usually some dental and life insurance and that kind of thing you know and   right yeah my husband has good benefits too or i probably wouldnt be able to do the temporary work   yeah exactly   i think medical is probably one of the most important things   i know uh here sometime back you know they had had had given him a printout you know of uh   to have   money that the company had paid into stock in his name and how much hed paid and um the medical benefits and whatnot that uh he was entitled to and they estimated those benefits at about forty percent of his salary   wow   even including vacation like you said and paid holidays and   umhum   and uh all of those things now some of those you look at and you say well im not going to need that or use that benefit but i guess its there knowing that it could be used if you   yeah those must be pretty good benefits ive heard that usually they average about thirty percent of your salary so it sounds like maybe his companys a little bit better   so chose yeah yeah i uh weve always been dealt fairly with that way and i would certainly you know caution any young person going into you know looking at jobs to make sure that they truly know what those benefits are and how theyre going to match up and it might be wise to take a lower salary or hourly wage if you knew that uh long term the you were going to get more of a profit sharing or you know or just you know   right yeah   whatever you know the differences in the you know in the benefits we belong to an HMO through my husbands work is do you is that the kind of medical you have   uh no fortunately we still have the its just regular travelers insurance that my husband has so we can go anywhere   umhum   i guess thats good i dont know uh i cant decide   well we uh we have five children so its been good for us to uh to have the HMO for the most part   oh yeah   were in a different one now than we used to be and its required some adjustment but i think it in the end it will all come out in the wash their uh mental health benefits are very very low and anything that is elective of in any way could possibly be conceived as elective is you know not covered so   uhhuh   if you have those kinds of services that while the general public may see them as elective you dont see them as elective     really   then uh you know uh you know you may not get the coverage thats you might have   yeah my husband works  for a psych hospital and i know that they sometimes have to discharge people before theyre really ready because their insurance wont let them stay any longer it frustrates him because theyll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then theyre gone   uhhuh thats right thats right and i know that that is a is a concern and if those people arent willing to go to outpatient you know therapy or something then that benefit is what what was paid is almost wasted   yeah really   and uh well i mean i guess you cant ever totally say that but you know the best good was not gleaned from the money spent where as maybe even two weeks longer would have made a difference there should be some provision for appeal or something i guess   right yeah yeah do you uh   need   does your husbands company have any of the new like a cafeteria plan where he gets to pick and chose any of his benefits   well yes i guess so you know uh but not uh not really you know therere there are some options in in every area whether its medical or uh you know insurance or you know as a stock you know savings kind of plan thats subsidized by the company and that kind of thing so   right yeah thats one thing i wish that we had was like a K plan or one of those things were they matched what you could save those are really good deals   umhum yeah yeah yeah we have been so grateful for that over the years because we uh uh that thats what our kids are going to go to college on i guess so   yeah   you know its good that   that or retire i dont think we can plan on social security taking care of us so   no i dont think so i think therere going to be too many of us our age for any way that that system can possibly even barely lessen the load we just better be those of us who can try to do something anything to put away for hopefully we wont have such a attitude in our country about elderly people not being able to work and not being smart enough to lend a hand by the time we get there too   yeah with what they say about how the populations changing i think attitudesll have to change to go along with that   yeah exactly so its going to were going to see a lot of changes in the next while   and thatll probably change the insurance benefits too as people get older and still work and   i would think so dont you think yeah   theyll need more health care   i know uh my motherinlaw has had to get individual insurance the last couple of years and shes seventy two   so   and uh its just been so difficult to get uh you know to get anything   yeah   but uh   does that just supplement like Medicare Medicare or   yeah yeah uhhuh uhhuh   yeah   like that so but you know i would say that overall weve been very luck and are very happy you know if if i had to   yeah thats good see i my husband been selfemployed and hes worked for uh like a small companies and now hes in a little bit bigger company so weve seen a little bit of every kind of benefit you can have   you kno w umhum yeah yeah i i work for parttime for a man whos selfemployed and gosh you know he and his family he doesnt do anything for me you know because i have what i need through my husband but uh it sure is rough for him its providing for his family   right yeah when we when he was self selfemployed and we had to get our own insurance to get maternity benefits was just ridiculous i mean you could you might as well have saved the money you paid every month and paid your own hospital bill at the end of the year or something   oh i know it yeah but you never know if you could have had that catastrophic thing happen to you know you or your baby where youd need   right   need somebody to jump in and take over those payments   yeah yeah its scary   yeah it sure is well i appreciate getting to visit with you   well it was good talking to you   take care bye now   you too bye
