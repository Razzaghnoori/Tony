 You can just answer them and feel free to respond however you want to OK What stories or books do you remember reading as a little person Little boy My two favorite books as a child was Curious George and The Jungle Book Curious George That was the little red monkey with the black and white Yes Did you have that doll No I didn t have the doll I just had the books Who told did did is that story your mom read to you or did you like My mom started reading it to me when I was small and and I picked it up on my own reading and I enjoyed the illustrations as much as the book So you liked the pictures Yes Were they bright books Or did they have bright pictures They all had yellow covers and they were all paperbacks And they had just little uh cartoons Not vivid pictures just They weren t real bright colors were they And the whole page wasn t colored No It was just individual pictures of the monkey himself and his immediate surroundings The monkey I didn t like Curious George That s neat All right um well what about that book that your mama bought you that time that she told briefly that story That book that she bought called In One Light That s why I have such fond memories of The Jungle Book Because she purchased a book for me and my brother and um it was a publishing company that could add your names and your friend s names and family names into the into the plot of the story So you became a character And it really brought home um events of the book to you because it was personal and it was it was individualistic Who were you Do you remember what character you played I was just one of the jungle boys who went through and had interaction with each of the members of The Jungle Book There was the snake and the lion and the elephant I remember The Jungle Book but do you remember the book Little Black Sambo No I don t OK That was a story that I have fond memories of Who would you consider the best storyteller in your family The best storyteller would be my grandfather my mother s father Lemmie Lemmie Because he he grew up um one of six children and so that just adds to his storytelling and imagination and his he s always had interaction with people so that just adds to how he interacts with people now Do you remember any one particular story that he told You can t think of a story Not um right off I know the story he tells about well he s always telling about going to play music and how they d play when he was young So can you think of a story I can remember a story that really is humorous in a way because he always tells a story about how he used to double date with his future wife and my mother which is his daughter and my dad because unfortunately his wife passed away when when she was really young so So Eileen and him double dated with your mom and dad Right He would talk about how he would ask um he would always try to get my dad to end up paying for all four of them s dinner And how they used to ride around together some That that to me is just something It s hard to imagine your your grandparents double dating with your parents but you know that was a unique situation So he s always been tight Right Um how does he tell when he tells those stories like does he usually tell them at family gatherings How does he do it Most of the time it s during family gatherings He s always got a story to tell regardless if he sees you or if it s a family gathering He s got you know he s going to be the one that s got the one who is keeping the crowd up or or you know just being himself What about you What do you when we you and I since we are husband and wife when we have kids do you imagine yourself as that kind of person Like that kind of storyteller Like Grandpa George and Lemmie Do you see yourself like that Probably I don t know some to a degree Um he s probably the one person in my family who s like that The rest of my family is pretty laid back and goes with the flow So I think I d probably be a little bit of him yet a little bit of everybody else and I m not really one to steal the steal the show at gatherings or what have you If you were going to tell a story to your kids about your childhood what story would you tell It would probably all be sports related stories um because sports to me has been such a big factor in my life whether it teaches you the value of competition or the value of sportsmanship or the learning from mistakes of um in sports you are sometimes forced to make quick decisions and sometimes those decisions are not necessarily the right ones You may end up being thrown out of a game for something stupid you do Well I think maybe you are ah trying to preface some story about getting thrown out of a game Well um there have been times when me and my friends have gotten into a little bit of trouble But we d play our archrivals in a summer league baseball game Who was your archrival The team from the northern part of our county North Stokes and we were the southern part South Stokes And uh they had one pitcher in particular who didn t like us and he was scheduled to pitch that night and after I had been hit the third time and my best friend had been hit the second time we kind of decided that we were going take it upon ourselves to hit back Only not with baseballs but with fists so we charged the mound Um so you know things like that are learning experiences where you learn to grow up and mature So what you going to tell your kid if someone from away hits them three times with a baseball Charge the mound I ve been there and I know what isn t necessarily the right decision What about what is your worst memory not your worst as in bad but just the worst kind of memorable memory you have about playing sports all through your life Well the good thing about sports is you can remember one thing that occurs or it or it can be a collection of memories And a lot what I have are a collection of memories because when you play for 21 years of your life in sports like I have um really what stands out is just year to year So many things can happen over the course of a year that or over the course of that many years nothing stands out in particular it is just bunch of fond memories OK we have a phone call We have an interruption OK sorry about that Uh back to the sports thing You were talking about how you just had a collection of memories Well if you had how do you think you got started in sports What was your family s connection to you in sports Like Jeff your brother and Denise and your dad and mom Well the funny thing is my parents were both athletic in high school My dad played baseball in school and my mom was the star basketball player Yeah with her hook shot With her patented jump hook shot But when it came to my older brother and older sister neither one of them part participated in sports And I wasn t um pushed by either one of my parents to play sports It was just the kind of thing where um in kindergarten or even before kindergarten it just it just came to me that I wanted to play tee ball and from there it started And after that I asked to put up a hoop in our backyard and luckily I had plenty of of children my age to play with and that used to be the ritual have the neighborhood kids come over to my hoop and we d play basketball and it ended up I was playing with a lot of older kids and so I developed an athletic ability through playing with the neighborhood kids in basketball and just starting so early and continuing on in baseball So it s kind of just evolved It wasn t something that was you know forced upon me So Jeff or Denise neither one you don t have any memories of playing with them in the yard I would play with them in the yard but they never played any organized sports My sister is quite older than I am so she and I as far as playing sports together you know that was few and far between She was dating when you were playing sports Right But my brother and I would play basketball in the yard or play baseball and we used to play a lot of kickball in our yard because we had a big yard and a lot of kids so we were always coming up with something What about hmm your daddy My dad would always play too um he was always just one of the kids Um because we had you know when I was 10 or 12 we d play against kids who were 14 16 and my brother was about seven years older and he would come out and play and so it was just kind of natural for my dad to fit in and play along And uh he was always good too and he was one of the reasons he made me good in what I was doing because he would challenge me Of course he was about 6 2 when I was growing up at 10 or 12 years old so he he would challenge me to get better Did he let you win Sometimes but not usually Um what s the best memory you have with your daddy and sports because I know your daddy s MS Well important to you Well they always say that some of the bad things are what stands out and not necessarily a bad thing but it is one of my best memories is ah Well my dad was diagnosed with cancer right before baseball season my senior year and it didn t keep him from coming to any of the baseball games though I can remember him just in in the months prior just prior to when he died it was like it took every ounce of energy he had to show up at the baseball games but nothing kept him from showing up Like I said you don t remember one thing in particular you remember things collectively and I remember that season collectively and him making that effort to show up at the games So it meant a lot to you that he did that for you Absolutely He always videoed all your games too didn t he As many as he could That last year I don t have any of those because he wasn t able to do it but all of my baseball and basketball games prior to that he wanted to videotape them for It kind of started out in a funny way It started out as Well if I videotape them and we take them home and watch them you can watch each tape and you can analyze what you need to do to get better And you can also show those to your coach and you know he can view the team and see what they need to do to get better But you know it just turned into something that I will always have those collection of tapes such memories Both hearing his voice on them screaming at the refs or screaming at me cheering and what have you So it s it s become something that been unique as a collection of tapes You said your daddy played baseball and that was the sport you were best in Yeah probably I mean relative to everybody else I was good in basketball but you know that can t really compare to Jerry Stackhouse or anybody like that When you add six inches to me it makes it a little bit tougher for me to compete But you are good at baseball Um I was decent I guess So is that going to be the sport you push on our kid I m probably not going to push any sport on our kid my kid although I have always said when I was in college and right after I gave up my sports career I always said my kid I m going to teach him more and work with him all the time But as I ve grown older and matured I ve decided I m going to let my kid be who he wants to be So if we have a Or she Or a she exactly Um well hmm since you know this I m interviewing you and you are my husband I want you to tell me the fondest story you have of me and you together Something that we have done Well it s kind of a of a defiance story probably One of the stories I remember most Your dad s always been real or kind of protective of you Yeah Especially when we first started dating and you didn t necessarily have the most reliable car of the people in NC Your little wrecked 84 Honda Accord wasn t necessarily the thing you were going to drive two hours away especially two hours to come and see me But um one of the things I remember was you putting it putting yourself getting in trouble and really probably wasn t one of the wisest things we have ever done Putting your personal safety on the line when you took off two hours up to my house against your parent s knowing I guess your mom may have known but your dad didn t know Yeah I think I told my mom And uh and we had a nice dinner and we went out to a movie and What movie did we see I don t even remember the movie I think it was Pelican Brief I just remember you coming up and that was one of the best times we have had And of course one of the things I remember most was going out to the Farmhouse which was our first official unofficial date And by our first official unofficial date should I go into that too Yeah You can tell that OK Well we ah I had just broken up with my girlfriend of on and off girlfriend of two and a half to three years and you were supposedly dating a guy in the Navy stationed in San Diego kind of a long distance relationship And my um fraternity was having a cocktail and I of course needed someone to go with since I didn t have a uh girlfriend at the time And all my friends said Why don t you ask Kristi Why don t you ask Kristi Because we had a bunch of mutual friends in the fraternity and Which one pushed you the most Morgan Collini Hum Morgy And um so we ended up going out but I didn t have any idea that you did have a boyfriend But I told them to tell Nobody told me And so I was looking at it as a date whereas she was looking at it as a a night out just to get out and do things I don t know I don t remember if you ended up telling me at some point during the night if you had a boyfriend um but it really didn t slow me down any I kept hitting on you kept trying to charm you I guess it got to you a little bit because we ended up eventually Eventually Yeah I told you I had a boyfriend on the couch remember You listened to the Christmas music too much maybe a little bit too much Um tell me uh about your Grandpa Willis because I don t know him that much Tell me something about him He was one of the most reserved people you will ever meet and ah he was 84 when he passed away and he was about 5 10 and he never weighed over a hundred thirty five pounds You take after him He grew up as a farmer a tobacco farmer and the thing about it is that he smoked non filtered Camels since the time he was 15 years old and he passed away at the age of 85 with the cleanest lungs but I m sure it didn t make the rest of his body too healthy But um but he was just an average hard working rural American With one child and he loved his one child dearly That s your daddy When my dad passed away in 1992 it wasn t long after that he deteriorated Um pretty much to nothing because he ah he had lost a major part of his life and it really brought him down but he didn t necessarily he wasn t one of the most talkative people If you talked to him it was like pulling teeth sometimes but he would do anything in the world for you Um he would always go the extra mile he just didn t do it with words he did it with actions Did you ever remember him playing was he a sports guy Did he play sports with you or anything Not really hmm he grew up on a farm and you know playing sports was um and he was so much older that I was he wasn t really in the best of health when I was growing up Um of course we would go up there every Sunday for Sunday lunch and uh he would get out in the yard with us and watch us climb trees and throw rocks and play but he never really participated because he was 70 years older you know 70 years older than I was So your grandpa was fairly old when you were born Right I didn t know that I didn t know your grandpa was a tobacco farmer Both of my grandparents were tobacco farmers It s the main economy in Stokes County is farming So there s no big towns whatsoever in Stokes County I know that you used to do that when you were little didn t you Yeah All of my neighbors and family members grew up on farms and and as a child in the summer when you weren t playing sports you were farming or working in tobacco to make money What did you do You primed the leaves you d chop it and you d plant it You know all the things necessary to raise the crop And then did you sell it I mean is that what your grandpa did Then the owners would take it to the to the tobacco warehouse and then they would auction it off and sell it per pound And that s what their uh that s what their way of living was was to sell that tobacco Hmm that s all your grandpas ever did Well that s what they did until they became 55 or 60 years old and then my late grandfather Lemmie went to work in a textile mill as a supervisor and my grandfather Willis went to work in a furniture factory Industry Industry Industry industry came in there Um what about your um childhood with your brother and sister What is the funniest story that you remember with your brother and sister as a child I ve heard a couple but My sister was always the little tyrant She is 11 years older than me and my brother is 7 years older than me And during the summer when we were home from school and I was five or six years old when they were both still home She was responsible for making sure the house got clean and the chores got done and to make sure we played a part in that and of course she was going to make sure we did our part So she was the biggest slave driver I ve ever seen and my brother was always the rebel and I you know as a five or six year old I did what I could and she didn t really have a lot of trouble with me but with my brother being when she was 16 he was 12 so you can imagine what kind of battles they had She always had this thing about when we rebelled she would lock us in two separate bedrooms Well my brother s idea of rebelling was to escape out the window and run around And one day what he did was we got locked into the room I don t know what we did necessarily that day but he climbed out the window and was running around Which bedroom was he locked into He was locked into the front bedroom And you were locked into the I was locked into the back Which back Your back Well that doesn t really mean anything to anybody who s listening Well it does Me But anyway he climbed out a window and came by my window and my window was several feet off the ground so it wasn t like I could escape But he would throw rocks up to get my attention and he saw me look out the window and he was jumping up and down waving his arms and laughing because he was out and I was still in Well about that time he he jumped on a honeybee And and the first thing I saw him do was hit the ground holding his feet so he kind of got what he deserved that day Um showing off a little bit hmm base but they had their share of fights Did he get caught Yeah he got caught And got locked back in with a with a sore foot Well you were perfect you never did anything What about the hole in the wall Well that s a different story Huh Yeah that s what I thought All right uh what about um your mom Tell me some funny stories about your mom She doesn t really tell many stories about her childhood or anything My mom s got plenty of stories to tell I am sure The funny I think one of the most humorous things about her if you know my mom she s uh 56 now and to imagine her with this patented hook shot on the basketball team and uh the all star of the of the Stokes County Basketball League as a senior in high school is pretty funny And she used to demonstrate that for me too We would go out and we would play horse and she would kick my butt because she had that hook shot that nobody else could do In her high heel shoes In her high heel shoes Um well OK I guess that is probably about enough Anything else that you want to add to your interview OK thank you and now you are always on tape
