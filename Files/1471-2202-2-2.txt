 Background Although intense efforts are being directed toward the development of safe and effective viral vectors that permit the introduction of foreign genes into mammalian cells chemical transfection continues to attract interest not only because chemicals are less difficult to use from a technical standpoint but also because this form of gene transfer may prove less toxic and immunogenic from a therapeutic perspective 1 Synthetic vectors include cationic polymers such as polyethyleneimine PEI and polylysine as well as cationic lipids such as Lipofectamine 2 and negatively charged liposomes 3 The unique chemical properties of PEI underscore its potential as a vector for gene delivery For example PEI has a very high cationic charge density making it useful for binding anionic DNA within the physiological pH range 4 and forcing the DNA to form condensates small enough to be effectively endocytosed 5 which is the primary mode of the PEI DNA complex into the cell 1 6 7 Via the endosomal compartment PEI DNA complexes travel to the nucleus whereupon the plasmid DNA is expressed within 5 hours after the initial attachment of the complexes to the cell surface 7 Another property of PEI that makes it suitable as a DNA vector is its structure in which every third atom is a protonatable amino nitrogen that allows the polymer to function as an effective buffering system for the sudden decrease in pH from the extracellular environment to the endosomal lysosomal compartment This feature is important for the protection of genetic material as it travels to the nucleus 4 7 Over 30 cell lines have been successfully transfected using PEI including COS 7 cells 8 rat hepatocytes 3 human dendritic cells 9 10 and mouse mammary epithelial cells 11 Especially exciting is the ability of PEI to introduce foreign genetic material into fully differentiated postmitotic cells in vitro Such examples include mouse myotubes 2 and chick embryonic neurons 4 Lambert et al 12 also demonstrated PEI mediated uptake of nucleic acids in rat sympathetic neuronal glial cocultures in serum supplemented media In this report we describe the application of PEI in the transfection of postmitotic rat sympathetic neurons in serum free glia free conditions thereby showing the capability of PEI as a method for studying the effects of targeted genetic manipulation in a rigorously defined cell culture system In addition we show that foreign genetic material can also be introduced into human retinal neurons that are decades old Results Expression of galactosidase in SCG neurons Transfection conditions were optimized using cultures of postmitotic sympathetic neurons that had been treated with a DNA synthesis inhibitor to remove nonneuronal cells Neurons were transfected on the fifth day in vitro Three days after transfection galactosidase gal activity was detected in a subpopulation of sympathetic neurons Figure 1Aand 1B Labeling was present in both the soma and processes Labeled axons could be followed for many millimeters and growth cones were consistently labeled gal protein could also be detected using immunocytochemical methods and the labeling pattern was identical to that detected using X gal Figure 1C Another gene that is commonly used to identify transfected cells EGFP was also successfully introduced into sympathetic neurons using PEI Figure 1D As with gal EGFP was detected throughout the neurons including synaptic varicosities and growth cones Pretreatment of our cultures with cytosine D arabinofuranoside prior to transfection almost completely eliminates the presence of nonneuronal cells 13 To further demonstrate that the transfected cells in our cultures are neurons we transfected cultures with the plasmid encoding EGFP and then immunostained them using an antibody for microtubule associated protein 2 MAP2 a neuron specific marker Ninety five out of 100 EGFP cells were also MAP2 Figure 2 indicating that the vast majority of transfected cells in our cultures are neurons Those few cells that expressed EGFP but not MAP2 possessed a clearly distinct morphology from the neurons such as smaller size and shorter processes and thus were easily distinguished from neurons in subsequent experiments Transfection efficiency is dependent on DNA PEI ratio and concentration Consistent with previous results 4 8 9 15 16 we found that the gal transfection efficiency varied according to the ratio of DNA to PEI Figure 3 Peak yield was observed at a ratio of 1 g plasmid DNA to 5 g PEI concentration of PEI stock is 1 g l in 1 ml culture media producing 9 transfected cells As the number of protonatable nitrogens on the linear 22 kD ExGen 500 PEI polymer at physiological pH is roughly equal to 5 47 nmol per g PEI and 1 g DNA corresponds to 3 nmol phosphate groups this means that the peak yield observed was at a PEI nitrogen DNA phosphate N P ratio of 9 Thus the most suitable N P ratio for in vitro sympathetic neurons appears to be around 9 creating positively charged DNA PEI complexes 17 The percentage of gal neurons varied according to the total amount of DNA PEI complex added to the cultures Keeping the 1 5 DNA PEI ratio constant lower yields were obtained at 0 2 1 and 0 5 2 5 DNA PEI Figure 4 Toxicity increased at higher overall amounts of DNA PEI Figure 5 Kinetics of foreign gene expression Sympathetic neurons were transfected with gal plasmid and PEI 1 g 5 g ratio At various times thereafter 6 h 1 d 3 d 5 d 10 d 21 d cells were fixed and assayed for the presence of galactosidase activity gal neurons were detected as soon as 6 h post transfection Figure 6 a finding consistent with previous work 7 A maximum of 9 gal neurons were observed at 3 d post transfection with 1 5 DNA PEI followed by a progressive decrease from 3 d to 10 d During this time many gal neurons appeared to either die or cease expression of the foreign gene However the percent of cells expressing galactosidase at 10 d 4 8 was similar to the percent at 21 d 4 7 This suggests that the neurons that still expressed galactosidase by 10 d continued to do sothrough 21 d Therefore PEI mediated gal expression in a certain percent of neurons is persistent Co transfection of gal EGFP To determine how efficiently co transfection occurred with PEI we used gal and EGFP together in a 1 1 ratio with the overall DNA PEI ratio at 2 g plasmid DNA 5 g PEI ml culture media Neurons expressing EGFP were also found to express galactosidase Figure 7 23 out of 24 transfected neurons examined clearly demonstrated expression of both plasmids indicating that co transfections are reliable using this method PEI mediated transfection in cultured human retinal ganglion cells Cultures of cells dissociated from adult human retina were transfected with plasmid encoding EGFP after 1 4 weeks in vitro using the same protocol developed for sympathetic neurons A variety of cells were transfected most notably glia Figure 8A Smaller process bearing cells expressing EGFP were also detected Figures 8Aand 8B these cells possess a morphology that strongly suggests a neuronal origin Similar types of cells were able to express the gal plasmid as well not shown Discussion Our data demonstrate the utility of polyethyleneimine as a vector for exogenous gene delivery in cultured neurons Although the sources of the neurons varied widely in age and species PEI was nonetheless able to facilitate the expression of at least two foreign genes LacZ and EGFP in each of the experimental settings This finding underscores the versatility of PEI as a method for introducing genes into postmitotic populations of cells particularly as our previous efforts to transfect sympathetic neurons using lipid based reagents Lipofectamine and Lipofectin had been unsuccessful From a technical standpoint PEI is relatively straightforward as commercial preparations are sterile and ready for use There are however important factors to consider while striving for optimal results The first is maximizing yield and minimizing toxicity Although the reasons for PEI toxicity are not completely clear it appears to involve the disruption of the endosome lysosome complex 4 6 In our experimental conditions the optimal density for transfection of rat sympathetic neurons is around 30 neurons mm 2 in contrast to a typical culture density of 10 neurons mm 2 13 This allows for sufficient numbers of transfected cells and appears to lessen the PEI burden per neuron yet does not preclude detailed morphological analyses of individual neurons Another factor is the presence of serum Based on our unpublished observations rat sympathetic neurons that are transfected in the absence of serum show much greater toxicity than those in which 2 5 serum is temporarily added for the transfection process data not shown Furthermore the presence of serum does not seem to greatly interfere with the transfection process of either rat sympathetic or human retinal neurons although in other cell types it sometimes does 18 19 Rinsing the cultures immediately after centrifugation is also a critical step in mitigating the toxic effects of PEI Increasing the number and volume of rinses improves cell survival but decreases the yield of transfected cells data not shown Clearly such parameters must be tailored to the specific type of cell under investigation Altering the ratio of DNA to PEI also affects the yield In our neuronal cultures it appears that the DNA PEI ratio of 1 g 5 g or 0 2 which produces complexes that bear a net positive charge produces the highest yield This is in contrast to previously published data showing that positively charged complexes and neutral complexes produce comparable yields in lung epithelial cells 17 However considering that the optimal DNA PEI ratio may vary from cell line to cell line 19 this is not an unexpected finding Perhaps the most attractive aspect of PEI mediated gene delivery is the flexibility of the method For example a DNA PEI ratio of 0 4 also produces reasonable numbers of transfected neurons in our system meaning that the measurement of the DNA and PEI solutions need not be rigorously accurate for the transfection process to work The applications can vary greatly as well PEI may be used in conjunction with adenovirus vectors 2 9 11 18 19 and can be conjugated to various ligands for targeted gene delivery 10 16 or to minimize nonspecific interactions with blood when injected into the circulatory system 20 It also has been shown to be effective as a vector for in vivo transfection in the mouse brain 21 22 and lung 17 21 as well as a potential way to target therapeutic genes to tumors 20 Our results confirm the findings of others that show the possibility of transfecting post mitotic fully differentiated cells using PEI 2 23 In addition we show that adult human retinal neurons which have been fully differentiated as long as seven decades are capable of expressing foreign genes when administered in this manner As the eye is considered to be the most accessible part of the central nervous system any method of gene transfer that works on human retinal neurons in vitro presents an attractive avenue of research for potential in vivo applications Materials and Methods Tissue Culture Sympathetic neuronal cultures were obtained by dissociating superior cervical ganglia from perinatal 21 day embryos to 1 day postnatal Holtzman rats Harlan Sprague Dawley Indianapolis using previously described
