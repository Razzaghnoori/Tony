 The Kosovo Question For the past week President Clinton has been preparing to bomb Yugoslavia His stated reasons are that the Serb dominated Yugoslav government led by President Slobodan Milosevic is waging war on the ethnic Albanian population of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and that Milosevic refuses to sign a peace plan to which Kosovo s ethnic Albanian rebels have grudgingly agreed Persuading the American public to support U S military action abroad is always difficult because such action poses risks to our troops requires moral justification for American aggression and threatens to entangle us in commitments we will regret To win over the public Clinton is trying to turn those three issues upside down 1 Risk This is the big buzzword among opponents of the bombing Speaking to reporters after his meeting with Clinton Thursday Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott used this word five times in three minutes Another favorite phrase in the anti bombing camp is rise to the level Last month Democrats defeated the GOP s impeachment effort by persuading the public that the charges against Clinton didn t rise to the level worthy of removing a president Now Republicans are turning the tables arguing that the stakes in Kosovo don t rise to the level worthy of U S military action Some supporters of the bombing argue that the risk can be minimized But this is a losing game since risk is always more than zero The better answer is to reframe the status quo as a parallel option with risks of its own We must weigh those risks of bombing against the risks of in action Clinton said at his press conference Friday If we don t act the war will spread If it spreads we will not be able to contain it without far greater risk and cost You have to ask yourself what will be the cost and the duration of involvement and the consequences if we do not move I m convinced we ll be dragged into this thing under worse circumstances at greater cost if we don t act To put plausibility and punch in this theoretical argument Clinton cited Milosevic s past aggression and invoked images of slaughtered innocents Absent intervention said Clinton Milosevic will produce the same thing that happened in Bosnia refugees and further atrocities I would hate to think that we d have to see a lot of other little children die I do not believe that we ought to have to have thousands more people slaughtered and buried in open soccer fields before we do something To drive home his point that inaction like action requires justification and bears consequences Clinton distilled his frame job to a brilliant sound bite In dealing with aggressors in the Balkans hesitation is a license to kill 2 Aggression Opponents of the bombing depict the United States as the aggressor and protest that we shouldn t intervene unless provoked For us to initiate an action such as bombing Serbia is really an act of war Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles R Okla told reporters outside the White House Friday I don t think that we should begin bombing unless and until the Serbs really begin a very significant massacre Monday in the Senate Sen Kay Bailey Hutchison R Texas urged her colleagues not to let Clinton take an affirmative military action against a sovereign nation that has not committed a security threat to the United States Clinton has responded by casting the Serbs as the aggressors At his press conference he replied I don t think it s accurate to say we re acting first I think they have acted first They have massed their troops they have continued to take aggressive action they have already leveled one village in the recent past and killed a lot of innocent people He added that the Serbs had stripped away Kosovo s right to self government a decade ago Above all he argued that the Serbs have repeatedly violated a 1998 agreement with NATO in which they pledged to limit their military presence and action in Kosovo This he maintained is sufficient to trigger bombing The threshold for their conduct has already been crossed In the Senate Monday Sen Joe Biden D Del agreed Everybody forgets we are operating in the context of an agreement that Milosevic signed The Yugoslav government has flagrantly violated the limits stipulated in the October agreement Together these points reverse the aggression argument in two ways First they turn the immorality of aggression into an argument for punishing the aggressors i e the Serbs Second they shift the burden of justification from the pro bombing to the anti bombing camp The code word for this burden shifting maneuver is impunity As Clinton put it Friday We cannot allow President Milosevic to continue the aggression with impunity Much of the aggression debate revolves around the integrity of NATO Senators who oppose the bombing warn that it would pervert NATO into an aggressive organization NATO is a defensive alliance Nickles observed Monday on the Senate floor Never has NATO threatened to go in to another country that s not threatening neighboring countries not threatening part of the alliance to quell a civil war Advocates of the bombing interpret NATO s mission more broadly Defense they argue rests on deterrence which rests on credibility in threatening the use of force which rests on the use of force when challenged This argument is weakened by its abstraction but is bolstered by the fact that the Serbian challenge is in Europe NATO s turf After meeting with Clinton Friday Sen Pat Leahy D Vt told reporters that the question in Kosovo was Is NATO relevant Can NATO stop massacres right in their own backyard The United States if it s going to keep NATO relevant has to show leadership 3 Commitment Clinton s critics invoke the specter of Vietnam by warning against an unwise commitment to war in Kosovo Clinton can t dispute the principle of commitment so he turns it on its head We ve already pledged to use force he argues and now we must keep our word Ostensibly this commitment was made last year when the United States voted with its NATO allies to use air power if one side of the Serb Kosovar war signed the peace plan and the other refused After meeting with Clinton Friday Sen Joe Lieberman D Conn told reporters The president is resolved He s going to keep the agreements made with our NATO allies Just as advocates of bombing use the word impunity to shift the burden of the aggression argument to their opponents they likewise use the word credibility to shift the burden of the commitment argument Failure to make good on NATO s already delivered threat would undermine the credibility of NATO on which stability in Europe and our own credibility depend said Clinton Sen John Warner R Va agreed The credibility of NATO is on the line The credibility of the United States working with its European partners in NATO is on the line Sen Carl Levin D Mich urged his colleagues to support NATO and not undermine its united effort Clinton is trying to reverse assumptions not merely about what should happen but also about what will happen The White House mantra for the past week has been that Milosevic faces a stark choice Sign the peace plan or NATO will bomb you The last thing Clinton needs is a genuine debate in the United States over whether we re serious about that threat To shortcut that debate he is trying to lull Americans into assuming that we re objectively as well as morally committed that the bombing is inevitable He pulls off this trick by presenting bombing as the default course with a momentum of its own If President Milosevic continues to choose aggression over peace NATO s military plans must continue to move forward Clinton decreed Friday The questions posed before a war are always the same Should we fight Can we Must we Will we Philosophers and theologians try to answer these questions but smart politicians rewrite them That s not fair you say Neither is war For more Kosovo coverage click
