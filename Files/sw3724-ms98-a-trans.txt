        do work in a large organization now     um well i i work in a actually its sort of an odd situation right now but uh i have until recently been working in in a uh in a large organization   uhhuh   and i currently maintain an office still at at the place even though i i officially quit there a few months ago   uhhuh   but its its not really a large organization but uh nearly nearly five hundred people   uhhuh oh yeah thats pretty big     yeah how about yourself are you   i work in a hospital and i think probably there are about seven or eight hundred employees   thats uhhuh   i guess um the thing i was thinking about as i was pondering this question is um besides salary it seems that people if its a large enough place need to feel that their jobs an important one you know that they have the respect of their fellow employees and their boss   hum yeah not lost in the in the crowd huh   yeah yeah its its more probably an issue in a large organization than it would be in a small one   ooh yeah i i think it its probably the thing is that its always fairly obvious in a small one right because um yeah   right everyones so integral   yeah everybody knows what everybody else is doing and and knows that its its generally important   umhum upward mobility or an opportunity to grow and learn different job tasks is probably an important one but it seemed to me that the respect of others is probably real important too   but um umhum what what about what about uh advantages of large organizations i mean benefits and things   well i definitely think that health care packages and that sort of thing are probably gonna be easier to coordinate you know in a larger   yeah yeah when it when ive worked with a with i mean the the small things ive worked with really havent had any uh any consistent yeah or any any kind of quality package right i mean it just kind of leaves you on your own yeah i ive had my own little business and then ive worked for small businesses   really in health care uhhuh   and yeah the the the only ones that ive had large uh uh i mean ive had health care and and and other kinds of benefits with have been large organizations   uhhuh vacation and   also i work for the university and that thats a is very large organization and uh   and were those good um considering the the size of that kind of organization did you feel like that you had good benefits   i you you know relative to nothing of course you know i mean it it i think so um the question you know i mean its its its handy to have them i just had gotten used to just not having insurance benefits and things um   uhhuh uhhuh did you pay for them on your own or did you just go without   um typically lets see uh typically the myself i i was covered myself but my family wasnt you know i had to chip in to for them to be covered but it was pretty economical   umhum umhum   um especially relative to just buying your own health care package   right that really gets prohibitive   yeah and so you know so thats thats handy uh you know i think that it im amazed that uh of the one place i was working uh what they calculate to be their overhead uh because of benefits they figure uh i mean its something like thirty five forty or fifty percent of of salary   yes ive heard that too   and  which is which is pretty amazing   it is especially especially if you consider in some situations people might actually use that much hopefully they budget for that and it doesnt get used up entirely but   umhum   its its a lot i think that those sorts of advantages are nice i know um my benefits through the hospital cover my family since my husband works for himself out of our home and and and office thats elsewhere but he doesnt   umhum   he didnt really ever pursue individual benefits and i think it makes a difference to be able to have the security of an organizations benefits   i i think so yeah it really does um do you get other benefits besides health do you have life insurance and things like that   it it actually its interesting just this last week um they introduced what the nineteen ninety two package was gonna look like and while the life insurance that we have free from the hospital is limited to its uh ten or fifteen thousand   umhum   um they offered for the first time a life term that would be up to a hundred and fifty but you have to pay into it   right are   the rest of the package is pretty good its vision and dental and you know all the full medical   oh well umhum yeah thats good i I just had uh dental insurance for the first time uh from from an employer which i thought was was pretty handy really took advantage of it i think   yeah   um do are you finding that that uh the packages uh that your benefits packages are shrinking   you know ive seen that all over the bay area in San Francisco bay area at least and probably true in California i havent yet at our hospital weve kind of been waiting with baited breath were the only hospital that i know of that doesnt have uh   umhum   a partial payment or i dont know if you call it copayment or premium by the the consumer   oh uhhuh copayment uh uhhuh   so as as of this date  my husband and my kids are free because theyre dependents but i know a lot of other place like you were mentioning you know you pay if   right yeah i i mean i typically you typically pay for dependents and and not for yourself but i ive the you know my company the company i was working with really has has been um you know they dont wanna cut back benefits but on the other hand theyre real concerned about the rising costs and and sort of scaling uh uh you know keeping   exactly
