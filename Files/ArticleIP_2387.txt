 A Goose Step Guide to Dating We ve just been sent a memo telling us we re not supposed to talk to the media said the young male clerk at Barnes Noble when I asked if he was selling a lot of copies of The Rules Time Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr Right the slender much publicized manual of retro dating strategy for women But yes eyeball roll sigh grimace it s flying out of here There went my theory that the book s sales advertised as 800 000 reflected warehouse size orders from the same cabal that inflated the numbers for Ancient Evenings The Closing of the American Mind A Brief History of Time and many other supposed huge sellers that you ve never actually seen outside a bookstore Choosing my copy from a miniwall of identical pink paperbacks I figured I should probably abandon my fallback theory too which is that the only people who take the Rules seriously are journalists assigned to write about them Certainly the B N clerk a dating man if I ever saw one took them seriously It s all about mind games he volunteered scornfully I hate that book Mind games is right The thesis of Ellen Fein and Sherrie Schneider s book is that for women who want to marry lunacy is the best policy Women who take the initiative a broad category of behavior that includes most signs of life not to mention common politeness destroy male ambition and animal drive Men are born to respond to challenge Take away challenge and their interest wanes So become a Rules Girl Having first transformed yourself Rule 1 into a creature unlike any other radiant confident fashionable mysterious elusive quiet and if necessary nose jobbed don t talk to a man first 2 or too much 3 don t go Dutch 4 or sleep with him on the first date 14 don t call him and rarely return his calls 5 always end phone calls 6 and dates 11 first and never accept a Saturday night date after Wednesday 7 As you might expect from a book that mingles pop Darwinism with the Weltanschauung of Cosmopolitan the Rules can be a bit mysterious and elusive themselves you can t introduce yourself to your neighbor but taking out a personal ad is OK and how s a girl to square the whole project of conditioning the marriage averse man with Rules 17 Let Him Take the Lead and 18 Don t Expect a Man to Change or Try to Change Him You could see The Rules as a weird fantasia on the theme of Why buy the cow if you can get the milk for free But what sets it apart from say Dear Abby is the demented quasi military precision of the Rules Buy a timer and set it for 10 minutes when he calls Practice the rules on the doorman and the butcher let them say hello first to you If your beau fails to come across with a romantic gift for your birthday and Valentine s Day he obviously doesn t love you so show him the door Don t just read the Rules memorize them By the end of the book when you re being advised to join a support group to help you resist the urge to have a normal conversation with your boyfriend the whole enterprise has a distinctly cultish flavor Rule 31 Don t Discuss The Rules with Your Therapist The Rules isn t just about manipulating men it s about manipulating the reader too The eerie assurance with which the authors insist that the Rules always work and that any deviation brings disaster is strangely nervous making like one of those chain letters that alludes darkly to people who dropped dead after failing to pass it on Could it possibly be that my 13 year long marriage was jinxed from Day One because I called my future husband first and suggested coffee in his neighborhood yet instead of my own Actually no Life s much more complicated Sure men like a challenge but so do women And nobody likes to be challenged all the time I know plenty of long standing happy couples who slept together right away spent hours yakking on the phone split checks down the middle and lived together for years before the wedding The notion that female initiative is useless because men know what they want is particularly odd most people don t even know what they want for dinner Even odder is the notion that what men want is a woman who s always on her way out the door Since The Rules do not reflect reality what is their appeal and to whom Undoubtedly the book owes much of its visibility to the general mood of anti feminism and family values conservatism But to see its popularity as evidence of rejection of feminism by women is much too vague In the pages of The Rules men are a barely individualized collection of amiable dolts but the Rules Girl is a particular social type and it isn t the choosy free spirit lectured in such anti feminist self help books as Smart Women Foolish Choices The woman depicted as in need of the Rules is a voracious doormat the sort of woman who sends men Hallmark greeting cards or long letters after a single date who rummages in men s drawers and pockets suggests couples therapy when brief relationships start to crumble throws away a new boyfriend s old clothes cleans and redecorates his apartment without asking and refuses to see the most obvious signs of disengagement Her problem isn t too much liberation it s incredibly low self esteem For women like this The Rules might seem like a way of setting boundaries on a personality that has none of giving a sense of purpose and structure to a life that seems empty a recurrent word of offering women who fear they are worthless a way of acting as if they were precious a creature unlike any other in the hope that the pose may become reality Of course this is unlikely a motormouth cannot be quiet and mysterious forever timer or no timer and The Rules blithe assurance that Mr Right reeled in by your friendly light and breezy persona will accept your edgy insecure and engulfing true self is perhaps the cruelest fantasy in the book Although the Rules Girl is anything but Everywoman the world depicted in the book is unfortunately the one in which millions of single men and women live a corporatized and highly competitive world of office jobs and aerobics classes personal ads nose jobs and diets singles dances self help seminars and spiritual fads It s not a very warm or kind world or one with much room for originality or playfulness or waywardness or even what I would call romance Friends matter because you need someone to rent a beach house or go to a singles dance with Politics and volunteer work and books are just ways to keep busy between dates The Darwinian theme prominent in much of the discussion about dating just now reflects this world well men and women different by nature and with innately opposed interests each trying to exploit the other first You don t have to like the other sex you don t even have to like your lover You just have to need him or her for sex babies romantic gifts attention money acceptability in a society organized around the couple Indeed the subtext of The Rules is resentment toward men As the authors put it in their inimitable fashion T he man is the adversary if he s someone you really like Why He has the power to hurt you he runs the show When feminists suggest that men run the show any show they get labeled man haters and whiners But then feminists want to change the rules not memorize them
