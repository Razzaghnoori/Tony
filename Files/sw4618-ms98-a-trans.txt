        go ahead     uh have you ever been tested for a new job or anything   um no i havent but in my job im a nurse and we are allowed to be i mean you know this is the rules that they can do this anytime uh i dont know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested   so its just sort of um they can if they   they can if they choose to right   yeah oh okay   have you well what have you had any experience with it at all   um not really but ive always worked on a university level but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff   uhhuh and what do you think about that   um i dont i dont think theyre very accurate because i mean i know their lifestyles changed prior prior to the drug test and i know they changed afterwards   right right see i know of that too and i also know that things like antihistamines Sudafed things like that can really throw it off and you cannot get a job because of it and they may not tell you the reason why   yeah i i had a friend it didnt cause her any problems with her job but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen   uhhuh   but what it was was she had been using she had been um in the jungle and it was some Malaria medication and she tested positive for that   see and so it really is a dangerous thing that way because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didnt get the job and they werent told why but a lot of people say the reason why after you take a physical will be because of the drug testing or they would tell you or this person never use any drugs   see i always i thought they got you got called back if you tested positive for more test   but um you should because you should be given another chance or at least able to justify it or something i have real mixed feelings about it i dont know   how uh do you know how wrong they are are they i mean is there a margin of error   the accuracy i dont know i dont know but i know there are a lot of things that can influence them and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time   yeah   and if you could show that i i interviewed for a job recently and i was taking Entex   uhhuh   and my doctor gave me a prescription for it and he said this way if it were to make the drug test positive you have proof that your doctor ordered this for you you know and it didnt come up that i needed to do it but if this could happen to anybody and if they would just say oh this persons drug test is positive we wont hire them   yeah   you know then you could lose out on a job when really you didnt do anything   yeah and i im not so sure theyre that needed i mean   so i dont know yeah im not sure either the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it then they have the right to go ahead and prove it because they say they can spot check   yeah if youre using it while at a job i can see a problem but the occasional person then its almost like its almost an infringement of your privacy   yeah well it sort of is and this is it this im not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways you know as a health professional i wouldnt want somebody take care of me that was using drugs   yeah   you know so as a patient i feel well yeah we probably should be protected but on the other hand theres a lot of things i should be protected from it they dont test my patients for too so you know i guess you sort of you have to have trust some place along the way   yeah   you cant go around testing everybody for everything   yeah   so i dont know and i i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you i think that a company or a boss could use this you know they could keep on doing this to you or something i guess i can see where it could become a problem   and it its like it seems like now they have trests i guess they can test your hair and they can find out if you use drugs up to several years ago   really oh wow but maybe you shouldnt be held responsible for something you did several years ago   so i know   thats the other thing i mean a lot of a lot of people as kids or you know young people get into some things that they get out of later on and i dont think they should really have to pay for that forever   yeah theres a lot of things you do as a kid that you wouldnt do as an adult but   so yeah   you cant say it was wrong at the time   i think thats true yeah yeah so that probably wouldnt be too good either
