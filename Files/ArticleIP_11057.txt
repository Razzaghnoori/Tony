 EM MONICA EM The White House may have been in crisis all year but the events were less the stuff of great drama than of a farcical musical comedy Hey wait a minute let s put on a show The time November 1995 The House Republicans led by Speaker Newt Gingrich are insisting on their version of the budget President Bill Clinton is stubbornly rejecting it The Republicans have taken a bold option They will just refuse to pass a budget and they ll let the government shut down In the Oval Office BILL CLINTON meets with advisers LEON PANETTA and HAROLD ICKES and secretary BETTY CURRIE to discuss this development The Shutdown upbeat production number PANETTA The Republicans have positions To which they re clinging fast ICKES The president is just as firm The die it seems is cast PANETTA Without a budget passed by Congress The government will close All of the workers Will be sent home on furloughs CLINTON speaking Well wait a second not all of them We ll need to keep some essential personnel PANETTA The Army and the Navy Will need to stay in place ICKES Also those at NASA Who keep the shuttle up in space PANETTA We ll need to keep the pilots Flying in their planes CLINTON And here at the White House My staff should remain PANETTA speaking But even here at the White House some adjustments will be required CLINTON OK tell the ushers To take a few days off Tell the maids and cooks and butlers To go play themselves some golf We have to do without the clerks Let them all go home CURRIE What about the secretaries Who will get the phones CLINTON speaking We ve got to make sure the Oval Office functions with efficiency We can t afford the tiniest error PANETTA Aha I have it We ll bring in an intern We ll bring in an intern Someone who s an expert with a phone We ll bring in an intern We ll bring in an intern I assure you Mr President Your routine here won t get blown PANETTA ICKES and CURRIE solemnly agreeing The presence of an intern will ensure Your routine here won t get blown The advisers depart leaving President Clinton alone He turns introspective President Lonely a ballad CLINTON I ve got deputies and bureaucrats Who fulfill my every thought And soldiers sailors and Marines To fight battles I want fought There s no one who s got more power I m the leader of all that s free But if you subtract the flags and lackeys I m just Lonely I m President Lonely But I guess I ll just have to muddle through The cheers and applause are overwhelming But presidents need cuddles too The fawning adoration s pleasant But presidents need cuddles too Enter Betty Currie CURRIE Mr President The intern is here And she s brought you some pizza The lights go down When they resume the intern MONICA LEWINSKY is talking on the phone to her good friend LINDA TRIPP LEWINSKY Well y know I d seen him around like a lot And I know he noticed me So when they said they needed an intern to answer the phones I said Hel lo o o And then I had the idea to take him pizza TRIPP And then what happened What Went On upbeat LEWINSKY Then I led him on I showed him my thong I let him take a long and ling ring look I led him on He studied my thong And from that point I had the president hooked That night when I took the president some pizza I made sure that he knew that he could have a piece We went into the hallway by his study And dispensed with formalities TRIPP Oh please go on You must go on Come on girlfriend Spill spill spill spill spill Now go on Please go on Did Clinton let you say hi to Little Bill LEWINSKY His lips and mine locked in a kiss fantastic His hands roved freely neath my blouse I reached into the presidential trousers And he got a phone call from a member of the House So I went on While he talked on the phone I took a position before him on my knees And I went on And he talked on Though what the congressman heard was Please please please please please But then we didn t go on TRIPP You didn t go on LEWINSKY No he stopped me when he seemed upon the cusp TRIPP So you didn t go on LEWINSKY No we didn t go on He said he wasn t sure if I was someone he Could Trust The lights fade as the girlfriends engage in cross talk TRIPP Trust LEWINSKY That s why we didn t go on TRIPP That s so weird What did he think That you d go blabbin this to the whole world LEWINSKY I mean rilly Hey what s that clicking TRIPP It s just my gum LEWINSKY Oh OK As the relationship between Clinton and Monica continues some members of the White House staff become worried about the prudence of continuing the relationship with so much potential for scandal This song is a conversation between Betty Currie who though worried still thinks Monica is a good person and the rather stonier EVELYN LIEBERMAN Time to Go CURRIE They go back there They re just talking I m sure she has a very thirsty mind LIEBERMAN I don t mind a girl who thinks It s just what she picks to drink Betty it s Lewinsky s time to go CURRIE She brings him Little presents She really is a very thoughtful soul LIEBERMAN It s not the junk I mind as much As her up real close and personal touch I tell ya it s Miss Monica s time to go CURRIE She never comes When he s really busy Rarely is there anyone around LIEBERMAN Still the Secret Service wears a frown They shouldn t worry he pats her down But I m not kidding it s time for her to go CURRIE Maybe she would like the Pentagon LIEBERMAN Good idea don t wait CURRIE Studly guys work at the Pentagon LIEBERMAN Let s get Clinton s head on straight CURRIE He comes back From Easter services Soon she s bopping in the door LIEBERMAN Hallelujah He Is Risen Shouldn t inspire thoughts so sizzlin Yes it s really time for Monica to go Times passes Monica moves to the Pentagon but the relationship intermittently continues Meanwhile Paula Jones sues the president for sexual harassment and it seems clear that before long Clinton will have to testify under oath Two close observers of those developments are old friends Linda Tripp and LUCIENNE GOLDBERG who is friendly with lawyers for Jones and lawyers in the office of Independent Counsel KENNETH STARR One day Tripp and Goldberg talk on the phone Talk Talk Chat Chat sprightly GOLDBERG and TRIPP Talk talk Chat chat Two old galpals swap the latest word Talk talk Chat chat Two old girlfriends dish the latest dirt GOLDBERG I got tickets To the opera Bloomie s says I ve got 40 due I lost a filling At lunch on Thursday That s it for me Now tell me what s up with you TRIPP My friend Monica From the White House I m pretty sure what she s saying here is true It seems this Monica chick Has been sucking the president s GOLDBERG Oh that s sick TRIPP And the two of them are going to lie about it Too GOLDBERG Back up Linda Did I hear you rightly Clinton got into an intern s pants God this news is manna Linda At last our cause will finally have it s chance TRIPP Oh you re a dreamer Luci There ll be headlines then he ll pull off an Escape He ll spin the story he ll turn the tables GOLDBERG Unless you get that airhead down on tape TRIPP What GOLDBERG Unless you get that silly vapid trampy time bomb Down on tape TRIPP Oh one more thing GOLDBERG What TRIPP There s a dress GOLDBERG Hold on let me call Sparky Independent Counsel Starr uses Tripp to detain Monica A few days later the news breaks On the advice of his pal Harry Thomason Clinton flat out lies to his wife to his loyalists and to the public about the relationship I Never Have performance should build in tempo and intensity CLINTON You know I d like to answer questions An act my lawyers won t allow I ll give you more not less sooner not later I just can t say a word right now But I don t know why she d say these things Her head s full of who knows what But I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that n Starr has spent 40 million There s desperation on his face An utter waste of public money A prosecutorial disgrace All he s got is some recordings Made by a vengeful snitch I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that b A vast right wing conspiracy Is using her to beat on me They wanna torpedo my agenda They hate me and Hillary But I will never let them ruin Our dreams for a better world I tell ya I never had sex with that woman I never had sex with that Girl Months of investigation legal wrangling and public relations campaigning follow Starr s tactics come under heavy fire to which he responds Crossing the Line STARR It s true Monica asked to lawyer up Which Bittman put the lid on And I felt bad about her mommy s grilling Upon our little gridiron The Democrats and liberals Blast these tactics of mine But a man s gotta do what a man s gotta do When the president crosses the line He s crossed the line He s crossed the line Only a fool wouldn t stretch the rules When the president crosses the line It may have seemed like dirty pool To drag his people fore the jury We wasted lots of Vernon s time May have busted Bettie Currie His aides aren t the innocent bystanders As they claim when they moan and whine They won t say what they know full well The president crossed the line He s crossed the line He s crossed the line I d be a nitwit not to bend a bit When the president crosses the line The talking heads are accusing me Of laying a perjury trap But all it catches is lying men Honest men beat the rap There s people who say I m against sex I ve had sex It s fine But lying about it gets my blood up And the president s crossed the line I crossed the line I crossed the line Tell Steve Brill I ll leak at will When the president crosses the line After months of denials and futile delays Clinton finally testifies before the Starr grand jury and argues that technically he didn t lie Testimony snappy CLINTON Depends what the definition of is is Depends on the meaning of sex Alone together is literal nonsense Before you reach conclusions read your text Afterward he speaks to the nation admits doing wrong and apologizes though grudgingly CLINTON Inappropriate was the nature of our actions And believe me I regret the whole damn thing But inappropriate are all these personal questions The country doesn t need to know these things Clinton s enemies reject his apology and soon the House of Representatives begins the long process of impeachment NEWT GINGRICH here discloses his approach Bring em Down dark moody GINGRICH Mustn t seem to be too cheerful Mustn t overreach Must remember to seem unhappy That we re going to impeach Must remember to remain sober As we undertake this chore At the same time let s remember To pin some stuff on Gore Bring em down Bring em down Sure they were elected Twice in point of fact Voters obviously were bewildered To have made a choice like that Now like charging linemen We ll move in for the sack Bring em down Bring em down Bring em down The House votes to hold impeachment hearings But just a few weeks later the midterm elections which are expected to go the GOP s way are held Contrary to predictions the Democrats pick up seats and the GOP s obsession with scandal is repudiated Gingrich resigns and the practical chances of Clinton s removal evaporate As the show ends we hear from Starr Lewinsky and Clinton The People Have Spoken dramatic stirring STARR The election was held and the people have spoken I can t believe what they had to say I had Clinton boxed into a corner Looks like he s going to get away I spent four years and 40 million That s a lot of time and loot I made Clinton look ridiculous But the only scalp I got was Newt s LEWINSKY The election was held and the people have spoken I can t believe what they had to say My boyfriend is still in office And he might return to me one day You think perhaps that he will not want me For all the trouble I ve caused so far But he knows I can always make him happy With my thong and my cigar CLINTON The election was held and the people have spoken I can t believe what they had to say The removal threat is over Kenneth Starr should go away I tell you though it is a mystery I mean I m unfaithful and I lie I might be guilty of obstruction Yet my ratings are sky high That must mean I m a pretty good president Though how I don t think I know But obviously I m not Starr or Gingrich Which may be why they love me so Which may be why they love me so Curtain
