 Exit Andy Grove Time s Man of the Year announces he ll be stepping down as CEO of the most powerful chip company on the planet and the market doesn t even blink In fact investors send the company s stock higher What s wrong with this picture Actually the picture is just fine In fact in a curious way the market s reaction to Intel CEO Andy Grove s announcement is the best testimony to Grove s managerial genius one can imagine For what Grove succeeded in doing at Intel was this He made the company stronger than just him His superfluity in that sense becomes the measure of his mastery To be sure superfluity overstates the case since Grove will remain at Intel as chairman of the board while Craig Barrett who will become CEO May 20 has already been running much of the company s day to day business as president and chief operating officer As chairman Grove plans to continue playing a role in shaping Intel s long term strategy presumably including its heavy investment in companies that are pushing the technological edge Grove s abdication of his throne also loses some drama from the fact that in recent years his public image has become that of a long range thinker rather than a hands on manager Especially since there s no Mrs Simpson in the picture Since Barrett was christened the heir apparent years ago the succession should go smoothly and all indications are that he s a more than capable executive Still Grove s announcement was certainly a surprise There was no hint of it in the press and he s only a couple of years older than Barrett though Grove has had a much publicized bout with cancer But there was nary a ripple of bad news out of Intel when the announcement was made and the sense of seamlessness that Grove and Barrett have projected has transformed the whole thing into an elegant passing of the torch ceremony In fact there s something invigorating about Grove s decision precisely because he s going out at the top of his game For most of his career at Intel Grove was if not anonymous then certainly overshadowed by Gordon Moore and Bob Noyce technological whiz kids who co founded the company in 1968 They were the visionaries he was the nuts and bolts guy In the last three or four years though after Moore s retirement Noyce died in the 1980s Grove was able to take on the visionary role even as he seems to have made a conscious choice to become a more public figure Magazines now wanted to know his thoughts about the future of computing and the Internet They became oddly fond of taking pictures in which his body was occluded by shadow while his face would be softly spotlit pictures that made Grove appear to be a mysterious man thinking very deep thoughts Which he probably was This transformation was also reflected in Grove s writing In the late 1960s he published an acclaimed engineering text Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices That one just missed getting on the best seller list In the early 1980s he published an exceptional book on management theory High Output Management which combined a sophisticated discussion of the way companies should be organized with a surprisingly convincing analysis of how to evaluate and motivate workers Then two years ago Grove published Only the Paranoid Survive which lays out a kind of Schumpeterian theory of major transformations in the business climate and tries to explain how to deal with them Grove s basic idea is that there are strategic inflection points moments where the entire framework in which business has been conducted is transformed and companies must adapt or die The arrival of superstores in suburbia the introduction of the stand alone PC the advent of talkies in Hollywood All these were strategic inflection points In each case those companies that recognized the changes and adjusted to them flourished while those that didn t floundered and eventually went under As might be expected Grove s description of past strategic inflection points is more convincing than his recipe for recognizing such moments in the future But what s especially striking is the way in which the evolution of his books from engineering to management to theories of change tracks his evolution as a public figure The Andy Grove of High Output Management couldn t have been Time s Man of the Year The Andy Grove of Only the Paranoid Survive could In that sense it s hard to see what more Grove had to accomplish as CEO of Intel The company s stock price isn t at its all time high but in every other way it s among the most productive profitable and acclaimed companies in the world It s fourth on Fortune s most admired companies list And without giving too much weight to Time it s not likely that a corporate leader other than Bill Gates of course is going to garner more mainstream attention than a Man of the Year cover Ted Williams retired after hitting a home run in his last at bat Grove s doing something similar except that thanks to the chairmanship he has the advantage of stepping aside gracefully without really disappearing Still there s a certain irony in Grove s ascent to elder statesman because the idea of him as shaper of the future makes it easy to miss how much Grove and Intel were products of what s now described as the corporate past Intel is not after all a virtual company It doesn t outsource all its production It doesn t have a brand name as its only real asset It doesn t have 10 people in its corporate headquarters running the whole operation It s not what management theorist Tom Peters sees as the company of the future a floating network crap game Instead Intel makes real things It builds enormously expensive plants that employ blue collar workers even if they are wearing bunny suits It invests heavily in research and development And it is hugely productive which is to say that it makes goods that are more valuable in a real sense than the sum of the various things that go into making them To say that Grove is a product of the past then is to say only that what Grove has done at Intel is more like what Alfred Sloan did at General Motors than what CEOs of Internet companies or Silicon Valley startups think they re doing today Intel s success under Grove though should give pause to advocates of this free floating no manager no employee just free agents new economy we re supposedly living in For what Grove has done exceptionally well is manage What has allowed Intel to dominate its many competitors who are perennially nipping at its heels with computer chips that are supposedly faster or cheaper is that Intel does a much better job of making chips reliably and efficiently And what has made Intel such a stable company over the past decade has been Grove s ability to plan for change and adapt to it while holding the overall framework steady The ease of Barrett s succession to CEO is the ultimate expression of this of course As Noyce and Moore did before him Grove led Intel brilliantly without making it dependent upon him He helped fashion an institution bigger than himself And that s why there s nothing at all wrong with this picture
