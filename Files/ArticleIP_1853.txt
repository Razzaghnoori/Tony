 Rep Bob Barr Rep Bob Barr R Ga is the id of the Republican Congress the rage beneath its tense smiles Republican leaders cower at Clinton s poll numbers too fearful even to whisper what they call the I word Barr meanwhile is furiously pushing impeachment For the past year the second term representative has been shouting out loud what many of his GOP colleagues only think that Clinton has betrayed the public trust that he has corrupted the White House that he s deeply sleazy and that he should go In November long before Monica Barr introduced a resolution to open a congressional impeachment inquiry Clinton reads its text has engaged in a systemic effort to obstruct undermine and compromise the executive branch And since Clinterngate broke Barr has been in a state of high gloat He s now preparing articles of impeachment and happily adding obstruction of justice and perjury to his list of Clintonian high crimes Barr has become what the Gingrich Congress was supposed to be After the 1994 Republican revolution tough tactics and rabid conservatism were expected to replace give and take and moderation But when Clinton outflanked them and Gingrich s ethics problems embarrassed them even the party s most intransigent ideologues learned the necessity of compromise Barr one of 73 members of the legendary freshman class of 1994 seized the opening He had campaigned as a run of the mill anti tax pro family rock solid conservative As the Gingrich crew weakened Barr repositioned himself The GOP leaned left toward Clinton Barr went right He advanced himself as the spokesman for the abandoned conservative fringes as an entrepreneur of right wing anger Barr can afford it He has one of Congress safest seats His west Georgia district used to be represented by the head of the John Birch Society and it voted for Pat Buchanan in 1996 You can t be too conservative for the Seventh District though Barr is giving it a good try He has attached himself to the usual list of silly far right causes no U S troops under U N command a two thirds majority to raise taxes a flag burning amendment etc But Barr s real genius has been igniting nasty fires over issues that Republican leaders would rather ignore He is more than willing to embarrass party leaders over matters of principle In 1996 for example the twice divorced Barr drafted the so called Defense of Marriage Act banning gay marriage Barr forced a reluctant GOP leadership to move the bill by whipping up support among conservative Christians With his usual light touch he blasted homosexual extremists and their deviant way of life The flames of hedonism the flames of narcissism the flames of self centered morality are licking at the very foundation of society The bill passed Barr the only member of Congress whose fondness for guns exceeds the National Rifle Association s also led the attempt to repeal Clinton s assault weapons ban The GOP brass wanted to leave the ban alone There is little upside to endorsing semiautomatic weapons But Barr s grandstanding threatened to mobilize the gun nuts against the party so Gingrich let the bill go to a floor vote On impeachment too Barr is happy to buck his party and speak for Clinton haters Philosophy Extremism in pursuit of Clinton is no vice Besides introducing his resolution Barr published a law review article on the history of impeachment and Clinton s fitness for it and wrote a glowing foreword to R Emmett Tyrrell s The Impeachment of William Jefferson Clinton Since Clinterngate broke Barr has been Capitol Hill s hottest interview All this has played brilliantly among those irked by the GOP s silence on impeachment He s a hero among conservatives who have felt abandoned by the Republican Party He s almost the only one in the House who is thought of kindly says Larry Klayman chairman of the conservative legal rights group Judicial Watch and fellow impeachment phile Barr like many cultural conservatives is flummoxed by America s continued affection for the president If the poll results are true and Americans really don t want their leaders to be held personally accountable then we are in pretty sad shape as a country he says Barr has the temperament of a Grand Inquisitor a moralist in a rationalist s body Barr is a former U S attorney and his prosecutorial zeal is notorious He interrogates hostile read liberal witnesses with a chilliness that astonishes congressional staffers He never smiles when a frown will do never skips a chance to seize the moral high ground At a recent hearing on partial birth abortion Barr told a pro choice witness that she and her allies were very hardened very cold very callous and have developed I m sad to say a moral blind spot Democrats say exactly the same thing about Barr himself The family values defender is not only twice divorced but has also been sued for child support He was also once photographed licking whipped cream off a buxom woman s breasts It was at a charity fund raiser he says and he did it to raise 200 for leukemia research Part of the Democrats dislike of Barr undoubtedly stems from annoyance with his persistence and effectiveness But part of it is personal Even his admirers admit he s dour and humorless His enemies use words like mean and heartless House Judiciary Committee staffers can t recall a single occasion on which Barr cooperated with Democrats During last month s State of the Union address every member of Congress Republican and Democratic rose repeatedly to give Clinton standing ovations Except Bob Barr He sat glaring and silent through the entire speech It would be a mistake to confuse Barr s skill at setting fires with real power He has gathered only 20 co sponsors for his impeachment resolution almost all of them GOP wing nuts One Rep Sam Johnson R Texas has suggested that Clinton be court martialed for his treatment of Paula Jones Another co sponsor Rep Helen Chenoweth R Idaho belongs to the black helicopter school of government The Republicans who hold real power keep Barr at a distance House Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon R N Y has so far refused to schedule a hearing on Barr s resolution A spokesman for the Judiciary Committee scoffs at the idea that Barr will introduce articles of impeachment to the committee House Majority Leader Dick Armey R Texas has compared Barr to former Rep Henry Gonzalez the nuttiest most obsessive Democrat of the last generation If impeachment hearings do occur it will be because Gingrich and his lieutenants favor them not because Barr does Barr who s a champion publicity hound has national ambitions During Clinterngate some admirers have begun comparing him to Newt Gingrich his fellow Georgia Republican Barr throws Molotov cocktails from the back benches just as Gingrich once did Gingrich rose to fame by destroying a powerful Democrat House Speaker Jim Wright Barr is making his name by trying to topple Clinton Gingrich rejected the timidity of Republican leaders and held himself out as the true conservative champion so does Barr Barr too may hope to ride right wing indignation to national power but don t count on it Gingrich may have been a vicious partisan but he is also sunny of temperament cooperative optimistic Barr is none of these You can t rule Congress with a glower
