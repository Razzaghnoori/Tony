 Connection Trouble A plaintive Cassandra No Richard more a disappointed Eeyore My last response wasn t lamenting the end of cyberspace It was lamenting the failure to connect What baffles me is your refusal to engage an argument that I have made any argument either in this exchange or from the book But you won t You attack what I seem to be saying or what I must assume Why not attack what I say For example You say my first problem is that I cannot distinguish between a change and a problem and then you go on to argue that real space law will be carried over to the Net as needed But where have I ever said anything different My argument is against those who say law won t be needed and shouldn t be used You ask why should we worry if the ACLU and the Christian right have their gates to filter information so long as they don t impose their will on individuals who do not join their cause But it was precisely my point that the PICS architecture enables the imposition on those who do not join their cause So are you agreeing with me Or disagreeing with me Or just not hearing me You say Larry seems to think that public and private controls are the same Where have I ever said anything like that Obviously they are both controls Obviously they are differentially dangerous depending upon the context What words have I uttered to conflict with these obvious banalities You rightfully report my lament at the displacement of an embedded First Amendment and then quote my argument about the increasing power of government to zone cyberspace But then you chide me that the painfully obvious answer to my lament is that these changes won t come if that kind of restriction violates the First Amendment But Richard look at what I wrote The section you quote was not talking about the First Amendment it was talking about the consequences of increasing identification The point was that this affected the commons not only as you said the gated communities My argument about the First Amendment comes three paragraphs later and about filters not IDs Whatever protection this local ordinance of a First Amendment has against filters it has painfully little protection against IDs And then you close by saying that your view is that the standard set of legal techniques carry over well to this new environment and that nothing about the Internet no special brand of cyberspace liberty changes these fundamental relationships and the problems they pose And I m again just at a loss what does this have to do with anything I said Much of my book is about how to translate legal values from real space to cyberspace So what do you believe you are arguing against In every case for some reason I can t get you to focus on arguments that I actually make either here or in the book I say commerce is changing the character of the Net you say you don t get it I say it is changing the Net by changing the architecture you say it won t affect the commons only the gated communities and side by side networks I show three ways in which it is changing the commons not the private networks you respond with a string of banalities that have nothing to do with the commons or my point You run but you will not hide Instead you say more and more that connects less and less I have tried to sell a message it is true I am grateful to those who have read it I m not sure it is right in ways I hope it is wrong and in the end Richard you might be right It might just not add up But you d be a bit more convincing in selling that message if you actually wrote about what I wrote It might just make the argument a bit less diffuse and hypothetical Be well
