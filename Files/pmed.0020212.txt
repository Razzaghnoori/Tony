 Research into the etiology of schizophrenia has never been as interesting or as provocative as in the past three years There has been progress on several fronts but particularly regarding the molecular genetics of this complex disorder of mind and brain At the same time a number of critically important and unresolved issues remain that qualify the ultimate clinical and scientific validity of the results However the recent progress in this historically difficult area of inquiry does not seem to be widely appreciated The purpose of this article is to provide a high level review of progress its limitations and the implications for clinical research and clinical practice The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear The median lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia is 0 7 0 8 1 with onset typically ranging from adolescence to early adulthood and a course of illness typified by exacerbations remissions and substantial residual symptoms and functional impairment 2 Morbidity is substantial and schizophrenia ranks ninth in global burden of illness 3 In addition schizophrenia is often comorbid with drug dependence principally alcohol nicotine cannabis and cocaine and important medical conditions obesity Type 2 diabetes mellitus 4 Mortality due to natural and unnatural causes is considerable and the projected lifespan for individuals with schizophrenia is some 15 years less than the general population 5 The personal familial and societal costs of schizophrenia are enormous Etiological Clues A substantial body of epidemiological research has established a set of risk factors for schizophrenia A subset of this work is summarized in Figure 1 Of a large set of pre and antenatal risk factors 6 having a first degree relative with schizophrenia is associated with an odds ratio of almost ten The general impact of some of the risk factors in Figure 1 remains uncertain and additionally migrant status urban residence cannabis use and biological sex are supported as risk factors for schizophrenia Although the attributable risk of some of these risk factors may be greater e g place and season of birth 7 the size of the odds ratio for family history suggests that searching for the familial determinants of schizophrenia is rational for etiological research Unpacking the Family History Risk Factor Studies of families adoptees and twins have been widely used to attempt to understand the relative contributions of genetic and environmental effects upon risk for schizophrenia These old genetics approaches use phenotypic resemblance of relatives as an indirect means by which to infer the roles of genes and environment There are many important assumptions and methodological issues with these studies 8 however genetic epidemiological studies of schizophrenia have yielded a remarkably consistent set of findings as summarized in Table 1 9 10 To summarize this literature briefly schizophrenia is familial or runs in families Both adoption and twin studies indicate that the familiality of schizophrenia is due mainly to genetic effects Twin studies suggest the relevance of small but significant shared environmental influences that are likely prenatal in origin Thus schizophrenia is best viewed as a complex trait resulting from both genetic and environmental etiological influences These results are only broadly informative as they provide no information about the location of the genes or the identity of the environmental factors that predispose or protect against schizophrenia Searching for genetic influences that mediate vulnerability to schizophrenia is rational given the larger overall effect size and lesser error of measurement in comparison to typical assessments of environmental effects Note that high heritability is no guarantee of success in efforts to identify candidate genes Genomewide Linkage Studies of Schizophrenia Modern genotyping technologies and statistical analyses have enabled the discovery of genetic loci related to the etiology of many complex traits 11 such as Type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity and Alzheimer s disease These discovery science approaches have been applied to schizophrenia and are summarized in Figure 2 The 27 samples shown here included from one to 294 multiplex pedigrees see Glossary median 34 containing 32 to 669 median 101 individuals affected with a narrow definition of schizophrenia There were 310 to 950 median 392 genetic markers in the first stage genome scans Hard replication implication of the same markers alleles and haplotypes in the majority of samples is elusive It is evident from Figure 2 that these studies are inconsistent and no genomic region was implicated in more than four of the 27 samples The Lewis et al meta analysis 12 included most of the studies in Figure 2 and found that one region on Chromosome 2 was stringently significant and several additional regions neared significance Our focus on first stage genome scans does not adequately capture the evidence supporting replication for certain regions e g 6p 13 18 However there appears to be soft replication across studies It is unlikely that all of these linkage findings are true The regions suggested by the Lewis et al meta analysis implicate more than 3 000 genes 18 of all known genes For the 27 samples in Figure 2 the percentages of all known genes implicated by 0 1 2 3 and 4 linkage studies were 42 35 14 6 and 3 respectively This crude summation suggests that linkage analysis is an imprecise tool implausibly large numbers of genes are implicated and few genes are consistently identified in more than a small subset of studies There are several potential reasons why clear cut or hard replication was not found With respect to the teams that conducted these enormously effortful studies it is possible that no study possessed sufficient statistical power to detect the subtle genetic effects suspected for schizophrenia For example it would require 4 900 pedigrees to have 80 power to detect a locus accounting for 5 of variance in liability to schizophrenia at 0 001 These calculations make highly optimistic assumptions and less favorable assumptions can lead to sample size requirements above 50 000 sibling pairs For comparison the total number of pedigrees in Figure 2 is less than 2 000 In addition it is possible that etiological heterogeneity different combinations of genetic and environmental causes between samples and technical differences different ascertainment assessment genotyping and statistical analysis between samples contributed however their impact is uncertain whereas insufficient power is clear If correct the implication is that Figure 2 contains a mix of true and false positive findings Association Studies of Schizophrenia Schizophrenia like most other complex traits in biomedicine has had a large number of genetic case control association studies 19 Although research practice is changing interpretation of many studies is hindered by small sample sizes and a tendency to genotype a single genetic marker of the hundreds that might be available in a gene For example a widely studied functional genetic marker in COMT rs4680 is probably not associated with schizophrenia 20 but nearby genetic markers assessed in a minority of studies may be 21 However as discussed in the next section a number of methodologically adequate association studies of schizophrenia appear to support the role of several candidate genes in the etiology of schizophrenia Similar to the linkage study data hard replication remains elusive Synthesis Despite the limitations of the accumulated linkage and association studies there are good suggestions that these studies have identified plausible candidate genes for schizophrenia Table 2 summarizes the evidence in support of a set of possible candidate genes for schizophrenia Reports supporting the role of many of these genes have appeared in top tier international journals known for rigorous peer review The evidence for several genes is encouraging but currently insufficient to declare any a clear cut cause of schizophrenia The accumulated data provide particular support for DISC1 DTNBP1 NRG1 and RGS4 Each of these genes has received support from multiple lines of evidence with imperfect consistency 1 The case for each of these as a candidate gene for schizophrenia is supported by linkage studies 2 The preponderance of association study findings provides further support 3 mRNA from each gene is expressed in the prefrontal cortex as well as in other areas of the brain and 4 Additional neurobiological data link the functions of these genes to biological processes thought to be related to schizophrenia For example DISC1 modulates neurite outgrowth there is an extensive literature on the involvement of NRG1 in the development of the CNS and RGS4 may modulate intracellular signaling for many G protein coupled receptors Moreover DTNBP1 and RGS4 have been reported to be differentially expressed in postmortem brain samples of individuals with schizophrenia This encouraging summation of work in progress masks a critical issue the lack or consistent replication for the same markers and haplotypes across studies The literature supports the contention that genetic variation in these genes is associated with schizophrenia but it lacks impressive consistency in the precise genetic regions and alleles implicated In contrast association studies of other complex human genetic diseases have produced unambiguous consistent and clear cut hard replication For example 1 in Type 1 diabetes mellitus the bulk of both the linkage and association data implicate the HLA region and INS 22 2 for Type 2 diabetes mellitus there are a number of findings in the literature where the association evidence appears to be consistent and compelling CAPN10 KCNJ11 and PPARG the data indicate that the same marker allele is significantly associated and has an effect size of similar direction and magnitude 22 the linkage data are less congruent probably due to power considerations and 3 for age related macular degeneration at least five studies show highly significant association with the same CFH Y402H polymorphism 23 27 in a region strongly implicated by multiple linkage studies For these findings the data are highly compelling and consistent and provide a solid foundation for the next generation of studies to investigate the mechanisms of the gene phenotype connection Power type 2 error appears to be a major factor if the genetic effect is sufficiently large HLA in Type 1 diabetes mellitus or CFH in age related macular degeneration or if the sample size is large then there appears to be a greater chance of hard replication At present the data for schizophrenia are confusing and there are two broad possibilities The first possibility is that the current findings for some of the best current genes are true This implies that the genetics of schizophrenia are different from other complex traits in the existence of very high degrees of etiological heterogeneity schizophrenia is hyper complex and we need to invoke more complicated genetic models than other biomedical disorders The alternative possibility is that the current findings are clouded by Type 1 and Type 2 error Schizophrenia is similar to other complex traits it is possible that there are kernels of wheat but it is highly likely that there is a lot of chaff At present the second and more parsimonious possibility has not been rigorously excluded The impact of Type 1 Type 2 error is likely and it is not clear why schizophrenia should be inherently more complex At present we cannot resolve these possibilities Public Health Implications The public health importance of schizophrenia is clear and the rationale for the search for genetic causes is strong Schizophrenia research has never been easy the current epoch of investigation into the genetics of schizophrenia provides a set of tantalizing clues but definitive answers are not yet fully established Findings from the accumulated literature appear to be more than chance yet sufficiently variable as to render hard replication elusive The currently murky view of this literature may result from the competing filters of Type 1 and Type 2 error The current literature could be a mix of true and false positive findings however it would be a momentous advance for the field if even one of the genes in Table 2 were a true positive result This body of work is not yet ready for wholesale translation into clinical practice However it is not premature to inform patients that this work is advancing and that it holds promise for new insights into etiology pathophysiology and treatment on the five to ten year horizon On a larger scale the treatment of the mentally ill mirrors the humanity of a society in many societies the return image is not flattering If a specific genetic variation were proven to be causal to schizophrenia this poor reflection might improve 28
