 there you go okay now i m sorry excuse me and uh i do that we recycle uh newspapers we take you know the Dallas Morning News daily and the Plano paper daily and you know after a month of that you got a ton of newspapers right oh i know it builds up really fast it really does i do recycle newspapers and uh glass yeah yeah uh huh we don t really have enough plastic to mess with we don t you know like we don t drink milk and we don t have children so we don t have you know six thousand plastic milk jugs a month you know yeah we do we have two a two year old and a three year old and so it really builds up with us yeah right but there is you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different uh container yeah and uh Plano has plans i believe it s tentatively scheduled for sometime in May of this year the city is going to leave uh receptacles at people s home and they can oh yeah that would be much more convenient yeah it certainly would and they can separate it and then the you know trash guys will pick it up yeah which would really be handy you know for people like shut ins or people who can t or don t drive you know they can t get to the these centers yeah or it just builds up so often yeah and i m sure rather than try to uh ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them you know yeah yeah but i think that s probably a good idea they used to have several places um that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn t profitable uh huh right so finally um they the people put so much pressure on the city they did a survey of everybody and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic uh huh uh huh and put it in front of the Wal Mart store in town and they they it just really every every every time you went by there it was just over flowing uh huh that s right and so Wal Mart complained uh huh yes so they moved it behind the store and nobody knew where it was and so people kept piling stuff in the same place where it used to be yeah great oh it was just like a dump there and so finally you know i called and they they said you know it was behind there and i started taking my things behind there i bet it was uh huh so we do that with because we have milk cartons you know constantly with two little kids and the paper but it just builds up it would be so nice if they had it uh huh sure you know at your home where you could just turn it in so they they final had enough of a response that they decided to try a small target area uh huh uh huh in one neighborhood and they have pickup there it s uh i think once or twice a week right uh huh and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out so they had not much participation and they were going to cancel it but then finally people started getting the message yeah it s just a matter of education i think yeah and i think that you know if they can get enough going uh huh they ll continue it you know throughout the rest of the city but it s not i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this and it s not going to be i don t think uh huh yeah yeah that s right yeah i think basically it s a good idea you know i hope it works yeah i do to because it s amazing how much you know trash we can generate i know this year we took our Christmas tree they had a place in the park where you could go have your tree shredded and they gave you a little absolutely absolutely right um seedling to plant you know you could take the the uh huh right mulch home with you you know and take buckets of that home so that was really good idea i thought uh huh sure absolutely and there s just you know the two of us my wife and i and it s amazing how much stuff just just the two of us generate you know i can imagine a family of you know four or five yeah oh yeah it s really it adds up so fast yeah it really does as far as new stuff to recycle you know i don t really i don t really know i really hadn t thought about it to tell you the truth yeah well they re working on diapers which would be great i ve read so many different things about diapers and now their saying that uh originally they thought the disposables were just awful that s right i was uh huh uh huh but now their saying that they re there really not that much in comparison to the others because you don t have to use the water to wash them and you know all different kinds of things too so that s right the the diaper service trucks apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver and drop those off uh huh yeah so i don t know what s the you know right thing to do but i really would hope that they would come up i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable but the landfill have to do something special you know for those uh huh i see but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too so oh i m sure it must yes you know i m not personally involved because i don t you know i don t have any children that wear diapers but i m sure it creates a large amount of you know uh refuse yeah yeah it does and you just feel guilty if you don t do something with them you know because you hate to contribute to the problem but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren t to great either that s right that s right absolutely that s right absolutely absolutely yeah i don t know what else they could recycle more of i guess we don t really use that many tin cans i guess there s some places where you can recycle aluminum but i don t know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff in i don t know if those are recyclable or uh huh i think they re made out of aluminum um yes there are there is a receptacle you know at the centers also for aluminum but again we don t we don t generate that much so we don t yeah yeah we don t either yeah we usually use frozen vegetables and things so we don t really have much of that but that s right that ninety nine percent of ours is newspaper and uh you know uh glass yeah well now when we lived out in California they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car uh huh or for aerosol cans and things like that because they say it s not safe to put those things in the regular trash uh huh that s right car batteries yeah yeah uh huh i don t you know i don t change my own oil so i don t i don t uh don t have that problem yeah well other than that i m not really sure we we try to recycle old clothes yeah uh huh yeah well we do to as a matter of fact our church has a place where you can take them and they you know pass them on to other families so right yeah yes we have one of those in town uh huh yeah yeah you know our church each year has a one of their major fund raisers is you know a garage sale and there s a ton of clothes always you know left over and i take those down to the uh oh it s called the clothes closet that s what it s called here in Plano right uh huh and they distribute them to the people that need them uh huh kind of like a Goodwill kind of place yeah yeah yeah that s that s real helpful too uh huh yeah well i m not sure of anything i can t really think of anything else that we could recycle no i can t either i really can t um yeah no i i really can t either okay okay well it was nice talking to you you to take care bye bye okay uh huh bye bye
