 October 1992 Dear Graduate As a graduate of the IU School of Law Indianapolis you are one of more than 5 900 alumni of the school Approximately 80 of the school s alumni reside in Indiana with more than 2 200 living and working in Marion County and the seven contiguous counties Our alumni are leaders in the bar business government and community affairs We can be proud of the graduates of our law school Unfortunately these are difficult times for public institutions of higher education Legislative appropriations are either flat or in the decline and tuition increases cannot make up the difference I therefore cannot overemphasize the importance of alumni support Last year only 20 of our alumni contributed to the school up from 14 in 1990 If the school is to maintain and improve upon its programs it needs our help This year the IU School of Law Indianapolis has initiated a Law Firm Campaign The Campaign is directed at law firms and businesses having 10 or more alumni The goal is to get each alum to commit to financially support the law school A precedent has been established by our sister school IU School of Law Bloomington Last year their law firm solicitation program succeeded in obtaining a range of 57 to 100 contributing alumni employed by participating firms For the same time period our alumni participation in similar firms was 31 to 67 We can do better Enclosed is a pledge card and reply envelope which you may complete and return to me by Friday October 30 Please show your support and make a gift Remember that as an Indiana resident you may receive tax benefits through the Indiana Tax Credit which is applied directly against the bottom line of the state tax return More importantly your gift to the law school will be an investment in the future quality of legal education at our school Sincerely
