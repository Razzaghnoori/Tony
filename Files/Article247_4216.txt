 Gems Amid the Sprawl Whatup It may not be a good sign to start off an e mail with a salutation from Martin Lawrence but what the heck Scanning the trail of emails ah it s good to be reminded of how stupid I am I notice that no one seemed to have mentioned that most movies these days take place in real time Maybe that s why I liked the animated stuff so much I didn t suffer booty fatigue or gluteal nerve damage after leaving the theater showing The Iron Giant There s a resolute quality to all of this cinematic sprawl that hurts filmmakers The second half of Topsy Turvy is the best thing Mike Leigh has ever done But the painstaking build to this payoff has people fleeing the theater in a blind rage It opens with a shot of an usher carefully checking a theater seat in the corner of the frame And sure enough we see the usher go across the whole row the entire length of the frame I didn t mean to suggest I had a better way of making The Green Mile I don t think it s a critic s job to tell filmmakers how to do theirs Though a recent New York Observer quoted a former boss of mine whining that I didn t write enough constructive criticism maybe I can start giving directors marks in citizenship and playing well with others And he wonders why I left the Detroit Free Press My point was that by skirting the issue instead of making a movie about racism they may have made a racist movie Getting back to The Best Man It s not a great movie But a lot of it is funny and Terrence Howard is better than anybody in The Wood which felt sitcomish and broad to me Howard brought weight and class to the picture it s a genuine movie star turn He ll be playing Muhammad Ali in a TV movie soon I do think that the influence of Godard has filtered into the current film scene Sarah Maybe not intentionally but it wouldn t be the first case of trickle down tribute to a director And Run Lola Run pays tribute to one of my favorite Godard quotes All you need to make a movie is a girl and a gun I hate to end my correspondence on an up note but I had a better time at movies this year than I have in years The girl who plays the younger sister in Election is nothing short of fabulous I hope someone gave her props There are shards of movies that stick with me The first half of Ravenous shows why Robert Carlyle deserves a film career That freakish doggie paddle he does before revealing himself is more unsettling than any of the hokey vampire film that follows Watching Matthew Broderick graduate from playing Ferris Bueller to Jeffrey Jones in Election brings one important thing to mind If Godard doesn t turn out to be the most influential filmmaker of the last year then John Hughes will Even American Beauty is staged like a John Hughes film It must be the eve of the millennium if I m thinking back fondly on The Breakfast Club Don t you forget about me Elvis
