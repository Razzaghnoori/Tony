 Background Gene expression profiling using complementary DNA cDNA microarrays is being applied for multiple purposes such as defining the taxonomy of different molecular subtypes of human breast and other cancers 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 and discovering biomarkers and therapeutic targets 11 12 A limitation of the use of this technology is that small specimens of human tissue such as obtained by core needle or fine needle aspiration FNA biopsies may not be sufficient for microarray hybridization using direct labelling protocols Typical microarray labelling procedures require 2 4 g poly A RNA or 25 50 g total RNA per cDNA microarray This amount of poly A RNA or total RNA can be obtained from samples of human tissue that weigh greater than 50 100 mg However core needle biopsies of breast cancers for example weigh in the 10 25 mg range and yield only 3 15 g of total RNA Small tumors identified using early detection strategies may thus be too small to excise a specimen with enough RNA for microarray analysis A pilot study by Assersohn et al 13 showed that only 15 of FNA samples from human breast cancers produced sufficient mRNA for expression array analysis One approach to low specimen RNA input has been to use indirect labelling techniques to increase fluorescence signal intensity such as with aminoallyl nucleotides Although less expensive we and other colleagues have found that indirect labelling techniques are not always reliable compared to direct labelling methods For valuable tumor specimen reliability is paramount A very recent report used amino C6dT modified random hexamers to prime cDNA synthesis in conjunction with aminoallyl dUTP and increased fluorescence intensity enough such that as little as 1 g of total RNA from cell lines gave sufficient signal for cDNA microarray hybridization 14 The reliability of this method with human tumor specimen warrants further testing RNA amplification techniques have been developed to address the need for sufficient RNA from tiny specimen for microarray hybridization Other examples of specimen requiring amplification for genome wide characterization of gene expression include purified populations of cells obtained by either flow cytometry laser capture microdissection breast ductal or bronchial lavage or microendoscopy Although one group has used unamplified total RNA extracted from 2 10 4microdissected cells for hybridization on 5000 clone membrane based arrays 15 most groups perform RNA amplification for this purpose 16 17 18 especially when using high density slide based arrays The most commonly used mechanism for RNA amplification is a T7 based linear amplification method first developed by Van Gelder Eberwine and coworkers 19 20 21 This method utilizes a synthetic oligo dT primer containing the phage T7 RNA polymerase promoter to prime synthesis of first strand cDNA by reverse transcription of the poly A RNA component of total RNA Second strand cDNA is synthesized by degrading the poly A RNA strand with RNase H followed by second strand synthesis with E coli DNA polymerase I Amplified antisense RNA aRNA is obtained from in vitro transcription of the double stranded cDNA ds cDNA template using T7 RNA polymerase Several protocols based on this mechanism have been developed and used in microarray analyses 16 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 In spite of the increasing use of T7 based linear amplification techniques in the study of human disease systematic evaluation of the fidelity and the reproducibility of amplification mechanisms has been limited Such information is important to determine how well the amplified sample resembles the unamplified sample and the validity of applying this technique to the study of human tissues A study by Wang and Miller et al 24 described a T7 based amplification protocol modified with a template switching TS primer used to theoretically generate a full length ds cDNA The gene expression of amplified total RNA from melanoma cell lines hybridized to 2000 gene microarrays was compared to that of unamplified total or poly A RNA using cluster analysis and determining the number of outlier genes between single experiments Approximately 3 6 of genes were discordant outliers when analyzed using 3 fold or greater expression ratios in at least one hybridization and compared between total RNA mRNA and different amounts of input aRNA Hu and co workers 27 compared amplified and unamplified samples using total RNA obtained from human glioma cell lines and 2300 clone microarrays printed with duplicates on the same array to evaluate a similar T7 based protocol with a TS mechanism adopted from Wang and Miller et al 24 Their results were based on nine microarray experiments and showed concordance between amplified and unamplified samples verifying four expressed and two differentially expressed genes using Northern and Western blotting and immunohistochemical assay Since there are multiple T7 based amplification protocols in use questions remain regarding the effects of differences between these protocols and how these differences translate when applied to solid tumors rather than cell lines on a genome wide scale A study from Incyte Genomics 25 examined gene expression of kidney vs placenta RNA and RNA from matched normal and tumor renal tissue using their own T7 based amplification kit not employing a TS primer and 9700 clone cDNA microarrays They found that a differential expression ratio cut off of greater than or equal to 2 fold produced excellent correlation between samples amplified with different amounts of input poly A RNA but that a 3 fold differential expression ratio threshold should be set for comparing ratios between amplified and unamplified mRNA Decreasing the input of tissue lysate increased gene expression discordance between amplified and unamplified samples As more human tissues were tested single round amplification produced a 200 to 500 fold yield lower than the 700 fold yield originally found in their study and lower than yields reported in amplification studies using cell cultures The differences between several T7 based linear amplification protocols are mainly the following 1 whether a template switching mechanism is used in the synthesis of second strand cDNA 2 what enzymes are used in the synthesis of second strand cDNA 3 how ds cDNA is purified cleaned up prior to in vitro transcription and 4 how in vitro transcription is performed Information regarding the effects of these differences on the fidelity or reproducibility of amplification should help eliminate both unnecessary procedures and those actually detrimental to amplification Determination of the range of input total RNA necessary to achieve reasonable fidelity and reproducibility is crucial for researchers dealing with very small specimens of human tissue To answer these questions and to define an optimal protocol for T7 based linear amplification we carried out a series of amplification reactions under different conditions using total RNA isolated from primary human breast carcinomas The amplified samples were compared to unamplified samples on high density cDNA microarrays containing 41 931 42 602 clones We evaluated the effects of TS primer in second strand cDNA synthesis DNA ligase activity in second strand cDNA synthesis column purification of ds cDNA and in vitro transcription time on the fidelity and reproducibility of amplification and the yield of aRNA The effect of diminishing amounts of input total RNA was also tested Results and Discussion Variation in cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression using unamplified poly A RNA In order to assess the reproducibility of microarray hybridization using standard methods poly A RNA was isolated from both primary breast carcinoma BC2 and Universal Human Reference total RNA Stratagene The BC2 poly A RNA labelled with Cy5 and the reference poly A RNA labelled with Cy3 were hybridized on five 42 000 clone cDNA microarrays 16 333 clones had a signal greater than 50 above background on all five arrays Three hybridizations were done on the same day using arrays from the same print batch and the average correlation coefficient between any two hybridizations was 0 97 0 01 demonstrating a high reproducibility between parallel hybridizations done on the same day Another two hybridizations were performed using poly A RNA isolated from BC2 total RNA three months later and a different print batch of microarrays The correlation coefficient between these two arrays was 0 95 similar to the average correlation coefficient of the first three arrays However when the unamplified poly A RNA arrays performed weeks apart from different print batches were compared the average correlation coefficient dropped to 0 89 0 01 indicating that experimental variations due to differences in microarray printing poly A RNA isolation and RNA labelling and hybridization contribute a small but detectable change in results In order to minimize experimental variations we created a virtual poly A RNA expression array that idealizes the gene expression of sample BC2 by using the average expression level of each clone over multiple hybridizations By expression level we mean the normalized log base2 ratio of signal intensities of Cy5 experimental sample to Cy3 reference fluorescence The idealized expression profile from the poly A RNA virtual array is used as our unamplified gold standard for data analyses involving BC2 The correlation coefficient between each individual poly A RNA array and the gold standard ranges from 0 95 0 97 similar to that observed between hybridizations performed on the same day The gold standard virtual array therefore represents well measured gene expression in the primary tumor and minimizes individual experimental variations Template switching does not affect the fidelity of amplification As previously mentioned a protocol based on T7 based linear amplification published by Wang Miller and coworkers 24 incorporated a TS mechanism 29 in the synthesis of second strand cDNA at the 5 end in order to generate full length ds cDNA This was speculated to be of advantage in the hybridization of unmapped sequences spotted on arrays and to enable higher temperature cDNA synthesis that would enhance sequence specificity However no experimental evidence was provided to support the idea that the TS mechanism increases the fidelity of amplification To determine whether the addition of TS primer improves the fidelity of amplification we compared gene expression profiles of aRNA amplified in the presence or absence of TS primer with expression profiles of unamplified poly A RNA Total RNA isolated from primary breast carcinoma BC91 and reference total RNA were amplified with or without TS primer using the Wang Miller protocol 24 except that aRNA was purified using an RNeasy kit Qiagen A virtual gold standard poly A RNA array was created for BC91 using the average expression level of four hybridization replicates of unamplified poly A RNA A virtual correlation coefficient for a given amplification protocol was obtained by comparing the virtual amplified array averaged expression level for each clone from multiple amplified samples to the virtual gold standard unamplified array for BC91 To determine the correlation between individual amplified samples and the gold standard an average correlation coefficient for a given amplification protocol was also calculated the sum of correlation coefficients of individual amplified samples with the gold standard divided by the number of amplified samples tested for each condition As shown in Table 1 using aRNA amplified from total RNA as reference the expression profiles obtained in the absence of TS primer correlated with the gold standard slightly better than in the presence of TS primer although the difference was not statistically significant When poly A RNA rather than total RNA was amplified as reference the correlation with the gold standard was slightly but not statistically significantly better with TS primer Table 1 The correlation coefficient using aRNA amplified from total RNA as reference is higher than using aRNA amplified from poly A RNA as reference regardless of whether TS primer is used This suggests that when total RNA from a tumor sample is amplified for microarray analysis the reference RNA should also be amplified from total RNA The yield of aRNA amplified from BC91 total RNA using different protocols is shown in Table 2 Assuming 1 of the total RNA is poly A RNA a 253 and 370 fold amplification was observed in the presence and absence of TS primer respectively The yield of aRNA amplified from total RNA which are generated from cultured cell lines was 2 to 3 fold higher than when the primary tumor total RNA was amplified data not shown These experiments demonstrate that the TS mechanism does not increase the fidelity of amplification and therefore can be eliminated from the protocol The reasons for the limited effect of the TS mechanism on the correlation coefficients probably are 1 the second strand cDNA synthesis primed by the TS primer probably represents a small fraction while the majority of the synthesis is self primed or primed by small pieces of RNA generated by RNase H and 2 adding a few base pairs to the ds cDNA prior to in vitro transcription does not change the aRNA significantly enough to affect the array hybridization DNA ligase activity is not required for amplification Amplification protocols that do not include DNA ligase in second strand cDNA synthesis generate the same length aRNA ranging from 0 2 kb to 6 kb data not shown as generated from a widely used T7 based amplification protocol developed by Affymetrix 26 which uses E coli DNA ligase The correlation coefficient between amplified and unamplified sample and the yield of aRNA amplified without DNA ligase are high enough to suggest that DNA ligase activity is not necessary for RNA amplification in microarray analysis For confirmation we omitted DNA ligase from the protocol developed by Affymetrix and compared the expression profiles of the resulting aRNA to aRNA obtained using the standard Affymetrix protocol that includes DNA ligase The correlation coefficient between amplified and unamplified samples is slightly higher in the absence of ligase Table 3 supporting our previous conclusion that ligase is not required for total RNA amplification in cDNA microarray analysis However the yield of aRNA is higher when ligase is used suggesting that ligase may play a role in improving the efficiency of amplification Column cleanup of ds cDNA does not improve the fidelity of amplification but decreases the yield of aRNA In the Wang Miller protocol 24 ds cDNA is purified using a Bio 6 column Bio Rad A drawback to this method is that the cDNA is eluted with a large volume and needs to be concentrated into a much smaller volume by lyophilization prior to in vitro transcription This is a time consuming step especially when large numbers of samples are processed To eliminate the lyophilization step from the protocol we used an alternative column the Sephadex G 50 column to filter out free nucleotides from the ds cDNA after completion of the second strand synthesis reaction The ds cDNA is then precipitated following phenol chloroform extraction and re suspended in proper volume for in vitro transcription The correlation coefficient between amplified and unamplified samples and the yield of aRNA using this less time consuming modification are similar to that using the Wang Miller protocol Tables 1and 2 We further explored the question of what effects the ds cDNA column cleanup step itself had on amplification We amplified total RNA from tumor BC2 either with or without the cleanup step of Sephadex G 50 Seven amplifications were done on different dates with the Sephadex G 50 column and five amplifications were done without this cleanup step Both the virtual and the average correlation coefficients using the column are slightly lower than without it Table 4 suggesting that the column cleanup does not improve the fidelity of amplification Moreover the yield of aRNA is significantly higher without the column purification of ds cDNA suggesting some loss of ds cDNA on the column Since the column had a negative effect on amplification by decreasing the yield of aRNA without improving the fidelity of amplification we eliminated this step from our protocol Effect of in vitro transcription time on the fidelity of RNA amplification To determine the effect of in vitro transcription time on amplification duplicate reactions were performed at 37 C for 2 3 4 5 and 6 hours Two additional 5 hour incubation reactions were stored at 4 C overnight to determine the effect of low temperature incubation on amplification The virtual correlation coefficient is slightly higher for the 5 hour incubation at 37 C Figure 1A However in vitro transcription for 5 hours at 37 C plus overnight incubation at 4 C gives the highest yield of aRNA Figure 1B Since the yield of aRNA at any time point is sufficient for multiple hybridizations we decided to use 5 hour incubation at 37 C for all subsequent amplifications Evaluation of the fidelity of T7 based linear amplification protocols To systematically evaluate the fidelity of T7 based amplification we compared the correlation coefficient obtained from four different protocols The correlation coefficients of individual samples amplified using different protocols with the gold standard range from 0 74 0 86 Figure 2 The scatter plots comparing the gene expression of the virtual amplified samples for each protocol with the unamplified gold standard are shown in Figure 3 with the virtual correlation coefficients ranging from 0 83 0 86 The differences in correlations obtained using different protocols are not statistically different by Student s t test demonstrating that differences in gene expression for samples amplified using different protocols are minor Our results also suggest that the level of bias introduced into gene expression profiling by amplification is relatively low expression profiles obtained using aRNA provide a close approximation of the true expression profile of the original sample To assess the biases of amplification quantitatively we calculated the number and percentage of genes with expression level change by 4 or 2 fold after amplification The biases of amplification by different protocols are similar Specifically less than 0 2 of 11 123 genes 12 15 genes changed their expression level by 4 fold or greater and less than 6 306 594 genes changed expression by 2 fold or greater after amplification With the Jeffrey lab protocol less than 4 of genes showed changes in expression level by 2 fold or greater Of the genes that changed 7 genes and 139 genes changed their expression in all four protocols in the same direction greater than 4 fold and 2 fold respectively Also the virtual correlation coefficients between different protocols are high average 0 95 Figure 3 suggesting that slight differences in protocols based on T7 linear amplification mechanism do not affect the correlation of amplified samples to unamplified samples These results suggest the conclusion that aRNA provides a close approximation of the true expression profile of the original sample We present here a components of variance model for explaining the different sources of variation in the amplification protocols see Statistical Appendix additional file 1 The expression measurement for a gene for a specific array protocol sample can be broken down as Additional File 1 Statistical Appendix Click here for file X Z e where X is the measured expression value Z is the true expression that does not change under replication and e is the measurement error that does change under replication While we cannot estimate Z and e directly we can estimate their variances from the data For the four different amplified protocols and the unamplified arrays the relevant variances are estimated in Table 5 The variance of the true expression Var Z ranges from 0 623 0 661 for the amplified protocols and is 0 726 for the unamplified arrays The variance of the measurement error Var e ranges from 0 055 0 102 for the amplified protocols and is 0 059 for the unamplified arrays The estimates of Var Z were obtained by averaging the pairwise covariances of the replicates within each protocol and the estimates of Var e by using the within protocol variance While the variance of a collection of numbers measures how much they vary about their mean the covariance of two sets of numbers measures how much they vary with respect to each other See Statistical Appendix for more details We notice that Var Z for unamplified poly A RNA is larger than all of the others indicating a dampening effect on gene expression by amplification Measurement error variance is lowest for the Jeffrey lab protocol The covariances between the different Zs for the different methods estimated from the virtual arrays are shown in Table 6 The off diagonal elements of Table 6are the covariances the diagonal elements are the variances of the virtual arrays We notice that covariances among the amplified protocols which range from 0 62 to 0 66 are higher than their covariances with the unamplified arrays which range between 0 57 and 0 61 Furthermore the variances of the amplified protocols 0 63 to 0 68 are lower than that of the unamplifed 0 74 This suggests the following further breakdown Z Zc Zs where Zc is a common expression component with variance about 0 6 and Zs is a specific expression component with variance about 0 04 for the amplified arrays and 0 14 for the unamplified arrays Therefore the amplified expression values for genes on an array are largely the same as on the unamplified array The component of variation in which they differ appears to be common for all amplified protocols and shows a much higher variance in the unamplified arrays The effect of amplification can be summarized by saying that it has a dampening effect on the true expression of some genes decreased variance in gene expression see Figure 4 A recent report compared amplified expression profiles of different primary breast tumors using Affymetrix arrays 30 Unger et al found that correlation coefficients between gene expressions in different tumors revealed by aRNA ranged between 0 71 0 89 However gene expression was not measured using unamplified poly A RNA from these different tumors raising the question of whether the observed fairly high correlation between diverse tumors was due to amplification bias To answer this question we compared the correlation coefficients between gene expression profiles of different tumors determined either with unamplified poly A RNA or aRNA amplified using our protocol Table 7 The correlation coefficients between BC2 and BC91 measured using poly A RNA or aRNA are the same 0 55 Moreover the correlation between differences in gene expression between amplified and unamplified samples for different tumors is weak Figure 4 suggesting that genes that differ through amplification depend on the sample rather than on systematic changes from amplification Our results demonstrate that different primary breast tumors are not closely related to each other in gene expression profiles and amplification does not affect the correlation of gene expression between different tumors Amplification is therefore suitable for comparison of gene expression profiles among large sample sets Evaluation of reproducibility of T7 based linear amplification Another important aspect of RNA amplification is the degree of reproducibility To evaluate this we calculated the correlation coefficients between individual amplified samples The correlation coefficients between individual hybridizations done on the same day for poly A RNA averaged 0 97 and for aRNA amplified on the same day averaged from 0 91 0 98 Table 8 The correlation coefficients between individual hybridizations done on different days averaged 0 89 for poly A RNA and 0 85 0 90 for aRNA amplified from total RNA on different days The reproducibility of our protocol is slightly better than that using other protocols Notably when samples are amplified on the same day the correlations are significantly higher than when samples are amplified on different days In addition samples amplified with protocols omitting ligase activity give higher reproducibility regardless of whether they are amplified on the same day or not The effect of the amount of input total RNA on amplification To determine the effect of the amount of input total RNA on single round amplification we amplified different amounts of total RNA 3 g 1 g 300 ng 100 ng 30 ng and 10 ng using different amounts of T7 primer according to the quantity of input total RNA Table 9 When the input total RNA is lower than 300 ng the yield of aRNA for is lower than the standard quantity required for one hybridization 3 g At amounts greater or equal to 300 ng the correlation coefficients between amplified and unamplified samples and among amplified samples remain about the same The fold of amplification increases with smaller quantities of template RNA but the absolute yield of aRNA decreases Therefore within the range of 0 3 3 g total RNA decreasing the input RNA does not affect the fidelity and reproducibility of amplification All original microarray data may be accessed at the RNA Amplification for Microarrays website http genome www stanford edu breast_cancer amplification Conclusions In conclusion T7 based linear amplification generates high fidelity aRNA for gene expression profiling using high density cDNA microarrays The average correlation coefficient between amplified and unamplified samples is 0 82 with less than 4 of genes showing changes in expression level by 2 fold or greater using the optimized Jeffrey lab protocol The correlation to unamplified poly A RNA increases to 0 85 when experimental variability is minimized by configuring multiple amplified samples into a virtual array Reproducibility between samples amplified with this technique is high especially when performed on the same day rather than weeks apart Amplification produces a dampening effect on gene expression variation Methods Tissue
