 The Merchant of EM Menace EM I don t think there s anything wrong with ethnic jokes per se Some of my best jokes are ethnic Like the one about the Jewish mother on a beach who screams My son My son the neurologist Is drowning Or the two Scotsmen who tuck 10 bills into their friend s casket and the third who swaps the bills for a 30 check But what about a sober drama featuring evil mercantilists whose technologically advanced robots enslave a peace loving nation and all at the bidding of a man known as Emperor Oh right the mercantilists also have slanty eyes wear long robes and talk just like Charlie Chan They attempt to hide their crafty schemes from the outside world by forcing the conquered nation to sign a faux treaty They are ruthless and cruel in their occupation When Michael Crichton wrote a Japan bashing film and novel back in 1993 called Rising Sun critics roasted him for exploiting racial fears But the racial stereotyping in George Lucas latest Star Wars epic The Phantom Menace is far worse and nobody seems to care Crafty Japanese trade villains aren t the only heavy handed ethnic stereotype in The Phantom Menace As the story continues the heroes slip past the evil Japanese to a nearby planet There they attempt to repair their broken spaceship but are stymied by the hook nosed owner of the local parts shop Watto who also happens to have a thick Yiddish accent To hear an example click Psychological manipulations that work on almost everyone fail with Watto Mind ticks don ta work on me only money he cries and the heroes get what they want only through the bravery of a gifted slave boy Anakin Skywalker At the end of the desert planet sequence Anakin is emancipated but separated from his mother who still belongs to Watto Even in a galaxy far away the Jews are apparently behind the slave trade And then there s Jar Jar Binks the childlike sidekick with the unmistakably West Indian accent and enormous buttocks Jar Jar is likable easygoing and dumb as dirt always being scolded or saved from death by the Jedi knights His stupidity and cowardice are running jokes throughout the film And his people the Gungan are a brave but primitive tribe who throw spears and rocks at the oncoming army in the climactic battle sequence Only Hispanics escape Lucas caricature which is actually something of a mixed blessing since Hispanics often rightly complain that they are ignored in the national race debate In fairness to George Lucas he gives Japanese traits to at least one heroine Queen Amidala and there is a black man Samuel Jackson on the august Jedi Council And true evil in this movie the so called Phantom Menace resides in a handsome white man Sen Palpatine and a towheaded tot Anakin Skywalker Darth Vader Until this last episode the Star Wars series has shown a happy multiculty universe in which thousands of sentient species coexist more or less peacefully This hardly gives Lucas license to revive racist stereotypes But it makes the latest characters seem like a lapse in taste rather than morals What s especially puzzling though is that film reviewers have by and large given Lucas a free pass A smattering of reviewers griped about Jar Jar Binks and the Village Voice was offended by the blatant ethnic stereotype behind Watto the hook nosed merchant insect But far more typical was the Time reviewer Richard Corliss who gushed the junk dealer Watto is a little masterpiece of design cinnamon stubble on his corrugated face chipped rocks for teeth the raspy voice of Brando s Godfather speaking Turkish Turkish Even without the visual clue of the hooked nose Watto s accent is clearly Yiddish not Turkish Or click listen again and you tell me Is Corliss crazy or am I
