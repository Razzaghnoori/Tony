 A Certain Slant of Light The visual drama of the Impressionist breakthrough into color and light has sometimes been dimmed in the frequent telling and retailing As you walk through the early rooms of the sumptuous exhibition of Renoir portraits at the Art Institute of Chicago the effect of following Renoir s career is like that of traveling through a tunnel You pause before the precocious Inn of M re Antony 1866 where dinner guests modeled on the peasant forms of Millet and Courbet huddle around a candle lit table Caricatures scrawled on the dim walls behind them echo their dark shapes We could be in the caves of Lascaux so gloomy are the grays and blacks of Renoir s early palette Then in a small circular room the first flickers of daylight In Claude Monet Painting 1875 Renoir s close friend stands in a darkened room in black hat and full bushy black beard but there s a wet blob of vermilion on the tip of his paintbrush and more of that red smeared on the palette in his left hand Renoir Monet and their associates in the Impressionist circle were beginning to find ways to leave behind the shadowy chiaroscuro of earlier European painting which they associated with a rural world now lost to modern experience You follow the crowd to the next room and all that was gray turns into gold the heavy leaden shapes dissolve in a shower of light The painting before you is the Metropolitan s huge Madame Charpentier and Her Children the sensation of the Salon of 1878 and the work that made Renoir s reputation as a portrait painter Madame Charpentier wife of a publisher reclines in her Japanese style boudoir Her daughter sits on the long suffering family pet a Newfoundland whose black and white coat comically echoes Madame Charpentier s elaborate dress Her son dressed identically to the daughter in pinafore and patent leather shoes joins his mother on the sofa The surrounding Japanese screens and mats are red and gold Seen on the walls of a museum Marcel Proust wrote Madame Charpentier will give a greater impression of elegance than anything since the great paintings of the Renaissance Of all the Impressionist painters Pierre Auguste Renoir alchemist of elegance had the humblest beginnings Born in the porcelain manufacturing city of Limoges in 1841 the son of an impoverished tailor and a dressmaker Renoir was apprenticed at age 13 to a porcelain painter in Paris whose firm specialized in imitations of Limoges ware The 18 th century rococo scenes that Renoir learned to execute with great skill dancers and performers and picnics in the country were a major influence on his later work Then at age 17 Renoir was abruptly laid off his paintbrush replaced by a machine Renoir s dazzling career as a painter can be viewed as his effort to prove the factory wrong As the art historian Robert Herbert has pointed out Renoir s famously feathery brushwork which according to one hostile critic left light like grease spots on the clothing of his figures was meant to show the mark of the hand rather than the mechanical finish of academic and salon art Renoir went so far as to write a manifesto in 1884 for a society of Irregularists to include such sworn enemies of mechanical perfection as painters decorators architects goldsmiths embroiderers etc but he couldn t muster enough fellow members A late painting like Christine Lerolle Embroidering 1897 with its complex weave of frames within frames is a veritable catalog of the craftsmanlike bric a brac Renoir admired the embroidery frame constructed of bamboo William Morris wallpaper a Japanese vase the rough hewed paintings of Degas and Renoir himself that the connoisseurs are inspecting in the background When Renoir s well off fellow Impressionists the aristocrat Manet or the banker s son Degas strolled through the working class neighborhoods of Montmartre they were consciously slumming They could afford to disdain commissions for portraits and to paint instead the class tensions of Paris predatory males and streetwalking women Renoir by contrast had lived by necessity in the slums of Paris When he painted the two girls in his wonderful Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando 1879 he was depicting members of his own social class In the background one can just make out the binoculars of an eager male viewer and the stripe on the trousers of an erect soldier but all our attention gravitates toward the innocent isolation of these two performers one of whom has gathered as many oranges thrown as tokens from the appreciative crowd as her small arms can hold The harsh social vision of Acrobats makes one wonder why Renoir s critical reputation has fared so badly in recent years particularly at the hands of such leftist critics as T J Clark who contemptuously dismisses the artist s boulevard pastorals On the occasion of the last big Renoir show a decade ago Art in America assembled a team of heavy hitters who took turns taking a swing at Renoir Peter Schjeldahl of the Village Voice called Renoir the worst artist ever to achieve canonical status art historian Michael Fried remarked that Renoir s native gift was perilously slight and critic Robert Rosenblum worried about the sugar content of his paintings Only Linda Nochlin whose contribution to the catalog of the Chicago show is an overview of Impressionist portraiture with almost nothing on Renoir used the Art in America occasion to say something serious and illuminating about Renoir s art noting that Renoir s men in such idylls as Luncheon of the Boating Party 1881 and Dance at Bougival 1883 both great paintings which blur the distinction between portrait and genre painting are in the Chicago show offer a masculine ideal counter to the male predators and businessmen of Degas and Manet Tough and tender at once these men are luscious peachy skinned and downy haired with heavy lidded eyes and yearning red mouths That androgynous tenderness is evident in Lunch at the Restaurant Fournaise The Rowers Lunch 1875 where we can t tell if the red daubs on the men s heads are ears or flowers Renoir s portraits of children which have a kindred prelapsarian innocence now seem the quintessence of cute To his contemporaries however such paintings as Child in a White Dress Lucie Berard 1883 and Girl With a Watering Can 1879 not in the show but hanging in the National Gallery in Washington D C were alarming Lucie Berard s father reported that the portrait of his daughter with its unorthodox coloring and swirling purple background simply frightens people away In this regard as in others Renoir has been the victim of his own success He banished the sentimental penseroso poses and the comforting twilit faces favored by the fashionable portrait painters he competed with His children too have emerged from the tunnel and they stare frankly out at us uncompromising and alone
