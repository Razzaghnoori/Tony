        anyway uh     how about you what do you do with your budget   what do i do um at the moment its utter chaos  um       right now im just uh i i dont really have a budget per se im i uh its called living within your means   uhhuh   you know which means at the moment um paying off the Visa bill and keeping everything else under control       and hoping the car doesnt collapse   yeah thats true   um but uh no i dont really have a budget at the moment um but i have uh i have uh rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month and then i dont  usually dont exceed that unless i unless the Visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another like if i have car expenses and then that that then it goes through the moon so   yeah that sort of a problem   yeah so um whatd you   were trying were trying to um so far we are in the clear credit wise but uh the other side of it is so not much on that side of it  to add to it were trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but   so you can afford to get a house   yeah wed like to do that some day we have this dream     yes   but we dont know how long it will be a dream we were kind of real were really happy that we dont have any debt but were at the same time were real scared about incurring it in this um economy right now so were stepping real careful and trying to see whats the best way to save what the little bit that we do get you know on top of expenses every month   yeah so what do you and your husband do   were missionaries actually yeah uhhuh   are you really   and um it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have uh like uh uh support quota   hm   and its cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here   no kidding   and it doesnt get switched very easily once you come home   i see so overseas where would you be going   so Africa Nigeria   really   yeah   really how long would you be there   about four years were career so we we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year we go over four we come back for a year   with with what church   um were with Wycliffe Bible Translators   oh yes yes i uh know who they are they um they have an office uh in in Costa Mesa as i recall   so yeah they could very well and   there there was uh you know there was a fairly large building that that was  so um are you uh are you uh active in translation   um we will be i was over over for four years doing language surveying which is the first step youre kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need and uh   umhum   came home and got married and we will go back back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators well i always wanted to do translation but as long as i was single and footloose so to speak its easier you know they really need surveyors cause you could youre free to travel anywhere you dont have kids hanging around you and stuff   true enough so um what uh what languages do you speak besides English of course   well i have a smattering of about ten different ones but theres im not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other you know since i did   umhum   you know complete a survey in one area id switch to the other so i know the greetings in about ten       and how to do market stuff but in about um about five i guess i can do better in it and my French is pretty good but its uh Senegalese French so uh im terrified to speak it in um   in France   in France yeah because theyre real snobby about their language and Senegalese French is street French and i just picked it up off the street and i knew what i was i knew what i was communicating but i didnt know what i was saying i never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when i came home and French to somebody and he paled and said im not going to tell you what you said so since then i have refrained from speaking any French  except in Senegal     um   i dont know what i said to him but uh i didnt ask him either   must have been terrible the um was it Henry Macon said that the the uh language is like a is like a man slowly bleeding to death slowly hemorrhaging to death without new infusions that will eventually die and i it it just amazes me that the French dont recognize that free style English is just takes on new
