 More Talk on Talk Hi Walter Pleasure to share the pages with you I warmed up this morning at my usual Breakfast Table the F train whose passengers are the most literate and convivial of any New York subway line I have ever ridden On average every third person is reading a newspaper There are the contortionists who fold the ever expanding Times into readable wedges the tabloid readers whose papers are enviably scaled for reading in motion and a scattering of people clutching Spanish or Asian papers The close quarters and the jostling practically make eaves reading inevitable and the paper bearers don t seem to mind sharing Today I saw a woman s eyes well up at the Times story on live liver donations I also saw three people contorting themselves to read the very New York Post story you mention on Hillary Clinton s interview in Talk I was not one of them My appetite for Talk has been weakened by these revelations which seem as banal as they are carefully meted out If we are going to be subjected to any additional dirt about the Clinton s mystery marriage it better be loamier than the over planted soil we seem to be farming here I agree with you about Tina Brown s domination of the media PR complex amazing how she is reinventing old news Bill Clinton s tough childhood and repeated philandering as the talk of the town I suppose we ll have to reserve judgment until tomorrow when the actual magazine hits the newsstands I ll make you a bet If the interview shatters any boundaries not already shattered by the Clintons post Gennifer Flowers 60 Minutes interview in 1992 I ll buy you a year s subscription to the magazine Are we on My favorite Talk comment so far comes from Howard Kurtz in today s Washington Post in his straight news item on Page A2 not in his long Brown vs Remnick comparison in the Style section Kurtz points out that the interview gracefully negates Hillary s previous denials real Freudian of her husband s affairs and might prevent her vast right wing conspiracy sound bites from being played ad nauseum during the Senate race Aside from sheer buzz of which she s already got plenty can you think of any other reason why Hillary finally striking out on her own is rehashing her marital troubles I also want to ask you for help in reading the Wall Street Journal s front page account of Mark Barton s online trading history The story includes a token caveat that his actions can t be blamed just on day trading but then recounts exactly how his deep losses led to the massacre How are we supposed to read a story containing a one line disclaimer that contradicts its entire narrative thrust Since Thursday I have been wondering if an unlucky gambler has ever opened fire in a Las Vegas casino or if any of the stockbrokers who committed suicide in 29 or 87 ever hurt anyone but themselves Please let me know if you ve seen any stories that answer me Until lunch Jodi P S I love it when newspapers are deadpan The terrific Times biz section story on the ad industry s all too sudden profit motivated defection to the anti smoking camp quotes an advertising executive named Alex Bogusky
