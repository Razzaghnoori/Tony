 Booker Snooker The God of Small Things has been good to the South Indian novelist Arundhati Roy The past year has brought many blessings the fairy tale arrival at her door of the eager publisher with the fat check a 1 6 million advance unheard of for a debut novel landmark sales 600 000 copies in hardcover multiple translations 23 languages much feting and fanfare global book tours interviews pride of place in India specials in Granta and The New Yorker and finally the announcement last Tuesday that Roy had won the which is awarded annually to a writer from Britain or the Commonwealth and brings with it a cash prize of more than 30 000 Though Roy s victory seems to validate the ubiquitous comparisons to the ubiquitous there is cause for pause Sure The God of Small Things is a cozy read But so are many of those books that go straight to the remainder pile So why did Roy win the Booker Why all the hype The answer is simple The Zeitgeist was ripe for Roy and Roy for it Her book hit an English speaking market that craves all things Indian tandoori food yoga Deepak Chopra the altie hip hop of Cornershop chai Homi Bhabha And while it would be ridiculous to suggest that Roy incubated this book for the better part of five years and then released it to capitalize on India chic just as it crested it is also true that she has played to that market in terms it understands and swallows whole Nothing wrong with that but Roy is strenuous in her denials She claims that 1 she doesn t want Brownie points because I m from India and 2 her book doesn t trade on the currency of cultural specificity But of course 1 she does and 2 it does Roy s book a humid tale of a pair of twins whose divorced mother has an affair with an untouchable is the sum of its othernesses The family at the center of the novel belongs to a small insular community whose inner workings are foreign even to most Indians Their family home Ayemenem is located in the comparatively remote southern state of Kerala a region that Westerners who might know Rushdie s Delhi or Naipaul s Bombay from reading their fiction might not recognize Roy s descriptions therefore can be safely lush richly runny The river shrinks and black crows gorge on bright mangoes in still dustgreen trees Red bananas ripen Jackfruits burst Dissolute bluebottles hum and die fatly baffled in the sun No one cares that Roy s prose is a breath defying crush of run together words and run on sentences strategically random capitalization and italicization numbered lists reversed words adjectival clusters acronyms quotations from songs and poems repeated images and abrupt endings The sensory overload the weight and range of devices some more clunky than clever fragments the narrative more than it enhances it forcing the reader to keep pace Click for a sample But nowhere is the self indulgent circling as pointed or annoying as in the image of Rahel the girl woman protagonist who is a dead ringer for Roy jeans and white T shirt wild hair tied back to look straight though it wasn t tiny diamond in one nostril absurdly beautiful collarbones and a nice athletic run It is this image of the exotic familiar the combination of diamond stud and bluejeans that has made U S reviewers go light on Roy She s the Indian babe who led that Eastern Religions seminar you took different enough to charm similar enough not to intimidate And the fact that she s clearly smart and literate makes everyone feel good and safe about gushing How glossy therefore is the praise how insubstantial the contact in the U S reviews I ve read Roy gives us a richly pictorial sense of these characters daily routines and habits said Michiko Kakutani in the New York Times and she delineates their emotional lives with insight and panache revealing the fatal confluence of jealousy cruelty and naivete that shapes their destinies forever No mention of the flabby plot with its contrived deaths no taking to task for the overworked prose Ayemenem is just too far away So Roy rode the wave here in the United States Book clubs met and raved and timorous tingling questions How deep did you have to reach to release those wonderful twins were asked during the author s tours The public invited magnificent pronouncements from Roy a sense somehow that this woman felt things more deeply more creatively more spiritually And she responded Asked about her language she said it is the skin on my thoughts traceable only to private rhythms So deeply felt so minutely realized were these rhythms it seems that she rewrote nary a word of her book remarkable given its length 321 pages and the fact that a word processor is quick to forgive errors The narrative structure was crafted and designed obsessively for four and a half years The story too was mine mine so what if Rushdie s latest was also set in Kerala I grew up in that village in my grandmother s pickle factory Rushdie didn t invent that Some of her British critics would agree that Roy and Rushdie indeed have little in common Only in the fantasies of publicists moaned the Guardian can such comparisons be made The Brits feel they know India and several members of the press at least appear unimpressed Arundhati Roy s victory left me close to despair said David Robson in the Sunday Telegraph If this is the novel of the year then the novel is dead Carmen Callil who chaired last year s prize committee called The God execrable and said it shouldn t have made the list Does the skepticism mean that The God got a more thorough going over in Britain Not really Americans think of the Booker committee as the Protectors of the Literary Flame In fact Booker politics are no less clubby and sordid than Oscar politics Prize and process are widely reviled by British readers and critics By giving Roy the prize the committee has confirmed the darkest suspicions of its critics Yes it s sold out quality literature for pop accessibility Also The queen s recent visit to India put the spotlight back on the issue of colonial guilt Her refusal to apologize publicly for a 1919 massacre was badly received Roy s win has been spun as a compensatory gesture from the colonialists to the former colony Roy herself was predictably modest about The God s success not the best novel the luckiest she said The win brought tears to her eyes of course and prompted a phone call to Mom in India The God of Small Things is dedicated to Mary Roy who like the twins mother married outside her community before returning divorced and in disgrace Mother and daughter were estranged for six years if the stories circulating here are to be believed Kicked out of the house when she was only 16 she was called Suzie in those days Roy went to Delhi and then to architecture school supporting herself by selling empty milk bottles some say beer bottles She bummed around the beaches of western India with a husband some say a lover before settling down in Delhi s comfy Press Enclave where all the newsies live one review claims a cottage deep in the jungle in central India The stuff of a novel but don t expect the 37 year old Roy to write it The Booker and all the laurels are about my past not my future says this ace of the apothegm I will only write another novel if I have another novel to write I don t believe in professions At a book reading in Seattle some months ago Roy told her audience that she d allowed The God to be published on the condition that it never be optioned Last week the Daily Telegraph reported that HarperCollins had finished recording an audio version of the novel using the voice of British actress Diana Quick who though she had been chosen because her British accent would not distract listeners was directed to imitate Indian accents for some dialogue Earlier this week Roy confessed that she d stuffed some movie related faxes into books saving them for a calmer time perhaps for when she repairs to that quiet cottage in the central Indian jungle
