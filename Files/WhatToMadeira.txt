workshops where the final touches are        put to these painstakingly produced items However youre unlikely to        see much of their actual manufacture as the vast majority of the work        is

visit the island if you dont mind crowds        Carnival Staged in February and occasionally March        Carnival is celebrated through the streets of Funchal with        Brazilianstyle samba rhythmsbut dont expect the hedonism or        sensuality of the type of celebrations in Rio or Tenerife Spain        Funchal is much too restrained for that and besides its party is        strictly small scale        Flower Festival This festival in late April or early May        is a crowd pleaser It includes floatsdecorated in beautiful and        inventive floral creationsparading through Funchals streets Two        events peripheral to the main parade should not be missed One is the        childrens parade in which each child carries a single flower and then        places it in a hole in a Wall of Hope in the Praa do Municpio        Covered in flowers the wall is a moving sight Once the parade is        finished an exhibition of the awardwinning flowers and displays is        put on in a lovely old house in Rua dos Castanheiros        Wine Festival Festivals take place in several villages to        celebrate the September harvest You may even see boracheiros men        sampling the goods from traditional goatskin bags once used to store        and carry wine        New Years Eve Madeiras biggest and most spectacular        festival has earned a worldwide reputation It jams Funchals hotels        every year you will need to book accommodation many months in advance        and pay a hefty premium Ironically its the one night of the year        when you get the least sleep  Many winter cruise ships anchor in        Funchal harbor on December  to take part in the party At pm all        the houses in town switch on all their lights opening all the doors        and windows setting the hillside ablaze in light The cruise ships        crank up their flood lights and the parties begin As the New Year        rings in a splendid fireworks display erupts        Several religious festivals also take place throughout the        year but one especially stands out The Feast of the Assumption known        more parochially as the Festival of Nossa Senhora do Monte Our Lady of        Monte is celebrated  August in Monte Pilgrims flock from all        around the island to kiss the image of the patron saint and some        ascend the final  steps to the church on their knees        To many Madeirans who believe the Lady of Monte has carried        them through troubled times the pilgrimage is an obligation The Monte        church is akin to Lourdes for these Madeirans The sick and crippled        arrive in droves in search of miracle cures Once the pious devotions        are over however wine flows fireworks explode espetada kebab        stalls flourish and Monte regains normality for another  days        Sports        With no beaches to speak of and scarcely enough flat        ground for a playing surface Madeira may not be the first destination        that springs to mind for a sporting holiday However there are        sufficient opportunities for most active vacationers and excellent        ones for those who enjoy walking and hiking        Spectator Sports The only spectator sport on Madeira is        football soccer Islanders are just as wild about futebol as        mainlanders and Funchals premier team in the first division of the

Robert Trent Jones the course has stupendous views from        the mountains to the sea below as its backdrop The only drawback is        the weather for Santo da Serra has a wet microclimate and

pebbly bays and beaches Sadly Madeiras one and only        black sandy beach at Prainha is isolated and not very attractive        Better bets are Ponta do Sol and Ribeira Brava where during summer        beach umbrellas are put up and locals and tourists crowd onto the rocky        shores You can also have a dip in the seminatural pools at Porto        Moniz on the extreme northwest tip of the
