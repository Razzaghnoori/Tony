 okay okay well i guess i can tell you that tonight is Murphy Brown that s the one i don t miss and i don t know if you ve seen that that s with Candace Bergen uh huh i ve never seen that before uh huh i ve heard about it but i ve never watched in fact i don t usually watch TV on Monday nights i guess i m either just really tired from the weekend and i get home well uh yeah really i have aerobics on Monday nights too i just didn t quite make it tonight because i was caught up at work for too long but um hum oh jeez but uh yeah i i usually don t get home until eight o clock so that s another good reason but uh huh i d say that s the only one i don t miss or i try not to miss that one and Cheers on Thursdays yeah i like Cheers uh huh but those are probably about the only two that i that i usually with any regularity uh huh back when i had time to watch TV oh maybe last year when i wasn t doing aerobics and work wasn t quite as busy as it s been lately um i liked The Wonders Year s and uh um sometimes every now and then i ll catch Doogie Howser because i think that comes on at eight on Wednesday nights and that s about the time i get home from aerobics and i turn on the TV as i sit down to eat dinner and i ll catch that uh huh my daughter watches that religiously we tape it for her because it comes on at nine here and she has to go to bed at eight thirty and uh so that you know we watch it too while we re taping it we watch it uh huh um oh no yeah yeah it s kind of cute um yeah i like the lessons it s a good uh good it s got a lot of good morals to it so i enjoy that one yeah yeah i like uh what is it on Tuesday oh i think Coach is kind of funny on Tuesday night oh that s right Coach yes that s another one that i try not to miss although it use to be better i don t know it seems well yeah i like that one um i haven t seen it in a while yeah i was going to say i haven t seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with Christine um hum uh huh and i was thinking well do i really want her to go back with such a jerk i know i know it s funny that that women even like that show because he really is he s such a jerk but then it s just kind of funny because you you can sit there and laugh and go yeah what a guy typical uh huh uh huh uh huh yeah but uh that one s kind of cute i m real bad i got hooked on a soap opera when i was in college General Hospital oh really everybody in the dorm watched it i mean everybody you were an outcast if you didn t gather in the TV room at two o clock in the afternoon to watch this soap i mean people scheduled their class around it and everything so i really um uh huh i started watching it and to this day i still watch it i just kind of got caught in that and then after i moved out of the dorm my roommates watched General Hospital and they watched All My Children and some other soaps and i was going i m not even going to be near that TV when they have any other soap on because i don t want to get stuck in another one one is bad enough no more but uh i know excuse me just a minute i think Katy get off the phone oops how old is she oh ten so she s been getting hearing about the the different calls and i ve i ve been in the middle of tests and stuff so i keep you saying oh press three sorry mom uh huh yeah so let s see i was trying to think of i don t think i ve ever watched any soap operas i think my mom used to watch Young and the Restless but i don t i don t watch them yeah don t ever start that s just the thing no well my my last boss s wife she oh gosh she would run the tape player from the minute she went to go do her aerobics and she used to do like um filing at the hospital uh huh and i think she did some work at a thrift store so as long as she was gone for about four hours well maybe three she would tape soap operas oh gosh and uh she would watch them at night when she came home i just couldn t watch that much TV i know he was saying he was so sick of soap operas because i guess for about four years now she you know he ll come home from work and there she ll be watching soap operas yeah hum yeah course see four hours of soap operas is really going to translate into about two hours of TV watching time because they re really half of it is just commercials they play more commercials in soap operas than anything i ve ever seen in my life but still i just don t think i could sit down for two hours oh really and especially two hours of soap operas i d that d be that might be a real good way just to break that habit is to have to watch them for that long i d kind of be like uh um hum this is enough i can t take this any more this is disgusting right yeah well she s really she s really into it i guess but i never have gotten gotten used to well i just really never have been home i think during that time yeah um hum um hum and so i never had a chance and even when i was in school of course i always had classes about that time so i never had a chance but General Hospital huh is one to get hooked on if you re going to get hooked uh huh yeah yeah i think so i mean i guess that s the only one i ve ever watched and i just i refused to i mean i never watched Dallas or Knots Landing or any of those things because it s like uh huh no i don t want to get hooked into one of these things that you have to watch it every week uh huh i mean you can watch Coach from time to time and not have to you know not feel like oh wait i m missing an episode and i won t know what s going on right really and so that s fine and i like LA Law too that s another one and i ve never watched that i going to have to watch that sometime it is pretty good i ve watched it maybe five or six times but it comes on kind of late on Thursday nights and sometimes i m trying to get things done and get in bed so i can go to work of of course for you it probably comes on really late on Thursday night come to think of it uh huh yeah yeah they everything starts at eight and then it goes through ten and uh i don t think Johnny Carson comes on until like eleven gosh oh gosh uh huh so everything really that s what s really cut into my TV watching is the time that everything comes on since it s all shifted back an hour i just i don t really have time to stay up late and since i have to get up so early to go to classes uh huh um i can t stay up past ten thirty i m falling asleep anyway so i miss most everything anyway uh huh yeah but uh let s see yeah i haven t watched Johnny Carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch David Letterman and things like that in college and Love Connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because we d get up in the in the apartment uh huh and the guys from downstairs who by the wa y two of them were from San Antonio there were three of us girls upstairs and three guys downstairs and they d come upstairs and watch it with us and we d all sit there and uh huh you know we d be yelling and going pick this one pick this one and we just had it was just a fun you know fun thing to watch but uh uh huh i ve never seen it what is it is it like a version of the dating game or huh kind of yeah they have the three choices on video and it s usually real funny because they ll usually get someone in there that half the time the dates didn t work out at all and they have to tell about their date and how it went and oh God half the time they ll say well when he showed up at the door he didn t really look quite like his video and i just wasn t real sometimes they really burn each other it s really kind of funny but uh huh that is terrible and the other person has to hear it yeah well then if the other person hears something like that they come back just as bad and he ll say well she underestimated her weight by quite a bit and they they just got you know they they go back and forth and it s kind of funny um oh uh huh oh gosh uh huh uh huh and then you ll see the real funny looking couples and it s it s it was just entertaining and of course that was uh huh that s been probably oh five six seven years ago since oh gosh i was going to say i never heard of that one The Love Connection we used to do that but uh i don t know if it even still comes on but that was always fun uh huh oh yeah i hadn t heard that one let s see i can t oh gosh that that probably wipes out my whole inventory of TV shows other than um PBS i yeah right now they ve got that Katherine Hepburn one where she s touring all the gardens of Europe i of course have missed the first series of that but that s about the only thing that i really catch on PBS um hum um hum yeah and uh we used to get Arts and Entertainment in San Antonio and i we get a little bit of the good ones here but we used to try and catch uh some of the stuff they had on there uh huh and like i said i don t really watch TV too much any more uh yeah sometimes i ll turn on CNN or something like that in the morning when i if i i get really sick of the radio in the morning because they just they re so obnoxious oh uh huh and so i ll turn on the TV and just i can hear it back in the bathroom and you know keep up kind of what s going on in the world so i ll do either CNN or Good Morning America or something like that but from time to time uh huh uh huh well we used to watch CNN because that was the only thing on really early that i could an update on all the news but with the war coverage i had had it with reporters um hum yeah and the coverage and so after a while i just turned it off i said i can t take it any more i just can t yeah yeah i haven t watched it since the war started i CNN though was it was a life saver for me back in October uh huh TI had sent me to Taiwan actually they sent me to six foreign countries Taiwan was right about in the middle and all they speak there is Chinese and in my hotel room there was nothing but Chinese programs on and they had CNN uh huh oh and i just kept that thing on constantly because i was going English language this is wonderful and and they at least i kind of knew what was going on on the other side of the world and trying to keep up with uh huh uh huh okay what s the weather been like and what s happening back in the US because by then i d been out of the country for three weeks already and i was i was you know wondering what s been happening lately but yeah i i never knew that i never even thought that they would have CNN on in Taiwan yeah believe it or not i guess that keeps anybody that s traveling that s American over there you d think that they d put it on in Chinese or translate it in Chinese yeah it was in English they had it in Tokyo too in English but they had they had they had Married With Children have you ever seen that before huh no i ve heard about it i ve seen a little bit of it it was kind of they had that on in Tokyo i watched it one night i ve seen it here before a few times it s a real sarcastic type show it s kind of funny huh um i thought i can t believe they re playing that in Japan these people over there must think we are horrible i mean some of the American shows were some of the worst ones we have and that s what they re showing in Tokyo and i m thinking i know that i didn t much uh huh oh they must think Americans are just really terrible if they watch this they probably do you know if that s all they see of us oh God what a thought so next time i think of that next time i meet somebody from Japan they re going to think oh Married With Children yeah that s what she s like i mean yeah yeah it was pretty embarrassing she s like Peggy Bundy oh boy and he s like Al Bundy oh golly yeah because i i can t remember where i ve seen clips of that but they were showing highlights of it and stuff and i was thinking who d think this is really up my alley for half an hour you know if i m going to spend my time but it was uh huh yeah um a lot of um borderline jokes yeah uh
