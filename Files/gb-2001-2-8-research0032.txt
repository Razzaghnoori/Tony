 Background The statistical model proposed in 1 for one probe set in multiple oligonucleotide arrays has the form 1 It states that the perfect match PM mismatch MM difference in array i probe j of this probe set is the product of model based expression index MBEI in array i i and probe sensitivity index of probe j j plus random error Here J is the number of probe pairs in the probe set Fitting the model we can identify cross hybridizing probes j with large standard error SE which are excluded during iterative fitting and arrays with image contamination at this probe set i with large SE as well as single outliers image spikes which are replaced by the fitted values In effect the estimated expression index i is a weighted average of PM MM differences with larger weights given to probes with larger The image of outliers array and single outliers identified through model fitting can be used to assess the quality of an experiment and to identify unexpected problems such as a misaligned corner of a DAT file 1 We have investigated several important properties of the model including the reliability and stability of the fitted parameters MBEI and probe sensitivity indexes the performance of MBEI compared to the commonly used average difference AD and how the availability of SE facilitates downstream comparative and clustering analysis Results and discussion Probe sensitivity indexes are stable across tissue types In practice in an array experiment a researcher hybridizes tissue or cell line samples corresponding to different treatments or conditions to a batch of arrays Ideally the probe sensitivity index should be independent of the tissue type This condition however may not hold for those probes that have cross hybridization affinity to non target genes Nevertheless assuming that a non target gene cross hybridizes only to a few probes of a probe set and its expression levels across arrays do not correlate with the target gene the iterative probe excluding procedure in 1 may be able to exclude cross hybridizing probes regardless of the tissue type hybridized In addition the relative probe sensitivity indexes of the good probes called by the model are likely to be similar across sets of arrays hybridizing to different tissue samples The stability of the probe sensitivity index is studied using 226 HU6800 arrays We apply the model equation 1 independently to six sets of HU6800 arrays 21 leukemia lymphoma and mantle cell samples 20 prostate cancer cell lines 17 brain tumor samples 55 cancer cell lines 58 brain samples and 55 lung tumor samples Figure 1ashows the values fitted for probe set 6457 used in Figure 1and 2of 1 in the six array sets The patterns resemble each other greatly showing that the probe sensitivity index is an inherent property of these non cross hybridizing probes and can be consistently identified from different sets of arrays Figure 1bshows the patterns for another probe set It is noteworthy that the probe 11 in array set 5 is likely to be cross hybridizing making its relative strength here MM is consistently larger than PM and this leads to a negative dissimilar to the probe 11 in other array sets The model identifies this probe as a probe outlier only for array set 5 and excludes it when calculating MBEI 0 for array set 5 In Figure 1a bthe target gene is present in most samples of all array sets For a probe set whose target gene is mostly absent throughout samples Figure 1c many probes are identified as probe outliers because of their negative indexes Here we cannot obtain correct probe sensitivity indexes because of the absence of the target gene Nevertheless the PM MM values for these probes are random fluctuations around zero leading to a correct expression index close to zero If the target gene becomes available for a future array set the correct probe sensitivity indexes will be recovered and these probes will be used for expression calculation Occasionally a responsive probe set may give rise to very different estimates in two array sets In Figure 1b probes 8 and 13 have different relative responses in array set 1 and 4 leading to different probe response patterns This might be due to the possibility that the probes in this probe set are differentially cross hybridized in different array sets or that the same probe in different batches of arrays may systematically behave differently Identification and flagging such probe sets is desirable and essential if we want to compare arrays hybridized to different tissue samples Figure 2shows the boxplots of average pairwise correlations of values between two array sets stratified by average lower presence proportion in the two sets In general when a gene is present in many samples of two array sets the patterns estimated from the two sets are very similar The target gene s presence in many arrays of an array set allows the probe sensitivity index to be estimated accurately Model based analysis for PM only arrays From Figure 1of 1 one can see that some MM probes may respond poorly to the changes in the expression level of the target gene This phenomenon raised questions on the efficiency of using MM probes and led some investigators to design custom arrays that use PM probes exclusively R Abagyan and Yingyao Zhou personal communication B R Conklin personal communication and others to calculate fold changes using only PM probes F Naef personal communication This design greatly increases the number of genes that can be studied on one array To investigate the relative performance of PM MM versus PM only designs we exploited the model to estimate gene expression levels using only PM probes and compared it to the MBEI using both PM and MM probes The full intensity model equation 1 of 1 specifies the relationship of PM probe responses and expression level 2 where v j is the baseline response of probe pair j due to nonspecific hybridization and j is the sensitivity of PM probe of the probe pair j The parameter estimates can be obtained by iteratively fitting i and v j j regarding the other set as known The same outlier exclusion procedure in 1 is applied The MM probe responses have a similar form as equation 2 except for different probe sensitivity indexes We fit a PM only and an MM only model to obtain expression values of all 20 probe probe sets using array set 1 For comparison we also used half of the probe pairs by alternatively picking one out of every two probes in a 20 probe probe set to fit to the difference model equation 1 For each probe set these three sets of expression values were compared with the expression values of the original difference model using 20 probes in terms of correlation of s obtained by two methods across the 21 arrays We assumed the 20 probe difference model provides the most accurate expression estimates If for a probe set a simplified model PM only MM only or 10 probe difference model performs reasonably well we expect its estimates to correlate with that from the 20 probe difference model Figure 3shows the histogram and Figure 4the boxplot of correlations of s estimated from the 20 probe difference model and s estimated from the 10 probe difference model a the 20 probe PM only model b and the 20 probe MM only model c For probe sets with high presence proportion both the 10 probe difference model and the PM only model correlate well with the 20 probe difference model The MM only model yields noticeably lower correlations however We note that this comparison is intrinsically biased in favor of the 10 probe difference model because the truth is constructed from PM MM differences This comparison corroborates the basic notion of the technology the PM probes hybridize more strongly to the target signals than MM probes and contain most of the information We stress that whereas the above analysis illustrates the applicability of model based analysis to PM only arrays the assessment presented here is only tentative because of the limited information provided by the HU6800 arrays on the comparisons Definitive comparisons of the efficiency of the designs must await the availability of data from PM only arrays MBEI reduces variability for low expression estimates The array set 5 has 29 pairs of arrays 2 Each pair consists of two arrays hybridizing to samples replicated at total mRNA level the total mRNA sample is split and then amplified and labeled separately and hybridized to two different arrays The differences between the expression values of the two replicate arrays in a pair are due to the variation introduced in experimental steps after the split the array manufacturing difference and analytical methods such as normalization and expression calculation This difference provides a lower bound of biological variation that can be detected between two independently amplified samples and serves as a good statistic for comparing different analytical methods The agreement of MBEI between two replicate arrays is shown in Figure 5a For comparison we also used the method in 3 to calculate ADs for all probe sets and plot them in Figure 5b AD is based on normalized probe values see Methods and materials section for the normalization method Also note that GeneChip software excludes probes whose PM MM difference is outside three standard deviations SDs of all probe differences in either of the two arrays in the comparison here as we are comparing multiple arrays at the same time when calculating ADs a probe is excluded if its difference is an outlier in the above sense in any of the arrays until a minimum of five probes is reached where all five probes will be used Both the MBEI and the AD method yielded some expression values differing by more than a factor of two especially for genes at low expression level This might be explained by the relatively larger amplification variation for weakly expressed genes given a constant success rate of amplifying a sequence by a certain fold Researchers often use log ratio between expression values of a gene in two arrays as the criterion for identifying differentially expressed genes Between duplicate arrays we expect these log ratios of expression values based on a good expression index AD or MBEI to be close to zero Thus for every probe set we calculated its average absolute log base 10 ratio of 29 pairs of duplicates as a statistic to compare the variation in expression levels between duplicates using the AD or the MBEI method Figure 6presents the results of the comparison The average absolute log ratio distribution of the MBEI method is significantly lower than that of the AD method when expression level is low and thus probe sets have a low proportion of detections of the target gene across arrays As expression level becomes higher when the target gene of a probe set is detected in more arrays the AD method shows a rapid improvement in performance approaching the level of the MBEI method The same boxplots Figure 7 for another set of 60 human U95A arrays consisting of 30 replicate pairs conveys similar information These results suggest that the MBEI method is able to extend the reliable detection limit of expression to a lower mRNA concentration Confidence interval for fold change After obtaining expression indexes using AD or MBEI fold changes can be calculated between two arrays for every gene and used to identify differentially expressed genes Usually low or negative expressions are truncated to a small number before calculating fold changes and GeneChip also cautions against using fold changes when the baseline expression is absent The availability of SEs for the model based expression indexes allows us to obtain confidence intervals for fold changes Suppose where 1 and 2 are the real expression levels in the sample and 1 and 2 are the model based estimates of expression levels We substitute the model based SEs for 1 and 2 Letting r 1 2 be the real fold change then inference on r can be based on the quantity It can be shown that Q has a 2distribution with 1 degree of freedom irrespective of the values of 1 and 2 4 Thus Q is a pivotal quantity involving r We can use Q to construct fixed level tests and to invert them to obtain confidence intervals CI for fold changes 5 Table 1presents the estimated expression indexes with SEs in two arrays and the 90 confidence intervals of the fold changes for 14 genes Although all genes have similar estimated fold changes the confidence intervals are very different For example gene 1 has fold change 2 47 and a tight confidence interval 2 06 3 02 In contrast gene 11 has a similar fold change of 2 48 but a much wider confidence interval 0 96 18 18 Thus the fold change around 2 5 for gene 11 is not as trustworthy as that for gene 1 Further examination reveals that this is due to the large SEs relative to the expression indexes for gene 11 This agrees with the intuition that when one or both expression levels are close to zero for one gene the fold change cannot be estimated with much accuracy In addition when image contamination results in unreliable expression values with large SEs the fold changes calculated using these expression value are attached with wide CIs In this manner the measurement accuracy of expression values propagates to the estimation of fold changes In practice we find it useful to sort genes by the lower confidence bound Lower CB in Table 1 which is a conservative estimate of the fold change When an expression index is negative as a result of taking PM MM differences we do not calculate the confidence intervals In such a case it is more helpful to filter genes by presence calls Standard errors help to assess clustering results Cluster analysis is a popular method for analyzing the data of a series of microarrays 6 7 If two genes are co regulated at the transcription level their expression values across samples are likely to be correlated Clustering algorithms use these correlations or monotone transformation of correlations to cluster co regulated genes together The correlation based on the estimated expression levels may however be different from that based on the real but unobserved expression levels Also the commonly used hierarchical clustering algorithm is an irreversible process once two genes or nodes are merged they will stay together even if later on there is good reason to adjust previous clustering Thus there is a need to assess the reliability of clusters A global way of using SE in hierarchical clustering is to resample or bootstrap 8 the whole gene by sample data matrix and redo the clustering then investigate the overall properties emerging from this repertoire of clustering trees In Bittner et al 9 the data matrix coming from cDNA microarray experiments is resampled using the estimated variation derived from the median SD of log ratios for a gene across samples As we now have SEs for all data points we can resample each expression value from a normal distribution with mean equal to the estimated expression value and SD equal to the attached SE Figure 8ashows a hierarchical clustering tree of 225 selected genes with presence proportion 0 5 and coefficient of variation SD mean 0 7 across the 20 samples in array set 2 In trying to interpret this tree we may be interested in the gene cluster colored in blue and the reliability of the gene members belonging to this cluster The whole data matrix is resampled and the clustering is performed again Figure 8b We notice that some blue genes genes in the original cluster are colored blue are clustered with other non blue genes and some non blue genes are mixed into the main body of the blue genes After each resampling we identify a cluster that contains more than 80 of all the blue genes but as few non blue genes as possible measured as a percentage of all genes in this cluster This cluster is considered to be the cluster that corresponds to the original one in Figure 8a In Figure 8bthe root node of the corresponding cluster is marked with small horizontal line intersecting the vertical line representing the range of the cluster on the right of the clustering picture Then for each of all the 225 genes if it belongs to this corresponding cluster we increase its in cluster count by 1 After resampling 30 times the in cluster counts are indicated in gray scale on the left side of the original clustering Figure 8c with black representing 30 and white representing zero A high in cluster count indicates a gene remains in the original cluster in most of the resampled clustering trees We can see from Figure 8cthat most genes in the original cluster are reliable members whereas a few genes at the bottom of the cluster are not in fact they are merged into the original cluster last Interestingly some genes originally not in the original cluster group with the corresponding clusters during resampling many times and have gray in cluster marks These genes may be related to the original cluster in some way In summary this method can help us to distinguish reliable and unreliable gene members of a cluster as well as draw our attention to related genes originally clustered somewhere else because of the accidental nature of hierarchical clustering Methods and materials Software We have developed a software package DNA Chip Analyzer dChip 10 to perform invariant set normalization see below calculation of MBEI 1 computation of confidence intervals of fold changes and hierarchical clustering with resampling Our experience is that more than 10 arrays are appropriate for model training outlier detection and MBEI calculation Researchers with fewer than 10 arrays may seek arrays of the same chip type and hybridizing to similar tissue samples and combine them in a single dChip analysis session We are exploring model based meta analysis of many arrays of the same chip type but hybridizing to a heterogeneous set of tissues samples and will present such analysis in future work Normalization of arrays based on an invariant set As array images usually have different overall image brightness Figure 9a especially when they are generated at different times and places proper normalization is required before comparing the expression levels of genes between arrays Model based expression computation requires normalized probe level data from Affymetrix s DAT or CEL files For a group of arrays we normalize all arrays except the baseline array to a common baseline array having the median overall brightness as measured by the median CEL intensity in an array A normalization relation can be understood as a curve in the scatterplot of two arrays with the baseline array drawn on the y axis and the array to be normalized on the x axis A straight line running through the origin is a multiplicative normalization method GeneChip s scaling method and a smoothing spline through the scatterplot can also be used Figure 9a also see 11 We should base the normalization only on probe values that belong to non differentially expressed genes but generally we do not know which genes are non differentially expressed control or housekeeping genes may also be variable across arrays Nevertheless we expect that a probe of a non differentially expressed gene in two arrays to have similar intensity ranks ranks are calculated in two arrays separately We use an iterative procedure to identify a set of probes called the invariant set which presumably consists of points from non differentially expressed genes Figure 9b Specifically we start with points of all PM probes about 140 000 for HU6800 array If a point s proportion rank difference PRD absolute rank difference in two arrays divided by n 140 000 is small enough it is kept for the new set Here the threshold of being small is PRD 0 003 when a points s average intensity ranks in the two arrays is small and PRD 0 007 when it is large accounting for fewer points at high intensity range and the threshold is interpolated in between We chose these parameters empirically to make the selected points in the invariant set thin enough to naturally determine a normalization relation In this way we may obtain a new set of 10 000 points and the same procedure is applied to the new set iteratively until the number of points in the new set does not decrease anymore A piecewise linear running median line is then calculated and used as the normalization curve After normalization the two arrays have similar overall brightness Figure 9c Figure 10shows another pair of arrays where the normalization relationship is non linear
