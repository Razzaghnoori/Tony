 Proust Peanuts and Snow Days Oh Harry A snow day It was a beautiful thing if you were a kid growing up in New Jersey as I did They canceled school if there was too much snow on the ground leaving you a day to sled drink cocoa or profiteer by shoveling driveways I imagine in Maine or Minnesota there weren t too many snow days or there wouldn t be any school at all But in states that are snow prone but not snow drenched they were a lovely treat Anyway Y2K made me a little misty eyed for a mini calamity like that But I should have left that a private reverie I totally agree re Sydney I especially loved the dancers on the sheer walls of the famed Opera House Our kid woke up at 4 a m and we happened to catch it live on that dreaded American TV It was great I m trying to read between the lines of your New York years You hated em but you also seem wistful for the pre Rudy days Who knows Maybe you d like it now without the squeegee guys and with ESPN Zone The Restaurant Somehow I think not Maybe it s 3 000 miles distance but am I wrong not to be too incensed by the Staples scandal Of course the Los Angeles Times shouldn t have split revenues with the center But publications do a lot with advertisers all the time In the magazine world advertisers are given heads up about upcoming issues and allowed to place ads in those issues That I realize is a far cry from what happened with the Times but it s telling about the intimacy between advertisers and publishers I actually find the listing of names a perfectly fine gimmick When I wrote for small weekly newspapers one of the tricks of the trade was to get as many local names into a story as possible You could argue that this was shameless pandering I bristled at it at the time but with some distance I can see the merits It gave a thrill for people who unlike us don t see their names in print Where s the harm I admit though the misspelling thing is hysterical You handling the Charlie Brown thing OK I have to say the Peanuts thing is making me wistful too Maybe that s what triggered the Proustian snow days reaction Like Capra Schulz was always a lot darker than most people thought and the richer for it Peanuts with its neurosis unrequited love and melancholy was newsprint Woody Allen Funny and sad too Like most adults I haven t read it for years in the papers It was one of those things though you d assumed would be there the way you assumed that well the year 2000 was the future See you Matt
