 Introduction This paper was presented at the 10th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases 28 31 May 2000 Stockholm Sweden Sepsis can be defined as a systemic response to infection 1 The incidence of sepsis worldwide is on the increase Sepsis and its sequels are the leading causes of death in intensive care units Mortality rates are higher for patients with pre existing disease medical conditions care in the intensive care unit and multiple organ failure 2 3 Despite steady improvements in antibiotic therapy and intensive care management during the past decade mortality has remained close to 50 This high mortality rate has continued to stimulate interest in pharmacological agents that might reduce morbidity and mortality 4 5 6 7 Steroid therapy in patients with sepsis is still controversial In the 1960s stress doses of hydrocortisone for the treatment of sepsis were investigated but no advantages could be shown in a double blind multicenter study 8 This led to the discontinuation of steroid replacement therapy for sepsis In the 1970s therapy with pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids was widely used in patients with sepsis and septic shock The most compelling evidence in favor of corticosteroid treatment was reported by Schumer 9 in his prospective randomized study of steroid administration to patients with septic shock These data indicate that methylprednisolone 30 mg kg or dexamethasone 3 mg kg reduced the mortality rate from 38 4 to 10 5 However later in the mid 1980s pharmacological doses of glucocorticoids for the treatment of sepsis were investigated extensively until several clinical trials gave negative results 10 11 12 Moreover there is some evidence that the use of high dose glucocorticoids in sepsis might be harmful 11 Many studies have demonstrated that elevated cortisol levels in sepsis and the degree of elevation are related to the severity of illness 13 Basal and corticotropin ACTH stimulated cortisol levels correlate with the severity of illness and very high cortisol levels often signify a poor prognosis 14 In sepsis the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is activated through systemic and neural pathways Circulating cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor interleukin 1 and interleukin 6 activate the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis independently and when combined have synergistic effects 15 Sepsis can also cause adrenal insufficiency AI which is associated with increased mortality 16 In recent years several authors have proposed a syndrome of occult AI in septic shock in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations This hypothesis is based on many studies investigating the adrenocortical response of patients with septic shock to 0 25 mg of ACTH Up to 28 of seriously ill patients have been suggested to have occult or unrecognized AI 14 The prevalence of occult AI a cortisol increment after a short ACTH test of less than 9 mg dl in severe sepsis was estimated at about 50 and the 28 day mortality rate at about 75 17 A few studies have indicated that stress doses of hydrocortisone improve hemody namics in patients with hyperdynamic septic shock which is unresponsive to conventional therapy 18 19 However the use of a physiological dose of steroid in patients with sepsis severe sepsis and septic shock has not yet been completely evaluated We therefore performed a placebo controlled randomized double blind single center study The aim of this study was to assess basal cortisol concentrations and the cortisol response to ACTH stimulation as well as their prognostic importance and also to determine the effects of the physiological dose steroid therapy on mortality in patients with sepsis Methods Study design The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Erciyes University and informed consent was obtained from the patients relatives This placebo controlled randomized double blind single center study was performed at the Department of Medical Intensive Care Unit and the Department of Infectious Diseases of Erciyes University Medical School during a 2 year period from May 1997 to April 1999 Patient selection Patients over 17 years old and diagnosed with sepsis were included consecutively in the study The diagnosis of sepsis was based on the definition of the American College of Chest Physicians Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference Report 1 The severity of illness was classified according to this definition Table 1 Criteria for exclusion from the study were as follows already known pre existing adrenal disease or adrenalectomy known malignancies tuberculosis that might have involved the adrenal gland and administration of steroids within the 3 months before the admission In addition patients with burns hemorrhagic shock or those who had suffered myocar dial infarction were not included Treatment protocol Patients enrolled in the study were treated with standard therapy used in the treatment of sepsis and septic shock This therapy could include the following administration of antibiotics fluid replacement vasoactive drugs mechanical ventila tory support and any other form of supportive therapy deemed necessary by the primary physicians Soon after the presumptive diagnosis of severe sepsis initial laboratory specimens were obtained and within 2 hours the patients were randomized to treatment with prednisolone or placebo groups The treatment groups were determined by a computer generated randomization procedure The steroid therapy group received prednisolone at a physiological dose Prednisolone was given intravenously at 06 00 5 mg and 18 00 2 5 mg for 10 days The standard therapy group received a placebo infusion containing physiological saline solution in an identical manner Patients and their primary physicians were blinded as to which therapy was administered Data collection An ACTH stimulation test was performed with 250 g of tetracosactrin synacthene Ciba Geigy Germany given intravenously Blood samples were taken immediately before the test and at 30 and 60 minutes afterwards After centrifugation plasma samples were stored at 20 C until assayed ACTH stimulation test was repeated on the 14th day in the patients who survived Plasma cortisol concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay with a commercially available kit ICN Biomedicals Inc Costa Mesa California USA Intra assay coefficients of variation were for control A 7 0 control B 5 8 and control C 5 1 Inter assay coefficients of variation were for control A 7 9 control B 6 5 control C 6 0 The cortisol response was defined as the difference between the basal and peak cortisol concentrations Normal adrenal function was defined as a plasma cortisol level before or at 30 or 60 minutes after the injection of ACTH above 20 g dl The cases with peak cortisol levels lower than 20 g dl were considered to be AI 13 20 21 22 Occult AI was defined as an increase in cortisol after a ACTH test of less than 9 g dl a cortisol response of no more than 9 g dl 17 23 24 Community acquired sepsis had its onset within 72 hours of the patients admission to the hospital whereas hospital acquired sepsis began 72 hours or later after admission The estimated prognosis of any pre existing underlying diseases had been classified according to the classification of McCabe and Jackson 25 Observed initial findings that related to disseminated intravas cular coagulation respiratory insufficiency altered mental status and renal cardiac and liver failure were noted 26 27 The severity of the illness was assessed with the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II APACHEII scoring system 28 The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment SOFA score 29 was added to the study protocol by amendment and retrospectively from the raw data Infections were diagnosed according to clinical and microbiological criteria Blood samples for cultures were obtained by the same investigator O Yildiz and inoculated into a standard culture medium BACTEC 9240 Patients were evaluated at enrollment and at the 24th hour and on the 3rd 7th 10th 14th 21st and 28th days and followed for 1 month after discharge from hospital Body temperature respiratory rate heart rate blood pressure the use of vasopressor drugs urine output complete blood counts urinalysis with microscopic examination erythrocytes sedimentation rate blood chemistry prothrombin time partial thromboplastin time fibrinogen fibrin debranch ing product blood gases electrocardiogram and chest roentgenogram were recorded for each patient individually Study endpoints The primary endpoint of the study was 28 day mortality from all causes The secondary endpoint consisted of adverse occurrences including possible complications of drug therapy and morbid events such as the progression of initial infection and the development of secondary infection Secondary infection was defined as the identification of a new site of infection or the emergence of a different organism at the same site generally requiring a change in antibiotic management All medications given to the patients any complications the duration of hospitalization the mortality rate and the causes of death were recorded and compared between the groups We also compared average values of basal cortisol peak cortisol and cortisol responses to ACTH between survivors and non survivors on the first day Moreover basal cortisol levels on the 1st and 14th days were compared in patients who recovered in each group Statistical analysis Student s t test and the Mann Whitney U multivariate analysis test were used for continuous variables 2and Fisher s 2tests were used for proportions and logistic regression was used for effects of factors on mortality Values are expressed as means SD odds ratio OR and 95 confidence interval CI or proportion Results Description of study population Forty patients with sepsis severe sepsis and septic shock were included in this study The mean age of patients was 56 5 16 4 years in the standard therapy group and 57 8 17 7 years in the steroid therapy group There was no significant difference in demographic characteristics the severity of underlying diseases the APACHE II and SOFA scores the median time to hospital and median time to death the acquisition of infection and the sepsis categories between the groups Table 2 The 28 day mortality There were eight deaths 40 in the steroid therapy group and 12 60 deaths in the standard therapy group P 0 343 The mortality rate in the patients with hospital acquired sepsis was higher than that in the patients with community acquired sepsis in both groups but this difference was not statistically significant The relationship between mortality and age the presence of an underlying disease vasopressor and steroid therapy and APACHE II and SOFA scores was assessed Age the presence of an underlying disease steroid therapy basal plasma cortisol levels and cortisol response to ACTH below 9 g dl were not associated with mortality Although a univariate analysis found vasopressor therapy OR 4 64 95 CI 1 02

95 CI 1 01 4 30 in a multivariate analysis Fig 1and Table 3 Variations of treatment effects on the 28 day mortality among subgroups The mortality rates among patients with a cortisol level over 60 g dl were 29 2 of 7 in the steroid therapy group and 78 7 of 9 in the standard therapy group 2 3 874 P 0 126 Although there was an increase in the level of basal cortisol in patients with sepsis 14 of 40 patients 35 had occult AI The mortality rates in patients with occult AI were 40 2 of 5 in the steroid therapy group and 55 6 5 of 9 in the standard therapy group respectively 2 0 311 P 1 Only one patient had both basal and peak cortisol levels lower than 20 g dl this patient was in the standard therapy group and died on the 7th day of treatment This case was accepted as adrenal failure A comparison of mortality rates for basal cortisol and cortisol responses to ACTH in both groups is shown in Figure 1 The median time to death was 5 days 95 CI 2 55 8 20 in the steroid therapy group and 5 5 days 95 CI 2 19 13 in the standard therapy group P 0 496 The reason for death in all patients was attributed to sepsis The median stay in hospital was 14 days 95 CI 11 09 20 08 in the steroid therapy group and 13 days 95 CI 10 13 16 37 in the standard therapy group P 0 406 Sepsis related organ dysfunction Organ dysfunction and failure rates of the patients on admission were 40 and 45 in the steroid therapy and the standard therapy groups respectively Table 4 No statistically significant difference was found between the changes in the percentage of SOFA scores of the steroid therapy group 43 1 26 5 and the standard therapy group 45 4 12 7 in survivors P 0 624 Cortisol levels and cortisol responses to ACTH Basal and peak cortisol levels and cortisol responses to ACTH in the steroid therapy group were not significantly different from those in the standard therapy group Table 5 The average values of basal cortisol peak cortisol and cortisol responses to ACTH in survivors and non survivors in both groups for the first day are shown in Table 3 There was no significant difference between the values for survivors and non survivors The mean basal cortisol level was 47 6 26 9 g dl on the first day in all survivors and 17 2 8 6 g dl on the 14th day in patients who recovered P 0 0003 In the steroid therapy group the mean basal cortisol level was 52 5 30 5 g dl on the first day and 17 6 10 3 g dl on the 14th day P 0 003 In the standard therapy group the mean basal cortisol level was 40 3 19 9 g dl on the first day and 16 4 4 6 g dl on the 14th day P 0 028 Table 6 Adverse events There were no adverse effects due to steroid therapy Only one patient in the standard therapy group had a secondary infection Discussion Sepsis is a severe and life threatening disease Septic shock is associated with a mortality rate of more than 50 Despite improvements in the overall management of such patients including intensive fluid resuscitation broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and life support devices mortality rates have not improved during the past decade 4 In this randomized double blind study of the physiological dose of intravenous prednisolone or placebo in the treatment of sepsis we observed an important difference in mortality rates between both groups The mortality rates were 40 in the steroid therapy group and 60 in the standard treatment group There was a trend towards a decrease in the mortality rate of the patients with sepsis who received physiological dose steroid therapy However the differences were not statisti cally significant P 0 343 Several factors were suspected to be associated with mortality in sepsis 30 31 Annane et al 17 reported that SOFA score high plasma cortisol levels and weak response of cortisol to ACTH were also associated with mortality However we found that only SOFA score was related to mortality independently of other factors OR 2 07 95 CI 1 02 4 22 in the multivariate analysis Briegel et al 19 showed that stress doses of hydrocorti sone reduce the time for the reversal of shock the number of organ system failures and the length of mechanical ventilation in patients with septic shock This finding underlines the fact that an impaired adrenocortical function contributes to vascular hyporesponsiveness in septic shock In contrast to other studies our study was performed in patients with sepsis severe sepsis and septic shock with the use of physiological dose prednisolone with or without vasopressor support Because the administration of prednisolone does not affect the circadian adrenocortical patterns and the results of an ACTH stimulation test in adults we preferred to use this drug 32 In this study we did not completely evaluate the effect of the steroid on patients with vasopressor dependent septic shock However in a few patients a physiological dose of prednisolone reduces the time for the reversal of shock as defined by the cessation of vasopressor therapy It is known that the plasma cortisol level increases in critical illnesses and that basal cortisol levels have a positive correlation with severity of illness and prognosis However some investigators 16 23 33 34 35 showed that patients with sepsis and high baseline cortisol levels had a lower cortisol response to the ACTH stimulation test Our entire study group had higher mean random basal and stimulated cortisol levels than those seen in outpatients The difference between the basal cortisol levels on the 1st and 14th days in patients who recovered was statistically significant P 0 0001 Table 5 We have also shown that basal cortisol levels correlate with the severity of the illness and that very high corti sol levels signify a poor prognosis in the standard therapy group Fig 1 Clinically significant AI is unusual in outpatients The studies of adrenal function in critically ill patients report conflicting incidences of AI ranging from 0 to 28 35 36 37 Our results show a low incidence of AI in septic patients One of our 40 patients had abnormal basal and peak cortisol levels less than 20 g dl and died This condition was evaluated as AI In the advancing process from sepsis to septic shock we concluded that AI was not so frequent as supposed In recent years several authors have proposed a syndrome of occult AI in septic shock in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations Annane et al 17 reported that 50 of patients with severe sepsis had occult AI In the present study 14 35 of the 40 patients had a subnormal cortisol response occult AI Five patients in the steroid treatment group had an inadequate cortisol response two of them died However five of nine patients in the standard treatment group who showed inadequate cortisol response died No statistical differences were observed in mortality rates between the patients who had occult AI 2 0 311 P 1 Fig 1 In conclusion a physiological dose of intravenous pred nisolone had a tendency towards a decrease in mortality in the patients with sepsis but the difference between the two groups was not significant Because our study had a small sample size and showed heterogeneity in population in terms of clinical severity treatment with physiological dose steroid in sepsis should be evaluated in a larger group of patients Key messages There was an increase in the level of basal cortisol in patients with sepsis In the advancing process from sepsis to septic shock adrenal insufficiency was not so frequent as supposed Sepsis can cause occult adrenal insufficiency in the presence of normal or even elevated serum cortisol concentrations Physiological dose prednisolone therapy had a tendency towards a decrease in mortality in the patients with sepsis Competing interests None declared Abbreviations AI adrenal
