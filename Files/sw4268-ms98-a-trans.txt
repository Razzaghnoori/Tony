        well i have a a couple of of of small children       one is four uh the other ones an infant and when we were looking for care for the older child when he was about nine weeks or so i uh i i had to go back to work i wanted to find someplace with a very uh low ratio of of children to to care giver so that the so that my infant could could really receive a lot of attention and for that first couple of of years i was able to find that in in a family setting uh  uh a a day care provider offering services out of her own home but her circumstances circumstances changed and she lost the the help that she had uh so that they were really now quite a number of of demands on her time and we switched over to to a uh a commercial day care service which actually is the best of of both worlds its its not a a big chain and they do have separate rooms for the the different developmental ages so it the the youngest one now the the the new infant still receives personalized care       uh but at the same school his his older brother is receiving uh basically pre kindergarten care   my situation is a little bit different but it still covers the same type of problem i am a grandmother but im also employed but my grandson and his father moved back in and lived with us for about a year and so and he was about four so it was sort of like another generation raising a a a child and were all working adults so it i have some of the same problems its no longer a problem now that he is older and in school but this has been a problem no matter what generation youre in and one of the things that and then also in the setting where i work i see a lot of uh young people especially uh young women with children who have to take time off because of problems with the babysitting or child care services and i think uh one of the things that and also when i had the grandson my grandson here that we were keeping care of him one of the main problems that affects work and affects the care too is when youre as any when the child is the least bit sick uh uh the you have to come get them theres a problem and one of the things i would like to see would be a type of day care service where there is uh at the same place where theyre care for as a well child they have facilities for uh sick care   i i i know i ive had the problem myself where the child might might begin to run a a low grade fever and the school calls up and says come get your come get your child uh your child looks like maybe he has conjunctivitis come get your child immediately whether or not   come get him yeah   its really true uh come get your child immediately uh it and thats its it is a big disruption uh its particularly bad in the first year if youre back to work and you know how frequently that you have to go to the doctor for the little ones just for checkups alone in the first year uh sometimes your boss doesnt think that thats really terrific   no   but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses and the school doesnt want to want to keep your child we do have up here um and some of the hospitals do this as a way of defraying their costs they run day cares for sick children out of their hospital facilities but   well thats an interesting yeah   that it and its its an interesting way to approach it but theres a problem i dont know how many parents would be willing to take their children to a a a location a child has never seen   oh thats thats another reason why i would preferred it to be with the same services the facility that i work with is a large facility and theyre looking at day care now and i would love to see day care on site where if you have lunch you can go over and spend it with a child uh if you have and i would like a twenty four hour day care and its big enough where it could do that where if you worked different shifts uh you could uh uh bring the child in   and but yeah   for the night where you know they would be there with you and you can stop in at anytime on your break so that your the check and balances of the type of care is subject to anybody stopping in anytime   i i know we we wouldve liked to
