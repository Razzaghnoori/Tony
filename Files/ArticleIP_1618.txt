 Gotta Love Those Bolls The Cotton Club produced by Rhea Kaiser Marketing Communications for Rhone Poulenc Guess what takes center stage in The Cotton Club A er plant A cotton plant to be precise and a sassy one at that No moldy bolls sprouting wispy white nothings here This plant is lissome It is lush And it will go to great lengths to convince its target market the rural South to buy Finish A defoliant re growth inhibitor and boll opener Finish is produced by Rhone Poulenc It speeds up the harvest by accelerating the growth cycle of the cotton plant causing it to age lose its leaves and open bolls ahead of schedule The Cotton Club dramatizes that compressed cycle via the sashaying shimmying plant which sheds its inhibitions and its leaves in its commitment to commerce and bares all Not that The Cotton Club is in poor taste you understand It is true that it is set to David Rose s famous Stripper which urges one to take it off take it all off but the spot s producers Chicago firm Rhea Kaiser were sharply aware of the Cotton Belt Bible Belt overlap This plant is a dancer not a stripper one of its makers insists The setting however strikes a coyly sultry note Red curtains and exaggerated underlighting transform an old German opera house in Brooklyn N Y into The Cotton Club where a new act is being staged First says the voice over as the camera curves around a gyrating graphic it takes off those leaves Then it keeps them from coming back We aren t sure what it is but clearly this product aids aging Leaves wither and fall as the plant continues to dance the combination of potent chemicals and strip clubs isn t likely to endear itself to the PC police and there are those who would be hard pressed to distinguish between Finish and Agent Orange But all s well etc because the stuff in the white bottle opens those bolls Man does it open up those bolls To put it another way the plant takes it all off then sprouts bolls Hmm A bottle of Finish waits in the wings as chyron and narrator describe its virtues Not only does it defoliate inhibit re growth and open bolls but it is also faster and more consistent than any other harvest aid As the curtain closes and applause spills across the footlights the message is reiterated Cotton has never moved like this as swiftly to harvest or across a stage Robert Shrum
