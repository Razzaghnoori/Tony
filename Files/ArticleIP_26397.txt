 Alpha Zeta Caper movies can often get by with only one great visual idea in the case of Entrapment it s Catherine Zeta Jones in a black vinyl cat suit doing ballet amid a field of laser beams She s supposed to be an undercover insurance operative who s out to catch legendary burglar Sean Connery in the act of stealing a priceless Chinese mask or is she actually a thief herself planning to bag the scrumptious Scotsman along with the motherlode A mystery that In the meantime Connery whisks her to his castle on an Inverness loch where he rigs a cat s cradle of red string to represent the lasers that she won t at the site be able to discern As she practices her moves blindfolded the firelight casts a golden aureole around her sculpted bottom But she s even more alluring when she does the deed for real She begins in the lotus position then unfolds and sends a long leg sideways in a neatly executed fouett On point says Connery peering into his laptop screen at the beams that only he can see Now lift The whole sequence has an archetypal enchantment made even more savory by its naughty underpinnings The aging master directs his prima ballerina in a sacred dance to larceny Entrapment doesn t hit the rest of its marks with comparable lan but it s bearable With its featherweight premise casually amoral heroes and exotic locales it conjures up an era the 60s and 70s when twisty romantic heist pictures were routinely ground out as tax shelters and sometimes cast with the producers model girlfriends so that expensive vacations could be written off too Entrapment is an A list production but despite Ving Rhames as Connery s enigmatically surly cohort and a bevy of state of the art sensors cybergizmos and digital readouts it can t manage to brush off its B movie cobwebs or to freshen banter that Rhett would have been too progressive to lay on Scarlett Has there ever been anyone you couldn t manipulate beguile or seduce asks Connery after Zeta Jones has stretched herself languidly out on a plush four poster In the climax the pair must walk a fraying tightrope between the twin towers of the world s tallest building in Kuala Lumpur while millennium fireworks explode around them But the bad guy s dialogue remains laughably mired in the last millennium They re rats in a trap E ntrapment is built around the object that is Zeta Jones who as the headstrong heroine of last year s The Mask of Zorro did a dazzling job of staring down Antonio Banderas She has almond eyes a luxuriant black mane made for high toned hair commercials and an upper lip that can flare or pout with silken ease Supple physically she is nevertheless somewhat stolid probably the upshot of a monotonous untrained voice of the sort that brings most goddessy supermodels crashing to earth It doesn t help that she s opposite an actor who can do a fouett on every syllable Connery is also the embodiment of everything unfair in nature to men but especially to women being one of the few male actors who actually makes a plausible heartthrob for a female nearly half a century his junior You re the most beautiful crook I ve ever seen he tells Zeta Jones toasting her with that voice while eating her up with those bandit chieftain eyes and you can picture sundry Golden Age Bond girls clucking I remember when he said that to me sonny Connery mocks Father Time by disguising himself as an old guy with glasses and a paunch This he seems say is how men of my age are supposed to look Of course one way that performers assist the aging process is by playing roles that give their features and emotions a workout Connery superb actor though he is hasn t broken a sweat since The Untouchables 1987 David Mamet who coincidentally wrote Connery s marvelous dialogue in that movie gave the American theater a brusque shove out of the romantic realm of disillusioned lefties such as Eugene O Neill and Arthur Miller into a brutal capitalist realism wherein every encounter was reduced to an attempt by one party to hoodwink psych out or otherwise overpower another Who d have thought that Mamet was secretly in love with the well carpentered 40s and 50s drawing room plays of the terribly English Terence Rattigan whom the Angry Young Men of the late 50s loutishly blew off the boards thus paving the way for Mamet s expletive laced theater games In choosing to adapt and direct The Winslow Boy based on one of Rattigan s most tidily crafted problem pieces Mamet points up an aspect of his own work that has increasingly dwarfed all others the drama as a procession of archly formal negotiations Beat by beat Mamet turns out an immaculately staged crisply paced and elegantly acted movie It s also a tad bloodless but you can t have everything Set in England before World War I the play based on an actual incident tells the story of an adolescent boy expelled from a military academy for the theft of a five shilling postal money order and the financially ruinous attempt of his proper patriarch played in the film by Nigel Hawthorne to clear his son s name Relativist that he is Mamet clearly loves the fact that young Winslow s guilt or innocence is never satisfactorily resolved What matters is that the Winslow cause at least when viewed from the perspective of the boy s increasingly frail but determined father has its own sterling truth More to the point Mamet can have himself a whale of a time directing a series of civilized confrontations that escalate in importance from the young man who asks Winslow senior for his daughter s hand in marriage and the precise amount of her dowry to a cunning barrister Sir Robert Morton Jeremy Northam who uses every rhetorical trick he can think of to wear down a Parliament weary of a twopenny schoolboy scandal Hawthorne gives Winslow an air of gorgeously ineffable sadness he seems to carry on his ever shakier shoulders the knowledge that this gray way of life this England is doomed If only Rattigan had given him a stronger second act This the playwright ceded to Morton the coldhearted Establishment lawyer who unexpectedly throws himself into an anti establishment cause and who Northam plays brilliantly as an alert snake increasingly unsure of where to strike For Mamet however the core of the piece is Winslow s daughter a snootily progressive ing nue and a suitable romantic foil for the conservative Morton She is played by Mamet s wife Rebecca Pidgeon whom he means us to find weirdly irresistible I find her weird and resistible but not unattractive having spent much of my early manhood pursuing similarly small dark eyed girls who looked as if they had some lewd secret that would only be divulged after a protracted psychodrama The secret of course was that there was no secret Along these lines the saucy Pidgeon s chief talent is for looking as if she knows something that you don t and even after ravishing her never will Clearly this is what gets Mamet through the night
