 SCHOOL OF DENTISTRY June 18 1990 Dear Colleague Several School of Dentistry faculty and staff members have recently asked how they can become members of the Century Club The Club is made up of alumni faculty staff and friends who support the school with annual gifts of 100 or more I believe many of the questions are being asked because the Campaign for Indiana IU s major fundraising effort that started in 1985 is ending and many who supported IUSD through the campaign are wondering how they can continue their support Payroll deduction is perhaps the easiest way to make a contribution For example with a 5 biweekly or 10 monthly contributon a person can be a Century Club member And if a person decides to be a contributor the best time to begin is the month prior to salary increases This allows donors to adjust their budget without losing any money they are already receiving I guess I encourage this method because I ve always made my contributions this way it s a painless method and at tax time I enjoy the deduction In 1989 we had 726 Century I and Century II members we would like to have 1 000 members by the end of 1990 If you would like to help us reach our goal we have enclosed a pledge card for your convenience Please return it to Joyce Stafford or me Development Office Room 202 so that we can personally thank you for your support You will also receive a letter from Dean Gilmore expressing his appreciation Over the past few years we ve been able to make many improvements that would not have been possible without the generosity and backing of the Century Club Support from the Century Club helps us continue to provide a progressive learning and working environment for our students faculty and staff I thank all of you who are already supporting IUSD and I look forward to welcoming many of our colleagues as new century Club members If you have any questions please feel free to stop by and see me Sincerely Danny R Dean Director of Development
