 Bad Ayres Day How spun was B Drummond Ayres Jr of the New York Times on Sunday when he wrote about today s special election in California to fill the House seat of the late George Brown Ayres line was that the seat had been a sure bet for Republicans to pick up Republican leaders once confidently predict ed victory by their candidate Elia Pirozzi he wrote because they had been steadily nibbling away at Brown s winning margins as the district grew more and more conservative A DNC spokesman couldn t have set the stage better If Democrat Joe Baca wins it now looks to Times readers like a stunning upset that foreshadows a possible Republican House collapse If the Republican Pirozzi wins it looks like the GOP barely hung on to take a seat that should have been a gimme So what s wrong with Ayres take A lot 1 It s factually inaccurate Republicans hadn t been steadily nibbling away at Brown s margins They came within a few hundred votes of beating Brown in 1996 But two years later Pirozzi lost to Mr Brown by 15 percentage points as Ayres colleague Todd Purdum noted in a NYT piece on this very race two months ago 2 Brown s district hasn t been growing more and more conservative As Purdum also reported Republican registration has dropped from about 39 percent of the voters in the district to about 33 percent now with the Democrats fueled by newly registered Hispanic voters picking up the difference Does Ayres read his own paper 3 Republicans hadn t confidently predicted victory by their candidate Pirozzi In fact since the GOP s first choice candidate State Senator Jim Brulte decided not to run the Republicans have been desperately lowering expectations something Ayres himself noted in an August 4 piece Since no other Republican candidate of Brulte s political stature has indicated a desire to get into the contest Ayres wrote back then Republican leaders say the district may not be such an easy target Why is the stature challenged Pirozzi now suddenly a former sure bet of these same unnamed Republican leaders Does Ayres read his own copy
