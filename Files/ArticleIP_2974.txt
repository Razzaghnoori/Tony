 Cafe Sociology Studio 54 was a singular disco Let me give you an example of what I mean One night there a fairly typical Tuesday as I recall I noticed that I was standing next to Juan Carlos the occupant of the Spanish throne He seemed to be enjoying himself though he looked a little anxious when a paparazzo took his picture How am I going to explain this to the archbishop he might have been thinking Later that week my mother came to visit me in New York We were watching a local newscast in her hotel room and there was a story about the police raiding a disreputable midtown disco The TV showed images of a youngish Puerto Rican clientele being led out by the cops Goodness my mother exclaimed Are there a lot of Hispanics at Studio 54 She s from Virginia Well I replied beaming a bit the last time I popped in the king of Spain was there It s hard to convey how much more interesting New York was in the late 70s than it is now There was a sense of unlimited possibility in the air Everywhere else Paris Los Angeles seemed provincial and dull by comparison John Sparrow the late warden of All Souls College put it nicely My impression is that in New York anything might happen at any moment In England nothing could happen ever Shortly after I arrived in the city an unknown from the sticks come to learn philosophy at Columbia I went uninvited to an opening at an art gallery on the East Side I met a guy there who turned out to be Andy Warhol s silk screener and he introduced me to Warhol who then introduced me to the governor of New York Hugh Carey who then introduced me to Diana Vreeland of whom I had never heard The next thing I knew I was in a private room upstairs at the 21 Club having dinner with the lot of them Hey Manhattan s easy I thought What I didn t realize is that you don t become rich and famous or even enduringly fabulous by osmosis at some unhappy point you have to work The sense of possibility reached its most intense pitch in that little patch of space time known as Studio 54 Temporally it spanned a thousand days from 1977 to 1979 spatially it occupied a handsome former opera house that was also a former TV studio The Jack Benny Show What s My Line Captain Kangaroo on 54 th Street 254 W 54 th St to be exact Oddly CBS had called it Studio 53 It was thither that I emboldened by my earlier brush with greatness hopefully hied myself around midnight one autumn evening in 1978 in order to shake my booty or possibly my groove thing An hour later I was Zulu dancing with Mary Tyler Moore Dick Cavett O J Simpson Margaret Trudeau and for all I know the author of this engrossing book Anthony Haden Guest The Last Party is more than the story of Studio 54 It is the Gibbonesque chronicle of the rise and fall of New York night life from the postwar period to the present The chief cultural innovation of the period was of course the discoth que The great early discoth ques were in Paris and Rome Roger Vadim the director husband of Brigitte Bardot coined the word by analogy with cin math que The concept swam into the ken of Americans with Fellini s La Dolce Vita What is a disco It is the perfection of voyeurism Playing recorded music allows the club to get rid of the performers so that the people have nothing to look at but one another They are the spectacle But you have to have the right people lest the spectacle prove disagreeable The disco in Saturday Night Fever was the 2001 Odyssey in Brooklyn a hustling polyester draped mass of rutting Guidos and Guidettes In a 1978 article titled DISCO Hottest Trend in Entertainment Life magazine claimed that there are now more than 10 000 discotheques in the U S Yes and only one of them was any good What made Studio 54 seem like the center of the universe was that every world art royalty Hollywood fashion rock Euro literary gay political bohemian blue blood brilliantly intersected there It solved for a brief shining moment what in game theory is known as the coordination problem Yes Elizabeth Taylor Norman Mailer Warren Beatty David Rockefeller and Mick Jagger will go to a nightclub but only if they are reasonably certain that Diana Ross William F Buckley Jr Salvador Dali Betty Ford Frank Sinatra Mikhail Baryshnikov and the king of Cyprus will show up too and vice versa Actually the king of Cyprus didn t get in The chief doorman Mark Benecke was under the misapprehension that he was the owner of Cypress Gardens in Queens Halston Andy Liza Truman and Bianca will be there regardless Studio 54 delivered this critical mass almost every night plus another 1 500 or so people who were simply beautiful or interesting to look at plus Haden Guest and me But why did all these competing elites blend together so ecstatically One reason I think was a giddy feeling in the late 70s that the End was Nigh so everything was permitted and there was no reason to compete The rest of the country had endured Vietnam and Watergate but New York had its own little problem bankruptcy and physical collapse It was like Rome in the waning days of empire Let the great debauch proceed And if there was a bit of buggery and whatnot going on up in the balcony what of it You would look around and you d see somebody s back says a photographer quoted by Haden Guest And then you d see little toes twinkling behind their ears In the warren of grungy rooms beneath the dance floor the celebrities sanctum sanctorum the coke was consumed by the linear foot and according to the author the odd European contessa could be found handcuffed to a water pipe getting squired from the rear by one of the pretty shirtless busboys In short the place made Bosch look like a Methodist picnic I don t know if I was in heaven or hell said Lillian Carter the president s mother after a visit But it was wonderful Outside the vetting committee at the door kept the great unwashed in their horrible disco regalia from getting past the velvet ropes Attempts at dramatic entrances were not always successful On one occasion recounted by the author a woman rented a horse stripped naked and arrived at the door Lady Godiva style The doorman looked her over and said OK the horse can come in but you have to stay outside Another guy desperate after repeated rejection tried to climb into the club through a vent but got stuck He was found a few days later in black tie dead OK the door policy was cruel but at least it kept Village Voice gossip columnist in chrysalis Michael Musto out And so the great party went jollily on night after night presided over by owner Steve Rubell irrepressible though always zonked on ludes co owner Ian Schrager the son of a Meyer Lansky lieutenant was all but invisible It seemed it would never end But all the while the shadow of doom was creeping nearer and nearer till came a day when it pulled off its whiskers and pounced It was Thursday Dec 14 1978 to be precise That was when a platoon of IRS agents who had been denied entrance when they came to boogie returned in a more official capacity They found numerous cash stuffed Hefty bags that had been hidden in the basement ceiling the skim and five packets of white powder I was there the night of the raid and the party was exceptionally good It was even better a year and a half later the night before Rubell and Schrager went to prison They had tried to implicate Jimmy Carter s Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan as a coke user in the meantime but the ploy didn t work Today Rubell is dead of AIDS and Schrager owns the half dozen most chic hotels in the United States Andy and Halston and Truman are dead along with an alarming percentage of those named in Haden Guest s index Studio 54 has had numerous reincarnations but the bloom was permanently off the thing by 1980 I know for since then I have been to the Tunnel the Red Zone Mirage Visage Mars Save the Robots the Ice Palace Crisco Disco G G Barnum s the Ritz the Roxy the Limelight the Cat Club Club USA the Palladium the Mudd Club AM PM Magique the Underground MK Area the Milk Bar Nell s the Jefferson the Surf Club the Peppermint Lounge the Pyramid Club the Continental Infinity Hurrah that

however been to a new club in the East Village called Studio Filthy Whore You might think that I spoof That I invent the names I do not These were nightclubs of the highest standing and chic Hundreds of thousands of aspiring fabulous people sought the entree to them All are defunct or moribund Today s club kids take boring drugs for days on end until they find themselves sawing the legs off their roommate s corpse as chief club kid Michael Alig was recently arrested for doing The Last Party leaves no doubt The New York nightworld is dead Let s go to Paris
