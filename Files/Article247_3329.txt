                                 Day Trading Is for Suckers                        In the wake of last weeks shootings at two day trading firms in Atlanta aspokesman for one of the companies said that these firms did a good job ofwarning prospective clients of the risks day trading entails and added that ifclients followed the rules the company laid out day trading was both easy andprofitable Now easy it may be although spending six and a half hours staringat a computer screen isnt my idea of fun Which makes you wonder why Im awriter But profitable day trading certainly isnt and the current mania forit is less a reflection of the moneymaking opportunities it offers than of theallure of easy credit and the seemingly unstoppable conviction of all gamblersthat the house can be beaten            The numbers are by this point well known but theyre no less staggering forall that Most estimates suggest that  to  percent of all day traders losemoney And thats in absolute terms These people leave their day tradingcareers with less money than they had when they started Those statistics saynothing about how many day traders lose money in relative terms which is tosay underperform the SP  If you do worse than an index fund youreeffectively losing money because you can invest in an index fund with no laboror opportunity cost at all Its probably safe to say that less than  percentof day traders are successful even without considering the opportunity cost ofall the time and energy they have to put into their trading            This is not needless to say surprising Day trading is predicated on afundamental misconception about the nature of stock prices namely that theyare somehow persistent and predictable Now some interesting academic studiesin recent years have called into question the idea that stock prices move onlyin a pure random walk ie theyre as likely to go up as go down at any onemoment But the walk is effectively random in the sense that patterns areincredibly hard to discern and basically impossible to take advantage of withany regularity In order to succeed as a day trader over time you have to beone thing incredibly lucky            The media sort of gets this But the attacks on day trading have gotten toomixed up with concerns about the impact of online brokerages the rise ofindividual investing and the mania for Net stocks These are distinctphenomena and have nothing to do with whats wrong with day trading In thelong run the impact of day trading on stock prices is negligible and althoughthe rise of the Net has facilitated day trading in fact day trading as itsdone at firms such as AllTech and Momentum looks more like old investing thannew investing in this sense The people who profit from day trading are notthe day traders but the firms that reap huge commissions from all the tradingjust as oldline brokers tended to encourage people to trade to increase churnin their accounts and boost commissions            The thing that is most remarkable about day trading though is the almostcomplete absence of a coherent investment theory that could justify thepractice If you read Warren Buffett or Peter Lynch or John Burr Williams youget a clear sense of the principles that guide their investing But if you talkto day traders and try to figure out why they believe they can beat the marketyou dont get any real ideas You just get a host of anecdotes about greattrades The press has exacerbated this problem by including in every articleabout day trading at least one character who says hes made hundreds ofthousands of dollars How he did it and why he doesnt get up from the tableand walk away always remain unexplained Lets face it If you go into anycasino theres going to be someone there whos up many thousands of dollarsThat may help us understand why people keep gambling It doesnt help explainwhat gambling really means economically            Finally its crucial to remember that day traders have the dubiousadvantage of playing with the houses money since most firms will lend them upto  percent of their existing capital to buy more stocks with That has twoconsequences It increases risk and it makes day traders performance evenless impressive If youre wagering  percent as much money as you have theprofits when you succeed will be greater than otherwise But so will be yourlosses What day traders need to ask themselves is If I had put  percent ofmy money in an index fund what would my returns have been But if they couldask themselves that question they wouldnt be day traders
