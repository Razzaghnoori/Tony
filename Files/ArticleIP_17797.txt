meeting with two colleagues Howard said I will have to be niggardly with this fund because it s not going to be a lot of money 3 One of the colleagues who was black stormed out and rumors spread that Howard had uttered a racist remark 4 Howard resigned because although his remark bore no racist intent he had failed to consider how it would be perceived 5 Williams accepted his resignation on the same grounds Conservative talk radio is having a field day with the story NAACP Chairman Julian Bond says people shouldn t have to censor their own speech to accommodate their listeners ignorance The spins 1 This is political correctness run amok 2 It s about sensitivity not intent 3 It s about black paranoia A leading black lawyer asked Do we really know where the Norwegians got the word 4 It s political correctness gridlock because Howard is gay and gay activists are now pressuring Williams to rehire him 5 Williams shamefully caved 6 Williams had to cave because he lacks credibility with

week the pope asked Carnahan to spare him Carnahan commuted Mease s sentence to life in prison but said he still supports the death penalty and made an exception for Mease only because of the coincidence of the pope being there and making a personal request that I chose to respond to Analysts pondered why the pope s request worked this time whereas similar pontifical pleas for mercy have failed in the past The spins 1 The pope is teaching U S politicians that capital punishment is wrong 2 U S politicians are teaching the pope that face to face visits and requests for personal favors are more effective than appeals to principle 3 According to Mease s mother God was on Darrell s side and God is the best lawyer you can get He s never lost a case 1 29 99 Pope John Paul II made his

counting each household argue that this method misses isolated and hard to track populations which are disproportionately black and Hispanic Since these groups tend to vote Democratic Democrats want to use sampling i e mathematical projection to theorize as to how many people the head count missed in various locations Republicans vehemently oppose this idea The superficial analysis is that the court struck down sampling and hurt the Democrats The sophisticated analysis is that the court nixed sampling only for the apportionment of congressional votes among states not for drawing district lines Therefore within states Democrats will try to use sampling to give black and Hispanic areas more representation at Republican expense The Democratic spin is that every individual ought to be counted The GOP spin is that taxpayers shouldn t have to pay for two census methods 1 27 99 Colombia suffered its worst earthquake since 1875 The quake killed at least 700 people and left at least 180

s successful lobbying for the 2002 Winter Olympics Other IOC members have resigned or are still being investigated Meanwhile an Australian official said he gave 70 000 to two IOC delegates just before the IOC awarded Sydney Australia the 2000 Summer Olympics by a two vote margin Cynics noting that officials in Nagano Japan which hosted the 1998 Winter games have already burned their documents predict the expanding investigation will show that corruption has permeated Olympics site selection for years The IOC promises to stop this corruption by taking away delegates voting rights and halting their visits to prospective host cities Critics spins 1 The IOC is corrupt throughout and the expulsions are a cover up 2 The IOC won t really be cleaned up until embarrassed corporate sponsors threaten to pull out 1 25 99 The first hand transplant in the United States was performed This follows a hand transplant performed in France last September Prior to that an attempt in the 1960s had failed because the patient s body rejected the new hand as foreign tissue The rosy spin Potent anti rejection drugs now make it possible to prevent the body from rejecting a new hand The
