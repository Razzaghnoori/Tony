                            Life is complicated It comes in all sorts of shapes sizes places and combinations        and has evolved a dizzying variety of solutions to the problem of carrying on living Yet        look inside a cell and life takes on if not simplicity then at least a certain        uniformitya genetic system based around nucleic acids for example and a common set of        chemical reactions for turning food into fuel And looked at in broad swathes life shows        striking generalities and patterns Every mammals heart will beat about one billion times        in its lifetime Both within and between species the density of a population declines in a        regular way as the size of individuals increases And the number of species in all        environments declines as you move from the equator towards the poles        Wouldnt it be good if there were a simple theory that used lifes shared fundamentals        to explain its largescale regularities via its diversity of individuals In the past few        years a team of ecologists and physicists have come up with just such a theory At its        heart is metabolism the way life uses energy is they claim a unifying principle for        ecology in the same way that genetics underpins evolutionary biology They believe that        energy use in the form of metabolic rate can be understood from the first principles of        physics and that metabolic rate can explain growth development population dynamics        molecular evolution the flux of chemicals through the environment and patterns of species        diversityto name a few        The work its originators insist is not a theory of everything for biology or even        ecology But it can often seem that way Were making advances on a broad range of        questions almost on a weekly basis says James Gillooly of the University of New Mexico        Albuquerque Weve been having an awful lot of fun                    Beneath the Surface        Metabolic ecology as it has become known is still controversial Some think its        mathematical foundations are unsound and that it explains nonexistent trends It also        divides researchers on philosophical linesthose that see lifes patterns as fundamental        versus those who think that variation is the key those who think that simple general        ideas can help us understand nature versus those who think that complicated problems        require complicated answers A lot is riding on the debate If the theory is right its        one of the most significant in biology for a long time says ecologist David Robinson of        the University of Aberdeen It would provide a common functional basis for all        biodiversity        Scientists have known for nearly two centuries that larger animals have relatively        slower metabolisms than small ones A mouse must eat about half its body weight every day        not to starve a human gets by on only  The first theories to explain this trend        developed in the late nineteenth century by the German nutritionist Max Rubner and the        French physiologist Charles Richet were based on the ratio between an animals surface        area which changes with the square of its length and its volume which is proportional to        its length cubed So large animals have proportionately less surface area lose heat more        slowly and pound for pound need less food The squareversuscube relationship makes the        area of a solid proportional to the twothird power of its mass so metabolic rate should        also be proportional to mass          For many years most biologists thought that it was        But in  Max Kleiber an animal physiologist working at the University of        Californias agricultural station in Davis reexamined the question and found that for        mammals and birds metabolic rate was mass         closer to three quarters than two thirds Kleiber looked at        animals ranging in size from a rat to a steer By the mids other workers had put        together a mouse to elephant curve that supported the threequarterpower law and by the        s the plot had been extended for everything from microbes to whales still seeming to        show the same relationship Quarterpower scaling also began to stretch beyond metabolic        rate Biological times such as lifespan and heart rate were found to be proportional to        mass          and fractions related to onequarter show up in other scaling        relationships the diameter of the aorta and tree trunks is proportional to mass          for example        It was however much harder to find a theoretical reason for why metabolic rate should        be proportional to mass         and more generally why quarterpower scaling laws should be so        prevalent in biology The impasse meant that by the mids interest in scaling had        waned But it sparked back into life in  when two ecologistsJames Brown of the        University of New Mexico Albuquerque and his graduate student Brian Enquist now at the        University of Arizona Tucsonand a physicist Geoffrey West of the Santa Fe Institute        developed a new explanation of why metabolic rate should equal the threequarter power of        body mass        West Brown and Enquists theory is based on the structure of biological distribution        networks such as blood vessels in vertebrates and xylem in plants The trio assumed that        metabolic rate equals the rate at which these networks deliver resources and that        evolution has minimized the time and energy needed to get materials from where they are        taken upthe lungs or roots for exampleto the cells They also assumed that although        organisms vary greatly in size the terminal units in their distribution networks such as        blood capillaries or leaf stalks do not        Bigger plants and animals take longer to transport materials and so use them more        slowly In West Brown and Enquists model the maximally efficient network that serves        every part of a body has a fractal structure showing the same geometry at different        scales And the number of uniform terminal units in such a networkand so the rate at which        resources are delivered to the cellsis proportional to the threequarter power of body        mass                    Pattern versus Variation        Whether metabolic rate really varies with the threequarter power of body mass is still        debatedsome researchers still favor twothirds others think that no one exponent fits all        the databut a majority of biologists favor threequarters And whether the fractal theory        really explains the relationship of metabolic rate to body size is also still contentious        In the most wideranging critique so far published this April two Polish researchers Jan        Kozlowski of Jagiellonian University Krakow and Marek Konarzewski of the University of        Bialystok claimed that the theorys maths could not simultaneously contain both uniform        terminal units and threequarterpower scaling that large animals built along such lines        would have more blood than their bodies could contain that biological scaling laws were        not built around quarter powers and that biological networks were not generally branching        fractals        I dont believe theres anything to explaintheres no universal scaling exponent        says Kozlowski He is also struck by what is left unexplained when size is accounted for        animals of the same size can still show more than an order of magnitude variation in        metabolic rate Whats striking in nature is the variability he says There are        regularities that call for explanation but that doesnt mean ignoring the variability is        correct Kozlowski is the coauthor of a theory that relates metabolic rate to cell size        and the amount of DNA an organism has one of several alternative explanations of the        scaling of metabolic rate published since West Brown and Enquists model        The criticisms are serious says Robinson The jury is outquestions about the        fundamental maths are worrying a few people On the other hand he says West Brown and        Enquists model seems a plausible template for designing an organism and its predictions        fit realworld data remarkably well Whether this fit truly captures the physical and        chemical mechanisms underlying the patterns remains to be seen Robinson hopes that        criticism can strengthen West Brown and Enquists model perhaps leading to a new        improved theory        The metabolic theorys authors are not budging Weve yet to see a criticism we feel we        cant answer pretty readily says Brown Kozlowski and Konarzewskis arguments are based        on a misreading of the work he says and criticisms that focus on one aspect such as the        structure of mammalian vascular systems miss the key point which is generality If were        wrong on quarter powers why do they keep showing up in everything from lifehistory        processes to evolutionary rates                    From Sharks to Tomatoes        After accounting for size Browns group turned its attention to the second most        important influence on metabolism temperature The effect is exponential and a  C rise        in body temperature equals a roughly  rise in metabolic rate The team built an        equation for metabolic rate that combined the mass         term with the Boltzmann factor The latter is an expression of the        probability that two molecules bumping into each other will spark a chemical reaction The        higher the temperature the greater the probability and the faster the reaction        Adding temperature explained much of the variation in metabolic rate that remained after        adjusting for size It also explained some of the metabolic differences between groups For        example a reptile has a slower metabolic rate than a mammal of the same size But        adjusting for its lower body temperature removes much of the difference suggesting that        the two groups share fundamental metabolic processes The same even goes for plants and        animals When you correct for size and temperature the metabolic rates of a shark a        tomato plant and a tree are remarkably similar Figure  says Gillooly who joined        Browns group as a grad student to work on the temperature question Its not yet clear        what the activation energy represents says Gillooly It could be a kind of average for all        the hundreds of chemical reactions in metabolism or maybe the energy needed to get over        one crucial hump in the path        The metabolic theorys third component resources is also something of a black box at        this stage Nutrient supply the team reasons is the next most important determinant of        metabolic rate and will account for some of the remaining unexplained variation As with        temperature the overall effect could be a balance of many processes or it could be due to        one limiting elementthe growth of lake phytoplankton is often limited by phosphorus for        example while for marine phytoplankton iron is usually the crucial nutrient Its a work        in progress says Brown But our vision for a metabolic theory of life is ultimately        going to include material resource limitation        These three things still do not account for all the variation in metabolic rate but        more detailed knowledge of species can yield more precise predictions Using body size        altitude and diet Brian McNab of the University of Florida Gainesville has explained         of the variation in metabolic rate for birds of paradise Figure  and  of the        rate variation in leafnosed bats Nevertheless when McNab sees attempts to explain        variation in metabolism using a few parameters applied across a wide range of sizes and        taxonomic groups what isnt explained strikes him as forcefully as what is        I have serious reservations as to whether there is a single relationship for body size        and metabolic rate he says I think we will be able to find generalizations in ecology        but theyre not going to be simplethere will be a bunch of clauses and restrictions and        animals have a lot of ways to bend the rules        No theory matches data exactly Brown points out having a baseline prediction for        metabolism lets you identify exceptional cases worthy of further investigation Viewed from        this angle the metabolic theory is a kind of null hypothesis of how organisms work Until        you have a theory that makes a prediction you dont know how to interpret any of the        variation says Brown And he adds despite this variation the underlying trends are        also meaningful There are themes of life that are deepseated and fundamental        All the business of life needs energy So if you know the rate at which an organism        burns fuelor if you know how big and hot it is and apply the metabolic theoryyou can        make a suite of predictions about its biology such as how fast it will grow and reproduce        and how long it will live        By correcting for mass and temperature Brown Gillooly and their colleagues believe        they have revealed underlying similarities in all the rates of life The hatching times for        egglaying animals including birds fish amphibians insects and plankton turn out to        follow the same relationshipif a fish egg were the same size and temperature as a bird        egg it would take equally long to hatch Figure  The same goes for growth a tree and a        mammal of equal size and temperature would gain mass at the same speed And size and        temperature even explain much of the variation in mortality rates between specieswhich one        might have thought to be strongly dependent on external factors such as predatorsperhaps        through metabolisms influence on aging processes such as freeradical damage to the        genome                    One Rule for All        If all organisms work in the same way understanding individual biology offers an        obvious route to explaining natures patternsecological processes become a kind of        metametabolism Indeed the team has used their theory to predict the flux of carbon        dioxide through forestsa measure more usually used to determine individual metabolic rate        They have also found that body size and temperature predict the densities and growth rates        of populations So hotter environments should support lower population densities as each        individual consumes resources more quickly leaving less to go round One thing that does        not scale with a quarter power of body size is the area of animals home ranges this        increases more or less linearly with body size But in October Brown along with        researchers from Princeton University and the Institute of Zoology in London published a        model that brought this too into the metabolic theory They borrowed another trick from        physics using an equation that describes colliding gas molecules to model the interactions        between neighboring animals        Temperature could also explain why biodiversity peaks at the equator the team believes        Organisms with faster metabolisms have faster mutation rates So the genomes of smaller        hotter animals change more quickly and they will also get through their generations more        rapidly One would therefore expect to see more new species created in small organisms and        warm environments The largescale trend in all these rateshatching time individual and        population growth ecosystem metabolism DNA substitutionis closely proportional to a        quarter power of body mass        In the future Browns group plans to examine the dynamics of colonial organisms and        societies through the lens of metabolic ecology instead of capillaries the terminal units        of the networks would become ants or people There are also many applied problems within        the theorys scope including some of the most significant human impacts on the biosphere        Carbon emissions and the consequent global warming are increasing both the temperature and        nutrient supply And exploited populations such as fisheries often show a decrease in        individual size as larger animals are preferentially killed Both these would tend to        speed up biological processes Another team of United States and Italian researchers has        found that the same model that describes the growth of individuals can also predict the        growth of tumors hinting that metabolic ecology may have medical applications        Brown hopes that metabolic ecology will one day become an uncontroversial part of        researchers toolkits like the theories population geneticists use to predict changes in        the frequencies of genes Before that happens both the theorys proponents and its        opponents have years of work ahead of them Adopting the theory may also require a shift in        ecologists worldview Most ecologists work by carrying out experimental manipulations on        small groups of similar organisms the warblers in a woodland for example or the grasses        of a meadow When they build models they do so from empirical data not from physical        first principles The philosophy behind metabolic ecology disconcerts many researchers        says Robinson A lot of traditional biologists are uncomfortable with thinking about data        in these terms        Kozlowski doubts that simple theories can make precise predictions about the behavior of        biological systems on large scales He believes that metabolic ecology risks leading the        discipline up a blind alley If Im right and the basic model contains an error        correcting the results will be a very long process If theyre not right theyll have done        a disservice to ecology        But many ecologists are more optimistic that some unifying principles of nature can be        found and that metabolic ecology and the debate around it is a step in the right        direction Some think the theory may be part of an even grander idea Stephen Hubbell of        the University of Georgia is one of the architects of another idea causing a stir among        ecologists Called neutral ecology it proposes a general explanation of how competition        between individuals produces the dynamics of birth death and migration seen in        ecosystems and its predictions match closely the abundance and diversity of species in the        wild He believes that metabolic and neutral ecology can become elements of some larger        theoretical framework        Ive never been more excited in my life says Hubbell Ecology now is like quantum        mechanics in the swere on the cusp of some major rearrangements and syntheses Im        having a lot of fun
