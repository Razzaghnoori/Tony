 5 Legal Groups at 1 Locale To Serve the February 3 2002 Vulnerable Salt Lake City Tribune BY EDWARD MCDONOUGH Five independent Salt Lake organizations that provide legal services to the poor ethnic minorities seniors and people with disabilities have joined together to acquire a west side downtown building where they will have their offices The new Community Legal Center at 205 N 400 West is a project of And Justice for All which until this venture has been a joint fund raising campaign by an alliance of the non profit providers of free legal services And Justice for All which solicits donations primarily from Utah lawyers and foundations was the first joint fund raising campaign of legal services agencies in the country and the Community Legal Center is the first joint office project of public service law groups The Legal Aid Society of Salt Lake the Disability Law Center the Multi Cultural Legal Center the Senior Lawyer Volunteer Project and Utah Legal Services will share the new facility and last Wednesday their board members were given a tour of the Community Legal Center hosted by staff members of the five agencies All of the agencies can share the same reception area and client waiting room The building is close in across the street from West High and two blocks from the Gateway It has its own parking something that s hard to find downtown and which has been a problem for staff as well as clients Owning and sharing the building and not paying rent times five will save the non profit agencies about 375 000 each year My assistant Charity Christenson pointed out that the shared facility will also be efficient for those needing legal services No longer will a woman desperate for a protective order for example have to run all over town trying to find the right agency After the tour we found Jaye Olafson at the cookies and brownies reception on the first floor Jaye and her husband Erik own Tomax Technologies and were the sellers of the building Jaye explained how much of the renovation had been merely uncovering what was already there The hardwood floors wooden ceilings and brick and stone interior walls were all hidden behind coverings and old paint She loves the building and they only moved out because the business had outgrown the space So they renovated the old Sweet Candy Company building for Tomax The Olafsons are delighted with the new owners The building had been like home she explained and so it was important who would be living there I noted on the donor list that the couple through Olafson Group had become one of the major supporters of the project Stewart Ralphs the executive director of the Legal Aid Society explained that the Community Legal Center Campaign still has a long ways to go with a bit more than half of the 4 million projected cost received so far There still needed to be furnishings and office equipment and such He promised that they would be getting in touch with us later on the subject
