 hi hi uh as a matter of fact this past weekend since we had a long weekend i uh took on a painting project in my bathroom and i had wallpaper up i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that and it took me all weekend because uh the wallpaper getting it off i had to wet the walls down and that had to dry and then the spackling had to dry a day and then the painting took another day you didn t try we rewallpapering you just uh no i i just painted did you use a textured paint or uh no actually the wall behind the paper was smooth so i just used a like a semigloss um and well did you get good results well no not really i need to it it looks so bad you can see where those spackling marks were i need to uh either paper back over it or do something yeah but just didn t it didn t it didn t cover it yeah it covered the spots pretty good but it didn t excuse me it didn t uh uh it just didn t look as smooth as i wanted it to well we did a uh we moved oh last August and we re getting a house my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den and we decided we went to i ve forgotten one of the paint stores and they just said oh you can get by and i forgotten what it was you put down and then you can just paint right over the dark uh huh well more or less after about uh half dozen coats it looks reasonable but it kept the the dark it was uh just a real dark uh wood grain type paneling uh huh and uh it was smooth and uh and we would we put this stuff on and and it supposedly textured it or did something to it and but because of the the dark behind it was really hard to cover and was it like a primer yeah it was something like that although we sort of when we got through i wished we hadn t done it because we were you know we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it and we were painting it and trying to do uh you know make it and it it really was you know the advice they give you is uh the job was considerably tougher than we thought yeah uh particularly when you try to i was talking to somebody else who who had a lot of wood paneling and uh they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate and it seemed like there was it was a good sized den with a lot paneling and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something oh my goodness that s an awful lot have you have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted not inside now uh when we bought the house that we live in right now we had a company that came out and painted it that was one of the requirements from you know FHA yeah that the house be painted before we bought it and it was fairly reasonable we have a brick house but all the trim yeah around the house was uh if i remember right it was like uh five hundred dollars oh that s quite reasonable yeah yeah so that wasn t too bad um the problem is have you have you tried matching paint lately no i haven t my wife we we built a shed over the long way actually it took this is not on the topic but i did finish it but my wife went to the uh Home Depot i think it was and and took a uh a copy took a piece of brick uh huh and she wanted to paint the shed it s a it s a wooden shed uh and she took it and they ve got this machine that matches the color of paint uh huh and uh they got and uh and in fact she put some right back she got they mixed uh a gallon of it and uh it s just remarkable how close it will match the paint uh and it does it uh oh electronically some something magic oh so they did do a good job yeah you know they but it s electronic yeah uh you put your sample under this thing and it looks at it and and uh and determines the and it it s really remarkable uh the problem they had and then they wanted some gray to do the to do the trim uh huh and uh but they didn t didn t occur to them that um that they could have taken a sample uh huh um from i forgotten this is Sherwin Williams Paint or something but anyway it s it s remarkable that s one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the you know you want this you want this to look like this and you want that to look like that and of course if it s all white you re all right but when you start getting into colors have you had problems getting colors to match uh huh yeah yeah as a matter of fact uh what we ve got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and a uh a blue and the blue even so many years two years later or so it doesn t match um you know so it s the very same type of paint and everything gosh so so you so what s your what s the solution then oh i have no idea i repainted the whole thing oh my well at least you ll get very good at it right yeah you could go back and and paint the whole thing over that s uh this is an interesting topic that they would bring up painting because it uh it seems like everybody has a you know to go in and do i ll just do a little bit here and a little that yeah yeah although the uh it s uh it we almost one day we painted the house to uh we painted we painted the whole inside and it had all this dark trim we thought uh you know we did the one wall but the other trim i m trying to think i think i think we left most of it because it gets to be uh they don t do that in the newer houses now we don t the uh mold everything is white in a new house everything is white yeah that s right white yeah that s what we re trying to get ours to look like oh good luck we wound up selling the house actually i i don t know whether it made actually it does it s interesting that the white um yeah makes the rooms look bigger one of the in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room it has molding uh like picture frames i don t know what you call that that actually that are along the walls you know up a couple of feet uh huh uh huh and my wife painted those the insides of those dark blue oh i see and uh it makes the room look remarkably smaller huh she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim what color the trim is still white okay white the the molding but by and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive but it makes the room look smaller which is uh uh huh yeah yeah uh which is it explains why they why they have everything white but i you wouldn t think that i well yeah yeah maybe that understands colors would know all of that stuff but well uh what about the lighting did it make a big difference uh not particularly because the house has so many windows uh it has the the the living room has four uh good size windows oh uh huh and uh well of course at night but with the we have we have we have a soccer field that s um oh about a hundred yards from our house uh huh and the lights shine right at our house it s kind of we didn t know that when we bought the house but so that uh you get some the color doesn t really matter for because you have that light yeah we have a lot of light yeah and well it it it um well it s just uh i think it s just the the the dark blue to about three feet and then above that we left it white so anyway it didn t change but the the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away it didn t it kind of bled under the masking tape which i guess is probably the topic we re I see uh huh we re really on to that that the masking is you have to do that very very carefully and it takes a long time that s right you can work yourself to death well i m sorry to hear your color didn t come out so good over the weekend yeah really no kidding it s kind of frustrating it is a lot of work a lot of work well i ve got to go to a meeting it s been good talking to you nice talking to you thanks a lot bye okay good bye
