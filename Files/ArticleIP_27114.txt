 Firing Blanks In recent days the National Rifle Association and its allies have argued that additional gun laws would not have helped avert the April 20 Colorado high school massacre because gun laws already on the books proved useless Why propose more gun laws since the Colorado killers had broken 17 laws anyway asked House Republican Conference chairman J C Watts Jr R Okla Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer 18 gun laws were violated and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott R Miss 17 to 19 laws We have lots of laws on the books echoed this construction The NRA s latest tally provided to Slate Tuesday lists 20 laws allegedly violated in the massacre But on closer inspection the list evaporates A Distractions The first four laws cited by the NRA concern bombs 1 Possession of a destructive device i e bomb 2 Manufacturing a destructive device i e bomb 3 Use of an explosive or incendiary device in the commission of a felony 4 Setting a device designed to cause an explosion upon being triggered What do bomb laws have to do with gun laws According to the NRA nothing Incredibly we ve been asked if we would support an instant check on explosives purchases NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre noted with disgust in a speech at Saturday s NRA convention Well I don t have to tell you we re not the National Explosives Association So why does the NRA include bomb laws on its list To pad the total B Tautologies Nine other laws on the list concern the use of guns to commit the massacre 5 Use of a firearm or destructive device i e bomb to commit a murder that is prosecutable in a federal court 6 Possession of a firearm or destructive device i e bomb in furtherance of a crime of violence that is prosecutable in a federal court 7 Brandishing a firearm or destructive device i e bomb in furtherance of a crime of violence that may be prosecuted in a federal court 8 Discharging a firearm or destructive device i e bomb in furtherance of a crime of violence that may be prosecuted in a federal court 9 Conspiracy to commit a crime of violence prosecutable in federal court 15 Possession of a firearm on school property 16 Discharge of a firearm on school property with a reckless disregard for another s safety 18 Intentionally aiming a firearm at another person 19 Displaying a firearm in a public place in a manner calculated to alarm The salient feature of these nine laws is that the killers violated them during the massacre not beforehand To say that these laws were violated is merely to say that the massacre happened i e that two kids walked into a school and brandished aimed and discharged firearms in a manner calculated to alarm people endanger the safety of others and further a crime of violence It is meaningless to bring up these laws in a discussion of prevention Like murder laws they are designed to prevent a killer s second crime not his first C Laws not violated or not known to have been violated 12 Possession of a handgun by a person under age 18 13 Providing a handgun to a person under age 18 14 Licensed dealers may sell rifles and shotguns only to persons age 18 or over and handguns to persons age 21 or over Persons under age 18 are prohibited from possessing handguns from anyone dealer or not 17 Possession interstate transportation sale etc of a stolen firearm 20 Possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number It is not known however whether the 17 year old perpetrator possessed the handgun used in the crime concedes the NRA The other perpetrator was 18 years old According to the New York Times the man who evidently bought the gun and passed it to the killers was 22 years old and investigators don t know whether he sold gave or lent the gun or which gunman was the recipient As for the other three guns the Times says the 17 year old perpetrator s 18 year old girlfriend has admitted buying two shotguns and a rifle for him But she was not charged because it is legal in Colorado for a minor to own shotguns and rifles There is no evidence that any of the guns was stolen Also the NRA concedes that it has only been suggested that at least one of the firearms used in the crime had an obliterated serial number D Duplicates Two statutes on the list ban possession of certain kinds of weapons essentially duplicating other statutes on the list that ban acquisition of those weapons 10 Possession of a short barreled shotgun 12 Possession of a handgun by a person under age 18 E Formalities So the list of relevant laws known to have been violated boils down to one 11 Manufacturing a sawed off shotgun This law prohibited the two perpetrators from making a sawed off shotgun However no law prohibited them from acquiring both a shotgun and a saw So this law means nothing Would the additional laws proposed by President Clinton last week have made any difference One of them would prohibit 18 to 20 year olds from possessing handguns If that law had been passed and effectively enforced it would have prevented the elder gunman from acquiring the handgun used in the massacre Another of Clinton s proposals would hold negligent parents liable for crimes committed with guns by their kids This law might or might not have prompted the parents of the Colorado killers to intervene before the massacre It is always possible that more gun laws would not have helped But the NRA s bogus list proves nothing
