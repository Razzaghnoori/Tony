Carvell You wake up one bright autumn morning and you re halfway to the subway when you decide to walk to work instead But you don t go to work Instead somehow you find yourself at the Central Park Zoo The zoo just opened and there s no one there and it s clear and bright and so quiet you can hear the seals break the water as they circle their pool and the gulls fighting the kept birds for their seed You close your eyes and think about other mornings mornings on the boats back in Nova Scotia The wet wool smell of your uncles in their Eaton s sweaters and army surplus peacoats and shredded wheat for breakfast and thin ice on the tide pools and diesel as the engines kick in Then you hear another noise a cry for help It s winsome and multitalented Reese Witherspoon and she s accidentally dropped her new baby in the polar bear cage You don t think you just act and endless seconds later the baby is back in Reese Witherspoon s arms But something else is bothering Reese She s crying but

hit by the meteorite Chris Kelly Click for more answers Randy s Wrap Up When is a threat real and when is it exaggerated for political interest like the missile gap or the bomber gap or the 80 death threats against New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani this year up from last year s total of 77 That danger is very very real declared Deputy Chief Daniel Oates testifying in federal court Monday as to why protests on the steps of City Hall must be limited to 50 people a limitation set for the first time in the city s history I have to take the position that anyone in that crowd might have some evil intent said the chief And that you are an evil space robot Taste lead evil robot Blam Blam Blam he did not add The chief stressed that this beefed up security is in no way intended to stifle dissent Nor is it evidence of a megalomaniac mayor with a puffed up sense of self importance Nor is it simply a chance for any city official to indulge a personal taste for martial law surrounding himself with a hunky praetorian guard manly men whose manliness glistens in the light of their boots burnished to a fine sheen by the sweaty exertions of muscular comrades in arms who I m sorry Could you repeat the question Caught Unawares Answer The New York State Health Department warns that you might be bitten by a rabid bat and not even know it Merlin D Tuttle thinks they re a bunch of hysterics The health department Not the bats of whom only 3 percent to 4 percent are rabid and if they bit you you d know it The NYSHD recommends rabies shots if a bat is found in the same room with a sleeping person or unattended child even if it is not known if the person has been bitten or if the bat has rabies or if the child is very nice To help sound the alarm the NYSHD distributes a Bat Rabies Alert refrigerator magnet and a poster with a sinister bat silhouette If you see me tell an adult Says the bat not Pat Buchanan who probably doesn t have rabies either Bat Conservation International the organization in whose magazine Merlin D Tuttle made his comment says that there has never been a case of rabies from an unnoticed bite But that doesn t impress the NYSHD s comically named spokeswoman Claire Pospisil A name even sillier than Merlin D Tuttle Imagine the childhood teasing There must be days when she yearns for the sweet release of an unnoticed bite from a rabid bat Let s say you wake up in a room and there s a bat in there and the bat flies out the window says Pospisil hoping to be taken seriously The health department would recommend you get treatment The treatment comprises six injections over 28 days and costs about 1 000 If untreated rabies is fatal New York state has recorded only a single bat rabies fatality in 45 years It was not Pat Buchanan Technologically Blessed
