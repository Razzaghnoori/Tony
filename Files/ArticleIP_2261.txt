 Lying All the Way to the Bank By Jacob Weisberg On the last day of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago I woke to the news that presidential adviser Dick Morris was about to resign over reports that he had been consorting with a 200 an hour prostitute I was of course amazed But then I thought Why should anyone be surprised Morris is a 200 an hour prostitute Things have changed since then Morris has raised his prices Now a normal person would be offended by what I ve just written In Morris case though I m afraid he may use it as a blurb for the paperback edition of his book Behind the Oval Office The current version includes this blurb from a brutal demolition job in Vanity Fair He never stops Somehow each shocking thing he does tops the shocking thing he did last year or last month or even last week Morris career has developed the curious quality of a plea bargain in reverse If you say he s guilty of a misdemeanor he will try to persuade you he s actually committed a felony In reality he s not fit to stand trial Morris discusses right and wrong as if those concepts were as remote from his own experience as lunar geology I wanted to address the values agenda three or four times a week he writes at one point in the book First though we had to identify through polls which values were important to Americans Blind people often have highly developed powers of hearing and smell but in Morris case he does not seem to have compensated for an attenuated moral sense with any other heightened abilities not intelligence not political savvy and certainly not literary acumen Despite being rotten to the core Dick Morris demonstrates in his book that he has nothing else to offer Morris casts himself of course as the man who brought Bill Clinton back from calamity and got him re elected in 1996 Most of the press fell for this hype during the campaign But Morris own account undermines the myth By claiming credit for absolutely everything Morris leaves you wondering whether he deserves credit for anything at all To call his recollections unreliable would be a massive understatement There is hardly anything he says in the book that he does not contradict at some other point in the book Usually the mutually contradictory statements fall within a few pages of each other Here are just a few subjects where Morris leaves the reader absolutely mystified about his views and his role Negative advertising On page 60 Morris swears off it As Eileen Morris wife who is now divorcing him and my therapist Dr Elizabeth Hauser softened my rage and brought me inner peace for the first time in my life I decided to abandon negative advertising as a m tier On page 63 Morris boasts about an ad he had produced for Clinton attacking an opponent in the 1990 Arkansas gubernatorial primary Don t let McRae build a wall around Arkansas Five pages after that Morris brags about his script for an ad in the general election of that year It culminated in this assertion You can t trust Sheffield Nelson Foreign intervention Noninvolvement in Bosnia had been a central element in my advice he writes on page 253 But just a few pages earlier Morris was taking credit for Clinton s brave decision to send troops to Bosnia And a few pages later he s telling the president to bomb the Serbs back to the Stone Age I don t mean the current stuff where NATO sends in only a few planes he counsels I mean an air strike that continues until they give up Press leaks Throughout my tenure at the White House I never leaked information unless I was told to Morris writes on page 171 On the same page I called David Broder of the Washington Post to give him background on the strategic implications of the speech and he ran a story The call wasn t authorized in fact Morris got in trouble for it he says Budget cuts On page 93 Morris advises Clinton Medicare cuts are your single biggest weapon against the Republicans They are hated by the public old and young Three pages later he writes I argued that as long as we lined up with the congressional Democrats and just sniped at cuts in school lunches and Medicare we would get nowhere This last contradiction is central because it goes to the heart of Morris claim to have got Clinton re elected The conventional understanding at the time was that it was Morris liberal enemies George Stephanopoulos Harold Ickes and Leon Panetta who were arguing in favor of fiercely resisting Republican cuts in social spending while Morris was telling Clinton to distance himself from the intransigent congressional Democrats According to my sources at the time Morris was desperately pushing for a budget deal and making the kind of hilariously precise electoral promises for which he was legendary If he compromised with Gingrich Clinton would win by a 14 point margin take back Congress and so forth In reality both plans were in play in the re election effort Morris triangulation and the Ickes Panetta Stephanopoulos tactic of standing firmly against Republican cuts in Medicare Medicaid education and the environment Both strategies were crucial Clinton recovered his lost popularity by resisting domestic budget cuts while his centrist values agenda helped to solidify his electoral gains In retrospect Clinton appears to have shrewdly pitted the Ickes group against Morris as an exercise in the management style FDR called creative tension Clinton needed Ickes to help him shore up his liberal base and prevent a Democratic primary challenge He used Morris to help him move to the center Morris tries to take credit for both strategies But if there was a great political mind behind this synthesis it was that of the candidate himself Getting the president re elected is only one of the many many accomplishments claimed by Morris who plays both Boswell and Johnson in his memoirs You may not have known that it was Morris who had suggested Al Gore for vice president in 1992 and that it was Morris who had recommended James Carville as strategist in that campaign Through secret back channels to other political consultants Morris tells us that he managed relations between Clinton and Boris Yeltsin It was none other than Morris who played a pivotal role in the Dayton Peace Accords Richard Holbrooke to Morris Without those words of the president s that you passed to me I would never have been able to get it done And it was Morris ideas that kept Clinton on track even after his Morris downfall Clinton to Morris We re basically following your game plan It s working well But even as he emulates the rooster that thinks the sun rises because it crows Morris demonstrates how right Panetta and the others were to be terrified about his running amok in the White House Among the Morris microinitiatives that didn t quite make it were a 33 cent postage stamp with a penny going to your favorite charity and a plan to force banks to meet new anti mugging standards for ATM machines Morris small bore ideas as he calls them made the presidency look somewhat ridiculous in 1995 and 1996 The ones that were killed in the crib would have turned neo Clintonism into a full scale self parody Through it all Morris maintains that what he was doing was really very high minded I don t spin anything he writes huffily I put new substance and ideas before the voters Even as we see him fighting to reduce governing to the most trivial micro pandering Morris asserts the primacy of principle Some reporters seem to think that the real story is never the candidate s idea but always the motivation to improve his or her political status he writes A few pages later of course he s explaining why Clinton had to sign a welfare bill that no one liked in order to get re elected a veto would have meant a three point loss By the end of his book Morris has cast himself as a modest egomaniac a shy publicity hound a principled manipulator a loyal traitor and a truthful liar He isn t just confused he s the dialectic incarnate He aims for evil but only manages to look ridiculous
