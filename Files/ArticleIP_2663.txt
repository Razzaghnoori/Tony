 The Hunger Food is not the boss in my life I am stronger than the temptation of any food from the Richard Simmons home page Then again maybe not Americans spend 30 billion a year on weight loss programs but obesity resists treatment more tenaciously than do viruses 90 percent to 95 percent of people who lose weight eventually regain it Why is that We ve learned much in the last few years about the role that hunger plays in obesity Drug companies have capitalized on that knowledge to create powerful new appetite suppressants But these cures come with serious risks Researchers linked the popular diet drug combination fen phen to a rare heart disease a year ago But doctors continued to prescribe it to millions arguing that the health risks associated with obesity justified fen phen s wide use Now reports of new heart abnormalities in women on fen phen raise fresh questions about using pills for obesity before all the facts are in Scientists didn t always view appetite as a cause of obesity The dominant thinking for more than two decades was that the obese gained weight because they burned fewer calories In experiments overfed or underfed volunteers always returned to their original weight the setpoint when they ceased their diets Also when obese dieters lost weight their metabolism slowed conserving calories and driving their weight back to the setpoint It seemed that obese people s only option was a combination of starvation and exercise while skinny people got to feast and watch television In the late 60s amphetamine which increases metabolism became the rage for dieters But it didn t keep the weight off and proved to be addictive As it turned out thin people didn t have higher metabolic rates On high calorie diets they gained weight just as easily as obese people In fact obese people had to eat more to put on a given amount of weight The metabolism of obese dieters never slowed enough to explain how quickly their weight bounced back They were also eating more Put simply even at their baseline weight obese people eat more than thin people Swedish studies of pregnant women demonstrate this observation Women weighed about a pound more one year after delivery than at the start of pregnancy Some gained more than a pound and many returned to their old weight How were the gainers different from the non gainers Mainly they ate more total calories especially in the form of snacks Although gainers ate lunch less often their snacking increased to three or more times per day The study also demonstrated another frustrating fact about setpoints they re easier to increase than decrease Experts believe that once you ve put on extra weight for six months to a year the setpoint resets as it does after pregnancy To permanently lower the setpoint you must keep weight off for about three years perhaps longer Until recently nothing short of has kept the seriously obese from eating as much as they want to The big breakthrough in understanding obesity came in 1994 when experiments on lab mice revealed that the hormone leptin controls the setpoint by controlling satiety When your weight falls leptin decreases hunger increases and you eat more until you return to your weight setpoint This year researchers in Cambridge England found an inbred family whose members all lacked the gene for producing leptin Without leptin to signal satiety the children in this family eat ravenously The 2 year old weighs 64 pounds and the 8 year old 189 pounds These leptin findings imply that hormones and neurotransmitters control the instinctual desire to eat overwhelming willpower in the process In evolutionary terms this makes sense The drive to find and eat food was integral to the survival of our early ancestors People who gorged themselves survived winter famines and reproduced more than others But this behavior became maladaptive when access to round the clock hamburgers and ice cream became the norm Now as we gain weight and push our setpoints upward we are reprogrammed to eat even more The leptin breakthrough spurred efforts to manipulate the brain s hunger centers In 1995 a combination of two drugs fenfluramine and phentermine fen phen was shown to suppress appetite enough to help the severely obese lose an average of 24 pounds after two years Fenfluramine increases the brain s serotonin levels Prozac does too but not as dramatically to produce a sense of satiety Phentermine is a relative of amphetamine that reduces hunger and increases metabolism Not surprisingly when the obese patients stopped taking these drugs their weights returned to baseline levels But fen phen was the first drug therapy proven to reduce weight over the long haul Other drugs for the hyperhungry are on the way Dexfenfluramine tradenamed Redux a cousin of fenfluramine was just released Sibutramine with fen phen s effects in one pill and orlistat which prevents fat absorption from the intestines are undergoing Food and Drug Administration approval testing Leptin analogues chemical cousins are also being developed Effective hunger control will probably require lifelong therapy with multiple drugs like these The first warning that these drugs could pose health risks came a year ago when the New England Journal of Medicine published an article by French researchers linking fen phen to a deadly cardiac disease called primary pulmonary hypertension The study suggested that between 23 and 46 of every 1 million patients taking fen phen would die from the condition each year At my hospital a young woman died from it after taking fen phen for 24 days to lose weight for her wedding Yet the New England Journal of Medicine downplayed the risks at the time It simultaneously published an editorial speculating that fen phen would save more lives by reducing obesity than the associated heart disease would kill The French findings were basically ignored Eighteen million prescriptions were filled for fen phen in the United States last year Physicians opened offices and Internet sites to do nothing but prescribe fen phen and weight loss operations like Jenny Craig and Nutri System placed fen phen prescription writing doctors at the center of their programs Fen phen consumption began to fall only this month when the New England Journal of Medicine essentially withdrew its earlier cost benefit argument with the emergency release of startling new fen phen findings Researchers in Minnesota and Nebraska documented 24 cases of unusual heart valve abnormalities in women taking fen phen The average age of the patients was 43 and five required valve replacement surgery This week the FDA reported 58 new cases of abnormal heart valves in patients on fen phen and the Journal of the American Medical Association reported animal evidence linking both dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine to toxic brain effects There are three reasons why nobody should have bought the obesity is deadlier argument 1 Obesity s risks come from high blood pressure high cholesterol diabetes and heart disease each of which can be controlled with safe medicines 2 The mildly overweight don t run these health risks yet drug companies are using results from 300 pounders to sell drugs to 140 pounders who want to look good at the beach 3 Even in the seriously obese we don t know that these drugs really will save more than they kill because no studies have been done Meanwhile the drug lobby is blocking the FDA from monitoring for bad outcomes after it approves drugs Fen phen isn t our first go round with a miracle cure for obesity and it isn t likely to be our last In the late 80s doctors inflated a balloon device in obese patients stomachs Because patients couldn t eat nearly as much they lost weight and kept it off But some of the balloons deflated and got stuck in the intestines Only after several people died was the device pulled off the market The dieters craving for something to quiet their hunger is almost as great as their craving for food
