 I m interviewing Avis Gregory Avis is from NY and she s 42 years old She s Black American And Avis has some stories that she d like to um tell us regarding reading and um some experiences she s had with books and with teachers Now Avis you had mentioned to me before about you had a fifth grade teacher who you really enjoyed who uh got you excited about reading But did you have any other uh experiences with reading that brings back memories prior to fifth grade or did it really start with fifth grade Umm reading has always been a passion for me and um that was probably one of my favorite Christmas presents growing up My mom knew that if she got me a new book I was happy Umm so it didn t just begin in fifth grade but when you had um asked me about my favorite book Um hum it took me back to fifth grade because that s when I fell in love with my favorite book Well it s one of my favorite books now but then it was it became my passion What fav favorite book was that Do you remember Yes of course It was the dictionary Oh really Yes I just did a report on the dictionary Really Well she part of the fifth grade teachers had pretty much required five word that you learn five words a day 25 words a week And that was pretty much it as far as vocabulary and spelling Um hum Mrs Agee was I think was perceived by a lot of the kids as a tyrant but her um I don t know exactly how to express it intensity regarding That s a good word Um grammar and English It was just something that I kind of gobbled up It was wonderful for me She required 20 words a day a hundred words And you had to not only be able spell it and give a definition for it but also had to be able to use it in a sentence Ooh And so vocabulary became electric for me I mean I just and and therefore the dictionary itself became something that I really I mean if I had to choose one book besides my Bible it would be the dictionary I don t think I could live without it That s amazing because most people when when they talk about their favorite book it s usually a short story or a novel that is a prose And certainly the dictionary isn t prose So that is really unusual I ve never heard of somebody who had their favorite book as the dictionary Oh So that s that s really interesting Now you had to learn 20 words a day So a hundred words a week That s right How did you go about doing that Oh we had assignments where um we had to um write out the definition actually write out you know using the word in a sentence And we had um spelling bee types of situations where we had to spell the word Um we tested on it and um but it was like every week like clockwork Um we were expected to to um produce you know this homework And um for me it was exciting and fun Everybody else was like Oh no Please not this And she gave you the 20 words Oh yes Uh huh And then did you have to look them up yourself Absolutely So that s how your involvement got in with the dictionary You had to look them up yourself Yes Well what about looking up words Why would that be an exciting thing for you Well um at heart I m pretty much an adventurer and um as a child uh stories were one way of exploring um for me But um when I don t know I learn something new it just feeds something inside of me that uh I don t know maybe my enthusiasm for life is just taken to another another level As an adult uh of course it has expanded into other areas but I still um enjoy uh spending time with my friend the dictionary Um one of the things that my husband teases me about is that when when I have episodes during my chronic illness and I have to be horizontal um sometimes I ll play Scrabble by myself And I ll play both sides and but I don t play of course the way you would in competition But I have my dictionary there so I can say Ok now what You know this looks like it ought to be a word let s see if there s anything So I use it as a learning experience and find out new things Interesting I ve never heard of it solo That s really interesting When um when you went beyond the fif that was the fifth grade wasn t it When you went beyond fifth grade um did you continue on did the next teacher continue on that passion with vocabulary Um not really Um but when I left fifth grade I also left Brooklyn and when I came to the VA school system things were very different Actually um there was a sense in which I think I was a little bit ahead of where folks were um in VA at that time Um in the um the middle school it was a major adjustment for me culturally Um where we were from in Brooklyn it was a very multicultural environment and um it was very all the races were kind of accepted to a certain degree Um actually um I didn t even have any kind of racial um prejudicial type experience except for um from Blacks which Huh that s unusual Which I know Well not really not as unusual as you might think But um when we moved to VA and I started to go to school here um the rejection I got was because I was a Northerner and uh well not here because I am in Charlotte now but there Um hum And uh they were very unhappy with the way I spoke and um I tended to stay to myself I tended to read a lot I really with withdrew socially Um hum To into books And um the teachers themselves didn t necessarily emphasize it it just became the library became my favorite place Humm And if at all possible I would get permission like to spend my lunch hours and to um spend my homeroom hours anytime I could get to the library it was uh a haven for me And uh uh I prob the librarian was probably my my best friend I can imagine why Yeah it was uh a a good outlet for me In fact I um when I got to high school which was in VA I um I remember beginning in the biography section and just starting with A And just reading each book and um just keeping on going until I got to the end and um Boy that was a real task wasn t it I didn t consider it a task It was wonderful I mean I would devour a book a day and my mom would say Honey take your nose out of a that book and SOCIALIZE Talk to your brothers and sisters I would read while I ate I d read on the bus I would read while I walked down the street if I could get away with it So you were really absorbed in that I did I read all the time All consuming It was It was And my mom had to really stay on me to be more well rounded um because it was very easy for me to escape into that because I was um rejection was that was very hard to to deal with And one of the things that I did attempted to do was to absorb the language around me and that was part of my my interest I mean I al because we were always around so many different cultures I always had an interest in language and an interest in cultures When we moved to VA it was not as diversified It was almost that was where it was like uh I really got to see black and white division I went to school at a predominately white uh school after my sixth and seventh grades Uh uh And umm I didn t have a problem with that I mean I grew up accepting all races so I didn t have a problem with that But because I didn t have a problem with that there were those who had a problem with me With you And so umm so it was very easy for me to withdraw from people into a world of reading Um hum And uh it s more balanced now But I don t have to do that Do you ever look back and and regret the fact that you spent all that time in those books Do you think in other words do you look at your experience as being a negative one and it drew you into forced you into those books or did you think it was in some odd way more of a good experience because you have absorbed your life in those books I didn t consider it negative I mean it was negative from the standpoint that that I was being rejected in that respect But the books having the opportunity it was fun to me It wasn t it you know as if say I had been in a situation where I hadn t had the rejection and there I was more accepted socially I don t know that I wouldn t have done the same thing But I loved reading And whether it was by I really liked true stories more than novels There are few novels that I can enjoy It s just that and maybe part of my critical rigging comes from I tend to be very critical of my own writing Um hum And if a story is not very well written it just leaves me disappointed Um hum And true life tends to be more fulfilling in reading to me than someone else s imagination I guess really I m not I guess there are very few things that I find um where I find that someone else s imagination intrigues me enough to for me to read a lot of their material So you prefer more of the biographies Absolutely Is that the same in movie watching Yes yes Um my husband and I both tend to be very critical when it comes to story lines and stuff like that And while we re watching something I ll say OK honey what s going to happen next Or I ll tell him what I think is going to happen next And if the way that the plot is um constructed if they ve got like loopholes or got if it s a non sequitur If things do not follow what I consider logical or if they make some kind of leap that is not explained or not presented at least so you can leap with them or see how they made that leap then it leaves me cold I really don t want to um watch that show any more So it basically uh turns you from the um plot instead of going with the plot It just turns you away from it Absolutely You lose interest Have you ever thought about because of your love for books have you ever thought about writing Absolutely I don t perceive in myself and maybe this I ll gain this as I get older but my attempts at short stories at least have left me flat I don t do very well in cultivating the characters you know Now the writing that I do like the journaling that I do um of course that s real life so that has a different intensity Um hum Um the poem the poetry that I write and the songs that I write um depending on whether I felt that it has meet met I guess my criteria for excellence um I I am working on compiling my poetry Um hum But um I haven t gotten to the point where I feel like it s ready yet And my family is chomping at the bit ready for me When are you going to publish And when it s ready it ll be ready and I really can t rush that Uh huh that s because that s the creative part And and you know that that creativity is not something you can force No but even having I mean I think I have my mom my grandmother says I know you have enough stuff put together Like it doesn t take that much But um the book that I m working on there s a certain flow that I anticipated having and at this point there re gaps Um hum And I don t know what fills those gaps yet But umm as soon as those gaps are filled then the book will be ready and we ll we ll move you know By that point in time the Lord will have shown me you know who to present it to as far as uh uh presenting it for publication Uh huh Have you ever because uh of your race have you ever thought about writing about um you know the Blacks and culture and and maybe have you ever had any interest also in any Black writers Oh absolutely Um Yes to both of those questions Um our family is a very mixed family My heritage is Black and Indian and White and Jewish that I know of There may be others but those are the the the strains that I know of or the races that I know of and um I know that there are gaps in what I know And I haven t really thought about um how to present that I mean I always thought of it as a wonderful heritage and I love being mixed so to speak Um I think it gives me an advantage I mean I feel connected to more than just my race because my race are so many Umm but because our family history or I mean there is so much history that I don t know but because of so many complex issues regarding my family I don t think the older members of my family could probably appreciate me writing about umm our racial heritage at this particular point in time Maybe umm maybe at some point in the future although now that you have brought it up I ll have to consider it more strongly I just thought about it because being February and and um it s Black American History Mon th or something like that and I m I m doing a report on that on Zora Neale Hurston s Their Eyes Were Watching God and um I found her to be very interesting but uh she writes solely upon the Black culture and her experiences in growing up So I didn t know if you had any experiences reading any of the materials that the Black writers female Black writers have whether that material interested you Maya Angelou was probably the first that really captured my attention Um her I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings um having experienced pain in my childhood her writing about her pain which you know I write about my pain privately in my journal but writing it for someone else to read is a totally different story And I thought that was very courageous for her and I still enjoy listening to her and hearing the wisdom that she has to share um regarding not letting life s experiences bitter you And so she s one of the Black female writers that attracted me Um I ve read a lot Unfortunately I don t remember everything I ve ever read I have the same problem And that s challenging But one of the things that um I guess if any particular subject that I would feel that I might write about it wouldn t just be from like uh the Black culture because other than my experiences in the Black culture tend to not be traditional from the standpoint that I don t seem to fit in or be generally excepted um at least from a childhood perspective Now it s not so much of a problem I mean but I live in a multi cultural world now Um but even in our family it is incredible to me how the different shades of color of our skin bring prejudices from both sides or from from all the different shades Whether I mean my grandmother who was on my dad s side was mostly Indian As a matter of fact I don t know if she had any Black blood in her She married a man who had Black blood but um she was ostracized in her family because of the Indian coloring She had more of it than any of the other children so they would call her derogatory names Um hum And um from her offspring which some married into the white race some married into the Black race Um hum And there s from black to white there are varying attitudes And I was really shocked I thought my family was very small on my dad s side As a matter of fact I didn t even know that we had the myriad of cousins that we do Umm Come to find out at my dad s death that um one of the reasons that he shielded us from them was because of their hatred for us which was incredible to me I had no clue Yes And to see it was shocking So that might be something that I would write about Um hum But don t know I would have to have a positive reason for writing about it because you know at this point I don t have a happy ending to the story Yes Um just sadness Um hum Some people don t write for others they write for themselves It just so happens that others take part in sharing it by reading it That s true Like I write for myself in my journal and I don t hide things in that but I haven t gotten to the point of sharing my journals with the world Did your journaling come from a teacher s uh uh expectation of you I know that some teachers they require a student to write in a journal everyday I didn t have that experience did you I did in high school I was already writing but it was not every day or structured Um Miss Red I think it was in tenth grade required us to write everyday in our journal and then get to turn it in Um hum And that was when I began um journaling with consistency And um and being willing to let you know someone know my heart so to speak because I felt very privately Um my mom had always warned us to be very careful about what we put on paper so the really innermost things of my heart I didn t write um until I got much older Um hum But it was that high school experience that that solidified it for me Then we took a Discipleship Class um my husband and I that that um really taught us how to study the Bible and journaling and Bible Study became enmeshed so to speak for me So when I spent time in the Scriptures I um write my insights and sometimes I write my prayers and I also you know pour out my heart Um hum My journals have uh taken a much different character as uh as I ve grown older and learned different things Uh huh Uh huh The teacher in high school that started you with your journal did she also um did she also activate in you a desire for any reading or other types of writing or did another teacher Or did that stop back in your sixth grade class No um actually that teacher did encourage me to write Um I was already homing as we call it Um and she enjoyed and encouraged me to do that It was actually the librarian in my high school experience that um she was uh also uh a creative writer and um we would share poetry And um I think more than my teacher she really I guess you would say inspired me to uh cultivate it and express myself more so in that that way So your your writing first came about in high school Umm no I I can t remember when I wasn t writing poetry I just always was making up things Um hum Umm high school was when I would write it down and keep it I mean I have things now that I can go back to uh poems that I wrote in high school but I was writing before that I just you know how things just disappear Yes We moved quite a bit and you know I have no clue what happened with all of those Well Mom had six kids so it probably ended up you know in the trash because it was just such a volume of mail Right of uh not mail uh schoolwork and paperwork and stuff like that Uh but I ve been really glad that I ve held on to the early things that I wrote One of the poems that um I still pull out and read from time to time is um Can I Be Me All By Myself Do you remember it Oh from memory No um What sparked you to write that one Uh one of the things that I didn t I would never be able to articulate as a child but looking back um there was a there was a certain chameleon quality to my personality I was very much a pleaser and whatever the authority figure who I was with wanted from me was what I tried to give them And um I guess in a in a way I was kind of frustrated with my own chameleon self And um I didn t know who I was I was always being someone else or what was expected of me and um that s not necessarily a bad thing except for um sometimes it was a very um the expectations were opposites And so you know if one person wants you to be the opposite of another person I mean who are you really when you please when you are trying to please both people you know God forbid they d both be in the same room at the same time That would be a problem wouldn t it It would It would But one of the books one of the one of the uh writers that I have been able to appreciate um is A A Milne And as you can see my Pooh characters I ve got a collection of the original Pooh Tales And I really appreciated the original stories from this perspective He captured personalities in a way that um I still go back to th those uh Pooh and Eeyore When I m my husband and I talk personality a lot and you know what personality type is a particular person and we really found it to be very helpful in understanding them and we realize that no one is one personality type we re all conglomerates But he the way that he wrote the characters and um uh captured the different personality types was has intrigued me even to this day and I can really appreciate um how he did that And there are times when I can really identify with Pooh and then there are I have my Eeyore Days I don t always appreciate what Disney has done with it now because they have commercialized it so but um that s one of the few things I I never really was a cartoon kid I mean my siblings watched and I know what they were but um it was so funny We had a situation We were at a family reunion and we were playing a game I can t I think oh it was Pictionary And um the my partner was drawing a anvil but I can t remember now what he was trying to get me to say but it was from a cartoon It was like I don t know what that cartoon was about I didn t watch cartoons Cartoons really just I mean even to this day I think How can people watch that junk But Winnie the Pooh is one of the cartoons that I can appreciate But the rest of them I can lump them all in the same bag and I don t have much use for them But um I can appreciate Milne s work Did your poem and his work the poem about who you are Uh huh Did you seem to assimilate that into his descriptions and characters Did you try to say I m more like this one than this one Did you make any connections there No not al all I wasn t so much even I I did not even know how to I wish I could put my hands on it If I had of thought about it I had no clue that we were even going to talk about him I think where in the world do I have that Umm I know I have written it down but I am trying to think where is my book It will come to me and I ll I ll maybe be able to find it and I don t mind sharing it with you But my my focus was in in solitude I was unsure about who I really was because I was pretending so much so it wasn t I had no clue At at that point in time I wasn t even thinking in the personality realm and I hadn t drawn any connection to it Um it was it was just um more of my you know how the teenagers go through uh Trying to find myself a questioning period And that was one of the poems that came out of my Who Am I What am I doing here And why type of you know struggle But um It s been really uh encouraging for me as I have um grown up and um I look back to that poem because to some degree I have learned now that I can be myself all by myself I can be me you know I don t have to be a pleaser although I do I still enjoy people being pleased with me Who doesn t But umm I ve I ve learned that um the Lord is pleased with me and if I do what is pleasing to Him you know everybody else the chips fall where they may b That s just the way it has to be Going back to your high school your favorite book in fifth grade wasn t it the dictionary Uh huh Did that change Did your favorite book become something else when you grew up a little bit more and you were in high school Well it didn t the dictionary is still one of my favorite books but one of the books that I read over and over again and I still periodically check it out in the library and read Little Women Uh Louisa Alcott Um her writings not just Little Women but Little Men and Jo s Boys um I I ve appreciated um her imagination In some parts I know it was based on her life and so there is a ring of reality but there again I hadn t realize this till we were talking but you have the different personality types That s true And um I kind of identified with Jo who of course is a writer And although I was I wasn t really tomboyish but I was definitely not interested in boys And umm so I uh I ve actually that s one of the few movies when I see when they ve done remakes of it different times that I ve been able to appreciate every single version of it Usually if I ve read the book and then see the movie I m like uh sigh It takes something away from the book Well my imagination is very different from their imagination so I don t when I read the book my imagination is engaged and um I think of things a certain way and it s very rare when I can appreciate somebody else s imagination if it s contrary to what my imagination says Um hum Um so that became that has become one of my favorites Little Women that started in um high school Um there is something I ve got to tell you it s just uh uh one of the things that my sister who is like two years behind me said I couldn t understand her frustration she says Do you know that there s not a book in this library that your name isn t in I don t know why that tickles me so much but Back in those days when you check out a book they put your name in it You wrote your name in it And she couldn t and every time she checked out a book my name was already there But that probably went to the fact that she wanted to be the oldest and umm that was something that reminded her that she was not the first Not the first one That s interesting I know Why it would bother her so much I don t know but Sibling rivalry Yeah It doesn t matter what it s in It was from her end more than from my end because I was the oldest You couldn t dispute that But um one of the other areas uh I did learn to enjoy I can t remember exactly when it was but science fiction became became intriguing to me and I think it was during high school years Now that s very creative That would be the antithesis of biography Oh I know I know Not that I would appreciate everybody s science fiction but uh there is a trilogy that I ha ve read and it s The Foundation Trilogy and uh I m trying to remember who wrote it I can t think of the author right now but it s one that both my husband and I have enjoyed And matter of right we point back to it Lord please help me to remember his name I can t think of the writer s name but the writer does so well with um with intrigue and irony And one of the things that I have found whether it s in a movie or a book it s got to engage me psychologically on some level I mean I don t really go for for fluff very much I have a low low tolerance for it Um hum Um so um I can t believe I can t believe I can t think of this man s name It must be the chronic fatigue robbing me Um it will probably pop in at some point so I ll let you know But um have you ever read The Foundation Trilogies No I haven t Oh For the most part I think it s pretty clean and that s something else I really appreciate is when I don t have to do deal with a lot of profanity or unwholesomeness You know there is so much that you can write about that s good and wholesome and intriguing without going into the areas that are unprofitable that um and I don t I haven t read The Foundation again in like probably the last five years but um periodically I ll feel like I ve got to visit this book again So you don t mind re reading Oh no especially that s how I know what my favorite books are because they are books I go back to Go back to Yeah Umm other than them I m trying to think favorites Um oh there was one back from I guess from the elementary years that I had forgotten to mention to you um Harold and the Purple Pen The Purple Pen Uh huh Uh if I could get my hands on this book I would buy it It that was a book that left a lasting impression on me Harold was um a little boy and the way that this book is written it s somebody that s drawing I mean you basically just have you know it s not like um photo photographic It s you know somebody s drawing Well Harold was a draw was one who who drew and he would draw things with his pen that would come alive I don t know there is just something about that book that even though I haven t read it in decades that still intrigues me and I want to put get my hands on it and read it again Umm as a matter of fact when um oh I guess my first radio job in VA I I started doing this little um like anonymous gift thing Like with my co workers I might bake something or whatever and I d I had bought a purple pen and I would say The purple pen strikes again and uh no one ever knew it was from Harold and the Purple Pen But or I don t I don t I don t think anyone ever knew it was from me unless somebody maybe figured out my handwriting or something like that but it was That s really neat the way you did that You made that connection there Yeah Do you always seem to have a habit of making connections in your personal life with things you have read about Absolutely And so you celebrate those things like you did that one To some degree I mean obviously you see my Pooh stuff That s obvious To some degree things that really have an impact on me have tended to become a part of my life on some level or another I mean I may not it may not manifest in my everyday existence but um at some point or another when it s appropriate you know I ll reach back and re and connect to that book or that character or whatever or some aspect of it and bring it forward I think that is really um putting your reading into real life uh experiences and making your reading become a part of you and personalizing Uh not very many people do that Really And with your ability to do that I think that that carries over into your writing Hum Because what you read about might spark something that becomes an interest to you and then you carry it over into your writing You might do it completely different than what the book has done Um hum And just basically assimilated it into writing Humm Carry on that creativity into some other avenue One of the recent when I say recent in recent years I read a book about George Washington Carver And it was incredible to me the things that he went through the the his intrigue with um discovering like all the uses for soy a soy the soy the soybean um or peanut or whatever I mean I went out and bought peanut oil just because he was in the book it it was saying um how good it was for your skin and stuff like that I started in rubbing peanut oil I got over it but and I still use it You didn t get a greasy effect did you I really didn t mind the grease it was the smell But um yeah the books that have an impact on me Usually in some way yeah you can find little pieces of it in my life And um my life experiences are often what end up in my writing Like um there s a poem on the wall over there that I wrote And I wrote it out of an actual experience that um my husband and I had We went on um a honeymoon well it wasn t a honeymoon A uh anniversary trip Um hum And um he took me to um Charleston and Folly Beach and to Isle of Palms because he knows I love the ocean The Isle of Palms Beach was my favorite I mean every beach has a character And um as I was walking along the beach there were broken sand dollars I mean it was just an incredible number of broken pieces of sand dollars And it was I couldn t believe I couldn t find a whole one That was ah my first thought There s got to be a whole one down here somewhere But umm then as I was thinking about it and I was looking at it and at first I wasn t even so much interested in the broken ones I was picking up the broken pieces and it made me think about our own brokenness in our lives And umm I don t remember whether it was that night or I think it was later But that experience was so impacting for me that that poem was born And um so it was just uh I don t know you don t let your experiences whether they re experience it s experiences that you ve read or what you ve lived Um hum How you don t connect with it I don t understand how people don t connect with it But then again maybe in a reading took a different because it was an escape for me maybe I connected with it too much You never really escape from reading Oh not from it no Um I enjoy visiting the different worlds so to speak you know of the character or whatever Whoever they were I enjoyed walking so to speak with them in their life Um hum Um and um and that s that s still an enjoyable thing for me you know when I have the opportunity Does that carry over we ve talked about you know the area in that the reading and the writing does that carry over your love for all those things into theater as well Um I have enjoyed um working in theater in my youth I don t really have much of an outlet for it now Um I guess the um lack of opportunity is probably the biggest aspect of why I wouldn t now but if I had the opportunity I wouldn t mind I guess my favorite um one of my favorite courses in college was improvisation I enjoyed doing that Um hum And um when we were growing up uh our Sunday school youth group we we did put on plays and and so that there was an outlet in my youth in my younger days in college But since then um I haven t had much of an opportunity to indulge that passion What about attending theater and watching it Does that do uh does that do very much for you Or do you find that that is not the same as reading it It depends It depends on the story and it depends on um well whether or not it s well done Um hum Um when I was in in junior high our orchestra teacher took us to see Fiddler on the Roof Um hum And that it was a theater production it was Um it was one that I thoroughly enjoyed and I could you know get right and it is something that s one of my favorite stories although now that I think about it I ve never read it I ve you know seen it on television but I ve never read it I ll have to do that Put it on your list That s right Fiddler on the Roof Um but uh I did enjoy it in the theater Um one of the plays I enjoyed reading Lorraine START OF TAPE 1 SIDE B NM Excuse me That s all right A Raisin in the Sun was the title Yes And you saw it on television I ve seen it on television and I ve I was interested in seeing it in the theater but but I never had that opportunity So if it s well done if it s a well written story Um hum Um I feel I would definitely enjoy I have not had a lot of other than college productions and stuff like that uh I haven t done a lot of theater going Um hum But um it s um and I m trying to think the theater uh other than Fiddler on the Roof of course I haven t seen a lot of different things but um has not had the same level of impact I guess Uh uh going to see The Fiddler on the Roof of course as a violinist that you know was part of our our class um project and that was part of our appreciation They also had a full orchestra Um hum So she wanted to expose us to that but uh that has um remained an intriguing story partially I think because of the insight into a different culture Um hum And um also when you think about the characters that are in Fiddler on the Roof you know they have very definite personalities And there you re again you re drawn to personalities in writing or even acting I think just from talking to you that s a very important aspect of of um your reading And I think with that we can make the connection of the dictionary The dictionary is a definition of a word and a personality is a definition of a person Whew How interesting Yeah I hadn t thought about that Um hum Well understanding is one of the things if I had to say that there was something underlying in my life I ve always wanted to understand whether it was understanding people or understanding why things happen Um hum Um understand why you know there are times I know it must drive my husband crazy when we get to talking about a particular word and I m saying That doesn t mean that And he s like well that s what it you know that s what it means to him and I m like Well let s get the dictionary We ll find out what Webster uh understood it to mean So we can have a common ground so we can both speak the same language and we can both you know know what we re talking about Because different words do mean different things to different people Yes And and I have found it to be a spark of misunderstanding so quickly Um hum Um that you know if you can get an understanding to clarify figure out where they re coming from and there again that personality thing Yes Understanding um a person s perspective from their personality view you know helps you whether you need to make allowances for them or um just uh figuring out the puzzle you know Um hum And I have to admit that there s a little bit of a Sherlock Holmes in me I love figuring out puzzles Um hum Whether it s life puzzles or um in my work um we we often find ourselves in situations where there are mysteries and we have to follow the clues And I I love I love it when I find the answer Everybody in the office knows I got it Did that ever lead you into mysteries for reading Um to some degree But um sometimes I guess I find mysteries that leave gaps or I don t follow them quite I don t know whether it s my perspective or my language We re not on the same plane And I end up not finishing it Now I m the kind of person I m very sequential I ve got to know what the end is I go to the back of the book to find out how it ended But I don t care about the middle part because somehow they lose me in the you know especially if they digress to other you know if they don t follow the story Um hum They go too many different places without bringing some level of resolution to whatever the uh issue is that they re dealing with you know Jumping around with three different kinds of story lines that does not appeal to me at all Are you in the habit then since you go to the back of the book for the mysteries are you having to do that with the other readings Um sometimes I guess it really depends on my mood Um hum If if I want to if I really want to know how it ends and then I really want to know how they got there then I ll do that but usually now I m more patient I usually just wait until I get there and see how it ends Um hum If they don t end it ri ght then I m mad That s not how it should have ended Not that everything has to have a happy ending it just has to have a a Bible solution of one of the things going back to The Foundation Trilogy in their closing chap chapters well it s like two chapters that end the book The chapter before the last chapter is is titled The Answer That Satisfies And it s like the answer to the mystery that the characters are dealing with and they are satisfied with this answer But then the final chapter is the answer that s real Umm AG And I don t know There s something well not only that aspect of the way that the writer he writes he basically gives two different endings to the story You know you could stop at the answer that satisfies and think that that s the end of the story but then you go to the next chapter and it s like Ah ha Um hum And I do happen to love a touch of irony I don t know what it is about um my sense of humor which I don t have don t have an appreciation of humor that seems like the general population has Because I mean a lot of things that people think are funny I don t think are funny Um hum And I can appreciate that they do but personally it doesn t tickle my funny bone but irony tickles me Um hum Um and one of the other things that um I almost had the name of the author um the writer of Foundation um that my husband and I both have taken away from that book is um there is a I guess a philosophy so to speak of um the um there are a couple of main groups in the story and the group that knows the most has a certain philosophy Um hum And uh we have seen I guess the essence of that truth to be uh applicable in real life Um hum And so when a book can take a real life truth and weave it into the storyline then I don t know even though it s a novel it has a basis in reality that s intriguing Um hum So um that s Speaking of reality you like the realism type of writing We talked about the classics you know with Louisa May Alcott and uh do you have you ever read much of the realism in modern literature which deals with realistic living and realistic lives and realistic families and the way they really are and not something that s fictional They call Cinderella type of stories These stories are pretty much what you would see today in lives of people realism Have you ever involved yourself much with the reading of that When you say modern do you mean like I mean how modern are you talking about I know there are degrees of modernness I m talking about modern in the 19th or actually 20th century type of reading of novels in literature They deal very much with realism they don t like the authors don t like the Cinderella endings the Cinderella type of of storyline The Father Knows Best types of families you know They think it s very unrealistic Uh ever involved yourself with that type of reading I m trying to remember something specific I mean I have Um hum I mean because I like to read about people s real lives So from that standpoint I would say my answer to your question would be Yes And I m trying to think of something specific Um I remember um a book uh this is probably in the 60s Black Like Me All right OK And that probably would fall into the category of reading that you re thinking about Um it was where uh a Caucasian man underwent a treatment where his skin color was darkened and he experienced what it was like to be Black Umm And um that had you know that realistic tone that you re talking about And um I m definitely attracted to real life stuff As long as they don t get too vulgar Um hum I appreciate not having to deal with vulgarity I mean you can you can be realistic without going into great detail I think about the ugliness of life Um hum It s not that I think that we should gloss over and I don t But I think that you have to um You can tell enough of the story for people to understand without um mashing your face in it so to speak Um hum And um I I don t have a high tolerance for violence and um I I I recently read a book um it was the author s name that attracted me to it I m trying to think of the name of it Aftermath was the name of the book and it was by I don t remember his name It s the gentleman that played Jordie on Star Trek I don t know if that will mean anything to you No I didn t follow Star Trek that well He also does um Reading Rainbow for kids I cannot remember that guy s name It ll come to me after while Anyway it was his name that uh attracted me to the book and uh um I ve read the book but I threw it away Ooh I would never want to read it again It was just too graphic for me and I wouldn t have given it to anybody else Um hum And I don t believe in throwing books away I come from a family where you just don t throw a book away It s a treasure And you know um I recently as a matter of fact had a situation where I was at my grandmother s house and in the bedroom where I was was a book I looked at it and couldn t believe that it was in her house And I went to her and I was expressing my concern to her and um of course that you don t throw away a book came up But Gran Some books you just have to throw away I mean it s garbage just garbage And it wasn t something that she read It was something that had come from someone who had gotten a box of books and was somebody else s library So they probably didn t even know it was in the house But I wasn t the only grandchild or great grandchild that was there and I would have hated for some impressionable person to have gotten a hold of it And being in grandmother s house they would have thought it was OK Umm And it was horrible So um Was your grandmother a prolific reader Very much so She s um and probably liked poetry love of poetry comes from her because she would quote poetry all the time And that s one of the things that is handed down from my grandmother to my mom and um you know to us and to the great grandchildren as well One of the poems that she would quote to my mom and I don t know the whole poem but it starts off I have to live with myself so I have to be fit for myself to know um I can t keep on the closet shelf a lot of secrets about myself I think that no one will ever know That s where I get lost But she can quote the whole thing And so yes she definitely um in the um time where she was raising her children it was really a a challenge to um that she took on to encourage them to be their absolute best And as a matter of fact both of her daughters became teachers And um all of her children are are readers And um she definitely believed that education was a essential and You will go to college So that was something that was definitely handed down Did she ever read stories to you Or did she just quote poetry Um I don t know that my grandmother has ever really read a book to me When I would spend time most of the time she was working I mean she was either working for a living or she was working to take care of us And she was I can t I don t remember a whole lot of leisure where she now she s more leisurely Um hum And one thing that we do is play Scrabble And she still beats me She does I can play as hard and the best I can and she can still beat me So she s still living And still has her wits about her Oh yes Definitely And that s a real blessing I can imagine that it would be Now she doesn t live here No She s in Southerland VA Oh OK I don t I know that she reads her Bible And I know I know that she is a reader but actually seeing her read Um hum I didn t now my mom has piles of books and piles of articles takes two papers and it s EVERYWHERE Does she collect or does she read She reads and she collects And I um try to keep my piles under control And periodically I have to go through and I will go to like the library book sales and I ll choose to take what piles either the author or the title that will interest me It s only a quarter so you support the library and you buy a book and Um hum And then I ll eventually get around to reading it and whether it stays or goes depends on what it s like Yeah Do you have a collection of special books Oh definitely Ones that I always will have and will never get rid of Yeah Um hum One of my almost every year I ve got to read books And since I ve got one of the few non fiction books that uh and again it s based on um reality is Hannah Hurnard s Hind s Feet in High Places and Mountains of Spices And the depiction the the the story that she depicts um is so to me has so many aspects of a true the struggles of our lives that every time I read it because I m a little different I get something a little different from it And that s one that I give it away and then have to go get another copy Because I always want that in my library I always want to be able to go back and read it again Uh huh I had someone give me that book once Years ago I probably still have it Um hum So I m familiar with that particular book Um in your high school years you re going back to that time period and your librarian was one that you said who encouraged you and you had some challenges between each other in writing poetry Um hum Um did she did you meet weekly or was it I was in there everyday Everyday Several times I day Now that was still during those times in high school Um hum I got permission to have homeroom in the library and I then I would go there for my lunch and I mean I would take me like that long to eat my food and I would go I have permission to go up to the library Umm And so um I found it kind of like being the librarian helper because I was there all the time And uh I as a matter of fact at one point I was going to go into Library Science I was just about to ask you I was surprised that you haven t become a librarian Yeah I toyed with it at times I ve worked in a couple of different church libraries and um I thoroughly enjoy it Um at this particular point physically it s not something I could keep up with but um the library is actually my favorite place Um hum Other than home Uh well if I had my way I d have the library in my home That s possible you know I know You ve probably collected enough books that you could fill up a room with them Yep Well we have a study that we have filled you know you ve seen our study the books that we have Um hum And I m I m now with Ron s collection and mine I m starting to go into his area and pulling off the shelves books that he s collected and going to read those Ooh Because I m like you you know I just like to read and I d like to continue that Are your bothers or sisters as much of a reader as you are Or have an interest at all in reading Oh um I think there are six of us all together and there s only one brother To my recollection I think all but one of my siblings is very strong in the area of reading And that one sibling is she came up at a time when they switched from phonics to sight reading Yes And it crippled her to a certain degree All of her life she has struggled with um not being able to sound out words and that it it has really limited her in reading and it s not very much fun to her But the rest of my siblings um are always kind of not so much that they re doing I don t get the sense that they re doing so much leisure reading now but they are um always you know continuing their education in whatever area they re studying in and their reading in that area Umm Interesting Yeah They definitely encourage their children in that regard too Um hum And so they have passed on that passion unto their children That s great Well it s been real interesting your life story about reading and writing I appreciate the time Oh it s my pleasure Any time
