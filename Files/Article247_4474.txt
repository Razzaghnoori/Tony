 Keeping Public Education Vital Dear Ann How can school systems get and keep excellent teachers Good question I do think that a good curriculum is part of the answer And I think the Core Curriculum is a good start From what I ve read Hirsch has sane ideas about reading which is no small thing I like his emphasis on biographies and mythology in the younger grades He gives an important place to music and art a good idea from my point of view His curriculum is fairly new and is currently used in less than a thousand schools and I suspect that in time and as more schools adopt the program the curriculum will evolve If Hirsch and his followers are open minded and they seem to be they will want to experiment with variations To Bennett s credit he has chosen to promote a pretty solid curriculum He could have picked one of the teacher proof regimens that have teachers reciting scripted lessons all day long I understand that many teachers are relieved to have such a script but I am sure that with guidance most of them would be happier using a more open ended approach The question is how to give such guidance Good principals can certainly help I agree with you that Bennett does not draw a satisfactory picture of what a principal s role should be By the way the unions play an important role in attracting good teachers Decent wages and working conditions are not a side issue I suppose it s not surprising that Bennett would be hostile to the unions considering that the unions usually support the Democrats and he is a Republican But I wish he had recognized how many helpful things the unions do not just in regard to wages and working conditions In New York the teachers union runs a program called Dial A Teacher that answers homework questions in English Spanish Haitian Creole French Greek Italian and Chinese which is really quite useful Give it a try 212 777 3380 This sort of program is much more than a PR gimmick Not that unions are perfect I have to make a confession about school choice I became a teacher in the 1970s because I was deeply affected by the books of Herbert Kohl Jonathan Kozol and George Dennison At that time I believed that the public schools were hopeless The conditions were too dreadful The teachers and administrators were too racist The system was intractable What to do For a lot of young educators like me the answer was to start our own schools alternative schools which at the time meant private schools Now the sides have changed Liberals like me understand that our society had better make the public schools work People like Bennett have given up I was wrong mea culpa in the 1970s and Bennett is wrong today Farsighted educators have shown that you can make superior public schools even in poor neighborhoods There is room in the public school system more than there used to be for people with ambition and ideas True there is a risk that in promoting public school alternatives neighborhood schools will be left with the most difficult to educate children and not enough resources to meet the task As for charter schools I don t think we have enough information yet Charter schools are public schools that operate outside of the bureaucratic system and in some places that might be good in other places not so good Concerning vouchers my fear is that they will undermine a sense of the public good in education I agree with you that Bennett is promoting a get it for your kid attitude So what if some other kids are left in the lurch is the implication It is not a very attractive idea of what American society should be like Still Bennett s book has some good ideas too as you and I agree and it has given us the opportunity to bat around our own ideas which has been fun Peggy
