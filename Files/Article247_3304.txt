 What Does W Stand For Every day this week the Washington Post has featured on its front page a new installment of a vast profile of George W Bush The length of a short book the series has explored every nook and cranny of the presumptive Republican nominee s biography We hear at length about Bush s childhood reaction to his little sister s death from leukemia his pole vault over the waiting list for the Texas Air National Guard in 1970 and his conversion from Wild Turkey to Cold Turkey in 1986 But as of today part six of seven we have learned approximately nothing about what W thinks about politics This isn t just the fault of policy averse personality driven journalism though it is partly that Visit George Bush s Web site read his speeches and statements and you will remain unenlightened as to his views Bush offers conventional conservative s bromides about the economy and the family and spends a lot of time talking about his signature idea faith based social programs But if he has a political philosophy that goes beyond pro business pragmatism and personal concern for society s unfortunates he s hiding it awfully well The problem here isn t simply the lack of specifics what Bush disparages as 10 point plans Members of his brain trust are working on position papers at this very moment and they ll soon provide the absent details What s odd and a bit worrying is that George W Bush has embarked on a presidential campaign lacking something even more basic the sort of world view or approach that equips politicians to formulate an agenda in the first place On the great issues of his era Bush isn t a pragmatist He s a cipher In an interview excerpt the Post reporters ask him whether it is true as they heard from others that during the Vietnam War Bush argued on both sides of the issue Here s W s response I don t remember debates I don t think we spent a lot of time debating it Maybe we did but I don t remember This does not appear to be a convenient failure to recall opinions that have since become unpopular or embarrassing It s the absence of any opinion at all It s hard to believe but the front runner in the 2000 presidential race is a guy who can t remember what he thought or if in fact he thought at all about the conflict that defined his generation In an article in The Weekly Standard a few months ago Fred Barnes offered a theory about how Bush has neutralized the religious right Though he eschews most of the issues and themes dear to social conservatives such as actually trying to ban abortion Bush wears his Christian beliefs on his sleeve You might say that he does something similar with secularized voters as well substituting his personal sense of compassion for the kind of policies that could do something to help the poor In a big speech in Indianapolis a week ago Bush singled out a charity called Mission Arlington Texas where people line up at three or four in the morning for free dentistry That Bush cares about the people waiting outside the clinic makes you think he s a decent human being But people who can t afford to get their teeth fixed don t need religious charity They need dental insurance To say that Bush is untainted by ideology does not mean he lacks political instincts As Bill Clinton did in 1992 he seems to have a fine grasp on why so many voters are turned off by his party Bush seems prepared to spill some voters off the right side of the GOP yacht in order to get it upright again In April it was reported that he had registered Internet domain names for only four potential GOP tickets Bush Whitman Bush Pataki Bush Engler and Bush Ridge All four are centrist northern governors This was a powerful hint that W intends to tell Pat Robertson to go play in traffic I predict that Bush will soon find a moment to blast some marginal figure on the right s ideological fringe the way that Clinton dissed Sister Souljah in 1992 When your task is unifying a divided party knowing what views to reject as Bush seems to may be more important than knowing what policies you support Those Republican candidates with strong and consistent ideological views Pat Buchanan Alan Keyes Gary Bauer can appeal only to small factions within the GOP Others who are eager to serve as vehicles for compromise look unprincipled because of their past records and comments Steve Forbes for instance has undergone a campaign conversion from supply sider to pious family values conservative The result is that no one quite trusts him Not having a record on national issues makes it easier to position oneself according to the current political wisdom That s one of the reasons governors generally make better presidential candidates than senators they don t have congressional voting records to constrict their evolution Better still is a governor who lacks even private opinions He s a political consultant s perfect Barbie doll You can dress him in this year s fashions And no one will remember him wearing anything different
