 okay um how s it been this week for you weatherwise or otherwise weatherwise weatherwise damp cold warm hum um oh no damp we have we have gone through what might be called the four seasons uh in the last week uh huh we have had highs of seventy two lows in the twenties my goodness well i don t even want to tell you what ours has been like then it was ninety six yesterday i heard about that yeah we set a record yesterday and uh very very windy but then today the wind has dropped off and also the temperature so very cool uh i think right now it s like sixty nine hm and that s cool for or if it it feels cool compared to yesterday but very pleasant no rain in the last month i don t think ground s very dry and our yard work everything everything is in bloom so our yard work s pretty tough uh ground being dry but i guess it also uh brings about allergies we re having a lot of allergies down here right now um hum everything blooming and and the weather and uh think a lot of people have contracted uh spring fever too so had a lot of people out at work you know for fishing and and uh golf reasons and things like that the blue flu yeah yeah the blue flu or the white collar flu depending on where you work i guess yeah yes oh we have had uh as i ve said we ve had variable weather uh hm it has been untypically wet for this time of year hm and also we have a lot of green you know the grass has been growing and if you look outside you would like to go out and mow your lawn if you could go out and hm buy a new spark plug or something along those lines but fortunately it rains and you uh do not have to go out and buy the spark plug no but we ve had an unusually uh uh warm yeah spring and well i guess we re still in winter and uh um hum we have had no snow to speak of to speak of no snow hm we usually average oh anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter and this year as well as last year we have had less than four inches total accumulation hm so it s been inordinately warm uh here for uh for this time of year so uh in that regard it s it s fine but uh hm um hum i envy you you re at ninety four degrees i thought i heard this morning that in San Antonio it was in the nineties yesterday yes yes it is down in uh more southern and and western areas and of course we re um about two hours from the northern border straight south and yeah and uh very windy it s amazing to me because i ve only lived in Dallas three years and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time it does i i i very seldom if any i can t remember you know a day that i walked out and the wind wasn t blowing um hum well i spent six years in graduate school at in Indiana in the flatlands and it was that way everyday rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour hm summer and and winter so that uh we you you became accustomed to it i guess but uh otherwise uh huh we as i said we have had a uh relatively mild winter for speaking for this area of the country um hum oh really where did you go to school in Indiana Purdue Purdue i have a brother that lives in uh uh Southbend Indiana oh yes and i had to always well i ve lived there for eight years myself i d always said i was gonna go back to school and go to Notre Dame but i didn t uh well you are not from that area originally i can tell no originally i m from New Mexico i was born in New Mexico and we lived in uh Southbend for eighty eight years and uh then moved to uh Tennessee actually oh okay well um hum well i thought i heard a little Tennessee in there and uh very much very much because i i spent thirteen years there um hum and uh then moved to Dallas about three years ago so gee you ve moved almost moved around as much as i have yeah it s uh uh uh uh my father was in the Air Force so oh i see well i worked for the government so i i moved uh uh much more frequently than i had intended uh for sixteen years but uh huh i guess the uh this this is my first conversation in this uh uh series oh uh huh i had i received a call last night because of the uh i had not received my uh personal identification number right so i had to call Jack Godfrey today and ask him what it was because i i had to abort the call last evening because i couldn t get on the line yeah so uh is there any i m not sure how long we re supposed to talk it s um it s just as long as you want to i mean it s just a oh okay as long as you want to and just you know a reasonable lengthy conversation now uh do you work for Texas Instruments uh no i do not i work for GTE oh okay and i uh of course was i was sent a uh an application from uh from Jack i ve known Jack for sometime i m in the um hum speech processing business and have been for a number of years so i was very much interested oh really yeah in in being a speaker for this oh actually i i work for Texas Instruments and um i m in a i m an environmental engineer oh i see and uh they just published this internally you know getting people involved so that that s really strange i i was wondering why we had somebody from Maryland though i was thinking God do we have a TI in Maryland or um hum i m sure you have a representative somewhere in the area just nothing more than a business representative or government services representative um hum and um but i have uh i have been an a speaker in other uh similar type of activities uh and i know the reason why this is why the uh this is being um hum gathered and the program and so forth so i was interested in as i said i was interested in being a speaker um hum we haven t talked much about the weather i know that s what we re supposed to do oh well yeah yeah well really it uh the the letter just says um let s see i can t i was looking at it i was trying to find out speedy short cuts and all it says not necessary to measure your time just to go ahead and enjoy the conversation and and end it when needed so um hum in environmental engineering uh okay um hum is that with regard to workplace engineering or just you know environment the work place environment or uh well it s actually um waste water taking taking care of uh i m actually in the air division and we monitor um oh i see anything that comes out of a stack or out of a building or um we do have customers that um their concerns are in the work place and we take care of that but in within um hum our department we uh take care of everything waste water uh solid waste and recycling and and air well i had my the the call last evening was supposed to be about uh concerning recycling in the community the call i received oh uh huh um hum and so i had uh i had thought a little bit about it um uh um hum beforehand oh uh huh so i but that that s interesting i have a um uh a friend who is a planner oh uh huh uh a city planner and one of his and he models uh city districts and so forth uh does computer modeling um hum yes and one of the uh he has inputs or gets inputs from a an environmental engineer uh huh yeah we actually our division is corporate wide and we take care of just the Dallas area course we have several plants here but um we do air modeling also to um hum oh i see and and yeah i take care of all the air modeling specifically for the Dallas area what we do we have a weather station that we get all of this information you know temperature wind speed and wind direction and and uh we have a huge chemical data base well that s interesting and uh our our chemical data base so that we know every chemical on site and and um it s concentration and and if if anything ever happened God forbid you know a building explosion or something like we d be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station
