 Background A wide range of symptoms produce considerable suffering in patients at the end of their lives This monograph aims to summarize the core competencies in symptom control needed by any physician no matter his or her specialty Many of the approaches will apply much earlier in the course of the illness not just at the end of life The monograph does not purport to summarize specialist knowledge While some practitioners will have specialist palliative care services upon which to call most in the world will need to provide the initial approaches to symptom control at the end of life This is not a fringe activity but a core competency for physicians After an overview of the approaches to whole patient assessment we summarize the management of several of the more common symptoms that occur at the end of life However to focus on symptom control skills alone will miss the mark To be effective in end of life care physicians must also have a broad conceptualization of end of life care and the legal issues that support it 1 and they must be competent in communication decision making and relation building skills 2 While we hope each pearl can improve a physician s practice the complete Education for Physicians on End of life Care EPEC Curriculum should be mastered in order to be fully effective 3 Methods To increase physician knowledge of new developments in palliation and their level of clinical competence in end of life care the Institute for Ethics at the American Medical Association with support from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation embarked on the Education for Physicians on End of life Care EPEC Project The overall goal of the EPEC Project is to teach physicians how to provide better care to terminally ill patients The overall method is to use a train the trainer dissemination model The central hypothesis is that a core curriculum designed written and taught by physicians using state of the art clinical knowledge and education theory can be effective in reaching a second tier of physicians by having the newly trained physicians return to their work settings and seek to engage and educate a growing number of their peers using and adapting the provided educational materials The project aims to improve end of life care through a ripple effect as the trainers educate a growing number of physicians A key tool of the EPEC Project was the development of the EPEC Curriculum It sets out the core competencies that all physicians should have in palliative care It was not intended to define or describe the specialty skills of a palliative medicine physician Two Advisory Boards of 24 expert physicians in ethics hospice and palliative care initially recommended the curricular content and format A team of experts with considerable clinical and research experience and expertise in physician education then developed the curriculum Finally it was modified based on the opinions of the first 280 physicians and other health care professionals trained to teach end of life care using the EPEC Curriculum EPEC Trainers The final EPEC Curriculum represents a synthesis of the ideas of many experts and clinicians The information in the present manuscript is extracted from this curriculum Results Whole Patient Assessment Management strategies to relieve suffering in end of life care begin with a comprehensive assessment of the whole patient and his or her family This approach to assessment may be quite distinct from familiar history taking and physical examination techniques Whole patient assessment examines a range of issues that may cause suffering It forms the basis for setting goals of care rather than seeking problem based solutions The assessment process itself can be a therapeutic tool It acknowledges the patient as a person and conveys compassion 4 5 6 During the assessment ask about each of the possible symptoms and the patient s functional activities rather than about organ systems or anatomy Because symptoms are inherently subjective patient self report is the gold standard for assessment 7 Validated symptom assessment tools may assist the clinician to gain consistent insight into the patient s perception of a symptom eg its severity etc When considering diagnostic tests assess their potential to assist relief of suffering rather than diagnosis for its own sake Most people with an advanced life threatening illness experience situational and possibly pathological changes in their affect and cognitive function and a range of emotions and fears Fear of loss of control and dignity abandonment being a burden and physical suffering can be so strong that patients desire hastened death Screening questions to assess for depression anxiety and cognitive impairment and inquiries about coping responses and fears are all important since these issues can be redressed 8 9 While the physician may not have the skills of a social worker he or she should be able to make an initial assessment of the patient s social and practical needs Unresolved relationships or financial legal or practical matters may be sources of distress 10 Because 30 of families spend their life savings and or lose a source of income in order to care for the patient it is important to know about financial status and health insurance coverage 11 The need for practical help must be addressed even the best of care plans may fail if the chores of day to day living are not attended to 12 Every person has a spiritual dimension to his or her life Whether it is understood in frankly religious terms or in terms of personal meaning and the mystery of life studies suggest that patients welcome inquiry about their spiritual issues 13 14 While a chaplain or skilled pastor usually administers spiritual care the physician must consider the possibility that spiritual pain also manifests itself as physical mental or social distress Equipped with a full assessment of the nature and context of the issues that are causing suffering for the patient and family the physician can then address each issue in turn The following addresses some of the most common physical issues and some touches on some of the related family or social issues they raise Pain Pain occurs frequently in end of life care It can be acute or chronic 15 Pain can be nociceptive or neuropathic in origin The patient s description physical findings and the results of laboratory tests and imaging studies will usually be sufficient for a provisional diagnosis 16 Nociceptive pain involves direct stimulation of intact mechanical chemical or thermal nociceptors and transmission of electrical signals along normally functioning nerves Patients may describe this as sharp aching and or throbbing pain that is easily localized Visceral nociceptive pain eg cardiac lung GI GU results from stimulation of the autonomic nervous system and may be difficult to describe or localize Neuropathic pain is presumed to result from disordered function of the peripheral or central nervous system due to any of many potential causes Patients tend to describe neuropathic pain with words like burning tingling numbness shooting stabbing or electric like feelings Management Effective pain management requires a clear understanding of the etiology and neuropathophysiology of each pain and the pharmacology of analgesics Nociceptive pain generally responds well to opioids and or coanalgesics Although neuropathic pain may respond well to opioids adjuvant analgesics tricyclic antidepressants anticonvulsants antiarrhythmics etc are often required in combination with opioids to achieve adequate relief Although research is not yet conclusive unmanaged pain itself may lead to changes in the nervous system that could reduce its responsiveness to treatment 17 18 19 Equally important unrelieved pain can have a devastating psychological effect on the individual and family 20 As there is no reason to delay the use of analgesics 16 initiate analgesic interventions while completing investigations and providing therapies directed against the cause of the pain eg radiation for a neoplasm Placebos have no role to play in the assessment or management of pain outside of clinical trials 21 Neither is there rationale for concerns that appropriate doses of analgesics will mask signs that will prevent accurate diagnosis and treatment 22 23 24 Frequently pharmacological and non pharmacological interventions and an interdisciplinary plan that includes other health care professionals nurses social workers pharmacists chaplains physiotherapists occupational therapists child life specialists etc are required to manage pain effectively Plans must be tailored to the expectations and needs of each individual patient and family Flexibility and ongoing education of the patient family and all caregivers ongoing assessment of treatment outcomes and regular review of the plan of care are all essential 15 16 When a plan does not control a patient s pain in a timely manner ask for help from colleagues with more expertise WHO 3 Step Model to Guide Analgesic Dosing In 1986 the World Health Organization WHO developed a 3 step conceptual model to guide the management of cancer pain see Figure 1 25 It provides a simple well tested model to guide the initial selection administration and titration of analgesics to manage the pain associated with any serious illness When initiating or titrating analgesics it is not necessary to traverse each step of the model sequentially a patient with severe pain 7 10 10 on a numerical or visual analogue scale NAS or VAS may need to have step 3 opioids from the outset Step 1 Analgesics Acetaminophen and the non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs including ASA have an important role in symptom management However all have a ceiling effect to their analgesia See table 1 25 All step 1 analgesics have a risk of adverse effects that are potentially life threatening The mechanism of action of acetaminophen is still unknown although it is known that it does not have a peripheral anti inflammatory effect Typically it is used alone or combined with other analgesics as a coanalgesic for additive or synergistic analgesic effects Patients who may think more is better should be cautioned that toxicity can ensue at 4 gm acetaminophen 24 hr particularly in patients with hepatic compromise NSAIDs work at least in part by inhibiting cyclo oxygenase the enzyme that converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins They act directly at neuro synaptic junctions and by reducing inflammation They can be used alone or as coanalgesics Extended release NSAIDs or those with long half lives eg piroxicam are likely to enhance adherence Intravenous formulations are also available eg ketorolac Care must be taken to anticipate the potentially adverse effects of NSAIDs eg gastropathy nephropathy and inhibition of platelet aggregation that are independent of the route of administration The newer agents specific to the isoenzyme cyclo oxygenase 2 may have fewer adverse effects but are less potent and more expensive than other possible choices There is no reason not to start with the least expensive agent for a clinical trial before moving to more expensive agents Step 2 and 3 Analgesics Step 2 and 3 analgesics include the pure agonist opioids eg codeine fentanyl hydrocodone hydromorphone morphine and oxycodone Those suggested for step 2 dosing combine a pure agonist opioid with either acetaminophen or aspirin to limit the amount of opioid that can be used 25 All of these opioids except fentanyl follow first order kinetics They reach their peak plasma concentration Cmax approximately 60 to 90 minutes after oral including enteral feeding tube or rectal administration 30 minutes after subcutaneous or intramuscular injection and 6 minutes after intravenous injection see Figure 2 Dosed once every half life steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within 4 5 half lives Analgesia appears to track with plasma concentration They are eliminated from the body at a fixed rate irrespective of the dose The liver first conjugates them then the kidney excretes 90 to 95 of the metabolites Except for the demethylation of codeine methylmorphine to its active metabolite their metabolic pathways do not become saturated Based on these pharmacological principles if an immediate acting oral opioid is selected and the pain is continuous or nearly so give the medication q 4h on a routine schedule not as needed The best possible pain control for the dose will be achieved within 24 hours once steady state has been reached To control any extra or breakthrough pain provide the patient with as needed rescue doses of the same immediate acting opioid Each rescue dose should be about 10 20 of the total 24 hour dose offered q 1h prn PO or PR q 30 min prn SC or IM or q 10 15 min prn IV If pain remains uncontrolled after 24 hours increase the routine dose by an amount at least equal to the total dose of rescue medication used during the previous 24 hours If pain is mild or moderate an increase of 25 to 50 in the total daily dose should be expected If pain is severe or uncontrolled an increase of 50 to 100 should be expected In fact if pain is severe and uncontrolled after 1 or 2 doses eg crescendo pain do not wait for 24 hours to pass before increasing the routine dose There is no maximum dose for a pure agonist opioid Follow the patient closely and titrate the analgesics until the pain is relieved or adverse effects are encountered Increasingly 12 24 hours sustained release formulations of the opioids are becoming widely available for routine usage either as tablets or granules They must be ingested whole not crushed or chewed A fentanyl transdermal patch is also available that can deliver medication for up to 72 hours Use of these preparations is likely to improve patient adherence Extended release formulations are not indicated for rescue dosing For this purpose use a concurrent dose of an immediate release formulation of the same opioid Methadone although the least expensive oral opioid has a long and variable half life days Only those with additional training should use it for pain control Not all opioid analgesics that are commonly available are recommended for acute or chronic dosing Meperidine is poorly absorbed orally and has a short half life of approximately 2 3 hours Its principal metabolite normeperidine has no analgesic properties of its own has a longer half life of about 6 hours is renally excreted and produces significant adverse effects when it accumulates Propoxyphene is typically administered at doses that produce relatively little analgesia The mixed opioid agonist antagonists such as pentazocine butorphanol nalbuphine and dezocine are not recommended as routine analgesics Their dosing is limited by a ceiling effect and they have a high risk of adverse effects They must not be used if the patient is already taking a pure agonist opioid as competition for the opioid receptors may cause a withdrawal syndrome If patients have good pain control on stable doses of an opioid and are not experiencing adverse effects especially drowsiness it is safe to drive a car Patients in pain may have much poorer reaction times and may be a much greater risk If a patient is unable to ingest an oral analgesic an alternate route of administration or an alternate opioid may be preferable Intramuscular injections are not recommended Intermittent subcutaneous doses are just as effective and much less painful When changing routes of administration or opioids an equianalgesic table is a useful guide for initial dose selection Significant first pass metabolism necessitates larger oral or rectal doses to produce analgesia equivalent to parenteral doses of the same opioid Equivalence dosing recommendations represent consensus from limited available evidence so they are guides only Individual patients may require doses to be adjusted by more than a factor of 2 to achieve effective analgesia without adverse effects See Table 2 26 Opioids have common and uncommon adverse effects Table 3 While several may be a problem initially pharmacological tolerance typically develops to all of the adverse effects except constipation within days Always caution patients and families to anticipate nausea and drowsiness for the first few days until tolerance develops Provide antiemetics as needed Prophylactic routine stimulant laxatives should be prescribed Many physicians misperceive that respiratory depression is a significant risk when prescribing opioids for pain In fact it is rare pain is a potent stimulus to breath somnolence always develops first and pharmacological tolerance to respiratory depression develops quickly The cost of opioid analgesics varies considerably Adequate analgesia can be achieved for the majority of patients with the least expensive opioids such as immediate release preparations of morphine Addiction It is a prevalent myth that the administration of opioid analgesics for pain management causes addiction 27 Confusion about the differences between addiction tolerance and physical dependence is in part responsible The hallmark of opioid addiction is psychological dependence manifested by a behavioral syndrome of continued compulsive drug use despite harm 28 Care must be taken to differentiate a true addiction substance use disorder from pseudo addiction due to under treatment of pain or other aberrant drug related behaviors 29 Pharmacological tolerance to analgesics ie the reduced effectiveness of a given dose of medication over time is not evidence of addiction 30 and is rarely significant clinically After an initial titration period doses may remain stable for long periods months to years if the pain stimulus remains unchanged An increasing need for more analgesics more likely reflects progression of the symptom and underlying disease On the other hand tolerance to opioid adverse effects is commonly observed and is favorable 31 Physical dependence evidenced by the development of a withdrawal syndrome when a medication is suddenly withdrawn is not evidence of addition 30 Similar outcomes occur in the presence of exogenous hormones and other medications that act through cellular receptors eg estrogens beta blockers alpha 2 agonists caffeine etc Some patients will experience less pain either spontaneously or with changes in their underlying disease If the pain stimulus decreases or disappears opioid doses usually can be reduced in decrements of 50 or more every 2 to 3 days and finally stopped without causing a withdrawal syndrome 32 Depression It is a myth that persistent feelings of helplessness and hopelessness are inevitable and permanent consequences of advanced life threatening illness 33 Most patients with a serious illness experience periods of intense situational sadness and anxiety accompanied by depressive symptoms These feelings are usually present for a relatively short period days to weeks and then resolve However in a variable number of patients these feelings persist The earlier depression is diagnosed the more responsive to treatment it may be 34 The most reliable symptoms of major depression in patients with advanced illness are persistent dysphoria anhedonia feelings of helplessness hopelessness and worthlessness and loss of self esteem 35 The somatic symptoms of depression such as changes in weight are unreliable as they may reflect the underlying illness 36 The screening question Do you feel depressed most of the time is a highly sensitive and specific question in this population 37 Thoughts of suicide and requests to hasten death may be a marker of undiagnosed depression Treatment for depression may help patients feel better and have the energy and interest to achieve their final goals before they die Approaches that combine supportive counseling and psychotherapy with antidepressant medication work best Other members of the health care team can provide invaluable assistance to support the depressed patient and his or her family When reversal of depression is an immediate short term goal a rapid acting psychostimulant such as methylphenidate is the best choice 38 If a response in 2 to 4 weeks is acceptable an atypical antidepressant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor SSRI may be an appropriate choice 39 Tricyclic antidepressants have limited usefulness due to their long time to achieve therapeutic levels and risk of anticholinergic adverse effects 40 If the diagnosis is unclear or the expected therapeutic response delayed consult with a colleague with expertise Anxiety Patients facing a life threatening illness commonly experience anxiety over their fears and uncertainties about their future 41 Compassionate exploration of the specific issues that are causing or exacerbating anxiety may be complex Issues of grief and loss may be important contributors Differentiate between primary anxiety and delirium depression bipolar disorder and medication side effects Look for insomnia and other reversible causes of anxiety due to alcohol caffeine or medications 42 Input from family friends and other members of the interdisciplinary team may be invaluable Like depression the management of anxiety often requires a combination of supportive therapy and medications Concerns about finances family conflicts future disability dependency and existential concerns will not resolve with medication When it appears that pharmacological therapy will be beneficial benzodiazepines are generally the medication class of choice 43 Intermediate half life agents eg lorazepam or clonazepam are commonly used Benzodiazepines may worsen short term memory particularly in the elderly or cause confusion in patients with preexisting cognitive impairment A few patients will experience a paradoxical reaction to benzodiazepines and their anxiety will get worse When discontinuing benzodiazepines taper them slowly to prevent rebound anxiety Breathlessness Dyspnea Breathlessness may be one of the most distressing symptoms for patients families and caregivers Believing the patient s self report is the best way to assess it Where possible the underlying cause should be treated to at least provide symptomatic relief when the burden of the therapy does not outweigh the benefit There are 3 widely used medical approaches for the symptomatic relief of breathlessness oxygen opioids and anxiolytics Nonpharmacological interventions may also contribute significantly to the patient s and family s sense of well being and their ability to cope The majority of patients who report breathlessness are not hypoxemic Measures of hypoxemia eg pulse oximetry blood gas determination do not correlate with the patient s self report 44 45 46 47 This is not to say that such measurements may not be useful in understanding pathophysiology However the measurements frequently do not correlate with symptom relief In addition such measurements may be uncomfortable frightening and or expensive and divert the focus away from the symptom While oxygen will not reverse the cause of the breathlessness a therapeutic trial of supplemental oxygen by nasal prongs may be beneficial This may have a placebo effect 47 In addition its effectiveness may be explained by the observation that cool air moving across the patient s face eg from compressed air by nasal prongs or from a fan may provide equal relief due to the stimulation of the V2 branch of the fifth cranial nerve 48 Opioids may provide significant relief of the sense of breathlessness without having a measurable impact on their respiratory rate or blood gas concentrations 49 Through both central and peripheral effects doses lower than those used to relieve pain may be effective in opioid na ve patients In some patients subjective relief may also be associated with a measurable increase in exercise tolerance and mobility 50 51 Concerns that opioid usage to manage symptoms will cause respiratory depression or hasten death ie an unintended effect or cause addiction are not relevant Opioid treatment for dyspnea is consistent with good medical practice ethical when the intent is to relieve suffering widely accepted when standard dosing guidelines are followed and very unlikely to be associated with abuse behaviors 52 As with pain treatment pharmacological tolerance is not a clinically significant issue Some patients who are breathless and anxious may also need treatment for their anxiety Benzodiazepine medications may be combined safely with opioids 53 Nausea Vomiting A thorough assessment of the etiology and pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is crucial as different causes will require very different interventions Two organ systems the gastric lining of the GI tract and the area postrema the chemoreceptor trigger zone the vestibular apparatus and the cortex of the brain are important contributors 54 The neurotransmitters dopamine histamine acetylcholine and serotonin are important mediators of this symptom complex All four can be demonstrated in the area postrema Although all are present in the lining of the GI tract serotonin is particularly important Acetylcholine and histamine are important in the vestibular apparatus Nausea and vomiting that is mediated by the cortex is more complex and not associated with specific neurotransmitters eg the anticipatory nausea associated with chemotherapy Dopamine mediated nausea is probably the most frequently targeted for initial symptom management even when the precise mechanism of nausea is not known Dopamine antagonist medications used to control nausea include the phenothiazines eg prochlorperazine or butyrophenone neuroleptics eg haloperidol Both have the potential to cause drowsiness and extrapyramidal symptoms particularly in young women 55 Commonly used antihistamines eg diphenhydramine hydroxyzine also have anticholinergic properties They may do double duty as a single agent and cover both etiologies of nausea 56 Opioids and anesthetics can trigger acetylcholine mediated nausea in the vestibular apparatus A pure anticholinergic medication may be added to other antiemetics in empirical therapy particularly when the vestibular apparatus is implicated eg scopolamine 57 Serotonin antagonists have been very effective in treating chemotherapy associated nausea eg ondansetron 58 They have been reported to be useful for refractory nausea of diverse types but are typically tried only when other medications have failed They are expensive and should be promptly stopped if they are not effective after a short therapeutic trial A sluggish or dyskinetic gut that does not empty properly due to carcinomatosis opioid therapy other medications diabetes mellitus etc may be a source of nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced disease 59 Constipation a large liver producing a squashed stomach ascites or peritoneal disease may be causing pseudo obstruction Medications with prokinetic effects eg metoclopramide or stimulant laxatives eg senna bisacodyl may be effective at moving gut contents forward and relieving the associated nausea 60 Hyperacidity with or without gastroesophageal reflux and or gastric or duodenal erosions may produce nausea heartburn acidity or bitter taste that may be associated with vomiting Antacids H 2 receptor antagonists or proton pump inhibitors may relieve the hyperacidity and or reflux Cytoprotective agents eg misoprostol may be effective in treating the nausea associated with mucosal erosion secondary to NSAIDs Heterogeneous groups of medications that have unclear mechanisms of action but uncontested benefits in some patients include glucocorticoids eg dexamethasone cannabinoids eg tetrahydrocannabinol and benzodiazepines eg lorazepam 61 62 63 With complete obstruction accumulation of intraluminal fluid from epithelial sources is principally responsible for the symptoms of bloating crampy abdominal pain nausea and vomiting Octreotide a synthetic analog of somatostatin selectively inhibits secretion of fluids and electrolytes into the gut lumen and may relieve these symptoms 64 65 66 Refractory cases of nausea and vomiting often require combinations of medications from different classes Constipation Constipation is the discomfort associated with reduced frequency of bowel movements 67 If left unmanaged it can lead to abdominal pain bloating nausea and vomiting overflow incontinence tenesmus fecal impaction or even bowel obstruction As there is a wide range of normal in bowel habits begin by assessing what the patient considers normal bowel function Tailor examination investigation and treatment to the presentation stage and context of the person and illness For most patients near the end of life correction of the underlying pathophysiological cause of constipation is often not possible or appropriate Constipation should be expected during opioid treatment and prophylactic measures always be initiated from the outset as the condition is easier to prevent than treat 68 Opioids cause constipation but they are not the only medication to do so Other medications that may cause or exacerbate the problem are those with anticholinergic adverse effects eg tricyclic antidepressants and calcium channel blockers eg verapamil As a general measure have the patient toilet regularly at the same time each day Take advantage of the gastrocolic reflex that occurs after eating the strongest peristalsis occurs in the early morning 69 Cathartic medications fall into several classes 70 For patients with advanced illness poor mobility and decreased oral intake a stimulant laxative eg prune juice senna casanthranol or bisacodyl is appropriate front line therapy 71 Osmotic laxatives eg magnesium salts lactulose sorbitol may be added Detergent laxatives eg docusate at conventional doses are only stool softeners and are rarely effective when used alone for patients at the end of life Prokinetic agents eg metoclopramide added to the regimen may assist the occasional patient whose constipation is refractory A lubricant stimulant eg mineral oil may assist a patient to defecate if the rectal vault is full Large volume enemas that work by distending the colon to induce peristalsis and soften are not well tolerated by debilitated patients A frequent mistake is the failure to dose escalate a particular cathartic This leads to the sense that nothing works when in fact nothing has been tried to its maximal therapeutic dose Habituation in patients at the end of life is rarely an important clinical concern Fatigue Weakness Fatigue weakness is the most frequent distressing symptom associated with advanced illness and end of life care Patients and families frequently focus on the symptom rather than its underlying cause Many believe that a person s strength is under his or her control and feel that the patient is giving up not fighting or not eating enough Physicians can play an instrumental role by educating patients and families about the nature of the symptom and by giving the patient permission to rest They can help decrease the pressure from family or others exhorting the patient to be more alert energetic and conversant Assistance from other team members may be instrumental There are many general approaches to the management of fatigue 69 Help patients and families to adapt activities of daily living to promote energy conservation Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can help with assessment teaching and assistive devices Discontinue routine medications that are no longer appropriate near the end of life that may be making the fatigue worse eg antihypertensives cardiac medications diuretics etc While fatigue weakness is not easily treated pharmacologically some patients respond to glucocorticoids eg dexamethasone 70 71 72 While they can be continued until death the effect may wane after 4 to 6 weeks As long term adverse effects are not a factor for patients who are at the end of their lives there is no need to taper the dose if it remains effective The psychostimulants eg methylphenidate may also be effective 73 Symptom Management During The Last Hours Of Life There are a variety of physiological changes that occur in the last hours and days of life Each can be alarming if it is not understood The most common are summarized here Weakness and Fatigue Weakness and fatigue usually increase as the patient approaches death The patients may become almost completely still and this need not be resisted Most treatment to alleviate it can be discontinued Joints may become uncomfortable if they are not moved 77 Continuous pressure on the same area of skin particularly over bony prominences will increase the risk of skin ischemia and pain 78 As the patient approaches death provide adequate support and cushioning on the bed to lessen the need for uncomfortable turning Cessation of Intake Most patients completely lose their appetite and stop drinking 79 80 This may heighten onlookers distress However most experts feel that dehydration in the last hours of living does not cause distress and may stimulate the release of endorphins and anaesthetic compounds that promote the patient s sense of well being 81 82 83 Low blood pressure or weak pulse is part of the dying process and not an indication of dehydration Patients who are not able to be upright do not get light headed or dizzy Meticulous oral nasal and conjunctival hygiene help to allay concerns overt patient thirst 84 Patients with peripheral edema or ascites have excess body water and salt and are not dehydrated though their intravascular volume may be contracted due to hypoalbuminemia Parenteral fluids delivered either intravenously or subcutaneously by hypodermoclysis are sometimes considered particularly when the goal is to reverse delirium 85 However parenteral fluids may have adverse effects that are not commonly considered Intravenous lines can be cumbersome and particularly uncomfortable when the patient is cachectic or has no discernible veins Excess parenteral fluids can lead to fluid overload with consequent peripheral or pulmonary edema worsened breathlessness cough and orotracheobronchial secretions particularly if there is significant hypoalbuminemia Loss of Ability to Swallow Once the patient is unable to swallow cease oral intake Warn families and professional caregivers of the risk of aspiration Scopolamine or glycopyrrolate will effectively reduce the production of saliva and other secretions 37 38 They will minimize or eliminate the gurgling from mucous buildup in the pharynx and trachea and may be used prophylactically in the unconscious dying patient Anecdote suggests that the earlier treatment is initiated the better it works as larger amounts of secretions in the upper aerodigestive tract are more difficult to eliminate However premature use in the patient who is still alert may lead to unacceptable drying of oral and pharyngeal mucosa While atropine may be equally effective it has an increased risk of producing undesired cardiac and or CNS excitation 86 If excessive fluid accumulates in the back of the throat and upper airways it may be cleared by repositioning or postural drainage Oropharyngeal suctioning is likely to be ineffective as secretions are usually beyond the reach of the catheter Continued efforts to suction may only stimulate an otherwise peaceful patient and distress family members who are watching Neurological Changes The neurological changes associated with the dying process are the result of multiple concurrent irreversible factors These changes may manifest themselves in 2 different patterns that have been described as the two roads to death See figure 3 87 Most patients follow the usual road that presents as decreasing level of consciousness and leads to coma and death Terminal Delirium An agitated delirium may be the first sign to herald the difficult road to death These patients frequently present with confusion restlessness and or agitation with or without day night reversal 88 To the family and professional caregivers who do not understand it agitated terminal delirium can be very distressing Although previous care may have been excellent if the delirium goes misdiagnosed or unmanaged family members will likely remember a horrible death in terrible pain with cognitive impairment because of the drugs It may be appropriate to evaluate and try to reverse treatable contributing factors However if the patient is in the last hours of his or her life with other concurrent signs of the dying process the condition is by definition irreversible Management appropriately focuses on the management of the symptoms associated with the terminal delirium in order to settle the patient and the family 89 When moaning groaning and grimacing accompany the agitation and restlessness they are frequently interpreted as physical pain 90 However uncontrollable pain rarely develops or worsens during the last hours of life Look for tension in the forehead particularly for furrowing of the brow as a clue that pain may be present While a trial of opioids may be beneficial in the unconscious patient who is difficult to assess physicians must remember that opioids may accumulate and add to delirium when renal clearance is poor 91 92 If the trial of increased opioids does not relieve the agitation or makes the delirium worse by increasing agitation or precipitating myoclonic jerks or seizures rare then pursue alternate therapies directed at suppressing the symptoms associated with delirium Benzodiazepines are used widely to treat terminal delirium as they are anxiolytics amnestics skeletal muscle relaxants and antiepileptics 93 Pre dissolved oral lorazepam can be administered against the buccal mucosa and dose escalated to effect Infusional benzodiazepines may be a rapidly effective alternative Benzodiazepines may paradoxically excite some patients 94 These patients require neuroleptic medications to control their delirium Haloperidol given intravenously subcutaneously or rectally may be effective 95 A more sedating alternative is chlorpromazine given intravenously or rectally 96 Barbiturates or propofol have been suggested as alternatives for the patient who is particularly difficult to control 97 98 Family Suffering Over Physiological Changes Changes in breathing patterns are frequent and can be distressing to the onlooker Warn family members and caregivers about the breathing patterns that they may observe Loss of sphincter control in the last hours of life may lead to incontinence of urine and or stool Cleaning and skin care are important A urinary catheter may minimize the need for frequent changing and cleaning prevent skin breakdown and reduce the demand on caregivers However it is not always necessary if urine flow is minimal and can be managed with absorbent pads or surfaces If diarrhea is considerable and relentless a rectal tube may be similarly effective Eyes that remain open can be distressing to onlookers unless the condition is understood Advanced wasting leads to loss of the retro orbital fat pad and the orbit falls posteriorly within the orbital socket 99 As eyelids are of insufficient length to both extend the additional distance backward and cover the conjunctiva they may not be able to fully appose Maintain moisture by using ophthalmic lubricants artificial tears or physiological saline 100 Conclusions A host of physical symptoms are common in patients with advanced life threatening illness If assessed many can be relieved We have summarized the management of only a few The interested physician will want to seek additional advice from some of the many sources of information available Symptom control is an essential but not a complete part of the core competencies of physicians in end of life care 3 Competing Interests None declared Authors Contributions LE conceived of the EPEC Program FF CvG and LE
