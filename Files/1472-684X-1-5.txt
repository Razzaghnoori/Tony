                    Background        A wide range of symptoms produce considerable suffering        in patients at the end of their lives This monograph aims        to summarize the core competencies in symptom control        needed by any physician no matter his or her specialty        Many of the approaches will apply much earlier in the        course of the illness not just at the end of life        The monograph does not purport to summarize specialist        knowledge While some practitioners will have specialist        palliative care services upon which to call most in the        world will need to provide the initial approaches to        symptom control at the endoflife This is not a fringe        activity but a core competency for physicians After an        overview of the approaches to whole patient assessment we        summarize the management of several of the more common        symptoms that occur at the endoflife        However to focus on symptom control skills alone will        miss the mark To be effective in endoflife care        physicians must also have a broad conceptualization of        endoflife care and the legal issues that support it           and they must be competent in communication        decisionmaking and relationbuilding skills     While        we hope each pearl can improve a physicians practice the        complete         Education for Physicians on Endoflife        Care EPEC Curriculum should be mastered in order to        be fully effective                       Methods        To increase physician knowledge of new developments in        palliation and their level of clinical competence in        endoflife care the Institute for Ethics at the American        Medical Association with support from the Robert Wood        Johnson Foundation embarked on the Education for        Physicians on Endoflife Care EPEC Project The overall        goal of the EPEC Project is to teach physicians how to        provide better care to terminally ill patients The overall        method is to use a trainthetrainer dissemination model        The central hypothesis is that a core curriculum designed        written and taught by physicians using state of the art        clinical knowledge and education theory can be effective        in reaching a second tier of physicians by having the newly        trained physicians return to their work settings and seek        to engage and educate a growing number of their peers using        and adapting the provided educational materials The        project aims to improve endoflife care through a ripple        effect as the trainers educate a growing number of        physicians        A key tool of the EPEC Project was the development of        the         EPEC Curriculum It sets out the core        competencies that all physicians should have in palliative        care It was not intended to define or describe the        specialty skills of a palliative medicine physician Two        Advisory Boards of  expert physicians in ethics hospice        and palliative care initially recommended the curricular        content and format A team of experts with considerable        clinical and research experience and expertise in physician        education then developed the curriculum Finally it was        modified based on the opinions of the first  physicians        and other health care professionals trained to teach        endoflife care using the         EPEC Curriculum EPEC Trainers The        final         EPEC Curriculum represents a        synthesis of the ideas of many experts and clinicians The        information in the present manuscript is extracted from        this curriculum                    Results                  Whole Patient Assessment          Management strategies to relieve suffering in          endoflife care begin with a comprehensive assessment of          the whole patient and his or her family This approach          to assessment may be quite distinct from familiar history          taking and physical examination techniques Whole patient          assessment examines a range of issues that may cause          suffering It forms the basis for setting goals of care          rather than seeking problembased solutions The          assessment process itself can be a therapeutic tool It          acknowledges the patient as a person and conveys          compassion               During the assessment ask about each of the possible          symptoms and the patients functional activities rather          than about organ systems or anatomy Because symptoms are          inherently subjective patient selfreport is the gold          standard for assessment     Validated symptom          assessment tools may assist the clinician to gain          consistent insight into the patients perception of a          symptom eg its severity etc When considering          diagnostic tests assess their potential to assist relief          of suffering rather than diagnosis for its own sake          Most people with an advanced lifethreatening illness          experience situational and possibly pathological changes          in their affect and cognitive function and a range of          emotions and fears Fear of loss of control and dignity          abandonment being a burden and physical suffering can          be so strong that patients desire hastened death          Screening questions to assess for depression anxiety and          cognitive impairment and inquiries about coping          responses and fears are all important since these issues          can be redressed               While the physician may not have the skills of a          social worker he or she should be able to make an          initial assessment of the patients social and practical          needs Unresolved relationships or financial legal or          practical matters may be sources of distress              Because  of families spend their life savings andor          lose a source of income in order to care for the patient          it is important to know about financial status and health          insurance coverage     The need for practical help          must be addressed even the best of care plans may fail          if the chores of daytoday living are not attended to                       Every person has a spiritual dimension to his or her          life Whether it is understood in frankly religious          terms or in terms of personal meaning and the mystery of          life studies suggest that patients welcome inquiry about          their spiritual issues      While a chaplain or          skilled pastor usually administers spiritual care the          physician must consider the possibility that spiritual          pain also manifests itself as physical mental or social          distress          Equipped with a full assessment of the nature and          context of the issues that are causing suffering for the          patient and family the physician can then address each          issue in turn The following addresses some of the most          common physical issues and some touches on some of the          related family or social issues they raise                          Pain          Pain occurs frequently in endoflife care It can be          acute or chronic              Pain can be nociceptive or neuropathic in origin The          patients description physical findings and the results          of laboratory tests and imaging studies will usually be          sufficient for a provisional diagnosis              Nociceptive pain involves direct stimulation of intact          mechanical chemical or thermal nociceptors and          transmission of electrical signals along normally          functioning nerves Patients may describe this as sharp          aching andor throbbing pain that is easily localized          Visceral nociceptive pain eg cardiac lung GI GU          results from stimulation of the autonomic nervous system          and may be difficult to describe or localize          Neuropathic pain is presumed to result from disordered          function of the peripheral or central nervous system due          to any of many potential causes Patients tend to          describe neuropathic pain with words like burning          tingling numbness shooting stabbing or electriclike          feelings                          Management          Effective pain management requires a clear          understanding of the etiology and neuropathophysiology of          each pain and the pharmacology of analgesics          Nociceptive pain generally responds well to opioids          andor coanalgesics Although neuropathic pain may          respond well to opioids adjuvant analgesics tricyclic          antidepressants anticonvulsants antiarrhythmics etc          are often required in combination with opioids to achieve          adequate relief          Although research is not yet conclusive unmanaged          pain itself may lead to changes in the nervous system          that could reduce its responsiveness to treatment               Equally important unrelieved pain can have a          devastating psychological effect on the individual and          family     As there is no reason to delay the use of          analgesics    initiate analgesic interventions while          completing investigations and providing therapies          directed against the cause of the pain eg radiation for          a neoplasm          Placebos have no role to play in the assessment or          management of pain outside of clinical trials              Neither is there rationale for concerns that appropriate          doses of analgesics will mask signs that will prevent          accurate diagnosis and treatment                Frequently pharmacological and nonpharmacological          interventions and an interdisciplinary plan that includes          other health care professionals nurses social workers          pharmacists chaplains physiotherapists occupational          therapists child life specialists etc are required to          manage pain effectively Plans must be tailored to the          expectations and needs of each individual patient and          family Flexibility and ongoing education of the patient          family and all caregivers ongoing assessment of          treatment outcomes and regular review of the plan of          care are all essential      When a plan does not          control a patients pain in a timely manner ask for help          from colleagues with more expertise                          WHO Step Model to Guide Analgesic Dosing          In  the World Health Organization WHO developed          a step conceptual model to guide the management of          cancer pain see Figure      It provides a simple          welltested model to guide the initial selection          administration and titration of analgesics to manage the          pain associated with any serious illness When initiating          or titrating analgesics it is not necessary to traverse          each step of the model sequentially a patient with          severe pain  on a numerical or visual analogue          scale  NAS or VAS may need to have step  opioids from          the outset                          Step  Analgesics          Acetaminophen and the nonsteroidal antiinflammatory          drugs NSAIDs including ASA have an important role in          symptom management However all have a ceiling effect to          their analgesia See table      All step           analgesics have a risk of adverse effects that are          potentially lifethreatening          The mechanism of action of acetaminophen is still          unknown although it is known that it does not have a          peripheral antiinflammatory effect Typically it is          used alone or combined with other analgesics as a          coanalgesic for additive or synergistic analgesic          effects Patients who may think more is better should be          cautioned that toxicity can ensue at   gm          acetaminophen hr particularly in patients with          hepatic compromise          NSAIDs work at least in part by inhibiting          cyclooxygenase the enzyme that converts arachidonic          acid to prostaglandins They act directly at          neurosynaptic junctions and by reducing inflammation          They can be used alone or as coanalgesics          Extendedrelease NSAIDs or those with long halflives          eg piroxicam are likely to enhance adherence          Intravenous formulations are also available eg          ketorolac Care must be taken to anticipate the          potentially adverse effects of NSAIDs eg gastropathy          nephropathy and inhibition of platelet aggregation that          are independent of the route of administration The newer          agents specific to the isoenzyme cyclooxygenase  may          have fewer adverse effects but are less potent and more          expensive than other possible choices There is no reason          not to start with the least expensive agent for a          clinical trial before moving to more expensive          agents                          Step  and  Analgesics          Step  and  analgesics include the pure agonist          opioids eg codeine fentanyl hydrocodone          hydromorphone morphine and oxycodone Those suggested          for step  dosing combine a pure agonist opioid with          either acetaminophen or aspirin to limit the amount of          opioid that can be used              All of these opioids except fentanyl follow          firstorder kinetics They reach their peak plasma          concentration Cmax approximately  to  minutes after          oral including enteral feeding tube or rectal          administration  minutes after subcutaneous or          intramuscular injection and  minutes after intravenous          injection see Figure  Dosed once every halflife          steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within           halflives Analgesia appears to track with plasma          concentration They are eliminated from the body at a          fixed rate irrespective of the dose The liver first          conjugates them then the kidney excretes  to  of          the metabolites Except for the demethylation of codeine          methylmorphine to its active metabolite their          metabolic pathways do not become saturated          Based on these pharmacological principles if an          immediateacting oral opioid is selected and the pain is          continuous or nearly so give the medication q h on a          routine schedule not as needed The best possible          pain control for the dose will be achieved within           hours once steady state has been reached          To control any extra or breakthrough pain provide          the patient with as needed rescue doses of the same          immediateacting opioid Each rescue dose should be about           of the total  hour dose offered q h prn PO or          PR q  min prn SC or IM or q  min prn IV          If pain remains uncontrolled after  hours increase          the routine dose by an amount at least equal to the total          dose of rescue medication used during the previous           hours If pain is mild or moderate an increase of  to           in the total daily dose should be expected If pain          is severe or uncontrolled an increase of  to           should be expected In fact if pain is severe and          uncontrolled after  or  doses eg crescendo pain do          not wait for  hours to pass before increasing the          routine dose There is no maximum dose for a pure agonist          opioid Follow the patient closely and titrate the          analgesics until the pain is relieved or adverse effects          are encountered          Increasingly  hours sustainedrelease          formulations of the opioids are becoming widely available          for routine usage either as tablets or granules They          must be ingested whole not crushed or chewed A fentanyl          transdermal patch is also available that can deliver          medication for up to  hours Use of these preparations          is likely to improve patient adherence Extendedrelease          formulations are not indicated for rescue dosing For          this purpose use a concurrent dose of an          immediaterelease formulation of the same opioid          Methadone although the least expensive oral opioid          has a long and variable halflife days Only those with          additional training should use it for pain control          Not all opioid analgesics that are commonly available          are recommended for acute or chronic dosing Meperidine          is poorly absorbed orally and has a short halflife of          approximately  hours Its principal metabolite          normeperidine has no analgesic properties of its own          has a longer halflife of about  hours is renally          excreted and produces significant adverse effects when          it accumulates Propoxyphene is typically administered at          doses that produce relatively little analgesia The mixed          opioid agonistantagonists such as pentazocine          butorphanol nalbuphine and dezocine are not recommended          as routine analgesics Their dosing is limited by a          ceiling effect and they have a high risk of adverse          effects They must not be used if the patient is already          taking a pure agonist opioid as competition for the          opioid receptors may cause a withdrawal syndrome          If patients have good pain control on stable doses of          an opioid and are not experiencing adverse effects          especially drowsiness it is safe to drive a car          Patients in pain may have much poorer reaction times and          may be a much greater risk          If a patient is unable to ingest an oral analgesic an          alternate route of administration or an alternate opioid          may be preferable Intramuscular injections are not          recommended Intermittent subcutaneous doses are just as          effective and much less painful          When changing routes of administration or opioids an          equianalgesic table is a useful guide for initial dose          selection Significant firstpass metabolism necessitates          larger oral or rectal doses to produce analgesia          equivalent to parenteral doses of the same opioid          Equivalence dosing recommendations represent consensus          from limited available evidence so they are guides only          Individual patients may require doses to be adjusted by          more than a factor of  to achieve effective analgesia          without adverse effects See Table               Opioids have common and uncommon adverse effects          Table  While several may be a problem initially          pharmacological tolerance typically develops to all of          the adverse effects except constipation within days          Always caution patients and families to anticipate nausea          and drowsiness for the first few days until tolerance          develops Provide antiemetics as needed Prophylactic          routine stimulant laxatives should be prescribed          Many physicians misperceive that respiratory          depression is a significant risk when prescribing opioids          for pain In fact it is rare pain is a potent stimulus          to breath somnolence always develops first and          pharmacological tolerance to respiratory depression          develops quickly          The cost of opioid analgesics varies considerably          Adequate analgesia can be achieved for the majority of          patients with the least expensive opioids such as          immediaterelease preparations of morphine                          Addiction          It is a prevalent myth that the administration of          opioid analgesics for pain management causes addiction              Confusion about the differences between addiction          tolerance and physical dependence is in part          responsible          The hallmark of opioid addiction is psychological          dependence manifested by a behavioral syndrome of          continued compulsive drug use despite harm              Care must be taken to differentiate a true addiction          substance use disorder from pseudo addiction due to          under treatment of pain or other aberrant drugrelated          behaviors              Pharmacological tolerance to analgesics ie the          reduced effectiveness of a given dose of medication over          time is not evidence of addiction    and is rarely          significant clinically After an initial titration          period doses may remain stable for long periods months          to years if the pain stimulus remains unchanged An          increasing need for more analgesics more likely reflects          progression of the symptom and underlying disease On the          other hand tolerance to opioid adverse effects is          commonly observed and is favorable              Physical dependence evidenced by the development of a          withdrawal syndrome when a medication is suddenly          withdrawn is not evidence of addition     Similar          outcomes occur in the presence of exogenous hormones and          other medications that act through cellular receptors          eg estrogens betablockers alpha agonists          caffeine etc Some patients will experience less pain          either spontaneously or with changes in their underlying          disease If the pain stimulus decreases or disappears          opioid doses usually can be reduced in decrements of           or more every  to  days and finally stopped without          causing a withdrawal syndrome                              Depression          It is a myth that persistent feelings of helplessness          and hopelessness are inevitable and permanent          consequences of advanced lifethreatening illness              Most patients with a serious illness experience periods          of intense situational sadness and anxiety accompanied by          depressive symptoms These feelings are usually present          for a relatively short period days to weeks and then          resolve However in a variable number of patients these          feelings persist          The earlier depression is diagnosed the more          responsive to treatment it may be     The most          reliable symptoms of major depression in patients with          advanced illness are persistent dysphoria anhedonia          feelings of helplessness hopelessness and          worthlessness and loss of selfesteem     The          somatic symptoms of depression such as changes in          weight are unreliable as they may reflect the underlying          illness     The screening question Do you feel          depressed most of the time is a highly sensitive and          specific question in this population     Thoughts of          suicide and requests to hasten death may be a marker of          undiagnosed depression          Treatment for depression may help patients feel better          and have the energy and interest to achieve their final          goals before they die Approaches that combine supportive          counseling and psychotherapy with antidepressant          medication work best Other members of the health care          team can provide invaluable assistance to support the          depressed patient and his or her family          When reversal of depression is an immediate shortterm          goal a rapidacting psychostimulant such as          methylphenidate is the best choice     If a          response in  to  weeks is acceptable an atypical          antidepressant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor          SSRI may be an appropriate choice     Tricyclic          antidepressants have limited usefulness due to their long          time to achieve therapeutic levels and risk of          anticholinergic adverse effects     If the diagnosis          is unclear or the expected therapeutic response delayed          consult with a colleague with expertise                          Anxiety          Patients facing a lifethreatening illness commonly          experience anxiety over their fears and uncertainties          about their future     Compassionate exploration of          the specific issues that are causing or exacerbating          anxiety may be complex Issues of grief and loss may be          important contributors Differentiate between primary          anxiety and delirium depression bipolar disorder and          medication side effects Look for insomnia and other          reversible causes of anxiety due to alcohol caffeine or          medications     Input from family friends and other          members of the interdisciplinary team may be          invaluable          Like depression the management of anxiety often          requires a combination of supportive therapy and          medications Concerns about finances family conflicts          future disability dependency and existential concerns          will not resolve with medication When it appears that          pharmacological therapy will be beneficial          benzodiazepines are generally the medication class of          choice     Intermediate halflife agents eg          lorazepam or clonazepam are commonly used          Benzodiazepines may worsen shortterm memory          particularly in the elderly or cause confusion in          patients with preexisting cognitive impairment A few          patients will experience a paradoxical reaction to          benzodiazepines and their anxiety will get worse When          discontinuing benzodiazepines taper them slowly to          prevent rebound anxiety                          Breathlessness Dyspnea          Breathlessness may be one of the most distressing          symptoms for patients families and caregivers          Believing the patients self report is the best way to          assess it Where possible the underlying cause should be          treated to at least provide symptomatic relief when the          burden of the therapy does not outweigh the benefit          There are  widely used medical approaches for the          symptomatic relief of breathlessness oxygen opioids          and anxiolytics Nonpharmacological interventions may          also contribute significantly to the patients and          familys sense of wellbeing and their ability to          cope          The majority of patients who report breathlessness are          not hypoxemic Measures of hypoxemia eg pulse oximetry          blood gas determination do not correlate with the          patients selfreport        This is not to          say that such measurements may not be useful in          understanding pathophysiology However the measurements          frequently do not correlate with symptom relief In          addition such measurements may be uncomfortable          frightening andor expensive and divert the focus away          from the symptom          While oxygen will not reverse the cause of the          breathlessness a therapeutic trial of supplemental          oxygen by nasal prongs may be beneficial This may have a          placebo effect     In addition its effectiveness          may be explained by the observation that cool air moving          across the patients face eg from compressed air by          nasal prongs or from a fan may provide equal relief due          to the stimulation of the V branch of the fifth cranial          nerve              Opioids may provide significant relief of the sense of          breathlessness without having a measurable impact on          their respiratory rate or blood gas concentrations              Through both central and peripheral effects doses          lower than those used to relieve pain may be effective in          opioid nave patients In some patients subjective          relief may also be associated with a measurable increase          in exercise tolerance and mobility               Concerns that opioid usage to manage symptoms will          cause respiratory depression or hasten death ie an          unintended effect or cause addiction are not relevant          Opioid treatment for dyspnea is consistent with good          medical practice ethical when the intent is to relieve          suffering widely accepted when standard dosing          guidelines are followed and very unlikely to be          associated with abuse behaviors     As with pain          treatment pharmacological tolerance is not a clinically          significant issue          Some patients who are breathless and anxious may also          need treatment for their anxiety Benzodiazepine          medications may be combined safely with opioids                                       NauseaVomiting          A thorough assessment of the etiology and          pathophysiology of nausea and vomiting is crucial as          different causes will require very different          interventions Two organ systems  the gastric lining of          the GI tract and the area postrema the chemoreceptor          trigger zone the vestibular apparatus and the cortex          of the brain are important contributors              The neurotransmitters dopamine histamine          acetylcholine and serotonin are important mediators of          this symptom complex All four can be demonstrated in the          area postrema Although all are present in the lining of          the GI tract serotonin is particularly important          Acetylcholine and histamine are important in the          vestibular apparatus Nausea and vomiting that is          mediated by the cortex is more complex and not associated          with specific neurotransmitters eg the anticipatory          nausea associated with chemotherapy          Dopaminemediated nausea is probably the most          frequently targeted for initial symptom management even          when the precise mechanism of nausea is not known          Dopamine antagonist medications used to control nausea          include the phenothiazines eg prochlorperazine or          butyrophenone neuroleptics eg haloperidol Both have          the potential to cause drowsiness and extrapyramidal          symptoms particularly in young women              Commonly used antihistamines eg diphenhydramine          hydroxyzine also have anticholinergic properties They          may do double duty as a single agent and cover both          etiologies of nausea              Opioids and anesthetics can trigger          acetylcholinemediated nausea in the vestibular          apparatus A pure anticholinergic medication may be added          to other antiemetics in empirical therapy particularly          when the vestibular apparatus is implicated eg          scopolamine              Serotonin antagonists have been very effective in          treating chemotherapyassociated nausea eg ondansetron              They have been reported to be useful for          refractory nausea of diverse types but are typically          tried only when other medications have failed They are          expensive and should be promptly stopped if they are not          effective after a short therapeutic trial          A sluggish or dyskinetic gut that does not empty          properly due to carcinomatosis opioid therapy other          medications diabetes mellitus etc may be a source of          nausea and vomiting in patients with advanced disease              Constipation a large liver producing a squashed          stomach ascites or peritoneal disease may be causing          pseudoobstruction Medications with prokinetic effects          eg metoclopramide or stimulant laxatives eg senna          bisacodyl may be effective at moving gut contents          forward and relieving the associated nausea              Hyperacidity with or without gastroesophageal reflux          andor gastric or duodenal erosions may produce nausea          heartburn acidity or bitter taste that may be          associated with vomiting Antacids H            receptor antagonists or proton pump          inhibitors may relieve the hyperacidity andor reflux          Cytoprotective agents eg misoprostol may be effective          in treating the nausea associated with mucosal erosion          secondary to NSAIDs          Heterogeneous groups of medications that have unclear          mechanisms of action but uncontested benefits in some          patients include glucocorticoids eg dexamethasone          cannabinoids eg tetrahydrocannabinol and          benzodiazepines eg lorazepam                With complete obstruction accumulation of          intraluminal fluid from epithelial sources is principally          responsible for the symptoms of bloating crampy          abdominal pain nausea and vomiting Octreotide a          synthetic analog of somatostatin selectively inhibits          secretion of fluids and electrolytes into the gut lumen          and may relieve these symptoms                Refractory cases of nausea and vomiting often require          combinations of medications from different classes                          Constipation          Constipation is the discomfort associated with          reduced frequency of bowel movements     If left          unmanaged it can lead to abdominal pain bloating          nausea and vomiting overflow incontinence tenesmus          fecal impaction or even bowel obstruction          As there is a wide range of normal in bowel habits          begin by assessing what the patient considers normal          bowel function Tailor examination investigation and          treatment to the presentation stage and context of the          person and illness For most patients near the end of          life correction of the underlying pathophysiological          cause of constipation is often not possible or          appropriate Constipation should be expected during          opioid treatment and prophylactic measures always be          initiated from the outset as the condition is easier to          prevent than treat     Opioids cause constipation          but they are not the only medication to do so Other          medications that may cause or exacerbate the problem are          those with anticholinergic adverse effects eg tricyclic          antidepressants and calciumchannel blockers eg          verapamil          As a general measure have the patient toilet          regularly at the same time each day Take advantage of          the gastrocolic reflex that occurs after eating  the          strongest peristalsis occurs in the early morning                       Cathartic medications fall into several classes              For patients with advanced illness poor mobility and          decreased oral intake a stimulant laxative eg prune          juice senna casanthranol or bisacodyl is appropriate          frontline therapy     Osmotic laxatives eg          magnesium salts lactulose sorbitol may be added          Detergent laxatives eg docusate at conventional doses          are only stool softeners and are rarely effective when          used alone for patients at the endoflife Prokinetic          agents eg metoclopramide added to the regimen may          assist the occasional patient whose constipation is          refractory A lubricant stimulant eg mineral oil may          assist a patient to defecate if the rectal vault is full          Largevolume enemas that work by distending the colon to          induce peristalsis and soften are not well tolerated by          debilitated patients          A frequent mistake is the failure to doseescalate a          particular cathartic This leads to the sense that          nothing works when in fact nothing has been tried to          its maximal therapeutic dose Habituation in patients at          the endoflife is rarely an important clinical          concern                          FatigueWeakness          Fatigueweakness is the most frequent distressing          symptom associated with advanced illness and endoflife          care Patients and families frequently focus on the          symptom rather than its underlying cause Many believe          that a persons strength is under his or her control and          feel that the patient is giving up not fighting or          not eating enough          Physicians can play an instrumental role by educating          patients and families about the nature of the symptom          and by giving the patient permission to rest They can          help decrease the pressure from family or others          exhorting the patient to be more alert energetic and          conversant Assistance from other team members may be          instrumental          There are many general approaches to the management of          fatigue     Help patients and families to adapt          activities of daily living to promote energy          conservation Physiotherapy and occupational therapy can          help with assessment teaching and assistive devices          Discontinue routine medications that are no longer          appropriate near the end of life that may be making the          fatigue worse eg antihypertensives cardiac          medications diuretics etc          While fatigueweakness is not easily treated          pharmacologically some patients respond to          glucocorticoids eg dexamethasone       While          they can be continued until death the effect may wane          after  to  weeks As longterm adverse effects are not          a factor for patients who are at the end of their lives          there is no need to taper the dose if it remains          effective The psychostimulants eg methylphenidate may          also be effective                              Symptom Management During The Last Hours Of          Life          There are a variety of physiological changes that          occur in the last hours and days of life Each can be          alarming if it is not understood The most common are          summarized here                          Weakness and Fatigue          Weakness and fatigue usually increase as the patient          approaches death The patients may become almost          completely still and this need not be resisted Most          treatment to alleviate it can be discontinued Joints may          become uncomfortable if they are not moved              Continuous pressure on the same area of skin          particularly over bony prominences will increase the          risk of skin ischemia and pain     As the patient          approaches death provide adequate support and cushioning          on the bed to lessen the need for uncomfortable          turning                          Cessation of Intake          Most patients completely lose their appetite and stop          drinking      This may heighten onlookers          distress However most experts feel that dehydration in          the last hours of living does not cause distress and may          stimulate the release of endorphins and anaesthetic          compounds that promote the patients sense of well being                Low blood pressure or weak pulse is part          of the dying process and not an indication of          dehydration Patients who are not able to be upright do          not get lightheaded or dizzy Meticulous oral nasal          and conjunctival hygiene help to allay concerns overt          patient thirst              Patients with peripheral edema or ascites have excess          body water and salt and are not dehydrated though their          intravascular volume may be contracted due to          hypoalbuminemia Parenteral fluids delivered either          intravenously or subcutaneously by hypodermoclysis are          sometimes considered particularly when the goal is to          reverse delirium     However parenteral fluids may          have adverse effects that are not commonly considered          Intravenous lines can be cumbersome and particularly          uncomfortable when the patient is cachectic or has no          discernible veins Excess parenteral fluids can lead to          fluid overload with consequent peripheral or pulmonary          edema worsened breathlessness cough and          orotracheobronchial secretions particularly if there is          significant hypoalbuminemia                          Loss of Ability to Swallow          Once the patient is unable to swallow cease oral          intake Warn families and professional caregivers of the          risk of aspiration Scopolamine or glycopyrrolate will          effectively reduce the production of saliva and other          secretions      They will minimize or eliminate          the gurgling from mucous buildup in the pharynx and          trachea and may be used prophylactically in the          unconscious dying patient Anecdote suggests that the          earlier treatment is initiated the better it works as          larger amounts of secretions in the upper aerodigestive          tract are more difficult to eliminate However premature          use in the patient who is still alert may lead to          unacceptable drying of oral and pharyngeal mucosa While          atropine may be equally effective it has an increased          risk of producing undesired cardiac andor CNS excitation                       If excessive fluid accumulates in the back of the          throat and upper airways it may be cleared by          repositioning or postural drainage Oropharyngeal          suctioning is likely to be ineffective as secretions are          usually beyond the reach of the catheter Continued          efforts to suction may only stimulate an otherwise          peaceful patient and distress family members who are          watching                          Neurological Changes          The neurological changes associated with the dying          process are the result of multiple concurrent          irreversible factors These changes may manifest          themselves in  different patterns that have been          described as the two roads to death See figure               Most patients follow the usual road that presents          as decreasing level of consciousness and leads to coma          and death                          Terminal Delirium          An agitated delirium may be the first sign to herald          the difficult road to death These patients frequently          present with confusion restlessness andor agitation          with or without daynight reversal     To the family          and professional caregivers who do not understand it          agitated terminal delirium can be very distressing          Although previous care may have been excellent if the          delirium goes misdiagnosed or unmanaged family members          will likely remember a horrible death in terrible pain          with cognitive impairment because of the drugs          It may be appropriate to evaluate and try to reverse          treatable contributing factors However if the patient          is in the last hours of his or her life with other          concurrent signs of the dying process the condition is          by definition irreversible Management appropriately          focuses on the management of the symptoms associated with          the terminal delirium in order to settle the patient and          the family              When moaning groaning and grimacing accompany the          agitation and restlessness they are frequently          interpreted as physical pain  However          uncontrollable pain rarely develops or worsens during the          last hours of life Look for tension in the forehead          particularly for furrowing of the brow as a clue that          pain may be present          While a trial of opioids may be beneficial in the          unconscious patient who is difficult to assess          physicians must remember that opioids may accumulate and          add to delirium when renal clearance is poor               If the trial of increased opioids does not relieve the          agitation or makes the delirium worse by increasing          agitation or precipitating myoclonic jerks or seizures          rare then pursue alternate therapies directed at          suppressing the symptoms associated with delirium          Benzodiazepines are used widely to treat terminal          delirium as they are anxiolytics amnestics skeletal          muscle relaxants and antiepileptics              Predissolved oral lorazepam can be administered against          the buccal mucosa and dose escalated to effect          Infusional benzodiazepines may be a rapidly effective          alternative          Benzodiazepines may paradoxically excite some patients              These patients require neuroleptic medications          to control their delirium Haloperidol given          intravenously subcutaneously or rectally may be          effective     A more sedating alternative is          chlorpromazine given intravenously or rectally              Barbiturates or propofol have been suggested as          alternatives for the patient who is particularly          difficult to control                               Family Suffering Over Physiological Changes          Changes in breathing patterns are frequent and can be          distressing to the onlooker Warn family members and          caregivers about the breathing patterns that they may          observe          Loss of sphincter control in the last hours of life          may lead to incontinence of urine andor stool Cleaning          and skin care are important A urinary catheter may          minimize the need for frequent changing and cleaning          prevent skin breakdown and reduce the demand on          caregivers However it is not always necessary if urine          flow is minimal and can be managed with absorbent pads or          surfaces If diarrhea is considerable and relentless a          rectal tube may be similarly effective          Eyes that remain open can be distressing to onlookers          unless the condition is understood Advanced wasting          leads to loss of the retroorbital fat pad and the orbit          falls posteriorly within the orbital socket     As          eyelids are of insufficient length to both extend the          additional distance backward and cover the conjunctiva          they may not be able to fully appose Maintain moisture          by using ophthalmic lubricants artificial tears or          physiological saline                                Conclusions        A host of physical symptoms are common in patients with        advanced lifethreatening illness If assessed many can be        relieved We have summarized the management of only a few        The interested physician will want to seek additional        advice from some of the many sources of information        available Symptom control is an essential but not a        complete part of the core competencies of physicians in        endoflife care                        Competing Interests        None declared                    Authors Contributions        LE conceived of the EPEC Program FF
