 okay well now i m from Dallas oh okay well actually i m living in Dallas i m not from Dallas i uh was living in West Texas before this uh which is a very dry arid uh huh okay well obviously it s kind of a desert area right getting uh close to Mexico or um hum real close New Mexico anyway all right and no and not the humidity i usually think of the South as being very humid well he Dallas is and that s since i ve moved up here now so i m starting to get a little bit of this but Dallas is i ll tell you uh considering well okay i ve uh mostly throughout my life i ve lived in in the smaller parts of of Texas and so moving to Dallas i was a little worried about the traffic uh huh um the differences in terrain because uh you know Dallas is is a lot more hilly than it is where i i was living and i had just bought a new car and it had uh had standard standard on you know standard and i had never had a standard car before i see oh oh you have to get used to hills right so i mean i was real worried about you know having a lot of ice and things like that we just had a wonderful winter i mean there was one or two days of ice the entire winter yeah oh that s good i mean we had cold weather we had a little bit of snow here and there but i mean i couldn t have asked for better first year of getting used to Dallas and my car at the same time i mean it just worked out great for me oh that s good and what what is uh what is the temperature like down there now oh well today it was probably in the eighties um well yeah we ve had uh we ve had several days in the eighties in fact i ll tell you what last night i came real close to turning on the air conditioning i didn t do it oh that s pretty warm already oh is that right i didn t do it but i came close actually last year uh um about a week ago at the same time last um hum last year um we had hit the actually uh nineties for about four days which is very unusual for this area at this time of year um what we re having right now is a lot of overcast i would imagine yes um hum you know a lot of days with uh drizzle or uh actually we ve had a thunderstorm But about this time of the year March blows a lot of winds here and it s a very windy month right um but right now we re in about the sixties which is is fairly comfortable um hum well i heard the uh that um Washington DC has actually got the cherry blossoms blooming so yes we do they peak on Friday so if you have a chance to be here Friday or somewhere somewhere around there that that s the best time to see them and they don t last too long you know so that s hum well yeah that s i heard that yeah and uh then after after this month it ll quickly get get hot you know i mean March April May it has a lot of rain uh May has quite a bit of rain and uh um hum by May we re hitting in the eighties sometimes even low low nineties uh but we don t really get the bad humidity here until July and August those are our worst months um hum well that s that s sort of what happens here except uh we may start a little earlier and end a little later but uh yeah right right so is everything in uh bloom down there now is it warm enough i guess all the trees are yeah they ve been they ve actually been going at it for a good you know four weeks now i would think um um hum you know in fact it s kind of funny uh you know you re watching the newscast i don t know about way up they are up there but the weather cast down here one of the things that they like to do is to tell you what s all in the air you know the fungus and the trees yeah well yeah oh right air quality index yeah but mostly it s you know allergy type index and it s been like like i said about four weeks now that uh they ve had um multiple pages of things and you know of of names of things in the air and uh you know so that s a real good sign that that the trees are in bloom and the flowers are in bloom and stuff like that oh right is that like a pollen sort of a pollen count yeah yeah well we re just starting now like i said the cherry blossoms are out forsythias are out uh no tulips yet so we re probably a few weeks behind pollen count yeah exactly um hum uh you know down uh that area being that south you know and uh um hum that lasts everything s in bloom you know everything s green here till about October and then we lose it all yeah but uh i always wondered about the South i figured that there couldn t be too many months that that trees were were bare because it s it s hot most of the time well it s it s um it depends on what part of the south i think the farther east you go you know from from here on east uh you do have a a limited um hum winter um now south of here uh like in Houston i did even though i said i lived mostly in the small towns i lived a short time in Houston it was winter yeah um hum um hum and you know the coldest day we got down there was like in the sixties you know when it got down in the sixties you were cold down there i see oh okay here it s sixties and we re celebrating okay so there s that s the difference i remember being in Louisiana a few times and and it was uh yeah yeah that um hum i think it was in December one time and it was probably in the fifties and rainy kind of weather but in the fifties and i was shocked to see people all bundled up with scarves and hats as though it were you know in the twenties because here in the fifties people have sweaters so you know i guess it s what you become acclimated to yes um hum oh yes it s a big difference i have a one of my friends is from Kansas City and uh he has lived down here for like eleven years but he refuses um hum to get to to where everybody else is i mean he will not wear long sleeve shirts he will not wear you know jackets and things like that i mean he s the only person i know right that in thirty degree weather still has a short sleeve shirt on you know um but it you know it s still not cold cold here compared to what he s used to so yeah yeah yes right right so uh yeah i i i like it better here i m i m uh formerly a Pennsylvanian and i have to say that i enjoy it that much better here a lot more sunshine and a lot less cold you know but i don t know about ever going that far south to live you know i guess you after a while whatever you get used to what you enjoy that s right um hum well i think that s true yeah although there s you know there s you don t ever want to get too much different to what i mean uh i grew up with a lot of trees around and then i lived out like i said in West Texas where it s desert and there s not a lot of trees and that s the main reason i moved up here was that i did not i mean i hated um hum right seeing you know no trees i mean it s just you could stand on a rooftop and see for miles and miles yeah i can understand that sure yeah i mean no i wouldn t want to i wouldn t want to uh go to a desert type of area either you know you get once you re in greenery you get spoiled by that you know well now that s that s not necessarily true there are people that are born out there that can t stand it here no oh is that right they they feel claustrophobic around trees i thought that was hilarious when i first heard it but i mean i heard it from more than one person so it s got to be somewhat true i mean ah that s interesting um hum yeah yeah so i guess that once they re used to the wide open spaces huh that that yeah that that s interesting so exactly yeah i see i wouldn t have thought from the beginning but i ve talked to so many people about it that it makes sense now i guess yeah i think i ll take the area with trees huh yeah yeah hum i agree i agree of course i wouldn t mind having an area with ocean but we won t get involved in that either right why am i too nice yeah that is pretty good oh but anyway well i that s that s about all you know i have right here on on this area so yeah yeah that sounds good um hum okay well okay well nice talking to you alright well bye bye it was yeah nice talking to you too bye bye
