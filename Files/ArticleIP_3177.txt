 Noted With Pleasure Much as the press coverage of government is in large measure coverage of politics so also do discussions of language get skewed toward issues of usage and etymology In language as in government a vast and remarkable infrastructure some of it regulatory some of it didactic quietly shapes the world in revolutionary ways Yet most of us give little thought to how say there came to be spaces between words or why English has the letters that it does or how the mechanical means of writing affects the nature of writing From time to time however language infrastructure pokes momentarily into public view I recall a heady few days in 1993 when a new reference work by Malcolm Parkes a lecturer in paleography at Oxford enjoyed a certain modest vogue This work was Parkes magisterial Pause and Effect An Introduction to the History of Punctuation in the West a book that at last stripped the cloak of anonymity from the important work of commas periods dashes colons semicolons and countless other full and part time functionaries Several times a day I still think of Parkes disquisition on the now obsolete punctuation mark known as a percontativus a question mark flopped backward and used to indicate a question that is purely rhetorical It is a device we might usefully revive This fall another noteworthy volume on the apparatus of written language has been published The Footnote A Curious History by the Princeton University historian Anthony Grafton The book seeks to explain how footnotes became an essential element of the narrative architecture of historical writing This is not a reference book to be consulted but an excursus to be savored by a writer with a studied sense of style To the inexpert he writes in one place footnotes look like deep root systems solid and fixed to the connoisseur however they reveal themselves as anthills swarming with constructive and combative activity Elsewhere he writes Unlike other forms of credentials footnotes sometimes provide entertainment normally in the form of daggers stuck in the back of the author s colleagues Some of these are inserted politely He sympathetically quotes Noel Coward s observation that having to stop for a footnote is sometimes like having to answer the door while making love Although Grafton does not mention the fact or even allude to it his book appears at a momentous time in the life of the footnote On the one hand encouraged in part by the cultural ascendance of irony and by recreational obeisance to the many tiered nature of experience and truth the noncitational or literary footnote has become increasingly prominent in recent years in journalism criticism and fiction For examples see the effective but very different techniques employed by Nicholson Baker in his novel The Mezzanine and by David Foster Wallace in the novel Infinite Jest and in the essays collected in A Supposedly Fun Thing I ll Never Do Again On the other hand the footnote as scholarly reference tool or scholarly reference weapon has never enjoyed more prominence than it does today each serious work of history Grafton notes must now travel on an impregnably armored bottom rather like a tank In law the analysis of footnotes even sustains a new minor discipline citology The next task for the footnote scarcely begun is the mastery of electronic information an undertaking that offers opportunities for utility and mischief on an incomparable scale Where did the footnote come from Scholars Grafton explains have placed the birth of the footnote in the twelfth century the seventeenth the eighteenth and the nineteenth never without good reason but usually without attending to the other chapters in this story Grafton s book begins by considering the historians Edward Gibbon and Leopold von Ranke who in their own ways raised the historical footnote to a level of high art both as a citational resource and a rhetorical outlet Ranke with his avowed intention to show history wie es eigentlich gewesen how it really was and with his ambition to put the study of history on a scientific footing doubtless had a more pervasive influence on the formal output of generations of historians But Gibbon s source apparatus and sotto voce commentary in Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire remain more accessible and entertaining to ordinary readers Gibbon straightforwardly observes at one point for instance that the emperor Marcus Aurelius thanked the gods in his Meditations for giving him a wife so faithful so gentle and of such a wonderful simplicity of manners Only in the annotation does Gibbon add The world has laughed at the credulity of Marcus but Madam Dacier assures us and we may credit a lady that the husband will always be deceived if the wife condescends to dissemble We owe a debt to the philosopher David Hume for persuading Gibbon to take such notational material out of the back of his volumes and to print it at the bottom of the relevant pages thereby turning end notes into foot notes and allowing Gibbon more effectively to drop the other shoe Neither Ranke nor Gibbon invented the citational or literary footnote Grafton slogs back through time in search of antecedents Medieval commentators ardently glossed the margins of documents with references and asides These like the historian s footnote enable the reader to work backward from the finished argument to the texts it rests on Religious writers in antiquity penned notations that sometimes we now know were later absorbed wholesale into the primary text itself The structure of footnotes grew increasingly elaborate mainly because of the rediscovery during the Renaissance of a wealth of old documentary sources along with the proliferation of new sources made possible by the printing press and the modern archive Some mechanism was needed to make sense of it all What is more humanism and the Reformation set off a fight for the ownership of truth historical and otherwise whence derived authority when the higher Authority had been dethroned and the footnote became a marker of legitimacy As Grafton makes plain the story of the footnote is in many ways the story of historiography itself The story can get a little dense although any reader captivated by footnotes to begin with has already passed the first endurance test And Grafton enlivens his account with a sometimes astonishing array of encylopedists autodidacts and polyhistors The French philosopher Pierre Bayle for example set out in the 1690s to produce a vast reference work Dictionnaire historique et critique Historical and Critical Dictionary whose sole purpose was to point out the mistakes in all other previously published reference works This was a dictionary a bizarre best seller in which even the footnotes had footnotes and whose pages Grafton notes offer the reader only a thin and fragile crust of text on which to cross the deep dark swamp of commentary We smile even as the crossing becomes potentially harder with every day Writing in 1824 Ranke conjured a memorable image of the modern critical historian confronted by and determined to derive order from the boundless quantities of available source material Consider the strange feelings that would arise in someone who entered a great collection of antiquities in which genuine and spurious beautiful and repulsive spectacular and insignificant objects from many nations and periods lay next to one another in complete disorder Does that sound anything like the challenge posed by electronic media And where is a percontativus now that I need one
