                            Sitting in the enveloping quietness of an anechoic chamber or other quiet spot you        soon become aware that the ear makes its own distinctive sounds Whistling buzzing        hissing perhaps a chiming chorus of many tonessuch continuous sounds seem remarkably        nonbiological to my perception more in the realm of the electronic        Even more remarkable put a sensitive microphone in the ear canal and you will usually        pick up an objective counterpart of that subjective experience Now known in auditory        science as spontaneous otoacoustic emission the sound registered by the microphone is a        clear message that the cochlea uses active processes to detect the phenomenally faint        soundsmeasured in micropascalsthat our ears routinely hear If the ear were more        sensitive we would need to contend with the sound of air molecules raining upon our        eardrums        What is that processthe mechanical or electrical scheme that Hallowell Davis in         called the cochlear amplifier Davis which energises the peasized hearing organ        buried in the solid bone of our skull        That question has engaged my curiosity since the late s when English auditory        physicist David Kemp first put a microphone to an ear and discovered the telltale sounds of        the cochlea at work Kemp  Sirenlike the sounds have drawn me into the theory and        experiment of cochlear mechanics now as part of a PhD course at the Australian National        University in Canberra I am studying the micromechanics of this process from a theoretical        point of view and investigating whether a resonance picture of some kind can be applied to        the faint but mysterious sounds most cochleas emit        Kemps discoveries are rightly viewed as opening a fresh path to auditory science and        to the tools and techniques for diagnosing the functional status of the cochlea But in        terms of fundamental understanding a key paper remains that of Thomas Gold more than half        a century ago Gold  Still cited widely today this paper deals with the basic        question of how the cochlea works to analyse sound into its component frequencies Two        prominent theoriessympathetic resonance proposed by Hermann Helmholtz  and        travelling waves proposed by Georg von Bksy need to be distinguished Figure         In a nutshell are there tiny independently tuned elements in the cochlea like the        discrete strings of a piano that are set into sympathetic vibration by incoming sound        Helmholtz or is the continuously graded sensing surface of the cochlea hydrodynamically        coupled so that like flicking a rope motion of the eardrum and middle ear bones causes a        travelling wave to sweep from one end towards the other von Bksy        The first option sympathetic resonance has the advantage of allowing vanishingly small        energies to build up cycle by cycle into an appreciable motionlike boosting a child on a        swing The second travelling wave has the weight of von Bksys extensive experiments        behind it At the same time one of the drawbacks of the travelling wave theory is the        difficulty of accounting for the ears exquisite fine tuning trained musicians can easily        detect tuning differences of less than  Even von Bksy himself notes on page  of        his classic book that the resonance theory of hearing is probably the most elegant of all        theories of hearing        Golds work done in collaboration with RJ Pumphrey Gold and Pumphrey  was the        first to consider that the ear cannot act passively as both Helmholtz and von Bksy had        thought but must be an active detector Gold was a physicist who had done wartime work on        radar and he brought his signalprocessing knowledge to bear on how the cochlea works He        knew that to preserve signaltonoise ratio a signal had to be amplified before the        detector and that surely nature cant be as stupid as to go and put a nerve fibrethat is        a detectorright at the front end of the sensitivity of the system He therefore proposed        that the ear operated like a regenerative receiver much like some radio receivers of the        time that used positive feedback to amplify a signal before it was detected Regenerative        receivers were simpleone could be built with a single vacuum tubeand they provided high        sensitivity and narrow bandwidth A drawback however was that if provoked the circuit        could take off producing an unwanted whistle Gold connected this with the perception of        ringing in the ear tinnitus and daringly suggested that if a microphone were put next to        the ear a corresponding sound might be picked up He experimented placing a microphone in        his ear after inducing temporary tinnitus with overly loud sound The technology wasnt up        to the jobin  microphones werent sensitive enoughand the experiment sadly        failed        Golds pioneering work is now acknowledged to be a harbinger of Kemps discoveries But        there is one aspect of Golds paper that is not so widely considered Golds experiments        led him to favour a resonance theory of hearing In fact the abstract of his  paper        declares that previous theories of hearing are considered and it is shown that only the        resonance theory of Helmholtz is consistent with observation        Gold and Pumphrey did psychophysical experiments in which hearing thresholds were        determined for listeners first for continuous pure tones and then for increasingly briefer        stimuli of the same frequency Gold and Pumphrey showed that their results could only be        accounted for by considering the cochlea as a set of resonators each of which responds to        a narrow frequency range        In a second neat experiment listeners had to detect differences between the sound of        repetitive tone pips series one and those same stimuli but with the phase of every second        pip inverted series two in which compressions replaced rarefactions and vice versa        Outofphase pips should counteract the action of inphase pips and following the        childonswing analogy rapidly bring swinging to a halt Therefore the argument goes the        two series should sound different By increasing the silent interval between pips until the        difference disappeared the experimenters could infer how long the vibrations or swinging        appeared to persist and could then put a measure on the quality factor         Q or narrowness in frequency range of the presumed underlying        resonance        From the first experiment Gold and Pumphrey derived values of         Q of  to  meaning that the range of response was as little as        th of the imposed frequencybased on the picture of a broad travelling wave The        second experiment gave comparable results However their resonance interpretation has been        dismissed because of a methodological flaw in the second experiment the spectral        signatures of the two series are not the same and provide additional cues Nevertheless it        is not widely appreciated that the first experiment seems methodologically sound and its        results remain persuasive        I think the resonance theory deserves reconsideration The evidence of my ears tells me        that the cochlea is very highly tuned and an active resonance theory of some sort seems to        provide the most satisfying explanation Furthermore as well as Golds neglected        experiment we now know from studies of acoustic emissions that the relative bandwidth of        spontaneously emitted sound from the cochlea can be  of the emissions frequency or        less My research guided by Professors M V Srinivasan and N H Fletcher has centred on        finding an answer to that most fundamental question if the cochlea is resonating what are        the resonant elements        A point of inspiration for me is Golds later discussion of cochlear function Gold        some nine years after Kemps discoveries had been made Gold draws a striking analogy        for the problem confronting the cochlea whose resonant elementswhatever they aresit        immersed in fluid the aqueous lymph that fills the organ To make these elements resonate        is difficult says Gold because they are damped by surrounding fluid just like the        strings of a piano submerged in water would be He concludes that to make an underwater        piano work we would have to add sensors and actuators to every string so that once a        string is sounded the damping is counteracted by positive feedback If we now supplied        each string with a correctly designed feedback circuit he surmises then the underwater        piano would work again        My research is investigating what Golds underwater piano strings might be A suggestion        put forward in a recent paper Bell and Fletcher  is that resonance might occur in the        space between the cochleas geometrically arranged rows of outer hair cells These cells        are both effectors they change length when stimulated and sensors their stereocilia        detect minute displacements so a positive feedback network can form that sets up        resonance between one row of cells and its neighbour The key is to transmit the feedback        with the correct phase delay and the new paper describes how this can be done using        squirting waves in the gap occupied by the outer hair cell stereocilia The paper        suggests that the outer hair cells create a standing wave resonance from which energy is        delivered to inner hair cells where neural transduction takes place In this way the        input signal is amplified before it is detectedan active system functioning just like        Golds regenerative receiver        With a prime candidate in place for the resonating elements this should I think        prompt us to reevaluate resonance theories of hearing which were first put forward by the        ancient Greeks and which irrepressibly keep resurfacing The bestknown resonance theory        was that formulated by Helmholtz but at that time no satisfactory resonating elements        could be identified and it lapsed until Golds attempt to revive it There are other        difficulties in reviving a resonance theory of hearing but I think they can be        overcome        If there really are resonant elements in the ear the outstanding question would be how        are they stimulated It is conceivable that motion of the conventional travelling wave sets        them off in which case we have an interesting hybrid of travelling wave and resonance The        other possibility which I favour is that outer hair cells are stimulated by the fast        pressure wave that sweeps through all of the cochlear fluid at the speed of sound in water         ms If that is the case and outer hair cells are primarily pressure sensors not        displacement detectors then the ear is a fully resonant pressuredriven system New life        perhaps to that old resonance idea
