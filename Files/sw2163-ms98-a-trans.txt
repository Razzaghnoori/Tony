 okay i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute well credit cards boy that s an easy topic isn t it okay okay is it yes it is it s one we all hold dear and near i m sure oh yes yes i guess i ve had some good experience and some bad experience with them yeah most of mine s been pretty good although i m i guess i m like a lot of other people now i m trying to to pay off my credit cards and i ve done pretty good at it uh huh well i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want you now not need want yeah uh huh there is a big difference there s a big difference there yeah yeah but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline yeah oh yeah i i do that i do that but the rest like i said the rest of them i ve been trying to to pay off and uh get back on a cash basis except for gas it s too easy to to run into the gas station uh huh oh it sure is especially when you work out of town and everything that way at least that s for me yeah what you uh huh yeah yeah yeah so but yeah i ve i ve talked to some who s really had some bad experience and kind of knock on wood i haven t yet not bad you know i just i m just shocked at the end of the month yeah well to see what damage i have did but yeah yeah i try to keep it pretty reasonable well i ve been pretty lucky in that respect i don t charge like i say i ve i been trying to to not charge except for emergencies uh huh so but i haven t really had any bad problems with credit cards there s you know they have uh wonderful features they re there when you need them you know like in emergencies or whatever yeah huh and then they have bad drawbacks too i mean high interest it s like paying twice yeah they talk talks with that s true that s true yes so but i try to i did switch to one uh sponsored by the credit union though that seems to be a pretty low interest oh uh huh yeah compared to some of the other ones and you don t have an annual fee there and that helps yeah yeah oh yes uh we used to have you know like several but right now we re just more or less at American Express you know and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in yeah uh huh yeah that s one way to do it because that that forces you to pay for it instead of saying well i ll just pay on it this month and yeah pay fifteen yeah yes i know yeah and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time yeah takes a long time that s right and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off off your income tax that s you know it sure does uh huh of course it s been going down for a number of years but this is the last year you can take anything so but yeah uh huh so yeah well i ve enjoyed talking to you well i ve enjoyed talking to you and maybe we ll get to talk again okay bye bye okay bye bye
