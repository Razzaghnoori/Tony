        why dont you tell me about the Brewers     well uh  i guess the thing about the Brewers is i think their personnel policies have been a little misguided lately um i think thats their main problem uh they seem to have have stuck with the same core of players uh Robin Yount Paul Molitor and Jim Gantner who uh theyre real good players but they seem to just depend on them to produce a pennant and it it doesnt it isnt working   well the problem with the Rangers is theyve got a lot of offense they just dont have any pitching and really havent had any pitching for years theyre the top offensive team around but defense and pitching wins your games over the long haul   except for papa Ryan anyway   well thats true but he only comes every five times so   yeah thats right he cant win them all for him   he cant win them all and hes getting a little bit up there   yeah i think uh the thing about the Brewers is too their pitching they never have really had real good pitching uh last time they had really good pitching was back in the early eighties when they got to the World Series was with uh people like Vuckovich and Fingers   oh yes Rollie Fingers   yeah yeah and of course uh he got them to the Series but then just before the Series that year in eighty two he um uh threw his elbow out or something shoulder or elbow i cant remember which and uh theyre number two righthander in the bullpen Pete Ladd who was kind of a rookie that year uh had to take his place and uh i think thats why they lost the series because in in game two in Saint Louis they had a pretty good lead going into late innings and Ladd got rattled when he didnt get some calls and they ended up losing the game uh Ole Mustache Fingers would not have done that   well Rollie was Rollie was more uh  well i guess hes uh is he in the Hall of Fame already i dont even remember   i cant remember if hes made it or not yet he he may not have been i dont know when he retired actually   you got to be retired for five years to be eligible   yeah but that was i think eighty two was well eighty one was the year i think that he won the the uh Cy Young and the MVP and the Fireman of the Year Award all at the same time i think but uh but in eighty two i think he won something some kind of award had a lot of saves anyway   yeah we had a game here where uh we had Goose Gossage this year and Goose and uh Ryan combine and they got i dont know Ryan got his three hundred something win and at the same time Goose got his three hundred and something save and they were you know the same number and they said that it was an unusual occurrence to have that   well id forgotten that Gossage was with the Rangers the the he was this year last year   yeah but hes not coming back   now did they pick him up uh sometime in the middle of the season or what   well no they got him at the very beginning of the season but he and the manager and manager Bobby Valentine didnt come along so   yeah   Goose is Goose is history   yeah well hes been quite a reliever in his time   oh yeah hes a hes hes definitely headed to the Hall of Fame But the Rangers have you know a a pretty good lineup now um with the with the addition of the uh Dickey Thorne at uh short stop that ought to help them but their problem is other than Ryan and an occasional flash of brilliance of other people theres just nobody there   yeah well well be looking for them to uh to improve in that area i guess because at least the uh now that i think about them a little bit im getting sort of back through the football season back into baseball i realize when you think of the Rangers now you got a real good looking young outfield there for the most part and uh quite a few of the infielders are uh probably have good real good careers still ahead of them im not sure why they got rid of Buechele but i guess it worked out for him okay   well at least he got to play in a championship the Rangers have never won the division so were were obviously not going to last year   yeah oh Inky went the wrong way though didnt he   yeah i think hes history       he is history   now who did they trade him to i forgot Cleveland   Detroit   Detroit   well they didnt yeah they he went to Detroit they really didnt get much for him   oh oh they released him really didnt they   yeah they released him and he had to go around trying to sign up with somebody   yeah   but he proved to be a total disaster   my goodness when he was when he was when he could really get into a ball though he was uh had a lot of power i tell you he reminds me a lot of Gorman Thomas remember him   yeah   center fielder for the Brewers there for a while there was a guy that   yeah he did something he i saw i saw him hit a grand slam once in a game when i was there but i also saw him drop a ball that cost a couple runs ended up costing the game so he could you know he could be both brilliant and with a bat and just a disaster in the field   uh well i dont think his fielding was generally that bad he uh as a matter of fact he was to   it was early on it got better but it was pretty bad at the beginning   yeah right yeah he did get better and i think uh he was one of George Bamburgers big projects when he took over at the Brewers at Milwaukee he was the guy that was up and down uh
