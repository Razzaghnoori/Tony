 Worth Bull BRENTWOOD I am so fucked It s not exactly Where s the beef or Whoomp there it is or Read my lips but as summer movie catchphrases go it looked like 1998 s odds on choice a few months back The line was to have been uttered by a camcorder wielding character in Godzilla as the monster s scaly foot came thundering down towards him Godzilla though wanted a PG 13 rating which by MPAA lore if not regulation limits a movie to one fuck The epithet was apparently already being used elsewhere in the movie and so the line did not survive And what Hollywood figure would you most expect to use the phrase in real life Warren Beatty whose film Bulworth recently had its nationwide release moved to just a few days before Godzilla opens Bulworth debuts in New York and Los Angeles today Godzilla nationwide next Wednesday They call it counter programming Culturebox calls it suicide If Bulworth throughout its entire theatrical run can gross what Godzilla makes over the Memorial Day holiday there will be champagne all around at Fox That of course is the kind of bottom line thinking Beatty says he despises So let us not judge Bulworth on the basis of its box office But let us not judge it on the basis of its noble intentions either Is Bulworth really a celluloid shiv shoved deep in the heart of the status quo Its hero asserts that private enterprise has a stranglehold on American politics This is a surprise to whom exactly Beatty s press interviews filled with wonderful anecdotes about Clifford Odets Huey Newton and Ronald Reagan have been more entertaining than a lot of the movie much of which is Beatty rapping and rapping badly It s an updating of the idea that drove Ishtar that we ll be endlessly tickled by the suave Warren looking intentionally goofy That I fear is a miscalculation Beatty s image isn t so iconic in the minds of today s moviegoer that subverting it is wildly hilarious As for the notion that Bulworth the politicized B Boy could send shivers down the spines of the Murdochs and Perelmans of the world please Granted this is a smart provocative movie with a performance from Oliver Platt that is truly off tha hook a film reflective of Beatty s decades long concerns over the corruption of government by money Why it s being released now instead of in the fall when more serious minded moviegoers could warm to it and keep it commercially viable through the first quarter award season is anyone s guess But just like the rappers with whom Beatty hung out to prep this picture the audience has a pretty good idea of what subject really obsesses Beatty and he hasn t touched it since Shampoo Why not It seems a waste Warren Beatty not making movies about sex is like Oliver Stone not making movies about conspiracies Chris Connelly
