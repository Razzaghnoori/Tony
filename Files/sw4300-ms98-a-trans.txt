                i actually just got back from uh U uh last week   yes they were in Atlanta uh recently   yeah they they started down in the south and then they headed up the coast   how many shows did they play um   they played well we saw them in Wister   yes   and they played once in Wister and once in Providence and then Saint Patricks Day in Boston   i see i see so you you just caught one show uh   yeah um  the way they rigged things where you had to call an eight hundred number and and you know two tickets two tickets per a person and   yes oh i see   there there where two million call attempts in in an hour to get the tickets so it was like by the time we got through there i mean we had separate seats seats but we lucked out we got a second and a third row seat   really yes how about that   yeah so we were we were pleased   yeah yeah um uh so so um specifically um thats the sort of music you like   well i mean it its more my fiances tastes um i go more into Celtic music um Celtic Celtic folk uh   i see really thats interesting sort of new age stuff   well Still I Spin and Silly Wizard uh Fair Port Convention you know kind kind of folk rocky kind of stuff but with a strong Celtic element   yeah i i i see i see   uh also Tangerine you know all sorts of pseudo new agey stuff Tangerine Dream and Micheal Field and and anything semi electronic   yes is um so the appeal of that music is the  quality you know the relaxing quality to it   well i i like the harmonies and and and and the sounds of of Celtic music and i like like the uh um the uh the the uh im trying to remember the name of it Tin Whistle the the variety of songs tone you can get out and i find the singers tend to be better less screaming and more more uh   yes melodic uh   melodic and attention to phrasing and and hitting the notes rather than you know just belting them out   yes i see i see   uh sound you sound like you probably are down in the uh country and western belt there   i yeah well uh well you see um uh down here there is a big you know theres a huge Country Western influence um particularly what i like um the Blues and uh you know various forms of um   oh   you know of uh um Delta Blues and uh getting back to um really elemental forms   well i i find i prefer Delta Blues to like you know what a lot of people think the Blues are because i find you know kind of the more the the more uh conventional as where blues i i find kind of repetitive and unmelodic   well it um you know i can see that argument but and as far as the emotion and the feeling that comes out you know even though it might be repetitive um   umhum   the the emotion that comes out of it i really think is a lot of it you know it you know where as the  quality of the Celtic music seems appealing the raw power and you know whether   um umhum yeah well it its a very its a very minimalist form because youve got duh duh duh duh or something like that youve got a very simple base line with   uh yeah uh uh just a one four five progression over and over again yeah   right yeah i think i was singing like my dog  yeah   yeah yeah   yeah i mean i i think with that the quality kind of it its much more based on you know how much the person can impart i mean ive heard some Blues that its like you you know did not strike me as as anything special because its like yeah okay you know lifes been tough to me too and you know theres just so much you can hear of that   right so uh so so perhaps the connection with it wasnt there uh   yeah i i mean you know well ive heard some Blues i really liked where theyre imparting more than just you know im yet another guy who got treated bad   yes yes   im trying to think whether there was something interesting or unique because i think it depends a lot more on the actual message being imparted it it certainly certainly youre not listening to it for its lifting melodies   right right  right right um i also like Jazz and um you know how do you think the two um you know complement each other do do right   well uh Jazz is is a much more i i i think youve got to be a much more uh spontaneous person to be playing Jazz you know youve got a long time to think about that next verse in uh Blues   yes right   where as in Jazz you know it just is is moving and um   and create a flowing in different directions   right i mean and youve got to be very i mean in many ways Jazz and Celtic if you ever go to like a   yes   um its very much like a a a an extemporaneous or a uh uh you know just a a jam session Jazz because you know there may be a basic pattern you know if youre playing a reel or a jig you know thats the basic melody of the jig but people are just going off and doing their own things and these are people who may have never played   uhhuh uh uh never played together and uh never there uh apparently in the Celtic is there any set form that um   right um there is to some extent i mean you know theres the basic tune of the jig or the real   yes   but you know someone will just come in and you know whos going to whos going to you know take lead on this verse whos going to you know it you know i want to uh theres a group called  which is an Irish
