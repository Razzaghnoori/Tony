 Retirement Has Its Appeal Lawyers Form Group to Offer Legal Aid to Indigent Clients Christine McConville Sunday January 26 2003 It started out as one of those talks people have at the end of a summer day Two years ago former Middlesex County Judge Edward Ginsburg and his cousin were sitting by the edge of a pond in New Hampshire discussing his approaching 70th birthday I don t believe in retirement I don t like that term said Ginsburg recalling that day s conversation Having reached the court system s mandatory retirement age the lifelong Newton resident left the courtroom But he has taken on another full time venture turning into reality a vision he and his cousin had on that summer day Senior Partners for Justice is less than four months old but already Ginsburg has some of the city s top lawyers working for some of the region s poorest clients The lawyers provide expert legal service for indigent people who need help with divorces custody battles and other family law matters One case has already been settled 13 others are in the works The initiative is his response to a pattern he noticed during his 25 years as a family court judge There s a disconnect between lawyers and the people who need their services Sixtyfive percent of the people in probate court appear without lawyers because they can t afford them I have a friend who says that going into court without a lawyer is like going to a foreign country without a guide Sometimes the people who represent themselves don t even know the significant facts of their case This is an effort to do something about that while giving older retired lawyers a chance to stay active he said It helps the courts by giving them attorneys to argue the cases too So far Ginsburg who works out of an office on Longfellow Place in Boston has recruited 30 lawyers including a 91 year old lawyer from Cape Cod a retired judge and an expert on dividing pensions after a divorce Former Newton mayor Thomas B Concannon has signed on along with lawyers from Lowell Andover Weston and Wayland Retired judge Herbert Hershfang just settled the group s first case a divorce It wasn t complicated Hershfang said of the case But he supports the cause partly because as a judge at Boston Municipal Court and other courtrooms Hershfang witnessed firsthand how many people can t afford lawyers Judge Ginsburg is to be commended for filling a really important need in our court system Hershfang said He had done a wonderful job as a judge and then as soon as he leaves he fills this need To Ginsburg it s just the right idea at the right time I think it s Voltaire who said There s nothing more powerful than an idea that has come of age Everything just fell into place and I thought I ve got to seize the opportunity and run with it said Ginsburg who names former President Jimmy Carter as a role model Most presidents retired and what happened to them They fade away but I think Carter had more influence after his presidency The participating lawyers say Ginsburg a diehard Red Sox fan known for his trademark bow ties is tough to turn down Concannon who at 63 is still practicing full time said he couldn t say no to Ginsburg a longtime friend He fished me in Concannon said adding People need lawyers and there s a growing amount of poor that need pro bono services The Volunteer Lawyers Project of the Boston Bar Association supplies the clients That group s executive director Meg Connolly said all the cases are screened first to make sure they have legal merit and that the client meets federal poverty guidelines That means that an individual can t earn more than 11 075 a year and that a family of four may not earn more than 33 938 she said Connolly said her program has been working to provide free legal services for 25 years and the demand isn t abating Having someone like Ginsburg working on the same problem helps out He has the cachet of being a long standing family court judge and lots of people like him she said Ginsburg has a lifetime of connections to tap and he s an expert tapper said Jack Reilly executive director of Massachusetts Continuing Legal Education Inc The agency hosts training seminars the first Wednesday of each month to keep the group s members up to date on marital law and family court issues Reilly said he has been stunned at the number of people who have been showing up For a lot of people in the legal services the initial reaction to the program was Been there done that doesn t work But based on the force of Ginsburg s personality and that he s at the office every day he s gotten some very senior people on board Reilly said You don t realize you want to do this until he talks to you The lawyers who are participating Reilly said still want to have an intellectual experience and they want to be part of the legal community And he said I m sure their spouses are delighted to push them out of the house the first Wednesday of every month For more
