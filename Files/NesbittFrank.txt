Dirty Dirty people you know what I m saying I done been around here four and a half years working a lot a different places and shit but came in contact with a lot of different people from a lot of different sides of the you know what I m saying of the spectrum That s why I know that this little that right there is void you know it should be Revised at least at the bare minimum because I done dealt with people and you can t can t put them in you can t box them You can t we re individuals And they always sit there and try to say because they want to make a link or make a point and then they want to box us Other than that we re individuals you know Everybody is everybody That s what makes us special There s only one of you know what I m saying Not really Now but you hear what I I m saying though I understand what you re saying But anyway that was my story you know what I m saying and it was just it was just crazy But that was our first lesson you know what I m saying to let us know we wasn t home you know wasn t home anymore We got to bite the bullet We don t have no uh no no uh refuge This is it know what I m saying We jumped in both hands and feet jumped in you know what I m saying We here Four years four and a half years later we got a accounting degree you know what I m saying two vehicles you know what I m saying all later models than that that you know what I m saying uh uh than the Maxima was so fuck Dean you know what I m saying I m serious you know so but it let us you know where we at I dealt with shit like that to the present day you know what I m saying from different people different sides of the spectrum People that when I came in I guess I had them boxed and they let me know that they not contained they just a wild unit you know what I m saying That s why you know that s why I said what I said about that That s it I forgot another thing Since I m talking about it I m going to get it off my chest too I got to get it off completely though After after that you know what I m saying after I witnessed that that happened you know what I m saying after I witnessed what had happened I sit up there and confronted you know I didn t confront well I did I kind of confronted him like you know What s up with the car You know what I m saying The man still didn t know that I seen the transaction then He didn t know that his wife came to me I just so happened to be the worker she actually talk to you know what I m saying Told me what she was there for you know what I m saying He trying to act like he still got the car they still got the car here you know They still waiting for this that and the third and his wife so after that I just wasn t feeling him no more you know I I I hated him you know what I m saying I like I mean because he just he smack then I felt like he you know what I m saying like he violated you know So he just and then I had to work underneath of him Then he was smug about it trying to lie about it trying to act like you know nothing happened you know anyway two what two days later he he fired me Yeah talking about he don t like my attitude because when I come in now I don t smile at him you know what I m saying I don t carry on a conversation with him I just go on and do my job do a good job and you know and I go That wasn t good enough for him He too came to the side told me you know actually he pull me in the back said Can I talk to you I said Sure No he didn t He sent that fat what s that what s the girl name Rhonda Shasta I hated her Shasta the kind of female just thought that the sun rose when she opened her eyes The sun rose you know what I m saying bottom line she was ugly She was piggish And I don t mean I don t mean I don t mean it as in her personality I m talking that but including her her physical When you looked you get kind of like a piggish you get a piggish vibe from her for real And she she was very animated you know very animated real country country And she just thought that she was the shit She was there first whatever whatever I m supposed I don t know I m supposed to tip tap you know I don t know but you know but I m sure they assumed when they seen a black guy that s it And they assumed OK well he s this he s that And they said Hold up she s white So that s a black guy with a white so that changes everything now So now they got to try to make a different analysis of OK so he s like this and like that and she got to be like that you know what I m saying and that s the way it is And then we got to work in them within them compounds We got to work and we got to survive know what I m saying like that s what I was saying before People automatically want to make up these these you know these groups but it s not true not for each and every one of us And then the ones that those uh uh particular things that uh uh classify that group soon as I get know what I m saying uh affected by it or have to go through I m either caught off guard or it hurts me or shit sometimes it could destroy people I mean because that s not me and I m caught off I wasn t expecting that you know what I m saying but anyway he fired me fired me Because he didn t I wasn t smiling and laughing and all that stuff like that Told me he didn t like my attitude didn t think my attitude you know he think it d be best if uh uh uh that s the first time I heard it s not working out not working can t stand that shit That shit make you want to put a pin in they fucking eye for real All right now don t make me stop this tape You know what I m saying Would you hurry up No you want to hear the voice this is for real I m 24 years old I been dealing with this since I was 19 years old Never never in my wildest dreams I don t know it s crazy It s crazy because all you ever heard of was southern hospitality That s all you ever heard up north Classifying We classified a whole South We just said OK this is how they are They just they love you to pieces you know what I m saying Everything is laid back They feed the hell out of you you know what I m saying Everything is just you know the weather s beautiful you know what I m saying You on farms you see chicken or some kind of fucking animal or something you know what I m saying that you can eat you know what I m saying running around the house or whatever Dog stuff like that old grandma cooking everything early in the morning But it wasn t like that I come to realize when I came down mind you you got to think this is the last place that held on to slavery as long as they could possibly hold on to it Just about you know what I m saying you know what I m saying So you got to remember that that s still here that s here It s the foundation it s the essence it s the essence Right now they in the process of trying to you know perfect the masch but I m looking past the masch I m looking at at the entity or what have you you know classify I m looking at it like that you know it gave me all new meaning to uh uh southern hospitality Now I understand that I it s just crazy it s crazy it s crazy That s why when I do go to school here I m going to go to school here for dirt cheap because I been living here since they robbed us with Angie and everything so I m going to go for cheap hurt them and then I m I m gone I m leaving I m not going to put no money into the into the community I m not going to put no money into the state or anything The city can just forget about it I m just gone I don t want nothing to do with this no more I m tired of it Shit by that time it d be what eight years nine years that
