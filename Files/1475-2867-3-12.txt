 Background One of the major cellular serine threonine protein phosphatases is protein phosphatase type 1 PP1 1 An abundant enzyme expressed in all cells complex regulation of PP1 is thought to be essential for proper temporal and spatial regulation of PP1 catalytic activity towards individual substrates 2 Three different isotypes of the catalytic subunit designated PP1 PP1 and PP1 1 are expressed in many different cell types 3 Studies employing many eukaryotic systems all point to a crucial role for PP1 activity in controlling cell cycle progression and an absolute requirement of this activity for mitotic exit 4 5 6 7 There is also evidence to suggest that phosphorylation of PP1 and its associated proteins by the cyclin dependent kinases may regulate PP1 activity in a cell cycle stage dependent manner 8 9 10 Hence current efforts are directed towards identification of cell cycle dependent substrates for PP1 and how regulation of PP1 activity towards these substrates controls the cell division cycle One physiological substrate for PP1 appears to be the product of the retinoblastoma susceptibility gene pRB 11 12 13 a demonstrated tumor suppressor The cell growth and tumor suppressive activity of pRB is regulated by its phosphorylation state pRB phosphorylation varies as a function of cell cycle phase during G 1 the hypophosphorylated form predominates while the hyperphosphorylated form accumulates during S G 2 and M phase 14 15 16 It is this hypophosphorylated form of pRB present during early and mid G 1 which functions to modify gene expression This is achieved by complexing with transcription factors resulting in repression 17 or stimulation 18 of transcription Under conditions favoring proliferation the phosphorylation of pRB via cyclin dependent kinases CDKs in mid to late G 1 phase results in liberation of E2F and other pRB bound transcription factors which then activate the transcription of S phase genes 19 In late M phase pRB returns to its growth suppressive hypophosphorylated form due to the action of a pRB directed protein phosphatase belonging to the type 1 class of serine threonine protein phosphatases 11 20 21 Of critical importance is the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation To date several techniques have been employed in this regard to demonstrate PP1 actions in intact cells Berndt et al 22 used electroporation to introduce PP1 protein into tissue culture cells having noted that previous genetic attempts to accomplish overexpression were not readily accomplished Using this technique they showed a G1 block by PP1 that was dependent upon the presence of pRB In another report micro injection of PP1 decreased extractability of pRB from nuclei presumably by increasing dephosphorylation and increasing association with nuclear proteins thereby playing a role in G1 S transition inhibition 13 Micro injection of antibodies to the PP1 catalytic subunit has been shown to block cells in metaphase 23 Since this is the time during mitosis when pRB is normally dephosphorylated 11 24 it is tempting to speculate that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1 activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype Here using the tetracycline induction system 25 we developed an inducible PP1 expression system to investigate the regulation of PP1 activity We view this as a first step towards addressing the question of the in vivo effect of PP1 activity on pRB and growth regulation Our results support the notion that induced PP1 protein functions identically to endogenous PP1 with respect to non catalytic subunit binding and activity towards phosphorylase a and the tumor suppressor pRB Localization of this protein to the nucleus also mirrors that of endogenous PP1 in vivo When using this system to forcibly overexpress 6His HA PP1 there is a concomitant decrease in endogenous PP1 levels suggesting the existence of an autoregulatory mechanism by which PP1 protein levels remain constant RT PCR analyses of isolated polysome fractions supports the notion that this putative autoregulatory mechanism is exerted at least in part at the translational level Results and Discussion Induction of 6His HA PP1 in LLW02F cells Figure 1shows construct of the tetracycline inducible plasmid used to express 6His HA PP1 As shown in Figure 2A 24 hr incubation with doxycycline in the medium has no appreciable effect on endogenous PP1 protein expression in the untransfected parent cell line UMUC3 or a cell line transfected with the reverse tetracycline transactivator plasmid pUHD172 1neo only LLWO1 A time course of induction by doxycycline was then carried out in stable clone LLWO2F Harvested at various time intervals whole cell lysates were prepared and the proteins were separated by SDS PAGE for western blotting using antibody to the hemagglutinin tag As shown in Figure 2B a protein with the anticipated molecular weight of 40 kDa was detected A clear differential of expression of 6His HA PP1 indicated at the left of the panel was observed at 1 5 hours after addition of doxycycline which became more pronounced at later time points The doxycycline independent increase in 6His HA PP1 is attributed to background expression when using this system 25 As predicted for a protein under the control of the doxycycline inducible promoter the abundance of 6His HA PP1 decreases in the absence of the inducer over time Figure 2C Subsequent time course experiments revealed peak abundance occurring between 16 and 24 hr and remaining constant thereafter for at least 72 hr at which time the experiment was terminated As such we have chosen the 24 hr induction time for all subsequent experiments to ensure peak abundance of the induced 6His HA PP1 As shown in Figure 2C a significant reduction in 6His HA PP1 abundance can be observed between 3 and 12 hrs following removal of doxycycline This reduction continued through the 24 hr time point at which time the experiment ended Taken together these data confirm the dependence of 6His HA PP1 protein production on the tet O CMV promoter thus demonstrating inducible expression of PP1 As expected 25 some low level expression of 6His HA PP1 in the absence of the inducer doxycycline can also be detected Biological and Biochemical Characterization of Inducible 6His HA PP1 To begin addressing the biological and biochemical characterization of inducible PP1 we next localized this protein in situ using immunohistochemistry As shown in Figure 3 there is a predominant nuclear localization of the hemagglutinin epitope panel A compared to the low level cytoplasmic and nuclear background reactivity seen in the uninduced LLWO2F control cells panel B Thus not only can doxycycline induced expression of PP1 be detected immunohistochemically but localization of this protein appears to be identical to that of endogenous PP1 26 Targeting of PP1 to the nucleus is due in part to a PP1 associated nuclear targeting subunit PNUTS 27 To further investigate the properties of inducible PP1 we performed coprecipitation studies to determine if PNUTS can also be found associated with 6His HA PP1 Towards this goal a fusion protein of GST and PNUTS was tested for the ability to capture induced PP1 Lysates from induced LLWO2F cells were combined with GST alone or GST PNUTS loaded glutathione Sepharose beads Following separation by SDS PAGE and western blotting antibody to hemagglutinin was used to detect any associated 6His HA PP1 Antibody reactivity would indicate a link from the GST epitope to the hemagglutinin epitope via a PNUTS to PP1 interaction As shown in Figure 4 the hemagglutinin epitope was captured by the GST PNUTS fusion protein but not the GST alone protein These data support the idea that induced PP1 and the nuclear targeting PP1 associated protein PNUTS can form a complex These results further support the view that induced PP1 behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1 and provides a possible mechanistic explanation for 6His HA PP1 localization to the nucleus Two different approaches were taken to address the biochemical activity of inducible PP1 First immunocomplexed 6His HA PP1 was tested for its ability to dephosphorylate phosphorylase a Phosphorylated on a single serine residue this substrate is often used to monitor the biochemical activity of PP1 in vitro 28 As shown in Figure 5 greater phosphatase activity is detected in immunoprecipitates from induced LLWO2F cell lysates compared to uninduced This is consistent with the notion that inducible PP1 is enzymatically active Our second approach involved testing immunopurified 6His HA PP1 for its ability to dephosphorylate the growth suppressor protein pRB Having previously reported on the ability of immunocomplexed endogenous PP1 to dephosphorylate pRB 20 we followed the same experimental approach Figure 6shows a significant decrease in the 32P radiolabel intensity for pRB following incubation with the anti hemagglutinin immunoprecipitate compared to the normal mouse IgG control immunoprecipitate In addition okadaic acid a potent inhibitor of PP1 activity 29 significantly inhibits pRB dephosphorylation in this reaction Taken together these data indicate that inducible PP1 is biochemically active Upregulation of inducible 6His HA PP1 coincides with downregulation of endogenous PP1 One prediction would be that by increasing expression of the catalytic subunit of PP1 overall PP1 specific activity within the cell would increase To address this we tested the phosphatase activity of LLWO2F whole cell lysate using phosphorylase a as the substrate To inhibit any endogenous PP2A activity which can also dephosphorylate phosphorylase a and thus interfere with PP1 activity measurements these assays were carried out in the presence of 5 nM okadaic acid which does not inhibit PP1 activity 30 Although reproducible we observed only modest increases in PP1 specific activity found in lysates from induced cells compared to the uninduced controls Figure 7 One possible explanation for this finding is that the overall level of PP1 within the cell remains relatively constant regardless of induction Indeed a time course of induction followed by western blotting of whole cell lysates using antibody to PP1 revealed diminution of the endogenous PP1 signal after 4 hr of induction while the 6His HA PP1 signal increased Figure 8 To further test this hypothesis immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments were carried out using PP1 isoform specific antibodies As shown in Figure 9 top panel induced approximate molecular weight of 40 kDa and endogenous approximate molecular weight of 37 kDa PP1 are clearly resolved by SDS PAGE As predicted both proteins are recognized by antibody specific for PP1 when performing immunoprecipitation or western blotting Immunoprecipitation using PP1 antibody followed by western blotting using the same anti PP1 reveals a reciprocal relationship in PP1 abundance following doxycycline induction endogenous PP1 levels decrease in response to increasing levels of 6His HA PP1 top panel compare left two lanes This difference in abundance is more striking in the whole cell lysate lanes endogenous PP1 fails to be detected in lysates prepared from induced cells compare middle two lanes Parallel experiments performed using the same lysate and antibody to hemagglutinin for immunoprecipitation and western blotting show the position of 6His HA PP1 and the fact that endogenous PP1 is not recognized by this antibody bottom panel Western blotting for additional isoforms of PP1 reveals that this reduction in PP1 following induction is isotype specific when 6His HA PP1 levels increase concomitant with a decrease in PP1 levels PP1 and PP1 1 levels remain relatively unchanged from those found in uninduced cell lysate Figure 10 Taken together these data suggest that an as yet undescribed negative feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1 which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of protein expression and enzyme activity RT PCR of polysome and total RNA specific for endogenous PP1 and 6His HA PP1 To address the possible autoregulatory mechanism s of PP1 expression and activity we analyzed the RNA levels of both endogenous PP1 and induced 6His HA PP1 For uninduced cells only endogenous PP1 RNA can be found associated with polysomes Figure 11 second lane While some 6His HA PP1 RNA can be detected in the total RNA the majority PP1 RNA detected in the total preparation is endogenous fourth lane In contrast it appears that for the doxycycline induced cells third lane there is more 6His HA PP1 RNA associated with polysomes than endogenous PP1 However both messages appear to be present at the same level in the total RNA preparation fifth lane This apparent preference for 6His HA PP1 RNA association with polysomes suggest that autoregulation takes place at least in part at the translational level Conclusions In summary we report on the development of an inducible mammalian cell expression system for the catalytic subunit of the isotype for PP1 This protein behaves similarly if not identically to endogenous PP1 with respect to nuclear localization complex formation to a recently described PP1 associated nuclear targeting protein and in vitro enzymatic activity towards phosphorylase a and the cell growth and tumor suppressor protein pRB We observed that endogenous PP1 protein levels decrease in response to increasing levels of induced 6His HA PP1 protein This observation suggests that an as yet undescribed negative feedback or autoregulatory mechanism exists for PP1 which contributes towards maintaining a constant level of this enzyme Given the difficulty in achieving overexpression of PP1 protein and activity in mammalian cells this suggestion provides an attractive explanation This putative mechanism appears to be isotype specific since the protein levels of PP1 and PP1 1 remained relatively unchanged in response to induced expression of PP1 Precedent for an autoregulatory mechanism comes from a report by Baharians and Schonthal 31 in which they demonstrate endogenous PP2A protein levels decrease in the presence of increasing amounts of forcibly expressed exogenous PP2A Their report also provides evidence that this control is exerted at the translational level and does not involve regulation of transcription or RNA processing Using a similar approach of analyzing mRNA association with ribosomes as a measure of translation efficiency a similar level of translational control also appears to exist for PP1 If mRNA association with ribosomes is truly a measure of translation efficiency one conclusion from these data is that in doxycycline induced cells 6His HA PP1 RNA is more efficiently translated than endogenous PP1 This would help to explain why we observed a decrease in endogenous PP1 protein expression in doxycycline induced cells Since we did not perform rigorous analyses on PP1 regulation of transcription or RNA processing we cannot rule out the possibility that some level of transcriptional control also exists Indeed the abundance of endogenous PP1 RNA found in uninduced cells appears equal to or greater than the combined abundance of endogenous and 6His HA PP1 RNA Figure 9 supporting the notion that some level of translational control may also exist These findings provided by the development of this inducible PP1 expression system will afford new research opportunities aimed towards addressing the question of how PP1 activity is regulated This putative autoregulatory mechanism for the catalytic subunit may help to explain why the overall abundance of PP1 during the various phases of the cell cycle remains relatively constant 32 Historically regulation of PP1 catalytic activity has resulted from associated subunits inhibiting or targeting the catalytic subunit towards substrates 33 While the PP1 catalytic subunit is not found alone in the cell such unassociated catalytic subunits have been shown to be active at least in vitro Although speculative there may be a threshold amount of catalytic subunit in vivo above which associated proteins are limiting Such a situation may compromise the ability of associated proteins to effectively regulate PP1 catalytic activity To guard against this scenario control over the amount of PP1 catalytic subunit present via an autoregulatory mechanism would be beneficial The data presented here validate a useful system with which to manipulate PP1 activity in vivo for the purpose of functional studies Just as is the case for PP2A 31 it seems clear that efficient overall increases in PP1 protein abundance may not be achieved due to a putative negative feed back or autoregulatory mechanism However induced expression of exogenous PP1 which behaves identically to endogenous PP1 while remaining physically distinguishable can facilitate the use of mutants to address functional questions particularly in the area of cell cycle regulation and tumor cell growth suppression Indeed the use of a constitutively active mutant of PP1 has already been shown to result in pRB dependent G1 arrest in human cancer cells 22 Placing this mutant into the inducible expression system described here has the potential to down regulate expression of wild type endogenous PP1 Doing so in a timed controlled manner will permit in vivo studies addressing PP1 function during discrete phases of the cell cycle and will be the subject of future endeavors Materials and Methods Tetracycline
