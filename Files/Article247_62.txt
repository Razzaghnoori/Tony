 No Gore in 04 The press bears a heavy burden of responsibility in the crisis now engulfing the White House It is imperative that we not get ahead of ourselves and that we avoid a speculative rush to judgment Oh what the hell Let s speculate Suppose Clinton resigns next week and Gore becomes president If Chatterbox reads the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution correctly that means Gore can only run for the presidency once in 2000 The 22nd Amendment says you can only be elected president twice and if you serve more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected you can only be elected once If Gore wants to maximize his potential years in the presidency Clinton has to hang on until at least Jan 21 1999 so Gore can serve less than two years of Clinton s term and then two full terms of his own Of course if Clinton drags it out for another year and then quits he ll probably be so unpopular that he ll pull Gore down with him And he ll deprive Gore of a crucial year in which to build his own record of accomplishment Memo to Martin Peretz owner of the New Republic You ve enthusiastically supported the ambitions of Gore your former student you ve said confidently that you intend to own the magazine until the end of Al Gore s second term as president You even sacked your magazine s editor Michael Kelly at least in part because in his obsessive your term attacks on the character of the Clinton administration Kelly how to put it failed to completely appreciate Gore s virtues If you ve been reading the 22nd Amendment too it must now be tempting to use your magazine to at least help prop Clinton up until the two year deadline is past so Gore can run twice But if the above analysis is correct the last thing Gore needs is for Clinton to dangle injured Nixon like for a year or two You need to get rid of Clinton now even if it means Gore is a one and a half term president at best The obvious solution Bring back Kelly Go for the kill Anyway in retrospect hasn t Kelly s obsessive anti Clintonism been a wee bit vindicated
