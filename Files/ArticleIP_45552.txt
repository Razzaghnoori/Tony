Pinsky in The Fray From Robert Pinsky Date Fri Oct 29 Kristine this is like a parent being asked to name a favorite child And to stretch that metaphor the youngest one the one just finished sometimes gives the greatest satisfaction Once when I visited a writing class in a medium security prison one of the inmates urged by his classmates recited by memory my little poem Exile That was a satisfying moment Entering another person s memory with your words perhaps a person quite different from yourself is in certain ways more glorious than any prize or title To reply click here U S Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky is Slate s poetry editor Subject Starting the Poetic Engine Re Robert Pinsky in The Fray From James Kobielus Date Fri Oct 29 As a general habit how do you personally start writing a new poem Do you start with an interesting title and then write around it Or an interesting first line Or the kernel of a core subject message Or simply an abstract rhythm cadence or melody to which you must give voice Once you start how do you know you re done When does it feel complete To reply click here Subject Re Starting the Poetic Engine Re Robert Pinsky in The Fray From Robert Pinsky Date Fri Oct 29 A good question but not only is everybody different many of us are different at different times of life maybe even at different times of day The best I can describe the process for me is that it resembles noodling on a piano I run rhythms and sentences or maybe not even sentences the shapes of sentences across one another trying out their sounds and sometimes I get a tune like combination of sound and syntax that makes me want to go on extend and refine it as it comes to dredge sustenance from the great pool of feelings and ideas that accumulates in a life It s a physical process because the voice is physical And everything I ve said about germination applies to termination a silly rhyme I ve just stumbled on as well To reply click here Subject Scorsese s Aesthetic Genius Re From Simon Warner Date Mon Nov 1 I agree that Scorsese is probably the most important director working in America today but I find it less easy to pass over his 1993 film The Age of Innocence as A O Scott does I completely disagree that this film substitutes intensity for emotion The point about Raging Bull being difficult to watch many times is well made but Age of Innocence improves with each viewing The film is the most beautiful thing I can remember Kundun comes close though The subtlety of the direction is breathtaking with three moments standing out for me the bursts of color exploding onto the screen during the opera sequence the steadicam shot of Daniel Day Lewis entering the post opera ball with Joanne Woodward s sublime voice over and my favorite one quick external shot of Pfeiffer s house showing it seemingly in the middle of nowhere and saying more in a single shot about her social exclusion than other directors could achieve in three pages of dialogue If you have not seem this gem recently I urge you to revisit it it s fantastic To reply click here Subject Re Scorsese s Aesthetic Genius Re From David Edelstein Date Mon Nov 1 I can t speak for A O Scott but I saw Age of Innocence again a few months ago and found the technique that you admire a distraction A critic at the time described the movie admiringly as virile and I m forced to agree Scorsese is working so hard to show that he can make a women s picture in a robust manner that he loses touch with his supposed themes And he doesn t begin to get inside his impotent male protagonist s head You re right the film is full of astonishing moments stuff as good on its own terms as anything Scorsese has done But I wonder if anyone even remembers what the film is supposed to be about Kundun on the other hand really is a triumphant merging of form and content I m less enchanted by the content than many but I certainly respect Scorsese s struggle to alter his directorial voice and usual amphetamine rhythms to portray the Dalai Lama To reply click here David Edelstein is Slate s movie critic Subject Re Scorsese s Aesthetic Genius Re From A O Scott Date Mon Nov 1 I wish I d had sufficient space to say more about Age of Innocence not to mention Kundun After Hours and Goodfellas but I pretty much agree with Edelstein s take on it It does indeed have virtuosic moments but the central love triangle is entirely inert Scorsese just doesn t do courtship as well as he does male friendship I think that Age is a case like Raging Bull of Scorsese overwhelming the audience with technique and producing visceral effects rather than emotional responses This is true of Goodfellas as well in my view a completely exhilarating movie that nonetheless has a certain coldness at its heart Now these effects are powerful and the technical command behind them is extraordinary unparalleled I m willing to stipulate among American directors of Scorsese s generation The argument of my piece is that Scorsese is often hailed as a visionary on the basis of his technical discipline and formal panache but that in too many cases the vision seems tired or blurred I wish I d had space and time to examine each of Scorsese s films more closely and to contextualize them to everyone s satisfaction but I ve enjoyed following this discussion so far and look forward to more To reply click here Subject Chatterbox Lost in the Wilderness Re From Robert Lewis Date Tues Nov 2 The account of Robert E Lee s manservant Rev Wm Mack Lee seems to be made up of whole cloth as he recounts how Marse Robert got mad at him only once during the entire Civil War on July 3 1863 down in the Wilderness As July 3rd was in the middle of the Battle of Gettysburg it seems unlikely To reply click here Subject Re Chatterbox Lost in the Wilderness Re From Tim Noah Date Wed Nov 3 Several Civil War buffs have written to the Fray to point out that in my Rev Lee s memoir snippet can t possibly be true because Robert E Lee was at Gettysburg and Stonewall Jackson was dead on the specific date Rev Lee mentions My item correctly quoted Rev Lee s book but it the book was written when Rev Lee was an old man and is obviously faulty on this point It s also possible that the error lay with the reporter whose article Rev Lee was quoting from in his book None of the above incidentally has any bearing on Lee s usage of the word bumfuzzled To reply click here Subject O J the Alpha Male Re From Gillis Heller Date Tues Nov 2 The confluence of Gore s attempt to become an alpha male and the death of Walter Payton brings to mind
