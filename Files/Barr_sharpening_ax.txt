 Atlanta Journal Constitution Barr sharpening ax on legal aid to poor Melanie Eversley Cox Washington Bureau Saturday March 23 2002 Washington The organization that pays for legal representation for the poor could be in trouble Bob Barr the conservative Republican congressman from Georgia is asking questions about the Legal Services Corp Barr thinks the private Washington based non profit organization which pays local groups to represent the poor is not doing business the way it should He has asked the General Accounting Office to conduct a probe We want to know why there s no peer accounting system why there s no real method of competition for grants and why meetings are held in secret Barr said The congressman heads the House Judiciary subcommittee on commercial and administrative law which oversees the Legal Services Corporation Legal Services is funded by Congress through an annual appropriation 329 3 million for fiscal 2002 In Georgia the organization channels funds to the Georgia Legal Services Program and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society Since 1994 when Republicans took over as the majority party in the Congress GOP members have charged that the LSC takes part in political activities Edwin Meese attorney general under President Reagan is among critics who have pointed out that Congress demanded in 1996 that the organization not do so LSC President John Erlenborn recently testified to Congress that the organization had instituted an oversight system run by 12 lawyers and other employees to ensure that its programs do not violate the rule LSC has made every effort to ensure that the congressional restrictions placed on grantees are strictly observed Erlenborn said We pledge to continue working with this committee to improve the civil justice delivery system in America he said and to ensure federal dollars allocated for legal services are being spent in the most efficient and cost effective manner possible Erlenborn said that Congress had stipulated that LSC funded programs are forbidden from filing or litigating class action lawsuits engaging in lobbying litigating on behalf of prisoners or representing most undocumented immigrants Critics say that the LSC funded organizations tend to defend people involved in leftist causes Unfortunately the Legal Services Corp that s in existence now is dedicated to political activism and leftist causes and sometimes the representation of the poor said Todd Gaziano senior fellow in legal studies at the Washington based Heritage Foundation Gaziano is working with Meese in opposing the LSC The representation of the poor is kind of low down on their list of priorities Gaziano said The current Clinton appointed board has thumbed its nose at congressional attempts to focus the Legal Services Corp on its mission of helping indigent litigants in certain types of proceedings A House Democratic staffer close to the case said that GAO studies in the past have proved that LSC is complying fully with the congressional stipulations The Legal Services Corp came about in 1974 under President Richard Nixon It is run by an 11member board appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate No more than six members of the bipartisan board can be from any one political party President Bush is expected to name new board members soon and Barr said he would like to have an effect on those appointments He said this week that he had sent a letter to the White House spelling out his questions about the organization I m not a fan of spending taxpayer dollars on the Legal Services Corp Barr said It could run on private contributions and if a state believes it ought to be involved then through state funds But Barr also said I don t think its realistic that we re going to be able to zero it out Therefore we should at least make it operate within the bounds of the law
