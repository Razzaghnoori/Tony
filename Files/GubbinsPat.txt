 This is Pat Gubbins She grew up near the Coliseum and she has some interesting stories to tell about her grandmothers And with no further ado I grew up on a 100 acre farm which is hard to believe now near the airport which was not nearly as intrusive as it is now because this was backing up to my father s parent s who came down here from Wisconsin in 1937 looking for a Southern way of life to get away from all that snow They bought this farm off of Wilmont Road I think it s still Wilmont Road anyhow it s near the new Coliseum on Tyvola and proceeded to turn it into a working plantation at least that was my grandmother Tina s ambition My father and his brother helped them build the house a two story white stucco with the first oil furnace in Charlotte or so the family history goes Um My father and mother met shortly thereafter and married in 1930 May of 1938 I think because I came along two years later and grew up with my grandmother Tina there to kind of well I remember when I was about five years old and we had settled down for the long haul on the farm after my father finished traveling around and taking us with him to various uh Air Force assignments out in Texas and oh Myrtle Beach He was in the Reserves So we were kind of back and forth But I think about the time I started first grade he stopped traveling and my little grandmother Tina who ruled everyone with an iron hand had been living in what we called the big house I m I m going on too much But anyhow moved her over to the cottage so my parents could have a little life of their own and the little cottage was right across one of the lawns from us and her other son lived in a little house down from the cottage So it was like the Borden compound When I was in the eighth grade uh our savings ran out pretty much so my mother told my father was being a gentleman farmer During these years we raised Angus cattle and ate very well with vegetables from the garden but we didn t have any money So my other grandmother came to live with us to take care of the children and my mother and father both found jobs in town And the two grandmothers had nothing in common but each one really gave me quite a gift Grandmother Tina had traveled uh as the wife of a military man herself and had a real interest in adventure in other cultures uh the out of doors and I remember when I was five or six she would take me by the hand and say Where would you like to go for a walk and I d point and we d go off in that direction Wow Across the fields and through the woods and over streams and I think what it did was wet my appetite for exploring new places And she was so sweet to me The other grandmother probably had an eighth grade education but a fabulous mind for invention because she came up with these stories When I was about seven my mother was pregnant with my little sister they sent me to live in Chapel Hill for six weeks toward the end of her pregnancy And that grandmother was staying with my mother s brother and his family on a farm outside Chapel Hill while he was getting uh a PhD and I would be homesick and my grandmother we called her Granny her name was Millie Frances would make up these stories about this great white snowy owl that would carry me home to see my family Oh how neat Of course if I thought about it now I d think of him carrying me home in his big claws but for a child it was very comforting And then she came to live with us probably four or five years more later while I was in the eighth grade so it would have been eight years later and she loved gardening and flowers And I think I got some of that from her because I still whenever I m out in the yard gardening I think about Granny my mother s mother And when I m traveling I sometimes think about Tina and how much she would have enjoyed it Well that s a neat mix Yeah So Did Tina ever tell you stories about her travels She didn t Mostly she told me stories about all the things I would inherit from her once she was gone Did you I did She she collected Chinese furniture and rugs and that sort of thing while they were based in Panama and she took great pride in them Pride of possession I suppose but also loved the thought that it would pass on to me one day And I still have those things in my house I have for a poor working journalist I have really nice furniture thanks to Tina And back then she bought them really cheaply because Panama was a free port and she would get these really nice wooden carved things from China for five 15 dollars Wow That I don t know what they d be worth now but I have rosewood screens that are hand carved that 10 15 years ago were valued at something like 1 800 dollars apiece JM Wow And the rugs are out of style but and they re rolled up underneath our beds for the most part But it s still a nice reminder of her At first I kind of resented having to take all this stuff because it meant I could never decorate the way I wanted to decorate but I got over that and realized you can have an eclectic mix of stuff And it s nice to have some good pieces of furniture that have that history attached to them And the other grandmother had nothing really of her own to leave us except a rocking chair that I think was her mother s It s not real comfortable but it has a place of honor in our kitchen Hum That s neat Um did they both live with you until they died Uh Granny did She got senile a couple of years before she died and I had graduated from college and my mother was taking care of her and my father had died and we kept her at home and under control with Thorazine And I remember a terrible time when my mother had gone to the grocery store and had left me I was there for the weekend home from I worked in Shelby or Gastonia at the time Uh it was a time Granny had missed her medication and she was getting strange She got real agitated She d see bugs crawling up the wall And I tried to make her take her pill and she hit me and I hit her back Not hard but it just shocked me that I would do such a thing Probably shocked her too It shocked her and she took her pill And settled down And the other grandmother had a series of strokes and my poor mother who was widowed was she widowed then No she was widowed shortly after Tina died uh but my father was working and my mother I think was kind of in charge of finding housekeepers to take care of Tina who loved nothing better than to order people around She was hard to get along with and people would quit and Mom would rehire them or Tina would fire them and Mom would rehire them and she finally wound up at the Huntersville at what s now the Huntersville Oak Yeah I think And I was in college when she died But she was artistic That s something else I got from her I forgot Back in the twenties no the turn of the century ladies painted hand painted china It was the thing for women of leisure to do She was not a woman of leisure but she always fancied being that so she would get this this barrels of fine china and hand paint them and fire them and initial them She insisted I be named for her so I could inherit her monog rammed stuff She was Kathryn Petric Borden Petric was short for Petrechek She was from Czecho her parents were from Czechoslovakia and that was her maiden name but it was shortened to Petric when they came over here So she was Kathryn Petric Borden and so my mother had no choice in the matter I had to be Kathryn Well she had the choice of the middle name but it had to start with a P and she thought about Penelope but luckily settled on Patricia Borden So here I have all these monogrammed linen napkins that sit in this uh pigskin trunk that was hand painted by my grandmother Tina with a brass clasp It s from China too And lots of this hand painted china Huh That Anne and I split up when she died She didn t specify who would get what and when she died and the time came to settle up stuff Mom said Ok how are you and Anne going to do this And so we said We ll flip a coin and see who goes first So that s how we did Anne would pick something and then I would pick something and then if one of us would pick something the other really wanted we d work it out and so that was You two were the only two grandchildren Um huh No uh she left things to two other grandchildren Her other son had a son and a daughter by two different marriages And I guess they um I don t know how they figured that out because I wasn t around when that was settled but I know that they we all got something like 1 500 plus furnishings Stuff They each got stuff I didn t even know about Until recently when I went up to see my cousin Cindy and she unrolled this wall hanging this thick rug that was hand woven of the 12 immortals And it s in pristine condition My sister has the matching one and Cindy has this Western type log house and said This rug it there s nowhere to put it They had things like stuffed animals on their walls Her husband s a big game hunter Oh you mean like stuffed heads of animals Yeah yeah So what did she do with the rug Did she give it to you Uh huh and now it s under another of my beds at home It s really beautiful but maybe one day I ll have a bigger house with a bigger wall that I can put it on I don t know sometimes possessions can be a real burden But that s neat she wanted you to have her stuff and I mean she Oh yeah She planned that Oh yeah she did But I really got tired of her talking about the day when she passed on and I would get all these things I thought of it as kind of emotional blackmail in a way but years later I don t really think it was She was just she was wanting to establish that connection even after she was gone She really well both our grandmothers just were the best you could have They never criticized us and they spoiled us That s what grandparents are for Yeah Why did you call her Tina though From Kathryn My mother came up with that nickname It has nothing to do with her name She uh all the other relatives called her Kathryn or Aunt Kathryn or whatever but I guess because she s little or was little maybe Tina kind of sounded like teeny I asked my mother how she came up with it and she said she didn t know it just kind of fit her and so from then on she was Tina Hum I would never have thought to call her Granny she wasn t the granny type Whereas my other grandmother who used snuff and was very very religious to the point of being a fanatic uh was a perfect granny My mother made her cotton dresses that came down below her calf and she wore these shoes that are now in vogue the black The granny shoes Granny shoes And cotton stockings And a pretty little apron She always wore an apron She did a lot of cooking for us She made great fried apple pies Oh And wonderful skillet cornbread Those are the things I most remember about her cooking But it was sad when she started to lose her memory because she would pull up plants out of season She d still want to garden and things would be coming up and she would think it was time to pull them out You d have to kind of go behind her and say Whoa But she was a she was a sweetheart they both were in their own ways And of course you never appreciate them and think to ask them stories Yeah Like until it s too late Because I know my Granny grew up in Cabarrus County on a farm and was one of three or four kids and she inherited her father s mother for a season out of every year Poor old woman would come all wrapped up in layers of clothes and my mother told me this not long before she died but she said when she was little she remembered her granny showing up and her mother saying The first thing I m going to do is unwrap this cocoon She wouldn t have changed her clothes since the last time Granny had seen her probably Oh no Well maybe six months But she had just layers and layers and it was just I can imagine her just grabbing it and going bloop and throwing all that in the wash pot and getting her cleaned up She was an ugly woman She was great big and looked very sour but uh they all had stories of their own I don t now let s see which one was it I ll tell you this one last story because it s a great story going back to the Civil War And it might have been this very woman who when she was a little girl this would be my great grandmother Maryann Joyner uh her father went off to fight in the war on the Confederate side from Cabarrus County And he didn t come back which left her mother kind of in limbo They presumed dead the war ended he never came back they never learned what happened to him and so she took up with this I guess he was a traveling salesman with a wagon and a mule And she put her two children Maryann and her little brother Maryann was about 12 and her brother was about eight at this point and they took they moved down or were going to move down to Georgia But he what happened I think they both died of malaria which was pretty prevalent along the coastal area and left the two kids on their own Maryann took her little brother by the hand and they walked back to Concord Wow PG And were taken in by this old man older man who was probably I guess 40 s early 50s maybe who had a sick wife and a flock of kids He brought them in took her in I guess both of them with the understanding she would take care of his wife and the kids Well the wife died and he married Maryann Huh So I don t know what the age difference was but it was probably 30 35 years Wow And she had several kids by him Wow That is an interesting story Yeah I tried to get my mother well I did have my mother on tape te lling about it and then I lost the tape But there s so many things like that I wish I had known to ask both grandmothers Because on the other side of course they fought with the Yankees My grandfather s father or maybe my grandfather s grandfather uh fought in the Civil War and he was captured and went to what s that awful prison in South Carolina Uh I know what you re talking about That a book was written about I can t remember the name But anyway he survived it A lot of people didn t um and he walked back to Wisconsin Wow No I take that back They were living in Pennsylvania and he walked back from Charleston area to Pennsylvania after the war like so many other people had to do because there was no other way to get there Andersonville That s it Yeah That takes it back the little bits I know about the family That s back about as far back as I can go Except for well there s my grandmother Tina who grew up in Wisconsin in the central part of the state while it was still Indian territory and you know you know the dining table at my house Have I told you the story about it No It was her mother s table and chairs and it was the table that she would put all her weekly baking on every Monday for the family She was widowed fairly young and had these nine kids And she took in laundry and raised her family as best she could My grandmother Tina was like the youngest of these kids and she was I guess eight or nine when this happened but they everybody I mean the Indians were part of the community although they kind of kept to themselves but they knew what was going on and they would have dealings with the settlers Well my grandmother Tina who was a little girl got sick with some fever and her mother was staying up with her night and day and was just exhausted And the Indians some of the Indians knew about it and they said they said to Tina s mother You go get some sleep We ll take care of your little girl So they brought her some sort of herbal concoction and broke her fever and she got better and they went away And they came back the next Monday after the baking was done and they gathered up the four corners of the tablecloth and took the week s worth of baking out the door which they figured was their due Without saying a word Yeah Wow you have any idea what year that was Can you trace it back Yeah it would have been let s see my father was born in 1904 Tina would have been about 20 early 20s at that point so early 1885 Yeah thereabouts It was truly the wild frontier And here you are And here I am eating off that table Things have calmed down pretty much since then Well I don t know sometimes
