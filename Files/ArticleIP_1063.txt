unmarried servicemen from sleeping with married people However the rules come with qualifications They say that the military will only prosecute when a case harms good order and discipline and when the adultery is of a nature to bring discredit upon the armed forces The ambiguity is intentional Visits to prostitutes are not reasons for a court martial but long term affairs and affairs between soldiers are considered dangerous and deserving of punishment Unlike civilian anti adultery laws the military rules are sometimes enforced Last year the Air Force alone prosecuted 67 soldiers for

unless a church tribunal annuls the previous marriage s An annulment is a declaration that a marriage was not legitimate to begin with Adultery is grounds for annulment on the theory that if a person knew that his or her spouse had a predilection toward infidelity the marriage would not have occurred in the first place Until recently the church was stingy with annulments But last year it granted more than 60 000 nine out of 10 of them in the United States Sheila Rauch Kennedy ex wife of Rep Joseph Kennedy II has garnered much attention for her recent book Shattered Faith which criticizes the church s annulment policies She claims that the church hurts children of annulled marriages when it claims that their parents were never legitimately wed How widespread is adultery Alfred Kinsey s
