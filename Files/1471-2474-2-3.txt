include vasculopathies such as atherosclerosis 5 and autoimmune vascular diseases such as lupus 6 graft versus host disease 7 and systemic sclerosis 8 Many factors are involved in the development and progression of these diseases including lifestyle diet smoking and lack of physical exercise genes and environment 1 2 3 4 Also infectious agents including both bacterial Chlamydia 9 10 and viral CMV 11 12 have been implicated CMV a herpes virus causes chronic asymptomatic infections in immunocompetent individuals termed latency 13 However in situations of immunocompromise CMV is reactivated which in many cases leads to organ failure and death 13 Epidemiological reports indicate that chronic CMV infections in humans may play an important role in pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis 14 and systemic sclerosis 11 12 In addition a recent report 15 revealed that SSc autoantibodies bind to CMV late protein UL94 and induce apoptosis in endothelial cells therefore implicating molecular mimicry as a potential mechanism accounting for the link between SSc and CMV Here we report that MCMV infections of gene targeted mice lacking IFN R and subjected to whole body irradiation develop vascular lesions that over 4 months progress to severe vasculopathy characterized by significant neointima formation a prominent feature of autoimmune vasculopathies in humans Furthermore imunohistochemical analyses indicate the presence of significant lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the adventitia of affected arteries containing both T and B lymphocytes Neointima stained positive for both smooth muscle actin and PCNA indicating proliferation of smooth muscle cells possibly mediated by growth factors TGF 1 PDGF A and PDGF B while TUNEL indicated apoptosis in the intimal layer in affected arteries Materials and methods Mice All experiments described in this study confirm with The guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the US National Institutes of Health NIH Publication No 85 23 revised 1996 CD 1 mice used for generating the MCMV stock were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA Experimental groups included 1 adult immunocompetent 129S mice and 2 adult B6 129S IFN R mice both obtained from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor MN Food and water were provided ad libitum All mice were housed in hepa filtered cages in the approved animal facility and monitored daily for the development of clinical manifestations of infection Preparation of MCMV stock and infection protocol MCMV strain Smith stock was purchased from American Type Tissue Collection Rockville MD This virus stock had been propagated in SC 1 cells mouse embryo fibroblast cell line To enhance pathogenicity the virus was passed three times in adult immunocompetent CD 1 mice which were infected with MCMV by i p injection with 5 x 10 5plaque forming units pfu Two weeks after infection mice were sacrificed salivary glands were collected and virus stock was prepared as a 10 weight volume homogenate Concentration of virus in these homogenates was determined by a standard plaque assay on an infected 3T 12 fibroblast cell line Final MCMV stock contained 4 2 x 10 6PFUs ml of salivary gland homogenate Control animals were infected with the same concentration of salivary gland homogenate obtained from control uninfected CD 1 mice Experimental protocol Two months old mice were injected i p with either MCMV or control salivary gland homogenate Starting at day 15 after infection and for as long as 6 months of age mice were sacrificed on a biweekly basis by i p injection of sodium nembutal Hearts and abdominal aortas were collected and histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed To both accelerate the development of vascular pathology and to deepen the immunocompromised state these mice were irradiated with a sublethal dose of gamma radiation 300 Rads at 4 months of age Tissue sections were coded and scoring was performed in a blinded fashion Histology H E Movat trichrome and Verhoeff van Gieson staining was performed on 4 m sections of aortas fixed for 16 hours in neutral buffered formalin 10 and embedded in paraffin Antibodies Polyclonal antibodies specific for CD4 CD8 TCR TGF 1 PDGF A PDGF B MCP 1 and polyclonal antibody to PCNA were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc Santa Cruz CA Polyclonal antibody to B lymphocyte marker B 220 was purchased from Caltag Laboratories Burlingame CA Monoclonal antibody specific for smooth muscle actin clone 1A4 was purchased from Sigma St Louis MO Immunohistochemical analysis Tissues were collected fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin After deparaffinizing and two 5 minute washes in PBS the sections were blocked for 20 minutes with a solution of 2 unconjugated goat anti mouse IgG in 1 x PBS Indicated dilutions of the primary antibodies were added to the slides and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature followed by two 5 minute washes with PBS Biotinylated secondary IgG diluted 1 100 was added to the slides and incubated for 30 minutes After two additional 5 minute PBS washes the tissue sections were treated with a 3 solution of hydrogen peroxide to quench endogenous peroxidase activity After two additional 5 minute washes the slides were incubated for 30 minutes in the solution containing the avidin biotin peroxidase complex Diaminobenzidine H 2 O 2 substrate was allowed to react with the peroxidase labeled tissue sections for 20 minutes After two 1 minute rinses in distilled water the tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxilin cleared and dehydrated by successive gradations through 70 95 and 100 ethanol followed by a final passage in xylene The slides were mounted and analyzed by bright field microscopy Tunel Animals were sacrificed and tissues collected and processed as described for immunohistochemistry TUNEL assay was performed utilizing a kit for in situ detection of apoptosis Oncogene Cambridge MA according to manufacturer s instructions Briefly 5 m sequential sections were deparaffinized and fixed with 4 paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature followed by 30 minute wash in PBS After a 5 minute rinse with PBS 50 l of TUNEL reaction mixture was added to tissue sections and incubated in humidified chamber for 60 minutes at 37 C followed by three 5 minute rinses in PBS and directly analyzed under the microscope Results Neointima formation triggered by MCMV infection Both immunocompetent 129S and immunodeficient IFN R mice were infected by i p injection at age 2 months with either 1 x 10 5or 5 x 10 4pfus of MCMV stock At 1 x 10 5pfus mouse 90 of IFN R mice died with necrotizing hepatitis between days 5 10 Reducing the dose of MCMV to 5 x 10 4pfu resulted in lower mortality rates 30 In the immunocompetent group no deaths occurred at either dose of MCMV Surviving mice that received either dose of virus developed perivascular mononuclear cellular infiltrates in a number of organs including lungs kidneys and salivary glands Vascular disease in the IFN R group of mice began with development of an inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitia of aortas 3 4 weeks after infection in 30 of animals Table 1 Fig 1A This infiltrate was comprised predominantly of lymphohistiocytic cells Fig 1A The vascular disease progressed over a time course of 4 months and affected between 50 and 65 of animals Table 1 In the group of IFN R mice receiving sublethal 300 Rads whole body irradiation 2 months after infection all examined animals exhibited vascular pathology Table 1 Animals appeared healthy and all survived whole body irradiation In the immunocompetent group of animals these infiltrates were cleared by 8 weeks after infection and from that point these animals were histologically indistinguishable from the uninfected group On the contrary in the IFN R mice infected with MCMV vascular disease progressed to the formation of neointima in aortas by 4 months of age Fig 1B C D Verhoeff van Gieson staining indicated the focal destruction of aortic elastic fibrils in addition to intimal thickening Fig 1D Controls in experiments using IFN R mice included 1 uninfected animals 2 mice that were exposed only to the whole body irradiation and 3 mice that received only MCMV Histopathological analysis of abdominal aortas collected from transgenic infected and irradiated animals revealed severe vasculitis characterized by significant inflammatory infiltrate in the adventitia and media Table 2 Fig 2 At the same time hearts showed no signs of disease data not shown Verhoeff van Gieson Fig 2C and Movat pentachrome Fig 2D staining indicated the focal destruction of elastic tissue as well as potential trafficking of the infiltrating cells through these breaks in the elastica The extent of vascular damage in all mice from this group was similar The most striking feature of the MCMV induced vascular disease was the formation of neointima in aortas of MCMV infected immunodeficient mice after irradiation Table 2 Fig 2 At the same time there was no vascular pathology in any of the control groups Table 2 Fig 2A Verhoeff van Gieson staining of aortas collected from IFN R mice 30 days after irradiation not shown and IFN R mice 60 days after irradiation Fig 2 indicated that the intimal vascular lesion induced by MCMV infection was characterized by collagen deposition and smooth muscle proliferation We utilized monoclonal antibody specific for SMA a marker for myofibroblast cells and found that neointima seen in the aortas of MCMV infected experimental animals contained myofibroblasts Fig 3 Immunohistochemical characterization of immune response to MCMV infection Immunohistochemical characterization of the inflammatory infiltrate seen in the adventitia and media of the affected aortas revealed both helper T lymphocytes CD4 Fig 4B and cytotoxic T lymphocytes CD8 Fig 4C throughout the lesion Since one of the characteristics of autoimmune vasculopathies is the appearance of high numbers of TCR 16 bearing cells we studied this cell type in our model of vascular disease Results from these experiments revealed a large number of TCR bearing lymphocytes throughout the lesion Fig 4D We also investigated the presence of B lymphocytes in the vascular lesion of MCMV infected mice While T lymphocytes were identified throughout the lesion these cells were mostly found in small follicles Fig 4A Investigation of the role of cytokines and growth factors Growth factors possibly responsible for the neointimal proliferation were studied based on their putative importance in autoimmune vasculopathies in humans Immunohistochemical analysis indicated a significant overproduction of TGF 1 PDGF A and PDGF B in the MCMV induced intimal lesion Fig 5 While TGF 1 and PDGF A immunoreactivity in affected arteries is localized to all three layers intima media adventitia Fig 5Band 5D PDGF B staining is localized to the media and neointima Fig 5F MCP 1 a chemokine that has been implicated in pathogenesis of several autoimmune vascular diseases including SSc was noted in the adventitia and media of affected arteries Fig 6 We did not detect MCP 1 positive staining in neointima data not shown Role of apoptosis and proliferation Further we investigated the role of apoptosis and proliferation in vascular pathology triggered by MCMV infection of immunosuppressed mice In situ TUNEL revealed positive staining in the intimal layer of affected aortas Fig 7A In addition a small portion of infiltrating inflammatory cells stained positive by TUNEL Fig 7B Smooth muscle myofibroblast cells forming the neointima did not reveal any cells positive by TUNEL Fig 7A Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA was used to identify cell proliferation The majority of cells in the neointima Fig 7Cand Fig 8 as well as infiltrating inflammatory cells Fig 7Dand FIG 8 exhibit immunoreactivity for PCNA indicating active proliferation Discussion The major finding of this study is the formation of neointima associated with MCMV infection in immunocompromised mice The disease described in our study resembles pathological processes seen in other autoimmune vasculopathies However it is important to note that while there are undoubtedly autoimmune aspects of atherosclerosis this issue is still under debate 17 The formation of neointima characteristic of the vasculopathy in autoimmune diseases by this approach has to our knowledge not been previously reported While MCMV vasculitis in IFN R mice has been previously reported 18 that study does not focus on intimal proliferation In our experimental conditions we were able to increase yield from 62 affected animals in IFN R mice infected with MCMV to 100 by including whole body irradiation of chronically infected IFN R mice Table 1 In addition a striking increase in the severity of intimal lesions was noted in irradiated mice Table 2 We propose that there are two possible explanations for the increase in both the number of affected animals as well as increase in the severity of vascular disease in MCMV infected IFN R mice receiving whole body irradiation treatment First sublethal irradiation additionally immunosuppresses the animals allowing unlimited replication of MCMV which may lead to direct viral damage Second the immune system after recovering from effects of radiation reconstitution contains large number of MCMV specific CTLs that may be capable of inducing intimal pathology while attempting to clear the infection CMV infections have been implicated in a number of vascular diseases CMV invades the vascular endothelium with the development of both latency and intermittent shedding of the virus to distal tissues often by detachment of infected endothelial cells In immunocompetent individuals CMV infections are of chronic or latent type and are usually not associated with clinically detectable disease In immunocompromised patients such as neonates transplant recipients and patients with AIDS CMV infections are a leading cause of organ failure and death Nonetheless the mechanisms of CMV reactivation and induction of vascular lesions are not well understood Clinical and epidemiological studies strongly suggest the association of CMV infection in the progression of numerous vascular diseases including atherosclerosis 16 17 18 19 20 rapidly progressive coronary artery disease endothelialitis in heart transplant recipients 21 22 23 24 coronary restenosis 25 26 and inflammatory aortic disease 27 28 as well as SSc 11 12 We attempted to reproduce the endpoint of such diseases by using immunosupression and CMV infection allowing us to investigate cellular and molecular events leading to this pathology While SSc is an autoimmune disease affecting microvasculature some recent studies also described increased incidence of vascular pathology in the large arterial vessels of SSc patients 29 30 31 However it is still unclear if macro vascular pathology is a primary feature of SSc or an indirect effect of some of the downstream events related to this disease Inoculation of immunocompetent mice with MCMV causes persistent productive infection in salivary glands followed by latency 32 33 This latency is characterized by the presence of the viral genome whereas infectious viral particles could not be detected In addition it was possible to reactivate virus either in vivo or in vitro from tissue explants While there are several lines of evidence to suggest that the immune system or its absence plays a role in MCMV reactivation from latency 34 35 the mechanism is not known Latent CMV in many organs can be reactivated from its dormant state by several means of immunosuppression including transmission from donors to immunosuppressed recipients of transplants and blood transfusion Prior studies describe development of MCMV associated vascular lesions in large arterial vessels of mice The i p injection of suckling mice induces vascular lesions in the aorta and pulmonary artery which are characterized by cellular infiltrates containing T lymphocytes 36 A more recent study describes the development of MCMV induced vascular lesions in the aorta of both immunocompetent mice and those lacking IFN responsiveness where IFN is determined to be a major antiviral factor preventing the long term persistence of aortic vascular lesions 18 The present study focused on neointima formation which was seen only in immunocompromised mice Our results indicated presence of both CD4 helper and CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the adventitia of the affected arteries Significant portion of these T lymphocytes are TCR This subpopulation of lymphocytes has been identified as part of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases For example it has been shown that TCR lymphocytes from SSc patients recognize and lyse endothelial cells at a significantly higher rate then cells isolated from control subjects 16 Also a recent study indicates that TCR bearing lymphocytes play an important role in immune response of immunosuppressed transplant recipients to CMV infection 37 NK cells natural antibodies and complement potentially important in controlling CMV infection await further study Growth factors TGF and PDGF are contributing factors in vascular diseases TGF upregulates smooth muscle actin gene transcription 38 Since we identified significant smooth muscle actin expression in our model and this coincided with the expression of TGF it is possible that TGF mediates smooth muscle actin expression in our model The elevated expression of PDGF in our model is also significant since the expression of these growth factors by endothelial cells can be induced by direct immune cell endothelial cell interaction promoting smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation in atherosclerosis 39 CMV as well as other viruses induces expression of a number of cytokines and growth factors in cells in vitro including TGF a profibrogenic cytokine 40 41 MCP 1 is a member of the chemokine C C family 42 and this chemokine has been implicated in pathogenesis of SSc 43 Our results Fig 6 indicate that this chemokine may play a role in recruitment of inflammatory cells to CMV infected vasculature We investigated the role of apoptosis in pathogenesis of MCMV induced intimal lesion since apoptosis of virally infected cells is one of the mechanisms by which host may limit the virus spread The presence of apoptotic T lymphocytes has been reported to be a feature of MCMV infection 44 Apoptosis of vascular endothelium induced by immune effectors has been described in both SSc patient vessels as well as those of UCD chickens one of the animal models for SSc 45 Recently it has been reported that IgG autoantibodies from SSc patients bind CMV late protein UL94 and this induces apoptosis in human endothelial cells 15 We detected the presence of apoptotic cells in the intimal layer as well as in inflammatory infiltrate of the affected aortas Fig 7A 7B In the future we will ask if apoptosis in our model is induced by anti endothelial autoantibodies MCMV infection of endothelium or is induced and or perpetuated by inflammatory cells Apoptosis of vascular endothelium may be the trigger that initiates the uncontrolled repair mechanism characterized by the proliferation of smooth muscle cells myofibroblasts leading to the development of neointima in MCMV induced vascular disease The development of CMV induced vasculopathies is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients CMV infections have been identified as important mediator of organ failure and death in transplant recipients and AIDS patients Although the role of CMV infection in pathogenesis of vascular diseases in immunocompetent patients is less clear epidemiological studies strongly suggest that chronic or latent infections may accelerate the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis and SSc In fact it is fair to hypothesize that several diseases thought to be of idiopathic origin may be triggered by chronic infections with CMV and other infectious agents in the genetically susceptible host Animal models such as those described in this paper will allow us to better understand the role that viral infections play in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases It is crucial to identify factors responsible for contributing to the development of vascular pathology in order to develop better preventive as well as treatment modalities Competing interests None declared Abbreviations CMV cytomegalovirus MCMV murine cytomegalovirus MCP 1 monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 PCNA
