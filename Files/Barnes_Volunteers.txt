 Barnes Volunteers as Lawyer to Poor Wednesday December 18 2002 Defeated last month for re election Gov Roy Barnes announced Tuesday that he will spend his first six months out of office as an unpaid attorney for the Atlanta Legal Aid Society where he will represent poor people One day I ll probably do some legal work that I will charge a handsome fee for at least I hope there are those that are still willing to pay he told reporters But for now I think it is important to fulfill my duty as a lawyer to help those who need it the most to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves and to defend those whose life and livelihoods depend on it he said Previous governors have gone to prestigious law firms joined corporate boards or returned to thriving businesses I don t think I ve ever heard of anybody doing this before Emory University political science professor Merle Black said If he s actually going to represent individuals for that organization they re going to get great representation You re going to get some powerful legal muscle there Mr Black said Mr Barnes said he already has his first case but he wouldn t say what it is Atlanta Legal Aid provides civil services to poor people in five metro Atlanta counties Mr Barnes said he was hoping to send a message to other lawyers This privilege to practice law is just that it s a privilege And it comes with a cost and it comes with a bill We as lawyers have a responsibility to make sure that everyone regardless of whether they can afford it or not has quality representation And if we don t do that then we re not much of a profession he said Steven Gottlieb the society s executive director said I can t imagine anything that could be better than to have the governor of the state in his first act as a private citizen donate six months of his time to represent poor people That s just astounding to me Mr Barnes did not necessarily need to seek a top salaried job after leaving office Financial disclosure reports and tax returns he released in June showed Mr Barnes had a net worth of 12 3 million
