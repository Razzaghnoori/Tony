 Background Flowering plants are composed of diverse cell types organized into tissues and organs To achieve the morphological and functional specialization of cells and tissues suites of genes are expressed in spatial and temporal patterns determined by regulatory hierarchies responding to environmental cues Plants reiteratively produce photosynthetic organs such as individual leaves that often differ in morphology and physiology depending on environmental cues and their positions on the plant The fine tuning of gene expression to permit such diversity remains largely uncharacterized Flower development provides one example where organs of distinctive morphologies sepals petals stamens carpels are produced in rapid succession specification of each floral organ requires temporally and spatially refined expression of specific genes 1 Although the functions and expression patterns for dozens of genes have been characterized in particular plant tissues and organs the number of well studied examples is meager compared to the total number of genes 2 Using information and material from genomic and high throughput expressed sequence tag EST sequencing projects several approaches have been devised to investigate global gene expression profiles In particular spotted microarrays of ESTs have been used to initiate functional analyses of thousands of genes simultaneously The first microarray contained only 45 Arabidopsis thaliana genes 3 but the demonstrated success of the method was quickly followed by studies of human 4 and yeast 5 gene expression Microarray analysis has been used in plants for such diverse purposes as discovering genes responsible for strawberry flavor 6 comparing mutant to wild type plants 7 and monitoring organism level responses to environmental stimuli 8 9 10 In most studies treated and untreated tissues of the same age were compared To date there are just a few studies comparing distinct developmental stages For example Ruan et al 11 surveyed expression in the three fundamental organ types leaves roots and flowers of Arabidopsis using microarrays containing 1 400 EST cDNA clones Fernandes et al 12 compared the hybridization of maize 14 day endosperm and immature ear 1 2 cm RNA populations on separate endosperm and ear microarrays containing approximately 2 800 and 2 500 distinct genes respectively They found that nearly all probes on the ear array hybridized to cDNA prepared from endosperm or ear whereas the endosperm array contained many apparently tissue specific elements Using the 152 746 maize ESTs available 31 858 tentative unique genes TUGs have been assembled as reported by the Zea mays database April 14 2002 13 Most ESTs are from the Maize Gene Discovery project 13 and a UniGene set is being developed from this resource From the UniGene1 EST assembly 5 376 cDNA gene probes were used to fabricate a spotted cDNA microarray for a suite of hybridizations In addition 384 synthetic oligonucleotides 30 40 or 45 nucleotides in length were printed to explore whether hybridization and washing conditions compatible with signal retention for both oligos and cDNA clones could be devised Thirteen RNA samples from 7 distinct organs were hybridized on this array to ask how many genes were expressed in all or most organs which genes had discrete patterns of expression and whether gene expression profiles could be used to understand the relationships among organs Among 5 000 genes selected for analysis 56 showed less than a twofold difference and 37 showed a two to fourfold difference in mRNA amounts compared to the reference sample maize seedling RNA These results imply that the differentiated state of maize tissues and organs is characterized by combinations of small numbers of differentially expressed 4 fold tissue or organ specific genes among the 5 376 genes in this study A complication of this interpretation is that some members of gene families will cross hybridize making it difficult to resolve whether there are large numbers of organ specific genes within such families As a first step in resolving expression patterns among recently duplicated genes oligo probes for well characterized genes were printed on the same microarray slides as the cDNAs The oligo probes generated more accurate information about gene expression than did cDNA probes for the genes examined in this study We discuss how rationally designed oligo probes can distinguish expression patterns of individual genes in a gene family with similar sequences Results Internal consistency of hybridization To examine the consistency of experiments from the labeling reactions through to the scanning process a pool of mRNA from 4 day old roots 4DR was used to synthesize two fluorescent cDNA targets using Cy3 dUTP or Cy5 dUTP These labeled cDNAs were subsequently combined in equal proportion to perform control hybridization experiments Signal intensities of the two fluorescence measurement channels were linearly correlated for a majority of the 5 376 PCR probes indicating that nearly all targets were labeled with each dye The mean Cy5 Cy3 ratio of the hybridized group of 5 263 genes was 1 046 with a standard error of 0 0014 and standard deviation of 0 105 Nearly all probes 5 074 of 5 263 or 96 were within the 0 75 to 1 25 range 0 415 to 0 32 on the log 2 scale and only two probe ratios were slightly over 2 1 on a log 2 scale Of 5 376 EST probes examined 5 263 generated signal intensities exceeding 300 intensity units in each channel and 1 500 in the summation of the two channels indicating that the ESTs on the array correspond mainly to moderately expressed genes The few ESTs with signal intensities below these values have been omitted from further analysis Another data set selected with a lower standard 700 in the summation of two channels generated very similar results data not shown To investigate hybridization consistency further aliquots of mRNAs from immature ears IME and 4DR were each labeled separately with Cy3 dUTP or Cy5 dUTP A mixture of Cy3 labeled 4DR and Cy5 labeled IME was hybridized to one slide and the same samples but labeled oppositely were hybridized to a second slide Probes with a red color on one side appeared green on the other side and vice versa as illustrated in Figure 1a 1b The hybridization consistency was examined by evaluating signal ratios between the two channels produced from each dye swapped hybridization Signal ratios were calculated by dividing the signal intensity of 4DR by that of the IME Out of 5 016 probes 4 536 hybridized successfully to produce signal intensities greater than the selection criteria in both hybridizations One of 16 subarrays 360 probes in one hybridization was excluded in this analysis because there was a mechanical failure during array printing Of high quality probes 4 334 95 5 showed a log 2 ratio difference between 0 5 to 0 5 Only six 0 12 showed a log 2 ratio difference of more than 1 in the paired hybridizations Figure 1c These hybridization results appear to be similar null hypothesis not rejected p 0 01 t test with an unequal variance p value 0 819 two tail t distribution 41 Therefore hybridizations on two separate slides from the same printing generate highly reproducible results Expression profile comparisons between 4 day old roots and immature ears The relative amounts of mRNA for each printed EST were inferred from hybridization results in the dye swapping experiments of 4DR and IME Figure 1d The ratios were averaged from a set of dye swapped hybridization experiments and 4 878 EST probes were selected for further analyses In the comparison 3 222 66 of 4 880 probes registered within the range 1 4 to 1 4 log 2 0 5 that is within the range of signal variations intrinsic to the experimental procedures Figure 1d Table 1 Of the 4 880 probes 1 188 24 showed a 1 4 to 2 fold difference 0 5 log 2 1 0 and 407 8 3 showed a 2 to 4 fold 1 log 2 ratio 2 difference between the two organs Only 63 or 1 3 of the EST probes showed more than a fourfold difference log 2 ratio 2 Figure 1d Among the 63 most differentially expressed genes 25 exhibited a more than fourfold higher level of expression and 38 a more than fourfold lower level in IME compared to 4DR Among the 25 IME abundant genes there are five MADS box gene family members In plants with perfect flowers male and female sexual organs sepals and petals in the same flower this gene family regulates inflorescence development flower organ differentiation flowering time and specification of floral cell type 1 In the imperfect monoecious plant maize some MADS box genes are expressed specifically in the male tassel or in the female ear inflorescences whereas others are expressed in both 14 15 Other ear enriched transcripts were for three different heat shock proteins late elongated hypocotyl gene and the mudrA transposase Genes exhibiting a more than 2 8 fold ratio difference are listed in the Additional data files Hybridization results were further analyzed by considering the cDNA library of origin There were 1 920 probes on the slides from cDNA library 614 4DR 768 probes from 606 IME and 2 683 probes from 707 and 945 two samples of the same mixed adult tissue cDNA library In the hybridization control experiment Figure 1 the behavior of 4DR dye labeled cDNA sample on the 4DR library 614 section of the slide was examined Some probes of library 614 showed strong red on the slide in Figure 1aand strong green on the slide in Figure 1bin the 614 section Figure 1 arrowheads which would be expected if these clones were expressed in a tissue specific pattern Other EST elements however presented the opposite color pattern Figure 1 arrows Of 1 920 probes originating from a 4DR cDNA library 614 1 106 57 6 showed log 2 signal ratios between 0 5 and 0 5 Only 28 15 13 1 5 showed over fourfold higher log 2 ratio 2 mRNA amount in 4 day old roots compared to immature ears Table 1 Furthermore 713 37 of 1 920 ESTs originating from a 4DR library were expressed at lower levels in 4DR than in IME Similarly probes originating from the IME 606 and mixed adult tissue 707 945 libraries showed only a small fraction of organ specific expression elements Table 1 These data in part reflect EST and UniGene1 consolidation methods see Methods and materials When an EST is chosen for a UniGene set this does not mean that it was found only in one cDNA library source contigs assembled from maize ESTs typically have contributions from several cDNA libraries Expression profile comparisons among thirteen samples from seven organs IME and 4DR are very distinctive in their developmental origin location and functions in the maize life cycle Despite this the majority of the microarray elements appeared to be expressed in both organs Interesting questions arose from this observation How many genes are expressed abundantly in specific organs How many genes are expressed in diverse organs To answer these questions seven different organ sources were analyzed The signal ratios were averaged from two hybridization analyses for each organ in comparison to the reference organ 4 day old shoots with coleoptiles The clustering by similarity of expression patterns is shown in Figure 2for a subset of the data Analysis was restricted to 4 673 probes that generated intensities 300 in both channels and 1 500 summing both channels in 11 or all 12 pairs of hybridization experiments Among these 4 673 genes only 326 7 showed more than a fourfold log 2 ratio 2 and 1 731 37 had a 2 4 fold 1 log 2 ratio 2 signal ratio in at least one of the 12 organs compared to the reference These are candidate tissue or organ specific genes The majority 56 of the genes showed signal ratios between 1 4 and 1 4 fold log 2 ratio 0 5 In Figure 2this observation is visually apparent from the high proportion of black elements depicting equal hybridization on the far left cladogram composed of 4 531 ESTs As shown in Table 2 over 90 of the genes showed a twofold range log 2 ratio 1 in most comparisons confirming and extending the initial comparisons between 4DR and IME This consistency of hybridization results suggested that only a small number of genes were expressed differentially in specific organs and that the majority of printed ESTs had approximately similar expression levels in many organs Among the 12 samples adult leaf blades L9 L10 showed the highest number of genes expressed at a lower level than the reference organ Table 2 and see extensive green color within Figure 2 whereas the husks and silks showed the opposite trend extensive red color in Figure 2 Inferred hierarchy of organ similarity Plant organs are classified on the basis of their ontogeny a few key characteristics such as their ability to photosynthesize and the expression of genes required for this process and the discrete impact of mutations on individual organs Using the expression profile data organ relationships were analyzed using a large set of characters Seven data sets were selected for clustering as described in Materials and methods either followed by a median centering and normalization or without this process As shown in Figure 3 both analytical treatments yielded nearly identical organ relationships Overall branch lengths appeared longer but tree topologies were more consistent among trees from the normalized method than from the unnormalized one Leaf blades at three developmental stages formed a tight group in all 14 tree diagrams Figures 2 3 Short terminal branches for these stages indicated a high similarity of their gene expression profiles Root profiles at three developmental stages also group together although their internal relationships were less consistent among comparisons Immature ears plus embryos or leaf sheaths from two developmental stages also grouped consistently With more distant relationships nodes were less well supported For example the leaf sheath pair appeared as a sister group to the leaf blades in trees A F but as sister to the leaf blades or roots in trees G L Figure 3 The extremely short shared nodes imply a weak relationship of the leaf sheath pair to either group After collapsing short and inconsistent nodes four distinct macrogroups remained with unresolved relationships among them Figure 4 leaf blades leaf sheaths reproductive ear silk embryo husk and roots Within these four broad categories each group has a unique set of expressed genes and these patterns were relatively consistent during the developmental stages assayed The relationship of the husk a photosynthetic leaf like organ 16 surrounding the ears of maize to other organs merits special attention It appeared as an immediate sister to the silk Figure 3 bottom panel or sister to the inflorescence organ group including the silk Figure 3 upper panel After collapsing ambiguous nodes the husk remained within the reproductive group and therefore distinctive from both leaf blade and sheath Adjacent positions with the long terminal branches implied a loose relationship between husks and silks Of the flower related genes 32 are expressed at high levels in husks Figure 2 node c Organ specific gene expression To gain greater confidence in deciphering organ specific gene expression patterns gene product classification focused on 326 probes with a more than fourfold ratio difference in signal intensities in at least one organ compared to the reference Figure 2 According to the criterion of E value e 10in BLASTX searches 17 only 136 of the 326 genes predict similar proteins in public databases 71 of 326 genes matched an Arabidopsis genome sequence and 119 genes did not have significantly similar sequence in the public databases Flower related genes included hydroxyproline rich glycoprotein hrgp 18 amylase PID9294660 pollen allergen PID4006978 a bZIP transcription factor PID6288682 four MADS box genes 1 14 and several unknown genes Figure 2 A relatively high expression of diverse transcription factors in embryo immature ear and silk is consistent with microscopic observations that many stages of organ differentiation are occurring within the immature inflorescence and embryos Because the husks were morphologically fully expanded leaf sheaths surrounding the ear it was surprising that they expressed the same genes such as MADS box genes that are associated with early stages of flower development Heat shock proteins 16 9 kDa 82 kDa and 101 kDa were abundant in silks husks and IME but not in embryos The genes for the 82 kDa and 101 kDa proteins are expressed at raised temperatures 19 20 however in this study they appear to be part of a developmental program Embryos and flowers are distinguished by large quantitative differences in expression of these three heat shock genes Root specific genes included a nodulin homolog PID3482914 putative lipid transfer protein gene PID10140658 physical impedance induced protein gene PID2226329 and four additional unknown genes The organ specific expression pattern of these genes may spark interest in defining their physiological functions Genes expressed preferentially in the leaf blade Twenty six transcripts were comparatively abundant only in leaf blades Figure 2 node a The expression ratio of these genes was more than twofold higher in 8 day 2 week and adult leaf blades and more than fourfold lower in roots immature ears and embryos in comparison to the reference 4 day shoots Twenty three of these leaf enriched transcripts shared high sequence similarity to previously published identified or putative coding sequences Gene products from 17 of these 23 genes were previously characterized as located in or predicted to locate to plastids Two well characterized genes in this leaf blade group are for Rubisco small subunit rbcS and phosphoribulokinase key enzymes for converting CO 2 into carbohydrate via the Calvin cycle Other genes represented components of light harvesting complexes photosystems I and II chloroplastic aldolase 21 and the phosphoenolpyruvate translocator gene 22 Most of these highly expressed leaf genes are encoded in the nuclear genome and the proteins are imported into chloroplasts Interestingly three of the 26 leaf blade genes are known to be encoded in the chloroplast genome in maize as in other flowering plants 23 None of them contained a poly A tail track in the EST sequences Transcripts for these genes are so abundant in leaf blades that poly A selection apparently failed to remove them during mRNA purification for cDNA library construction and hybridization target labeling These chloroplast encoded genes consistently showed a co regulated expression pattern clustering with photosynthesis genes encoded in the nuclear genome Thus although they are contaminants their expression patterns confirm the co regulation of plastid and nuclear encoded genes required to construct photosynthetically competent organelles A second group of genes was also expressed highly 4 fold in leaf blades especially adult leaf blades and was about twofold lower in most other organs Figure 2 node b As listed in Figure 5 most of the annotated gene products are involved in the C4 pathway of CO 2 fixation Expression patterns of C4 genes are consistent with previous reports that they were highly expressed in leaves as well as at a low but detectable level in other organs 24 and references therein 25 Abundant transcripts of carbonic anhydrase phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase pepc and NADP malic enzyme genes in leaf blades are consistent with the NADP ME type C4 pathway known to operate in maize 24 26 In addition to the NADP ME type C4 pathway genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and alanine aminotransferase genes were also highly expressed in leaf blades These encode two of the three enzymes that distinguish the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase PEPCK C4 pathway The gene for the other key enzyme aspartate aminotransferase was not included in this array however EST sequences are well represented in diverse organs including the green tissues of 2 week old shoot and mixed adult tissue libraries ZmDB 13 All genes involved in both the NADP ME and PEPCK C4 pathways are regulated similarly in all organs surveyed in this study Figure 2 Verification of hybridization ratios and ratio interpretation To estimate how well signal ratios reflect relative transcript amounts an RNA blot hybridization was carried out with an hrgp probe There are three hrgp TUGs which are 94 identical along 860 nucleotides and more definitively 6 9 and 15 nucleotide unique indels insertions or deletions distinguish them As shown in Figure 6 blot hybridization with the hrgp probe produced results similar to the pattern of signal ratios in the 12 pairs of microarray hybridizations which are listed by organ in Figure 7 Overall individual signal ratios were lower on the microarray hybridization than with the blot hybridization measured by a Phosphor Imager For example the ratio between IME and the reference was 2 5 fold on the array but was 5 6 fold by blot hybridization Exceptionally signal ratios for leaf blades were higher in the microarray analysis than by blot hybridization To some extent these quantitative differences may reflect the different properties of microarray and RNA blot hybridizations The microarray utilizes a complex mixture of labeled cDNA fragments targets to hybridize to one kind of tethered probe at each position whereas an RNA blot applies one kind of labeled probe to a mixture of RNA targets separated by size using gel electrophoresis The blot hybridization also appears to report ratios over a wider range The ratios from the microarrays for EMB and silks were about 7 for both organs but they were 23 and 79 for EMB and silks in the blot hybridization respectively These observations may reflect two features of microarray analysis the nonlinearity of fluorescence excitation and the saturation of signal intensities for abundant transcripts The signal ratios from microarrays in this study probably underestimate the actual difference in amount for abundant transcripts Therefore a small absolute ratio should be interpreted as a reliable indicator for the presence of the transcript type in both samples In this experiment log 2 ratios from 0 5 to 0 5 are interpreted as simply indicating transcript presence without ascribing a difference in absolute amount Similarly we conclude that a fourfold difference detected by microarray hybridization indicates more than a fourfold difference in RNA abundance and could indicate organ specificity of expression Hybridization pattern comparisons between oligos and cDNA There are five gene families on the 326 element cladogram shown in the middle of Figure 2 three tubulin genes three tubulin genes three carbonic anhydrase genes four MADS box genes and five putative cellulose synthase genes Individual genes in each gene family displayed almost identical expression patterns in all 13 samples A few individual tubulin 27 tubulin 28 MADS box 15 29 and cellulose synthase 30 genes have been reported to be differentially expressed in maize or other plants For these gene families individual gene expression profiles on microarrays are obscured by cross hybridization among family members 12 31 To test whether oligonucleotide probes can be utilized together with cDNA probes to resolve individual gene contributions multiple oligos were printed on the same glass slide microarrays with the EST probes We wished to determine whether multiple oligos designed to the same gene would exhibit a coherent hybridization pattern and whether the oligos from a particular gene would cluster with known examples of genes co regulated in vivo a powerful test of the microarray 32 For this analysis 582 probes were selected a combination of oligo and EST probes Oligo probes from five genes tub hrgp rbcS eEF1 pepc met the selection criteria see legend to Figure 7 of demonstrating a high ratio in at least one hybridization Multiple oligo probes for each of these genes were printed as illustrated in the gene models in Figure 7 After cluster analysis the multiple oligos for each gene established well separated groups in only one restricted branch of the cladogram of the 582 element data set Figure 7 left panel Within the rbcS block as an example both 45 nucleotide probes from each of two exons appear as close neighbors no other probes separate them Such tight groups are characteristic of all 45 nucleotide oligos present in this cladogram Similar results were produced from data that were neither median centered nor normalized The multiple cDNAs for rbcS hrgp and tub genes cluster with the corresponding oligo probes It is notable however that two of three hrgp cDNA probes showed fairly reduced ratios in several organs Figure 6 triangles and squares The signal ratios from these two PCR probes differ significantly from the other probe and from the oligo probes p 0 01 in a paired t test Differences between a cDNA and multiple oligo probes are particularly evident for pepc Six of nine oligos are shown on the cladogram with functionally related genes Figures 2 7 Three others were excluded during the selection process because of weak hybridization On the other hand the cDNA probe was not selected because it exhibited an insufficient absolute ratio difference We suspect that cross hybridization among pepc family members or other genes obscured the authentic gene expression from the cDNA probe The ratio patterns of oligo probes in 12 pairs of duplicated hybridization experiments suggest that 45 mer oligos are a good alternative to gene specific RNA blot hybridization to measure expression patterns of specific genes Oligos of 30 and 40 nucleotides were also used successfully although signal strength was weaker red dots on the gene list in Figure 7 We conclude that the oligo hybridization patterns reflect transcript levels relatively accurately for the five genes presented in Figure 7 In fact the representation is likely to be more accurate than that based on PCR products based on the RNA blot hybridization comparisons Figure 6 Discussion Internal consistency of the microarray hybridization Internal consistency of the array hybridization results was demonstrated by five pieces of evidence First a control hybridization with one type of mRNA for which aliquots were labeled with different dyes generated signal ratios within 0 75 to 1 25 fold for 96 of the genes Second a dye swapping hybridization with two samples of mRNA hybridized on separate slides yielded very similar expression profiles Figure 1 Third multiple probes for each of several gene family members for five families deposited at random positions generated similar hybridization patterns Figure 2 suggesting that local effects on hybridization were negligible Fourth functionally related genes clustered together demonstrating a coherent pattern in 12 pairs of hybridization analysis Figures 2 7 Fifth groups of oligos designed to match different positions within several genes generated similar signal ratios and each oligo group clustered together Figure 7 Collectively these facts indicate that hybridization with these microarrays containing a mixture of cDNA and oligo probes was internally consistent Organ identity of husks Each organ is expected to have a unique combination of expressed genes allowing organ identification and assessment of similarity with other organs as shown by the cladograms in Figure 2 It is interesting that the highly expressed genes in husks parallel what is found in other floral organs Anatomically the husks around an ear are composed primarily of leaf sheath with a reduced ligule region subtending a highly reduced leaf blade in most maize inbred lines Husks are usually classified as modified photosynthetic leaves with the assumption that they are vegetative organs on a branch that terminates in an ear 16 33 According the work of Langdale and colleagues 33 maize husks express mainly the C3 pathway of carbon fixation in contrast to leaf blades in which C4 fixation predominates We found that husk gene expression profiles are distinctive from both leaf blades and sheaths For example Rubisco subunit binding protein PID1345582 was expressed at a similar level in husks but at 2 fold lower levels in leaf blades compared to the reference 4 day old shoot Figure 2 On the other hand all other photosynthetic genes expressed at high levels in leaf blades were at low levels in husks relative to seedlings Physiologically photosynthetic rates in husks are consistently measured to be around 20 fold lower in leaf blades 33 Both the expression pattern of photosynthetic genes and the low rate of carbon fixation in husks suggest that these are distinctive organs In contrast those genes that are highly expressed in silks and immature ears were expressed at comparable levels in husks Figure 2node c They included hrgp 18 amylase PID9294660 pollen allergen PID4006978 a bZIP transcription factor PID6288682 four MADS box 1 14 three heat shock proteins and a dozen uncharacterized genes Consistent with the hybridization results one MADS box gene ZAP1 has been reported to be expressed in the sterile organs of maize florets and in husks 15 The Arabidopsis homolog AP1 is also expressed in non reproductive organs such as sepal and petal primordia 34 The close relationship of husks to maize floral organs shown by gene expression profiles suggests that husks could be considered as photosynthetic floral organs arising from an inflorescence meristem Two types of C4 photosynthesis pathways in maize C4 plants have been classified into three subgroups on the basis of the distinctive enzymes that decarboxylate C4 acids in the bundle sheath cells Maize is a classic NADP ME type C4 plant 35 Interestingly we found that the enzyme PEPCK is expressed in a pattern similar to NADP ME and two additional universal C4 enzyme genes PEPCK catalyzes the reversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetate OAA to PEP This enzyme has several proposed functions such as gluco neogenesis in germinating seeds carbon recovery during senescence nitrogen assimilation during seed development and decarboxylation of OAA in PEPCK type C4 photosynthesis 36 37 The comparatively low expression level of the PEPCK gene in 4 day old shoots weakens the hypothesis that its major function in maize is for gluconeogenesis in greening seedling parts Similarly high level expression in seedling leaves and adult leaves cannot be for senescence related carbon recovery We concur with recent proposals that the major role of PEPCK in green tissues is decarboxylation of OAA during C4 photosynthesis in maize Maize leaves have PEPCK activity equal to 45 of the activity levels of a pure PEPCK type C4 plant Panicum maximum 34 Furthermore the enzyme activity was localized in bundle sheath cells where CO 2 is released from OAA for refixation in the Calvin cycle 38 The cDNA was cloned from libraries enriched for maize bundle sheath cells 26 In addition to PEPCK two additional genes for key enzymes of the PEPCK pathway were expressed coordinately alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase Previously the proteins were undetected by western analysis in purified maize bundle sheath cells using antibodies against Panicum maximum aspartate aminotransferase and Cucumis sativus alanine aminotransferase Detection failure could reflect weak antibody cross reactivity or enzyme degradation during bundle sheath cell isolation 38 By EST sequencing and microarray hybridizations all three PEPCK C4 pathway specific genes are expressed similarly to the NADP ME pathway genes We therefore propose that the PEPCK type C4 pathway is active in addition to the NADP ME type C4 pathway for CO 2 fixation in maize leaf blades Figure 5 Extensive hybridization overlap by diverse organs The UniGene microarray contained 5 376 elements On this microarray most genes hybridized to RNA from diverse organ samples and very few genes hybridized to RNA from just one sample According to the array hybridization results over 60 of the genes produced similar signal ratios log 2 0 5 between the reference and each of 13 samples examined Thus most transcript types appear to be present at near equivalent levels in many organs of the plant The interpretation of organ differences reported here reflects results based on a subset 17 of the current tentative unique genes defined by maize EST collections many of the EST elements queried are likely to be moderately expressed genes However microarray hybridization result is consistent with DNA RNA reassociation kinetic studies using multiple organs of tobacco plants 39 About 40 of tobacco genes were expressed in all organs examined leaf petal anther ovary root stem and 10 40 of the genes were tissue or organ specific by the criterion of RNA complexity The apparent low number of tissue or organ specific genes observed in maize is also consistent with other microarray studies indicating that only around 25 of Arabidopsis genes displayed significant 2 fold difference in three organ comparisons seed root and leaf 40 or root leaf and flower 11 Similarly only 24 of tested genes were distinguishable at three stages of strawberry ripening 6 Studies of the same organ from different treatment regimes such as dark grown and light grown seedlings of Arabidopsis 10 showed only a 16 difference During a more complete study of the circadian cycle only 2 of genes examined showed differential expression with a circadian rhythm 41 From the data available it appears that plant organs differentially express only a small subset of unique genes and that physiological perturbations result in induction or repression of an even smaller number Why do so many genes appear to be expressed in diverse plant organs including those of maize Some housekeeping genes are constitutively expressed in similar amounts in all organs to insure the maintenance of basic cellular processes Differential expressions might be cell type dependent such differences might not be detected in this study because most tissues were mixtures of multiple cell types In a gene expression study during Poplar wood development 40 genes were differentially expressed in different development zones within the vascular meristem 42 Some genes may be expressed at similar RNA levels but protein levels are controlled post transcriptionally On microarrays the correspondence between individual gene expression and hybridization signal is not exact Cross hybridization among similar sequences is a major complication in microarrays fabricated with cDNAs Substantial cross hybridization has been reported among sequences showing 85 similarity over 30 nucleotides 31 Cross hybridization between related genes will be a profound problem in the analysis of gene expression patterns in plants About 70 of genes are duplicated in A thaliana through both chromosome and local duplications 2 43 Maize has undergone an allo tetraploid chromosome duplication event within the past 11 4 million years preceded by other genome wide duplications 44 45 In the available studies however there are many examples of maize duplicated genes expressed in different organs 46 For example two duplicated transcription factor genes p1 p2 regulating pholaphene pigment synthesis are expressed fairly exclusively in two sets of organs p1 and p2 arose following a local gene duplication and insertion of multiple retroelements between p1 and p2 Subsequently p1 acquired a new regulatory sequence 5 of the gene probably explaining its new expression pattern 47 There are many retroelements and DNA transposons flanking maize genes and they may contribute to the rapid divergence of transcriptional regulation 48 Another example comes from duplicated chalcone synthase genes C2 Whp They share over 94 sequence similarity but are differentially expressed 46 It is also evident that some duplicated genes are expressed redundantly at the same time in the same organ For example five copies of cellulose synthase genes 30 and five copies of eEF1 genes 49 are coexpressed in diverse organs Redundant expression among duplicated genes Sequence comparisons among TUGs assembled within individual EST sequencing projects 614 4DR and 606 IME provide anecdotal information about the expression modes of duplicated genes TUGs sharing 90 sequence similarity over 100 nucleotides were identified by BLAST 17 Within library 606 immature ear 32 963 3 032 of the TUGs are similar at this criterion and 33 1290 3 879 of the TUGs defined within library 614 seedling root appear to be duplicated genes When TUGs assembled from libraries 606 and 614 are compared to each other 20 appear to be duplicated The sequence comparisons among TUGs probably underestimate the number of duplicated genes because sequence data are incomplete Comparisons of full length cDNA sequences of each gene would increase the fractions of gene families both within and between these two libraries Because microarray hybridization conditions cannot resolve the precise expression patterns of gene 90 similar the true fraction of constitutively expressed genes cannot be calculated An important question is what fraction of closely related duplicated genes are expressed differentially during the maize life cycle For the moderately expressed class of genes discovered by EST sequencing of specific developmental stages it is striking that so many gene families are expressed in all 13 samples examined here Functional redundancy among individual genes within a gene family would produce no detectable phenotype until all functionally redundant genes are mutated see examples in 1 Yet mutations in individual maize genes within a large gene family can produce a visible phenotype This evidence indicates that functional specialization has occurred By RNA blot hybridizations it is often observed that the relative amount of transcripts varies among individual genes within a family suggesting that promoter divergence produces quantitative differences 30 49 In some cases mutation that eliminates expression from one gene family member may be compensated by higher expression of other members even if there is no visible phenotype a molecular phenotype is predicted cDNA microarrays are not sensitive enough to detect minor changes of expression patterns or differential expression of recently duplicated genes with the current hybridization condition 65 C hybridization and 55 C washing Oligo probes appear to be a good alternative for analysis of individual gene expression profiles either in conjunction with PCR products or by themselves Oligo probes can be designed to represent individual genes by exploiting even small polymorphisms Our results show that suitable hybridization and washing conditions can be used for the analysis of PCR and oligo probes on the same microarray slide Materials and methods Sample organs The maize strain in this study has the genetic background K55 75 W23 20 Robertson s Mutator 5 Seedlings were grown under 100 E m

taken at 8 days or 14 days after planting Field grown plants were the source of most organ samples The same genotype was planted in mid June at the Stanford University Plant Growth Facility Three immature ears 3 5 cm were harvested after the tips of the husks had emerged from a leaf sheath silks were excluded from immature ears Husks were collected from the same ear The two outermost husk layers were excluded and all other inside layers were collected Mature but unpollinated silks were harvested from two ears the ears had been shoot bagged to prevent pollen contamination on the silks Adult leaf blades were taken from fully expanded leaves cDNA probe preparation cDNA clones were from three non normalized cDNA libraries a mixture of adult tissue projects 707 and 945 W23 inbred line with active Mutator transposons 4 day old roots project 614 W23 inbred line and immature ears project 606 Oh43 inbred line The 5 376 cDNA clones chosen represent approximately 17 of the tentative unique genes in the April 2002 EST assembly 13 They were designated as UniGene1 members after EST assembly of 73 000 available ESTs representing around 17 000 TUGs in September 2000 A clone for each TUG was selected on the basis of EST sequence length during UniGene1 consolidation In many cases ESTs defining particular TUGs were recovered from multiple libraries Clone identities were verified in UniGene1 by resequencing for approximately 50 of the clones to confirm well positions in the consolidation plates PCR amplifications of cDNA inserts were carried out at annealing temperatures of 50 C 614 and 606 libraries or 60 C 707 library in a 25 l volume in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 Applied Biosystems Foster City CA thermocycler for 35 cycles with a 2 min extension time The reaction cocktail contained 1 ng EST plasmid DNA 1 7 mM MgCl 2 1x reaction buffer 50 mM Tris pH 8 5 20 mM KCl and 0 1 units of Taq polymerase GibcoBRL Gaithersburg MD PCR amplified products were purified with Gene Clean kits BIO101 Carlsbad CA and eluted in 20 l water Samples of 3 l were loaded onto a 1 agarose gel and electrophoresed to measure product size and yield Of the 5 376 ESTs 197 produced multiple bands or smeared products and were excluded from the analyses Samples of 10 l were transferred to a 384 well plate and dried completely the pellet was dissolved before printing in 5 l of 150 mM phosphate pH 7 0 buffer to yield approximately 300 ng l DNA concentration Probes were printed on 3D link slides followed by coupling and processing as recommended by the manufacturer SurModics Eden Prairie MN Oligo probe preparation A minimum of one oligo was synthesized within each exon intron and at exon intron and exon1 exon2 junction regions from 17 selected maize genes In most cases two probes were synthesized in each exon and intron Oligo design was based on double stranded complete gene sequence available from GenBank Oligos were synthesized using phosphoramidite chemistry on an automated oligo nucleotide synthesizer at the Stanford Genome Technology Center 50 Oligos were synthesized from the 3 to 5 direction and the 5 end of each oligo was modified by addition of a C6 amide group A total 184 oligos of 45 nucleotides were synthesized from the selected 17 genes In addition 96 oligos of 40 nucleotides and 96 oligos of 30 nucleotides were synthesized from 45 different genes for comparison of their hybridization behavior to PCR probes short oligos were also prepared for the 17 genes for which the 45 nucleotides oligos were designed The calculated T m of exon probes ranged from 92 109 C while the T m of intron and intron exon junction probes ranged from 89 95 C Synthesized oligos were dissolved in 150 mM phosphate buffer pH 8 5 at 40 m Multiple 45 nucleotide oligo probes for 17 genes were printed on the same arrays as the cDNA probes Mean signal intensities were calculated from each of 10 genes represented by these 45 mers that showed consistent hybridization in all organ comparisons They were used to examine the consistency of hybridization as positive control elements and they were included in the cluster analyses RNA purification labeling and hybridization Total RNA was extracted from 13 samples using the Trizol method GibcoBRL mRNA was further purified from total RNA with Oligotex mini columns Qiagen Valencia CA mRNA quantity and quality were examined by UV absorption at 260 and 280 nm RNA quality was also examined by agarose gel electrophoresis to monitor loss of ribosomal RNA after mRNA purification About 2 g of poly A RNA was used to synthesize fluorescently labeled cDNA targets The reaction cocktail contained 2 g poly A RNA 1x reaction buffer 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8 75 mM KCl 3 mM MgCL 2 50 M dNTP 10 mM DTT 1 g oligo dT 3 g random hexamer and 400 units Superscript II GibcoBRL Hybridization was performed as described at 51 Variations included hybridization at temperatures between 61 65 C and an initial washing at 55 C mRNA from 4 day old shoots with coleoptiles was labeled with Cy3 dUTP which served as the common reference in all pairs of hybridization for the cluster analyses with Cy5 dUTP labeled samples from other stages Microarray slides were scanned with an Axon400 scanner Axon Instrument Union City CA Signal was initially normalized during the image scanning process to adjust the average ratios between two channels Grids were generated and adjusted automatically then refined manually to identify the microarray elements Those probes whose signal intensity subtracted by background was lower than 300 in either channel or less than 1 500 in the sum of both channels were excluded from further analyses Signal ratios for each probe element on each slide were calculated using the mean intensity of pixels subtracted by median background for each channel Array results are deposited at a public gene expression database Gene Expression Omnibus 52 and their accession numbers are GPL12 for the platform and GSM57 GSM80 for 24 samples Hierarchical clustering Hierarchical clustering of the data was performed using the computer program Cluster 32 The output was visualized using the program TreeView available at 53 Cluster analyses were carried out before and after a secondary normalization process to make the sum of the squares 1 0 in each row and column Although the results were very similar we prefer the results from the unnormalized data for three reasons First the reference sample is identical in all hybridizations Second unnormalized data produced organ relationships consistent with organ identities and the relationships inferred from normalized data Third the normalization could compound variation by combining an uncertainty from a computation method on top of the variations from hybridization RNA blot hybridization A 15 g sample of total RNA was loaded onto a glyoxal gel as described in 54 Hybridization probes for RNA blots were prepared by the random primer labeling method to incorporate 32P Blots were analyzed on a Phosphorlmager Molecular Dynamics Sunnyvale CA Additional data files A listof genes differentially expressed between 4 day old roots and immature
