 War and Pieces No movie in the last decade has succeeded in psyching out critics and audiences as fully as the powerful rambling war epic The Thin Red Line Terrence Malick s return to cinema after 20 years I ve sat through it twice and am still trying to sort out my responses which run from awe to mockery and back Like Saving Private Ryan the picture wallops you in the gut with brilliant splattery battle montages and Goyaesque images of hell on earth But Malick a certified intellectual and the Pynchonesque figure who directed Badlands and Days of Heaven in the 1970s and then disappeared is in a different philosophical universe from Steven Spielberg Post carnage his sundry characters philosophize about their experiences in drowsy runic voice overs that come at you like slow bean balls Why does nature vie with itself Is there an avenging power in nature not one power but two Or This great evil Where s it come from What seed what root did it grow from Who s doin this Who s killin us robbin us of life and light First you get walloped with viscera then you get beaned by blather Those existential speculations don t derive from the screenplay s source an archetypal but otherwise down to earth 1962 novel by James Jones who also wrote From Here to Eternity about the American invasion of the South Pacific island of Guadalcanal They re central to Malick s vision of the story however and not specious In the combat genre the phrase war is hell usually means nothing more than that it s a bummer to lose a limb or two or to see your buddy get his head blown off A true work of art owes us more than literal horrors and Malick obliges by making his theater of war the setting for nothing less than a meditation on the existence of God He tells the story solemnly in three parts with a big deal cast Sean Penn Nick Nolte John Cusack and a few other major stars John Travolta Woody Harrelson George Clooney dropping by for cameos After an Edenic prelude in which a boyishly idealistic absent without leave soldier Pvt Witt Jim Caviezel swims with native youths to the accompaniment of a heavenly children s choir the first part sees the arrival of the Allied forces on the island introduces the principal characters none of whom amounts to a genuine protagonist and lays out the movie s geographical and philosophical terrain The centerpiece the fighting goes on for over an hour and features the most frantic and harrowing sequences chiefly the company s initially unsuccessful frontal assault on a Japanese hilltop bunker The coda lasts nearly 40 minutes and is mostly talk and cleanup the rhythms growing more relaxed until a final incongruous spasm of violence whereupon the surviving soldiers pack their gear and motor off to another South Pacific battle In the final shot a twisted tree grows on the waterline of the beach the cycle of life beginning anew The Thin Red Line has a curious sound scape as the noise of battle frequently recedes to make room for interior monologues and Hans Zimmer s bump bump minimalist New Age music Pvt Bell Ben Chaplin talks to his curvy redheaded wife viewed in deliriously sensual flashbacks Love Where does it come from Who lit this flame in us Lt Col Tall Nolte a borderline lunatic passed over one too many times for promotion and itching to win a battle no matter what the human cost worries groggily about how his men perceive him The dreamer Witt poses folksy questions about whether we re all a part of one big soul If the movie has a spine it s his off and on dialogue with Sgt Welsh Penn who s increasingly irritated by the private s beatific almost Billy Budd like optimism Says Welsh In this world a man himself is nothin and there ain t no world but this one Replies Witt high cheekbones glinting I seen another world At first it seems as if Witt will indeed be Billy Budd to Welsh s vindictive Claggart But if Witt is ultimately an ethereal martyr Welsh turns out to be a Bogart like romantic who can t stop feeling pain in the face of an absent God He speaks the movie s epitaph Darkness and light strife and love Are they the workings of one mind the feature of the same face O my soul let me be in you now Look out through my eyes Look out at the things you made all things shining Malick puts a lot of shining things on the screen soldiers natives parrots bats rodents visions of Eden by way of National Geographic and of the Fall by way of Alpo Malick s conception of consciousness distributes it among the animate and inanimate alike almost every object is held up for rapturous contemplation I could cite hundreds of images A soldier in a rocking boat hovers over a letter he s writing which is crammed from top to bottom and side to side with script You don t know the man but you can feel in an instant his need to cram everything in A small white bearded Melanesian man strolls nonchalantly past a platoon of tensely trudging grunts who can t believe they re encountering this instead of a hail of Japanese bullets Two shots bring down the first pair of soldiers to advance on the hill a second later the sun plays mystically over the tall yellow grass that has swallowed their bodies John Toll s camera rushes in on a captured Japanese garrison One Japanese soldier shrieks another skeletal laughs and laughs a third weeps over a dying comrade The face of a Japanese soldier encased in earth speaks from the dead Are you righteous Know that I was too Whether or not these pearllike epiphanies are strung is another matter Malick throws out his overarching theme is nature two sided at war with itself in the first few minutes but for all his startling juxtapositions he never dramatizes it with anything approaching the clarity of say Brian De Palma s Casualties of War 1989 Besides the dialogue between Welsh and Witt The Thin Red Line s other organizing story involves a wrenching tug of war between Nolte s ambition crazed Tall and Capt Staros Elias Koteas who refuses an order to send his men on what will surely be a suicidal and futile assault on a bunker But matters of cause and effect don t really interest Malick Individual acts of conscience can and do save lives and heroism can win a war or a battle he acknowledges But Staros is ultimately sent packing and Malick never bothers to trace the effect of his action on the Guadalcanal operation In fact the entire battle seems to take place in a crazed void Tall quotes Homer s rosy fingered dawn and orders a meaningless bombardment to buck the men up it ll look like the Japs are catching hell Soldiers shoot at hazy figures unsure whether they re Japanese or American Men collide blow themselves in half with their own mishandled grenades stab themselves frantically with morphine needles shove cigarettes up their noses to keep the stench of the dying and the dead at bay A tiny bird mortally wounded flutters in the grass Malick is convincing at times overwhelming on the subject of chaos It s when he tries to ruminate on order that he gets gummed up retreating to one of his gaseous multiple mouthpieces Where is it that we were together Who is it that I lived with Walked with The brother The friend One mind I think I d have an easier time with Malick s metaphysical speculations if I had a sense of some concomitant geopolitical ones central to any larger musings on forces of nature as viewed through the prism of war Couldn t it be that the German and Japanese fascist orders were profoundly anti natural and that the Allies cause was part of a violent but natural correction You don t have to buy into Spielberg s Lincolnesque pieties in Saving Private Ryan to believe that there s a difference between World War II and Vietnam or for that matter World War II and the invasion of Grenada or our spats with Iraq While he was at Harvard Malick might have peeled himself off the lap of his pointy headed mentor Stanley Cavell the philosopher and film theorist and checked out a few of Michael Waltzer s lectures on just and unjust wars Maybe then he d view Guadalcanal not in an absurdist vacuum the soldiers come they kill and are killed they leave but in the larger context of a war that was among the most rational in its aims if not its methods fought in the last several centuries For all his visionary filmmaking Malick s Zen neutrality sometimes seems like a cultivated and pretentious brand of fatuousness John Travolta s empty nightclub impersonation of Bill Clinton in Primary Colors 1998 had one positive result It gave him a jump start on Jan Schlichtmann the reckless personal injury lawyer at the center of A Civil Action Travolta s Schlichtmann is much more redolent of Clinton slick and selfish and corrupt in lots of ways but basically on the side of the angels too proud and arrogant to change tactics when all is certainly lost Schlichtmann pursued and more or less blew a civil liability case against the corporate giants Beatrice and W R Grace over the allegedly carcinogenic water supply of Woburn Mass Boston writer Jonathan Harr in the book the movie is based on went beyond the poison in the Woburn wells to evoke stopping just short of libel the poison of the civil courts where platoons of overpaid corporate lawyers can drive opponents with pockets less deep and psyches less stable into bankruptcy and hysteria Director Steven Zaillian s version doesn t capture the mounting rage that one experiences while reading Harr s book or even the juicy legal machinations that Francis Ford Coppola giddily manipulated in his underrated adaptation of John Grisham s The Rainmaker 1997 But A Civil Action is a sturdy piece of work an old fashioned conversion narrative with some high tech zip Schlichtmann doesn t take this orphan case brought by the parents of several children who died of leukemia because he wants to do good but because he figures that Grace and Beatrice will fork over huge sums of money to keep the parents from testifying publicly about their children s last days He might succeed too if it weren t for Jerome Facher Robert Duvall the Beatrice lawyer who knows how to keep Schlichtmann shadowboxing while his small firm s financial resources dwindle to nothing Zaillian is at his most assured when he cuts back and forth between Facher s Harvard Law School lectures on what not to do in court and Schlichtmann s fumbling prosecution The sequence has the extra dimension of good journalism It dramatizes and comments simultaneously Plus it gives Duvall a splendid platform for impish understatement Duvall has become more fun to watch than just about anyone in movies Elsewhere Zaillian takes a more surface approach sticking to legal minutiae and rarely digging for the deeper evil As in his Searching for Bobby Fischer 1993 the outcome of every scene is predictable but how Zaillian gets from beat to beat is surprisingly fresh He also gets sterling bit performances from Sydney Pollack as the spookily sanguine Grace CEO William H Macy as Schlichtmann s rabbity accountant and Kathleen Quinlan as the mother of one of the victims Quinlan knows that when you re playing a woman who has lost a child you don t need to emote you reveal the emotion by trying not to emote To the families involved in the Woburn tragedy the real climax of this story isn t the downbeat ending of the book or the sleight of hand let s call the Environmental Protection Agency upbeat ending of the movie The climax is the publication of a book that takes the plaintiffs side and that remains on the best seller list in hardcover and paperback for years The climax is the movie starring John Travolta Beatrice and Grace made out OK legally but some of us will never use their products again without thinking about Travolta losing his shirt in the name of those wasted away little kids
