 Politics and It s Disconnects I was watching Miami TV coverage of the INS decision on the boy they called it Decision Day and man those local channels don t want to get nasty letters from any Cuban Americans I don t know if you can access any tape of this stuff but the street reporters were moaning over the kid s lost opportunities I m not the first nor will I be the last to note that family values take a backseat to the chance at some stock options in the hearts of a lot of conservatives While on the subject of as the current lingo has it disconnects today s Boston Globe has an interesting story about McCain pressing the FCC to take a speedy vote on an application by a contributor to his campaign to buy a Pittsburgh TV station Don t get me wrong I m not a fan of reform living in California where half a century of reform has turned our politics into an insider s game The one reform that might work is free TV time were not the broadcast lobby one of the strongest in Washington for proof see the Telecommunications Act of 1996 But I note with glee that conservative defenders of the status quo argue a version of the old Jesse Unruh line about being able to take a man s money to fully quote Jesse and eat his food and drink his booze and screw his women and still vote against him but when the Heritage Foundation trots out its tabulation of how countries vote in the U N General Assembly it cross refs those votes with how much money the U S gives each country in foreign aid So we should only expect votes to be well and truly bought when they re the votes of sovereign nations I ascribe DiFi s lack of opposition to two things assiduous courting of Silicon Valley where major Republican contributors have lined up behind her and more important the sad state of California s GOP Grey Davis the Democratic Governor is triangulating like a Clinton and it s giving the Reps fits Mayor Riordan is a Republican although one of those splendid reforms keeps that fact a secret from voters and he s an amiable enough guy who has used his rhetorical and organizational muscle to force some changes or at least rumors of changes at the school board But like the Texas Governor the Los Angeles Mayor is an executive office without a lot of power He couldn t be a Giuliani if he wanted to Plus we have so few trains and they don t go very far so it s easy to make them run on time Actually the school system is in bad enough shape that there s major support behind breaking up the district and the police force has a metastasizing scandal in one of its central city stations thousands of cases may have to be reopened due to revelations that yes Alan Dershowitz is right the cops do lie so aside from the weather and the economy it s not all that golden Riordan s term is up shortly though and if he can lick statewide animosity toward L A he might be the Republicans best hope for beating Davis or Boxer or Leno
