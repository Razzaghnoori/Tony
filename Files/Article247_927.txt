 Idiot Box Note from the editor With today s entry we inaugurate Culturebox s new television column by Michelle Cottle which will appear at the end of each week and cover the coming week in television We know that when it comes to TV everyone s a critic so we invite you to send your picks pans and flames to culturebox slate com We don t promise to reply to each and every one of you Also all times given are Eastern Standard Check local listings for broadcast times in your hometown With only 14 viewing days left until Christmas the yuletide spirit is approaching critical mass on pretty much every channel And navigating the rising tide of warm and fuzzy holiday programming can be harrowing In the coming week viewers will be bombarded with holiday episodes of everything from The X Files to Two Girls a Guy and a Pizza Among the most promising offerings are Fox s King of the Hill Tues 8 PM in which Hank and Peggy try to nurse a depressed neighbor through the suicide season and NBC s Just Shoot Me Tues 9 PM a take off on How the Grinch Stole Christmas narrated by Frasier star Kelsey Grammer On a darker note viewers in need of a good Christmas cry should check out ER NBC Thurs 10 PM The show is emotionally draining on a regular basis so this week s attempt by the idealistic Dr Carter Noah Wyle to perform a holiday miracle on a dying teenager is guaranteed to have you doubling up on Prozac Monday night you should probably tune in for Ally McBeal s holiday hijinks Fox 9 PM The episode itself sounds iffy Fish launches a wrongful termination suit on behalf of a major client who s been fired for claiming to have seen a unicorn but there s a kind of perverse thrill in seeing what abject humiliation will befall the show s emaciated heroine each week One recent episode found Ally wedged into a toilet in another she got her fingers stuck inside a bowling ball And during last week s holiday rerun the micro skirted minx fell into her Christmas tree and lay entangled in the branches until her roommate came in and marveled that Ally s sex life had deteriorated to the point where she was humping the Christmas tree Who knows perhaps this holiday season the beleaguered Ms McBeal will inadvertently drop her diaphragm into some Salvation Army Santa s collection basket The coming week also delivers a sleigh full of holiday movies and specials Of course there are the requisite showings of Miracle on 34th Street WB Fri 8 PM and It s a Wonderful Life NBC Sat 8 PM For those who like their merriment in one concentrated dose Fox is rebroadcasting Greatest Christmas Moments of All Time a compilation of snippets from holiday cartoons movies specials and commercials through the years Thur 8 PM And then there s NBC s 17th annual Christmas in Washington Fri 10 PM complete with a special Christmas message from President Clinton Come sit on my lap little girl Ho Ho Ho and a guided tour of the White House by none other than this month s Vogue cover model Hillary Rodham Clinton Some of the more terrifying movies and specials to avoid include the Family Channel s 1997 classic The Christmas List featuring Marla Maples Sun 8 PM USA s Ms Scrooge Wed 9 PM starring made for TV schmaltz goddess Cicely Tyson as a bah humbugging Ebenita I did not make that name up and PBS s Saturday night concert 9 PM Perry Como s Irish Christmas nuff said By far your best bet this week is a relatively new but oh so jolly holiday tradition 15 Days of 007 on TBS Dec 5 19 Connery Moore Dalton even that George Lazenby fellow they re all there Pierce Brosnan has yet to make it into the line up but he s also yet to make a decent Bond flick Seriously what could be more festive than voodoo priests poppy fields space based laser weapons germ warfare car chases boat chases ski chases and a half naked Ursula Andress This week s highlights include Diamonds are Forever Mon 8 05 PM From Russia With Love Tues 11 05 PM On Her Majesty s Secret Service Wed 11 05 PM yes Lazenby stinks but the movie itself is one of the best and it s the only one in which James gets hitched Live and Let Die Thurs 10 05 PM and Dr No Fri 11 10 PM A word of warning to those desperately seeking non holiday fare Although there s not an Xmas tree or menorah in sight steer clear of NBC s retelling of Shakespeare s The Tempest Sun 9 PM Set in the Civil War South Peter Fonda is the benevolent plantation owner Gideon Prosper whose evil brother John Glover plots to have him killed in order to take over the plantation Fonda escapes with the help of a slave who also happens to be a voodoo priestess and runs off with his daughter Miranda Katherine Hegl to live in the swamps The movie has some smashing special effects a la NBC s Merlin but it also has its share of bad acting and heavy handed dialogue We won t even go into Fonda s half baked Dixie accent All told you re better off with Bond Disclaimer Bear in mind that I ve not had the opportunity to actually preview many of the aforementioned shows and in many cases am relying on press releases written synopses and assurances from network flacks that a particular episode doesn t suck My recommendations however are made in good faith and based on the most up to date research methods Slate can afford Nonetheless I will gladly and profusely apologize for any and all bad calls Michelle Cottle
