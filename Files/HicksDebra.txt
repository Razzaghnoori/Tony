 This is Candace Walton I m interviewing Debra Hicks on November 24 1999 and she is going to tell us a story that she remembers from her childhood The story I m about to tell is about this little girl Ah she grew up in a interracial family background Um she had very big dreams of wanting to become a lawyer one day Um she was at the time there was a lot of racial tension that was going on so she felt like she wouldn t be able to make it She was kind of confused of what background she wanted to u what ethnic background she wanted to use so she decided to use her black heritage um background And so she moved to New York and she went to school there she made it through school and she did become a attorney She later was going through problems because they found out that she was a black ethnic and not white so they would she could no longer work with the firm Um they had no sufficient reason as to why they wanted to cancel didn t want her to be um the attorney Um so they told her she wasn t doing good with her cases so she decided finally she left the firm She got married and she married this uh very predominant guy who s very very well off and they moved back to their her hometown in GA So she decided that she would go and visit her grandmother who raised her and her grandmother was telling how she told her it would be hard and for her to make it once she let it known that she was an African Afro American So she decided that she would start an organization and I can t remember the name of it to where it has something to do with women s um Women s Black American Women s something and to she um let me see what else She um she um oh started this organization She started the organization and I can t remember the name of the organization and um she helped out a lot of of women that uh that were black women that were having problems being able to make it in society because of their their color or their culture background And um let s see she didn t she her grandmother passed away and she um after her grandmother passed away she moved from GA her and her husband she did have a child and um so she moved back to New York and she uh after she finished helping with this um women organization um she went back into law practice That s about all I can remember of this story I read this story and it was a very good story and um it was just meaningful and touching that how you know we as as individuals can criticize our own color because of being a little shade lighter or hair is straighter than your hair or whatever But I really enjoyed it and I got a lot of good insight points on it So it was a book that you read It actually it started out as a story that I had to do for a my senior project senior exit Oh So y all made it up We made the story up but actually the story there was story very similar um same name everything Everything was the same except our name wasn t in the copyright nowhere but ah it was a story an actual truthful story OK well thank you very much for sharing your story with me You re welcome
