 Background In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae the mitotic exit network MEN plays a pivotal role in driving cells from mitosis to G1 Identified components of the MEN include Tem1 a GTP binding protein Lte1 a putative guanine nucleotide releasing factor Nud1 a spindle pole body protein Cdc15 a protein kinase Dbf2 Mob1 a protein kinase complex Cdc5 a Polo like protein kinase and Cdc14 a protein phosphatase When cells harboring conditional lethal temperature sensitive ts mutations in any of these proteins are shifted to the restrictive temperature they uniformly arrest in late anaphase as large budded cells with segregated chromosomes fully elongated microtubule spindles and in all tested cases elevated Cdc28 Clb2 protein kinase activity Cdc28 is the major cyclin dependent kinase Cdk1 and Clb2 the major mitosis specific cyclin of budding yeast reviewed in 1 2 The protein phosphatase Cdc14 is likely to be the most downstream element in the MEN because it can act directly on cell cycle regulators to promote exit from mitosis By counteracting Cdk1 mediated phosphorylations Cdc14 activates both Hct1 Cdh1 which targets Clb2 for degradation 3 4 5 and Swi5 which turns on the transcription of Cdk1 inhibitor Sic1 6 3 Degradation of Clb2 and accumulation of Sic1 act in concert to eliminate mitotic Cdk activity which is required for exit from mitosis 7 Thus elucidating how Cdc14 is regulated holds the key to understanding how cells exit mitosis In pre anaphase cells Cdc14 is confined to the nucleolus as a subunit of the RENT complex which also contains Net1 Cfi1 and Sir2 and its phosphatase activity is inhibited by Net1 8 9 10 11 Damaged DNA and mis oriented mitotic spindles delay exit from mitosis reviewed in 12 but after errors have been rectified or bypassed Lte1 Nud1 and possibly other unidentified factors 13 promote Tem1 activation Tem1 recruits Cdc15 to the spindle pole body which in turn recruits and phosphorylates the Dbf2 Mob1 protein kinase complex thereby switching it on 2 14 15 16 17 The Tem1 signaling pathway eventually triggers disassembly of the RENT complex enabling the release of Cdc14 and a portion of Sir2 from Net1 Active Cdc14 diffuses into the nucleus and cytoplasm to extinguish mitotic Cdk activity and to promote exit from mitosis The relative position of the Polo like kinase Cdc5 in the MEN is obscure Cdc5 is required for full activation of the Dbf2 Mob1 protein kinase complex 15 16 17 and has been proposed to impinge on the MEN both upstream and downstream of Tem1 15 16 17 18 During exit from mitosis Cdc5 is required for Clb2 destruction and similar to over expression of Cdc14 3 induction of Cdc5 triggers precocious Clb2 degradation in pre anaphase cells 19 20 In addition to its role in exit from mitosis Cdc5 has other functions during mitosis in budding yeast Depletion of Cdc5 or Polo like kinase in cdc5 cells arrests a significant fraction of the cells in early anaphase with short mitotic spindles 20 21 and phosphorylation of the cohesin subunit Scc1 by Cdc5 enhances the efficiency of Scc1 cleavage by the separase Esp1 during the metaphase to anaphase transition 22 Although many proteins are known to be essential for exit from mitosis the factor that sets Cdc14 free from the nucleolus still remains elusive In this study we assess the roles of Cdc5 in disassembly of the RENT complex and exit from mitosis Results Release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in late anaphase requires Cdc5 In S cerevisiae disassembly of the RENT complex and the subsequent release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus drive cells to exit mitosis 8 9 This event is thought to require two independent signals an unknown mitosis specific signal and a signal from the mitotic exit network MEN proteins including Tem1 Cdc15 and Dbf2 8 9 The Polo like kinase Cdc5 also belongs to the MEN thus we tested whether it too is required for release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus by using indirect immunofluorescence to compare Cdc14 localization patterns in wild type and cdc5 1 cells Wild type cells with short spindles were in pre anaphase and showed focal nucleolar Cdc14 staining and those with elongated mitotic spindles were in late anaphase and showed diffused Cdc14 staining Figure 1 Rows 1 and 4 8 9 In contrast cdc5 1 cells uniformly exhibited focal Cdc14 staining whether they were grown exponentially at permissive temperature 25 C or arrested in late mitosis at nonpermissive temperature 33 C Figure 1 Rows 2 and 5 Furthermore in all including late anaphase cdc5 1 cells Cdc14 co localized with A190 a nucleolar protein Figure 1 Rows 3 and 6 suggesting that when CDC5 is compromised most or all Cdc14 fails to vacate the nucleolus in late anaphase Overexpression of Cdc5 evicts Cdc14 from the nucleolus To identify candidate proteins that directly disrupt the RENT complex we examined whether overexpression of the MEN proteins could release Cdc14 from the nucleolus We first tested Cdc5 because Cdc5 is required for Cdc14 release Figure 1 and because overexpression of Cdc5 triggers ectopic degradation of Clb2 19 20 which normally depends upon active Cdc14 3 These experiments employed a GAL CDC5 DB strain in which expression of Cdc5 DB a stabilized version of Cdc5 lacking the destruction box was driven by the inducible GAL promoter 20 Cells were arrested in G1 by factor supplemented with galactose to induce the GAL promoter and released into galactose containing medium Cdc14 was focal in almost all cells with short mitotic spindles but became diffused in a significant fraction of these cells after Cdc5 DB was induced Figure 2A A similar result was obtained if the total number of cells with diffused Cdc14 was plotted instead data not shown To address whether overexpression of Cdc5 could also force Cdc14 out of the nucleolus in cells arrested at a cell cycle stage where Cdc14 is nucleolar we arrested cells in metaphase using the microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole After the expression of Cdc5 DB was induced in nocodazole arrested cells Cdc14 diffused beyond the domain of Net1 in 49 of cells Figure 2B In contrast GAL driven overexpression of Dbf2 GST Mob1 protein kinase complex did not dislodge Cdc14 from the nucleolus data not shown Taken together these data suggest that overexpression of Cdc5 but not the putative downstream most MEN component Dbf2 Mob1 activates premature release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus Cdc5 influences the phosphorylation state of Net1 in vivo Because the overexpression studies implicated Cdc5 as a promising candidate for participating directly in disassembly of the RENT complex we evaluated further whether the phosphorylation state of Net1 was affected by Cdc5 Net1 Myc9 from a cdc14 1 culture at 37 C nonpermissive temperature was hyperphosphorylated and migrated slower in SDS PAGE 8 than that from identically treated wild type or cdc5 1 cultures Figure 3 compare Lane 4 with Lanes 1 and 2 Furthermore this hyperphosphorylation of Net1 in cdc14 1 cells was significantly reduced upon simultaneous inactivation of CDC5 Figure 3 compare Lanes 3 and 4 suggesting that Cdc5 is at least partially responsible for the phosphorylation state of Net1 in late mitosis Our analysis of Cdc5 s role in release of Cdc14 from the RENT complex revealed that Cdc5 is required for disassembly of RENT in late anaphase that Cdc5 can provoke premature disassembly of RENT in pre anaphase cells and that Cdc5 controls at least in part the phosphorylation state of Net1 during anaphase Moreover the arrest of cdc5 1 cdc5 2 cdc5 4 and cdc5 7 temperature sensitive mutants in late mitosis was potently suppressed by the TAB6 1 allele Park et al submitted which encodes a form of Cdc14 that binds weakly to Net1 and is released from Net1 during mitosis even in the absence of MEN function 23 Taken together these data suggested the hypothesis that cdc5 mutants arrest in late anaphase because inadequate Cdc5 dependent phosphorylation of Net1 results in failure to release active Cdc14 from the RENT complex Polo like kinases can disrupt the RENT complex in vitro Both Net1 and Cdc14 are extensively phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro Figure 4A To test if Cdc5 could dislodge Cdc14 from Net1 we devised a simplified in vitro release assay using GST Cdc14 and His6 T7 Net1N expressed and purified from bacteria Net1N includes the N terminal 341 amino acids of Net1 and is sufficient to bind and inhibit Cdc14 11 When GST Cdc14 His6 T7 Net1N complex anchored to anti T7 beads was treated with ATP plus increasing amounts of recombinant Cdc5 purified from insect cells both Cdc14 and Net1N were phosphorylated as indicated by their increased apparent molecular weight Furthermore Cdc14 was released from bead bound Net1N to the supernatant Figure 4A and free Cdc14 was active as a protein phosphatase data not shown suggesting that Cdc5 is sufficient to disengage active Cdc14 from Net1 The essential functions of Cdc5 can be performed by mammalian Polo like kinase Plk1 21 which led us to test if Cdc5 can also be substituted by other Polo like kinases in the release assay His6 T7 Net1N GST T7 Cdc14 complex was assembled on anti GST beads and treated with either active or N172A kinase inactive Plx1 Polo like kinase from Xenopus 24 in the presence of ATP Active but not inactive Plx1 phosphorylated both Net1N and Cdc14 and completely dislodged Net1N from bead bound Cdc14 Figure 4B Thus we conclude that like Cdc5 the protein kinase activity of Plx1 can disrupt the interaction between Net1N and Cdc14 Because recombinant Plx1 but not Cdc5 was consistently expressed at high levels in insect cells and because release assays using Plx1 and Cdc5 yielded similar results we used Plx1 in most of our release assays The Net1N Cdc14 complex is only a crude approximation of RENT because it does not contain all components of RENT such as Sir2 lacks modifications which normally occur in yeast cells and contains Net1N instead of Net1 Thus we tested whether Polo like kinases could disrupt a physiological RENT complex Myc9 Net1 and the associated RENT subunits were immunopurified from extracts of myc9 NET1 cells on 9E10 beads and treated with Plx1 plus ATP Active but not inactive Plx1 released a significant portion of Cdc14 and Sir2 from bead bound Net1 to the supernatant fraction Figure 4C In a similar experiment Cdc5 also disrupted the RENT complex data not shown Taken together these data suggest that Polo like kinases are sufficient to release Cdc14 and Sir2 from Net1 in vitro Polo like kinase abolishes Cdc14 binding activity of Net1 in vitro Polo like kinases phosphorylated and disrupted Net1N Cdc14 complex raising the question whether disassembly of the complex in vitro required phosphorylation of Net1N or Cdc14 or both To address this question we tested the binding affinity of combinations of Plx1 phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Net1N and Cdc14 Unmodified Net1N bound equally well to beads harboring phosphorylated or unphosphorylated Cdc14 Figure 5 Lanes 5 and 8 respectively To the contrary phosphorylated Net1N remained in the supernatant Figure 5 Lanes 2 and 3 and failed to bind to Cdc14 beads Figure 5 Lanes 6 and 7 Thus we surmise that Polo like kinase disassembles RENT in vitro by eliminating the Cdc14 affinity of Net1 RENT complexes comprised of Net1 phospho site mutants are resistant to disassembly by Polo like kinase but exhibit only minor phenotypes in vivo If Cdc5 disassembled the RENT complex through phosphorylating Net1 then a mutant Net1 lacking Cdc5 phosphorylation sites should bind Cdc14 even in the presence of active Cdc5 Polo like kinase To test this hypothesis we prepared Net1N phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro and mapped 12 definitive and more than 20 potential phosphorylation sites using mass spectrometry which is described in detail elsewhere 25 We constructed an extensive set of phospho site mutants of Net1N which were tested for their ability to remain bound to Cdc14 beads in the presence of Plx1 25 By successively combining individual mutations in Cdc5 phosphorylation sites we created the phosphosite mutants Net1N 7m with S30 S31 S48 S60 S64 S242 and S335 all changed to A and Net1N 19m with T16 S30 S31 S48 S60 S64 T194 T195 T196 T197 S223 S224 S228 S231 S242 S295 S301 T302 S335 all changed to A Net1N 7m contained mutations required to strongly inhibit Plx1 dependent disruption of Net1N Cdc14 complexes whereas Net1N 19m contained additional mutations without compromising the affinity of Net1N to Cdc14 25 Both of these mutant proteins when expressed in E coli and assembled with recombinant Cdc14 were found to be severely defective in releasing Cdc14 upon treatment with Plx1 data not shown To evaluate the effects of the Net1 7m and Net1 19m mutants in vivo DNA fragments encoding either the wild type or the mutant NET1N alleles were subcloned into a TRP1 marked integrating plasmid to generate full length NET1 myc9 894L1 net1 7m myc9 894L2 and net1 19m myc9 894L3 plasmids respectively which were then integrated into the TRP1 locus of net1 diploid yeast cells After sporulation net1 NET1 myc9 net1 net1 7m myc9 and net1 net1 19m myc9 strains were obtained and analyzed First we compared in vivo phosphorylation states of Net1 and Net1 7m Net1 and Net1 7m from asynchronously growing cells migrated identically in an SDS polyacrylamide gel Figure 3 Lanes 1 and 5 Net1 7m from cdc14 1 cells arrested at 37 C appeared to migrate slightly faster than the corresponding Net1 Figure 3 compare Lanes 8 and 4 and the reduced mobility of Net1 7m in cdc14 cells was no longer dependent upon CDC5 compare lanes 7 and 8 Net1 19m behaved identically to Net1 7m in this assay data not shown We conclude that there is diminished Cdc5 dependent phosphorylation of Net1 7m in cdc14 cells arrested in anaphase Next we asked if the mutant RENT complex is more resistant toward Plx1 RENT complexes from net1 NET1 myc9 and net1 net1 7m myc9 cell lysates were captured on 9E10 beads and treated with increasing amounts of recombinant Plx1 plus ATP Whereas 40 of Cdc14 was released from wild type RENT complex in the presence of 0 5 l of Plx1 less than 10 of Cdc14 was released from mutant RENT complex when treated with 15 l of Plx1 Figure 6A Thus the mutant RENT is at least 30 fold more resistant to Plx1 than wild type RENT RENT complexes comprising Net1 19m yielded nearly identical results data not shown Despite the striking defects of the phosphosite mutant proteins in vitro neither net1 7m myc9 nor net1 19m myc9 cells expressed a dramatic phenotype We observed that 40 of net1 7m myc9 and net1 19m myc9 cells with long mitotic spindles showed focal i e nucleolar Cdc14 localization compared to 6 of wild type cells Figure 6B However this result indicates that the majority 60 of net1 phosphosite mutant cells released Cdc14 from the nucleolus during anaphase with normal kinetics Indeed the kinetics of cell cycle progression monitored by either elongation of the mitotic spindle or delocalization of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in the wild type and the net1 7m mutant strains were almost identical Figure 6C While this manuscript was under consideration Cdc5 was shown to be involved in promoting Cdc14 early anaphase release FEAR 26 FEAR is a transient phenomenon that depends on Cdc5 but does not depend upon other components of the MEN pathway It was reported that in early anaphase Cdc14 is transiently released from the nucleolus by the action of the FEAR pathway but quickly returns to the nucleolus unless the MEN is activated to promote sustained release of Cdc14 and subsequent exit from mitosis To evaluate whether the net1 7m and net1 19m phosphosite mutants have an impact on FEAR we analyzed Cdc14 localization in synchronous populations of dbf2 1 net1 7m dbf2 1 and net1 19m dbf2 1 cells following release from an factor block in G1 phase at 25 C to factor free medium prewarmed to 37 C nonpermissive temperature for dbf2 1 As shown in Figure 6D the percentage of cells that completely released Cdc14 during early anaphase spindle length 0 8 m was reduced by 50 in net1 7m and 25 in net1 19m cells compared with wild type cells To test for the possibility that the proteins encoded by net1 7m and net1 19m might be hypomorphic with respect to their resistance toward phosphorylation by Cdc5 i e not all Cdc5 phosphorylation sites on Net1 were mapped and mutated we evaluated whether the net1 phosphosite mutants exhibited a synthetic growth phenotype when combined with msd2 1 a mutant allele of CDC5 This experiment was based on the idea that a reduction in phosphorylation sites on Net1 coupled with a reduction in Cdc5 activity might synergize to prevent efficient release of Cdc14 during anaphase resulting in failure to exit mitosis The net1 19m but not net1 7m allele showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with msd2 1 Figure 6E The net1 19m allele also showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with dbf2 1 These observations imply that some of the residues mutated in net1 19m represent in vivo phosphorylation sites that influence the MEN dependent release of Cdc14 during anaphase Discussion Cdc5 participates in disassembly of the RENT complex during anaphase CDC5 was originally discovered as a gene essential for exit from mitosis 27 We found that Cdc5 was required to release Cdc14 from the nucleolus cdc5 1 cells in late anaphase displayed focal nucleolar Cdc14 staining whether grown at the permissive or restrictive temperature By contrast Cdc14 was released from the nucleolus in the great majority of wild type cells by late anaphase Surprisingly cdc5 1 cells grown at 25 C could exit mitosis despite persistent nucleolar localization of Cdc14 which may have been due to release of a small fraction of Cdc14 that was nevertheless sufficient to drive exit from mitosis in these cells Alternatively it is possible that complete release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in cdc5 1 cells was so brief that it escaped our detection A ramification of this observation is that indirect immunofluorescence assays based on Cdc14 localization may not correctly predict whether a cell can exit mitosis Not only was Cdc5 required for Cdc14 release but a stabilized mutant lacking the destruction box Cdc5 DB triggered inappropriate Cdc14 release in pre anaphase cells when overexpressed from the GAL1 10 promoter Ectopic release of Cdc14 might contribute to the proliferation block and Clb2 degradation caused by induction of GAL CDC5 DB 19 20 Overexpression of Cdc5 DB also altered nucleolar structure in nocodazole arrested cells Figure 2B the reason for which is not understood In contrast GAL mediated overexpression of Tem1 R Li personal communication Cdc15 28 or Dbf2 GST Mob1 RA unpublished data had little or no detectable effect on either exit from mitosis or cell proliferation suggesting that the Tem1 Cdc15 Dbf2 Mob1 branch of the MEN plays a more restricted role in promoting the exit from mitosis The observations that Cdc5 was both necessary and sufficient for Cdc14 release and that Cdc5 influenced phosphorylation state of Net1 in vivo prompted us to examine whether Cdc5 directly catalyzes disassembly of the RENT complex Indeed Cdc5 and the Xenopus polo like kinase Plx1 reduced the binding affinity between recombinant Cdc14 and Net1 by phosphorylating Net1 and dislodged both Cdc14 and Sir2 from the RENT complex in vitro Net1 mutants lacking critical Cdc5 phosphorylation sites support normal progression through mitosis If Cdc5 directly promotes disassembly of RENT in vivo by a mechanism similar to that observed in vitro then a Net1 mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by Cdc5 should not allow release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in anaphase cells To address this prediction we mapped in vitro Cdc5 phosphorylation sites in the N terminal part of Net1 which is sufficient to bind and inhibit Cdc14 11 The details of this study are described elsewhere 25 Among the thirty or so mapped sites with some being more efficiently phosphorylated than others no strict consensus sequence for Cdc5 phosphorylation could be derived However the data from this and other 22 29 studies suggest a clear preference for phenyl or aliphatic side chains F Y L I V M in the 1 position Mutating all mapped phosphorylation sites was ruled out as being uninformative because a Net1 mutant lacking 22 sites Net1 22m already suffered significantly reduced binding affinity for Cdc14 data not shown Thus we prioritized phospho sites based on their stoichiometry of phosphorylation and on homology to sites whose phosphorylation was demonstrated to be important in earlier release assays In total we tested more than 20 phospho site mutants of Net1 and identified two Net1 7m and Net1 19m that still bound Cdc14 normally but displayed a strong defect in releasing Cdc14 upon treatment with Plx1 Full length net1 7m myc9 and net1 19m myc9 alleles were constructed and expressed in net1 background Mutant RENT complexes retrieved from these cells were significantly more resistant to the Polo like kinase Plx1 in release assays Fig 6Aand data not shown However when net1 7m and net1 19m cells were evaluated by immunofluorescence the majority released Cdc14 in late anaphase and the subset that exhibited a modest delay in Cdc14 mobilization probably released enough Cdc14 to exit mitosis in a timely manner such that essentially no cell cycle progression defect was evident Fig 6C In addition Cdc14 remained nucleolar in cdc5 1 net1 net1 7m myc9 cells data not shown suggesting that the release event was still regulated properly How does Cdc5 promote disassembly of the RENT complex and exit from mitosis There are two extreme interpretations of our analysis of the Net1 7m and Net1 19m mutants First Cdc5 is not directly involved in disrupting the RENT complex and second Cdc5 directly disassembles the RENT complex via phosphorylation of Net1 but because it is not feasible to evaluate all possible 10 9 2 30 combinations of phospho site mutants or because the sites phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vivo are different from those in vitro due to the presence of factors such as Sir2 Pol I and rDNA 10 23 we missed key phosphorylation sites that would have given a more definitive phenotype when mutated A variation on this theme is that it might never be possible to construct a phosphosite mutant of Net1 that binds Cdc14 but fails to release it during anaphase if the hydroxyl groups that are phosphorylated normally form critical hydrogen bonds that tether Cdc14 to Net1 A third hypothesis that stakes middle ground between these polar extremes is that Cdc5 affects RENT stability both directly and indirectly with the former role being less significant than the latter Several lines of evidence are consistent with this view First net1 7m and net1 19m mutants exerted a modest effect on release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus in that 40 of cells with long mitotic spindles retained focal localization of Cdc14 and that both net1 phospho site mutants displayed a modest defect in Cdc14 early anaphase release FEAR 26 Second net1 19m showed a synthetic growth defect when combined with dbf2 1 or the msd2 1 allele of CDC5 Third phosphorylation site mapping of Net1 purified from arrested cdc14 1 cells WS and SC unpublished data revealed that at least one S231 of the five in vivo phosphorylation sites in the first 341 amino acids was directly phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro Nevertheless because expression of neither Net1 7m nor Net1 19m had a major impact on exit from mitosis any direct effect of Cdc5 on Net1 appears to be minor and the requirement for Cdc5 in the release of Cdc14 might arise principally from phosphorylation of other release promoting proteins If Cdc5 plays a minor role in directly disassembling RENT then how does it promote exit from mitosis Cdc15 Dbf2 and Mob1 are not properly localized to the spindle pole body in a significant fraction of cdc5 1 cells 30 31 17 and Dbf2 Mob1 protein kinase activity is diminished in cdc5 cells 15 16 17 suggesting that at least one function of Cdc5 is to generate maximally active Dbf2 Mob1 which can then trigger Cdc14 release This explanation is unlikely to account fully for Cdc5 s role in exit from mitosis however because 1 overexpression of Cdc5 but not Dbf2 Mob1 provoked ectopic release of Cdc14 from the nucleolus and 2 the Dbf2 Mob1 kinase complex is at least partially activated and is correctly localized to the spindle pole body in 50 of cdc5 cells at the nonpermissive temperature 16 17 While this manuscript was under consideration two papers presented new evidence on how Cdc5 contributes to exit from mitosis 29 26 To summarize our study and these recent findings we present a model Figure 7 that is consistent with all of the available data Upon initiation of chromosome segregation Cdc5 promotes the transient Cdc14 early anaphase release 26 Our data suggest that Cdc5 can promote FEAR by directly phosphorylating Net1 as well as other yet to be identified FEAR factors Cdc5 also helps to activate the MEN by directly phosphorylating and disabling Bfa1 29 which is thought to inhibit Tem1 by serving as a GTPase activating protein Cdc5 presumably impinges on the MEN by other means as well because Cdc5 is required for maximal Dbf2 protein kinase activity even in the absence of Bfa1 s obligate partner Bub2 18 Once activated the MEN in turn sustains the transient Cdc14 release enabled by Cdc5 and other FEAR pathway components The unique ability of overexpressed Cdc5 to expel Cdc14 from the nucleolus may thus be a consequence of Cdc5 s abilities to directly disassemble Net1 Cdc14 complexes promote FEAR and activate the MEN A complete understanding of Cdc5 s role in mitotic exit will ultimately require identification of all of its direct substrates in the MEN and FEAR pathways A word of caution on phosphosite mapping Cdc5 can phosphorylate up to 30 residues in the amino terminal domain of Net1 in vitro Remarkably only five sites in this same segment were confirmed to be phosphorylated in vivo in cdc14 cells and only one of these corresponded to a site phosphorylated by Cdc5 in vitro Whereas it is possible that Cdc5 protein kinase activity is qualitatively or quantitatively altered in cells held at the cdc14 block resulting in reduced phosphorylation of Cdc5 target sites on Net1 our data suggest that Cdc5 is a promiscuous protein kinase This raises significant concerns about the interpretation of numerous studies in the literature that report effects of Cdc5 Polo on in vitro processes without mapping and genetic confirmation of phosphorylation sites Moreover several recent studies have reported direct mapping of sites phosphorylated by Cdc5 Polo in vitro 22 29 32 but in two of these cases the authors relied exclusively on phosphoshift analysis of mutant proteins to confirm that the same sites are phosphorylated in vivo Given the significant possibility that multiply mutated proteins are not properly phosphorylated in vivo for indirect reasons or migrate aberrantly upon SDS PAGE it may be prudent to perform direct mapping experiments to confirm unambiguously the physiological significance of sites phosphorylated by Cdc5 Polo in vitro Conclusions Although Cdc5 activity 1 is necessary to free nucleolar Cdc14 in late mitosis 2 can elicit ectopic release of Cdc14 in pre anaphase cells when overproduced 3 regulates the phosphorylation state of Net1 during anaphase and 4 can disassemble native and recombinant RENT complexes in vitro by phosphorylating Net1 a combination of in vivo and in vitro phosphosite mapping and mutagenesis experiments suggest that Cdc5 mediates exit from mitosis primarily by phosphorylating targets other than Net1 The unusual promiscuity of Cdc5 Polo highlights the need to validate Cdc5 Polo in vitro phosphorylation sites by direct in vivo mapping experiments Materials and Methods Protein detection The SDS boiling method for yeast extract preparation to visualize Net1 phosphorylation
