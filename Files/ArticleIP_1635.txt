recipes are as authentic as possible She uses no alcohol or water and imports many of her ingredients from the Middle East The perfumes are available for 22 each More Archaeological Updates The Italian city of Pompeii destroyed by a volcanic eruption in A D 79 faces further destruction this time from tourism The Chicago Tribune reports that the site which attracts 2 million visitors a year suffers from extensive vandalism theft and chronic funding shortages as well as from pedestrian wear and tear Only 17 of the nearly 800 excavated villas are currently open to the public The Italian government is considering various preservation measures including corporate sponsorship of individual villas on the site Fiat the Italian automobile manufacturer is interested but scholars oppose the idea of privatizing the national heritage Archaeologists digging under the ruins of the residential palace of Roman tyrant Nero earlier this month stumbled on an astonishing find a 10 foot by 6 foot fresco faded but almost completely intact The mural appears to be an aerial view of Rome as it looked before the Great Fire of A D 64 which the megalomaniacal Nero is believed to have set himself Scratch n Sniff Doctors have developed a smell test for insanity It has long been known that the breath and body odors of patients suffering from serious mental disorders are distinctive but now researchers have developed a skin sweat test for schizophrenia and are working on a breath test The creators of the test are a group of clinicians at the Highland Psychiatric Research Group in Inverness Scotland working alongside sniff science pioneer Dr George Dodd who founded an institute for olfactory research in the 1970s It was Dodd who helped to develop the first generation of electronic noses which produce electric signals in the presence of various molecular compounds Dodd is optimistic that smell tests could become a front line diagnostic tool Eventually he says the electronic nose could diagnose patients over the telephone An Affair to Remember Presidential friend and White House sex scandal witness Vernon Jordan has chosen a sometime historian of presidential sexuality to help him write his memoirs According to the Chronicle of Higher Education Jordan s collaborator will be legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed an untenured professor at New York University s law school who swept to prominence last year with the publication of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings An American Controversy Hailed as the definitive account of Jefferson s long rumored love affair with the slave Sally Hemings Gordon Reed s book argues that historians should give credence to the story of Jefferson s mistress and their six children For Slate s take on Gordon Reed s book click here And if You Believe That Several con artist schemes have emerged in academia One scam reported in the Chronicle of Higher Education last month involves a man posing as a director of the Saudi based Islamic Development Bank or as a professor at a Saudi university He telephones American scholars and invites them to a conference in Saudi Arabia Soon the invitees are being asked to wire money to a courier claiming to be on his way to America to deliver the conference invitations This man claims that he has been robbed en route and is stranded without money or his plane ticket in an airport somewhere in Europe or the Middle East Moved by this plea for help the duped scholar promptly wires the individual a loan of as much as 3 700 After learning that one of its members had been taken in by the scheme the Middle East Studies Association posted a warning on its Web site Another scheme reported by the Chronicle last May was the case of a fast talking ex convict who convinced dozens of professors that he was the nephew of esteemed Berkeley race and sports sociologist Harry Edwards Among those fooled by the Six Degrees of Separation style setup was Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson who lost 175 Deleuze for Dodo Birds High French theory has finally conquered the children s book market In 1988 postmodernist Jean Fran ois Lyotard published Le Postmoderne expliqu aux enfants Postmodernism Explained to Children and the book became a must read for graduate students everywhere A children s book was recently published in France based on excerpts from the works of the even

Picasso and Raymond Queneau Duh me who today makes her living as a graphic designer and illustrator calls her book in French The Bird of Philosophy The title was inspired by one of Deleuze s cryptic musings Don t you think that philosophy is as pretty as a bird s name Trojan Virus The deadly Ebola virus may turn out to have a medical use according to a recent article in Science A team of virologists at the University of Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor has reportedly identified Ebola s molecular attack strategy and is hoping to exploit it to battle heart disease and cancer The virus insinuates itself into its victims bloodstreams by using a glycoprotein a protein with sugars attached to it to disable the host s immune response and blood vessels The researchers would like to affix the Ebola glycoprotein to a harmless virus carrying therapeutic drug or genetic cocktails Rain Forest Crunch Classical musicians may be contributing to the despoliation of the rain forests
