 WHAT TO DO SHOPPING Though Portugal has grown considerably more modern and cosmopolitan over the last two decades it continues to excel at traditional crafts Small shops and outdoor markets across the country feature intricate works of gold and silver handpainted ceramics and classic wool rugs Other shoppers will be pleased by the sprouting of chic fashion and jewelry boutiques in Lisbon and Porto as well as wine shops and cellars stocking Portugal s famous fortified wines Relative to other European countries many consumer goods remain somewhat cheaper in Portugal What to Buy Brass bronze and copper Candlesticks pots and pans old fashioned scales bowls and trays can be found across Portugal Cataplanas make a delightful decorative or functional souvenir The Moorish tradition of producing cooking utensils from beaten metal is maintained in the town of Loul in the Algarve Carpets and Rugs Attractive and excellently crafted hand made rugs mostly from the Alentejo region have been produced for centuries Arraiolos wool rugs are colorful and rustic looking the small town of the same name has a few dozen small dealers Ceramics Pottery and Azulejos Portugal is renowned for its colorful and hand painted glazed pottery and tiles You can buy a single blue and white tile an address plaque for your house or an entire set of plates Some shops will paint tiles to order or copy a photograph But remember that ceramics can be heavy and fragile to carry home inquire about shipping options Each region has its own distinctive style ranging from the intricately painted faience animals of Coimbra to the ubiquitous roosters of Barcelos and the black pottery of Chaves Good places to buy include the Azulejo Museum in Lisbon see page 31 and the shops along route EN 125 along the Algarve coast which sell more ceramics and pottery than anywhere else in Portugal The small town of Porches has two standout shops Olaria Algarve Porches Pottery which has revived and updated long forgotten Moorish styles and Casa Algarve Coimbra s old city is a good place to find ceramics featuring revived 17th 18th century styles typical of the area Cork Portugal is the world s leading producer of cork You ll find place mats intricate sculptures and other designs and it s as light as a feather to take home Embroidery A great many embroidered items including tablecloths and napkins

inexpensive Jewelry Filigree work a legacy of the Moors is of extremely high quality Look for silver filigree earrings and brooches often in the form of flowers or butterflies Leather You can find a very good selection of fashionable relatively inexpensive shoes and handbags Leather belts bags and shoes are very popular buys Shoes are just about as fashionable as in Spain and Italy and are cheaper Music To enjoy the sounds of Portugal back home take home a classic fado recording perhaps by Am lia Rodrigues or Carlos Paredes or a disc of ethereal Portuguese pop by the Lisbon group Madredeus Wine Portugal s wine industry produces not only excellent table wines from regions like D o Douro and Alentejo but legendary port wine which comes from the north The best places to buy are the cellars maintained by all the major producers in Vila Nova de Gaia just across the river from Porto Given wine s weight and bulk it s often best to wait until the duty free shop at the airport When Where to Shop Most shops are open at least Monday Friday 9am 1pm and 3 7pm and Saturday 9am 1pm Modern shopping malls are usually open 10am midnight or later and often on Sunday as well

depending on where you are Lisbon and Porto offer all kinds of live music theater bars and clubs and resorts along the Algarve are well stocked with bars and discos Smaller towns tend to be much quieter Fado The classic night out in Lisbon still belongs to the fado clubs casas de fado in Alfama or Bairro Alto Many offer dinner as well as drinks Fado s origins are unclear it may have developed as a form of mourning for men lost at sea or it may be a relic of the days of slavery a kind of Iberian blues Typically a fado troupe consists of a woman dressed appropriately in black accompanied by a couple of men playing acoustic guitars The music is a swell of longing regret and nostalgia You may also hear a man perform the same sort of ballad with a strong husky voice The fado is much too solemn to be danced so regional fishermen s and shepherds dances are sometimes performed to perk things up Lisbon clubs to consider include Adega Machado Rua do Norte 91 A Parreirinha da Alfama Beco do Esp rito Santa 1 A Severa Rua das G veas 51 and Senyor Vinho Rua do Meio Lapa Along the Algarve you ll also find fado nights at bars and hotels The quality of performances is unlikely to rival the clubs in Lisbon but you can still get a taste for this quintessentially Portuguese musical expression Other Live Music and Performing Arts Lisbon is home to the greatest number of opera ballet and classical concerts including the Gulbenkian Symphony Lisbon s cultural scene offers occasional opera symphony concerts ballet and recitals usually held in winter The city s opera company is highly regarded by the rest of the world and the Gulbenkian Foundation see page 33 maintains its own symphony orchestra and ballet company Porto selected European City of Culture for 2001 is certainly on the upswing featuring a wide spate of concerts and theater that will likely improve the city s offerings on a permanent basis Nightclubs Lisbon and Porto are both packed with dance clubs and bars that go late into the night and popular Algarve resorts such as Albufeira and Praia da Rocha throb to a disco beat Most other towns in Portugal while offering a reduced roster of low key bars tend to be rather quiet at night Gambling Near Lisbon the Estoril Casino is one of the biggest draws for gamblers Casinos are also found in the Algarve at Monte Gordo Vilamoura and Praia da Rocha as well as at Figuera da Foz Espinho and P voa de Varzim Popular games are baccarat craps roulette blackjack and slot machines To be admitted you must be over 21 and carry a passport SPORTS From swimming and hiking
