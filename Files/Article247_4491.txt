 Bush Knows What Regatta Means My first reaction on learning Bill Bradley s verbal SAT score 485 was Gee that s pretty low My second reaction was that this proves that the SATs at least back in the 60s really were culturally biased I ve interviewed Bradley as part of a group of reporters a couple of times he seems like a smart guy with a lively sense of Washington s absurdity If as an achiever from a small town in Missouri he scored lower than George W Bush did as an unfocused rich Connecticut Texas Maine WASP it shows how skewed the tests were in favor of rich WASPs My third reaction was Gee that s pretty low Where Are the Minutes of the Media Conspiracy When You Need Them It s been obvious that the press has doing its best to give Bradley a boost in New Hampshire Former Senator Bill Bradley was a candidate transformed today stumping with renewed vigor James Dao New York Times Reporters needed a new story line the New Gore story having been done to death Bradley Battles Back is the story they ve wanted desperately to write More important we journalists are terrified the Democratic primary campaign might actually end next Tuesday stopping all the fun and giving us half as much to cover in the next six months We signed up for a race dammit If Bradley fails to give it to us as looks likely the reaction against him by reporters will be vicious Don t expect Bradley to get the usual He Raised Important Issues campaign eulogy Who Speaks for the Paranoid Center The appearance of the New Gore suggests he may do to Bush what he s doing to Bradley methodically chew him up And it s hard to believe that if Gore wins the presidency the Democrats won t pick up at least six seats in the House So there s now the distinct possibility maybe even probability that my own chosen party will control both the House and White House It s hard not to be at least mildly alarmed by this prospect Think of all the mischief Chairman Rangel Ways and Means and his unreconstructed colleagues could make if freed from Republican constraint Goodbye welfare reform hello Urban Development Action Grants I sort of trusted Clinton for all his faults or maybe because of his faults not to give in totally to the congressional Dems most clich d instincts Even if Clinton hadn t run as a New Democrat he s self confident and slippery enough to avoid giving anybody more than he has to It s not easy to have the same confidence in Gore one reason his gratuitous gay litmus test pander was so disturbing Actual Inside Dope Where s Clinton s long awaited book on race Nowhere to be seen that s where There are still some New Democrats left in this White House
