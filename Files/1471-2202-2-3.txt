                    Introduction        HIV infection is currently the third leading cause of        death in women ages  years   and manifestations of        HIV infection show important genderdependent differences        Women frequently develop menstrual abnormalities with        amenorrhea and manifestations of AIDS occur at higher CD        counts and lower viral load as compared to men   Plasma        estradiol levels are also lower in HIVinfected women          It remains unclear if dementia associated with HIV        infection occurs more frequently in women than men A large        multicenter European study showed that women were twice as        likely to develop HIV dementia compared to men          however another study failed to confirm these differences                 Drug abuse accounts for nearly half of the HIV        infections in women in United States  however the        effect of drug abuse on incidence rate of progression or        severity of HIV dementia is not entirely clear Although no        major differences were noted in cognitive functioning        amongst HIVinfected asymptomatics with or without a        history of drug abuse   a subsequent study showed that        a history of injection drug use and presentation with        prominent psychomotor slowing was associated with more        rapid neurologic progression   Other neuropathological        studies show marked sever ity of HIV encephalitis in drug        abusers   particularly involving loss of dopaminergic        neurons   Long term methamphetamine use has also been        associated with neuronal damage as determined by magnetic        resonance spectroscopy brain imaging studies   Autopsy        studies also confirm injury to dopaminergic neurons in        cocaine as well or methamphetamine abusers           Interestingly some investigators have proposed the use of        psychostimulants in the treatment of HIV dementia          however the effects of these drugs on cerebral function in        the setting of HIV infection has not been well studied        HIV proteins gp and Tat have been implicated in the        neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia Both proteins are        released from HIV infected cells and are present in the        brains of HIV infected patients with dementia or        encephalitis   Recent studies from our laboratory have        shown that these proteins cause synergistic neurotoxicity        that involves excitatory amino acid receptors and oxidative        pathways          Estrogen deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor        in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases            and estrogen replacement may result in        improvement of cognitive function   The mechanisms by        which estrogens protect neurons is currently under intense        investigation and may involve receptormediated mechanisms        or nonreceptormediated antioxidative effects For these        reasons we assessed the combined effects of HIV proteins        and drugs of abuse methamphetamine and cocaine on neuronal        function and determined to what extent estrogen may protect        against these neurotoxic substances                    Results                  Detection of estrogen receptors and dopaminergic          neurons in human fetal brain cells          Estrogen receptors were localized in the neuronal          cultures by immunostaining and by mRNA analysis by          RTPCR We found that  cells immunostained for          estrogen receptors Estrogen receptors could be localized          in both neurons and astrocytes Figures A Band DF          The immunostaining was noted in the cytoplasm and nucleus          of these cells mRNA for estrogen receptor but not          estrogen receptor could be detected in these cultures          Figure  Dopaminergic neurons were detected by          immunostaining for dopamine and dopamine transporter          which could be colocalized in nearly  neurons Table           Figures AC as well as dopamine receptors DA           cells and D  cells Figures E and F Estrogen          receptor colocalized with cells staining for dopamine          Figure A as well as DA and D receptor containing          neurons Figures Eand F                          Blocking of neurotoxicity of supernatants from HIV          infected monocytes with antisera to gp and Tat          Cell culture supernatants from HIV infected monocytic          cells were collected periodically and analyzed for their          neurotoxic potential Maximum neurotoxicity was noted at          two weeks post infection Figure A Complete          obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted when the          supernatants were immunoabsorbed against antisera to          gp and Tat Figure B However when immunoabsorbed          against each of the antisera alone the effect on          neurotoxicity of the culture supernatants was not          significant not shown                          Neurotoxicity of HIV proteins with methamphetamine          or cocaine          To determine the synergistic neurotoxic properties of          the viral proteins and drugs of abuse we initially          conducted time and dose response curves for each compound          individually and then in combination of one another We          determined that dosages for causing neuronal cell death          or changes in mitochondrial potential paralleled one          another however changes in mitochondrial potential could          be seen as early as  hours Figure  significant          cell death occurred at  hrs post treatment No          significant toxicity was noted with Tat  nM gp           pM or Tat  nM  gp  pM Figure           To determine the specificity of Tat action we used a          two Tat deletion mutants Tat and Tat No          changes in neuronal cell death were noted at maximal          concentrations of Tat tested  nM and partial          obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted with Tat          Figure  These observations are consistent with our          previous experience with synthetic Tat peptides          demonstrating that Tat contains the neurotoxic          epitope   To determine the specificity of gp          action we used a nonspecific glycoprotein HS          glycoprotein No neurotoxicity was detected at the          highest concentrations tested  M          Similarly no significant neurotoxicity was noted with          methamphetamine  M Figure A In addition all          concentrations of cocaine tested were nontoxic by these          assays The maximal concentration tested was  uM  nM          Tat   pM gp with cocaine  or  M or          methamphetamine  or  M produced significant P            neuronal cell death Figure Aand B and          decreases in mitochondrial potential in each case Figure          C When  nM Tat was combined with either  pM gp           M methamphetamine or  M cocaine significant          decreases in mitochondrial potential P   were          observed demonstrating a synergistic neurotoxic response          between the viral proteins and drugs of abuse The          synergism for both methamphetamine and cocaine showed a          steep dose response suggesting an all or none          phenomenon Figure                           Protection against HIV proteininduced          mitochondrial toxicity by estradiol          We determined the ability of estradiol to protect          against the synergistic neurotoxicity induced by the          viral proteins alone or in combination with cocaine or          methamphetamine Nearly complete attenuation of neuronal          cell death induced by Tatgp was noted in a          concentration dependent manner Figure   nM          estradiol could also protect against the combined          synergistic neurotoxicity of the viral proteins Tat           nMgp  pM with cocaine  M or methamphetamine           M Figure   nM estradiol protected against          both changes in mitochondrial membrane potential Figure          Aand B and neuronal cell death Figure C However          this toxicity of higher concentration cocaine  M          could be only partially reversed by  nM estradiol          Figure B A lower concentration of estradiol           nM could also completely reverse the changes in          mitochondrial membrane potential Figure Aand B but          not cell death Figure  To determine the mechanism of          estrogen action we pretreated the cells with either ICI            M or  M or tamoxifen  pM  nM We          tried several different combinations and concentrations          of viral proteins and methamphetamine or cocaine          Although protection with estradiol was consistently          present in each case the estrogen antagonists failed to          reverse the protective effects of estradiol on          mitochondrial membrane potential Figure Aand B          Interestingly however ICI  a prototypic          estrogen antagonist blocked the protective effect of          estradiol on neuronal cell death P   while          tamoxifen had only a partial effect that was not          significant Figure D Both ICI  and tamoxifen          alone did not produce neurotoxicity at the above          concentrations Figure D                            Discussion        Although it is clear that patients with HIV infection        may develop dementia and nonHIV infected drug abusers        develop evidence for neuronal dysfunction it is not        clearly established if patients exposed to both HIV and        drugs of abuse are at increased risk for neurological        complications In this study we show that HIV proteins may        synergize with drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine to        cause neurotoxicity These findings are supported by recent        observations suggesting that HIV infected drug abusers have        a more severe encephalitis at autopsy     and at        least in some HIV infected drug abusers an accelerated form        of HIV dementia may be observed   One possible cause        of this acceleration may be the synergistic neurotoxic        properties of HIV proteins and the drugs of abuse Our        observations also suggest that an acute exposure may be        sufficient to cause neurotoxicity The mechanism by which        these substances synergize remains elusive As demonstrated        in these studies at least in part the mechanism involves        mitochondrial dysfunction Since both gp and Tat have        been shown to cause toxicity to dopaminergic cells and        similarly methamphetamine and cocaine also cause toxicity        to dopaminergic systems we characterized the dopaminergic        cell types and receptors in our culture system We found        that only a small proportion of these cells underwent cell        death when exposed to the proteins and drugs of abuse        suggesting that there must be another susceptibility factor        that characterizes these cells which needs to be        identified        We demonstrate that HIV proteins gp and Tat are        important components in supernatants of HIV infected cells        that cause neurotoxicity This does not exclude the role of        other substances such as cytokines and other soluble        cellular products implicated in neuropathogenesis of HIV        infection In fact previous studies have shown that most of        these substances can be induced by HIV proteins in        uninfected monocytes and astrocytes   Although further        studies are necessary to determine the relative amounts and        kinetics of HIV proteins released from different HIV        infected cells previous studies have shown that both gp        and Tat are present in the brains of patients with HIV        dementia and encephalitis    Gp and Tat may also        synergize to cause neurotoxicity          Recently much attention has been given to the        neuroprotective properties of estrogens for both chronic        neurodegenerative diseases and acute insults such as        stroke In vitro studies also show that estrogens can        protect against a number of neurotoxic compounds   The        mechanisms by which estrogens protect cells can be broadly        classified into two categories receptor mediated and        nonreceptormediated effects Estrogen receptors are        widely expressed in the brain with some regional        differences   We initially demonstrated the presence        of estrogen receptors in the neuronal cultures by        immunocytochemistry and determined their subtypes by mRNA        analysis We found that estrogen receptors are localized        both in neurons and astrocytes We also found that some        dopaminergic neurons coexpressed estrogen receptors        We next determined that estradiol at concentrations        that can either be achieved physiologically or easily        obtained pharmacologically protected against the combined        insult of HIV proteins and drug abuse Protection was noted        against both cell death and mitochondrial toxicity The        protection was specific since no protection was noted with        estradiol In subsequent experiments we determined if        this protection was mediated via estrogen receptors        Estrogen receptor antagonist ICI  completely and        tamoxifen partially reversed the neuroprotective effects of        estradiol using cell death as an end point However        these compounds were unable to reverse the neuroprotective        effects of estrogen on mitochondrial potential suggesting        that the mitochondrial effects of estrogen are nonreceptor        mediated Thus the toxic effects on mitochondria and        neuronal cell survival seems to be independently regulated        However it seems that estradiol can protect against        both these effects by receptor and nonreceptor mediated        mechanisms These observations are consistent with recent        reports showing that estradiol interacts directly with        a subunit of mitochondrial FFATP synthaseATPase        required for the coupling of a proton gradient across the        F sector of the enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane to        ATP synthesis in the F sector of the enzyme   This        accounts for the antioxidant properties of estradiol        Due to its multiple sites of action its wide spectrum of        protection against multiple neurotoxic substances at easily        obtainable concentrations and the ease of administration of        estrogen this compound is a very attractive candidate for        consideration for therapeutic intervention in HIVinfected        drug abusing women Clinical trials are now necessary to        confirm these observations Caution may be necessary in the        use of estrogens in this population because estrogens have        been associated with a small but real risk of ischemic        heart disease and cerebral infarcts   Some patients        with HIV infection may have a hypercoagulable state and may        be at increased risk of developing cerebral infarcts                 We conclude that methamphetamine and cocaine may        synergize with HIV proteins to cause neurotoxicity and        resulting in increased dysfunction in HIV infected drug        users Caution should also be used in the use of other        structurally and functionally similar psychotropic drugs in        HIV infected patients Estrogen may be neuroprotective in        this population acting through receptor and nonreceptor        mediated mechanisms                    Methods                  Cultures

Recombinant Tat and gp proteins          Recombinant Tat was prepared as described previously            with minor modifications The           tat gene encoding the first           amino acids were amplified from HIV           BRU obtained from Dr Richard Gaynor          through the AIDS repository at the NIH and inserted into          an           E coli vector PinPoint Xa          Promega Two deletion mutants from this plasmid were          also prepared One by deleting the sequence encoding          amino acids  of Tat previously shown to contain the          neurotoxic epitope   Another one was prepared by          deleting the sequences  encoding the basic region of          Tat These constructs allowed the expression of the Tat          proteins as a fusion protein naturally biotinylated at          the Nterminus The biotinylated Tat proteins were          purified on a column of soft release avidin resin          cleaved from the fusion protein using factor Xa and          eluted from the column followed by desalting with a PD          column All purification steps contained dithiothreitol          to prevent oxidation of the proteins Tat proteins were           pure as determined by SDSPAGE followed by silver          staining and analysis by HPLC using a C column showed a          single symmetrical peak Western blot analysis showed          that these preparations contained both monomeric and          dimeric forms of Tat but monomeric form only for          Tat and Tat The functional activity of          Tat was confirmed using a transactivation assay in          HLT cells containing an HIV LTRCAT construct            gp from HIV           SF was obtained as a gift from Chiron          Corporation Recombinant gp was made in a chinese

gp preparations contained           pgml endotoxin as determined using a Pyrochrome          Chromogenic test kit Associates of Cape Cod Inc          Falmouth MA The Tat proteins were stored in a

the          specificity of action of the viral proteins Tat was          compared to Tat and Tat at  nM          concentration each Similarly gp  pM was          compared to a nonspecific glycoprotein HS          glycoprotein Sigma  uM Cell death in each case was          monitored by trypan blue exclusion  hours later as          described previously    Neuronal cell counts were          determined from five fields at predetermined coordinate          locations Each field was photographed coded and          counted At least  cells were counted in each field          Each experiment was conducted in triplicate wells and at          least three independent experiments were conducted with          each pharmacological agent The means and standard errors          of the mean were calculated and data were analyzed by          ANOVA with TukeyKramer posthoc comparisons To          investigate the neuroprotective properties of estrogen          the cells were incubated with estradiol Sigma at          various concentrations followed by exposure to the viral          proteins andor the drugs of abuse in Lockes buffer and          cell death monitored as described above Preincubation          with estradiol in each case was  min To          determine the mechanism of estrogen protection the          cultures were incubated with either ICI   nM          Tocris or tamoxifen  nM Sigma                          Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential          activity          To determine the effect of the viral proteins on          mitochondrial function we used a fluorescent dye JC to          measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential Once          loaded into the mitochondria JC undergoes aggregate          formation in the regions of high potential The resulting          spectral shift of the dye can be used to detect changes          in mitochondrial activity The green fluorescent JC                    tetrachlorotetraethylbenzimidazolylcabocyanine          iodine T exist as a monomer at low membrane          potential However at higher potentials JC forms red          fluorescent Jaggregates that exhibit broad spectrum          and an emission maximum at  nm Optical filters          designed for fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine were          used to separately visualize the monomer and Jaggregate          forms respectively Mitochondrial function was monitored          following treatment with the above compounds at different          concentrations and time points Briefly after experiment          treatment cells were incubated for  minutes at C in          a  CO            incubator in the presence of  M          of the JC and then washed in Lockes solution          Optical measurements were acquired with excitation at           nm and emission at  nm and  nm The levels of          fluorescence at both emission wavelengths were quantified          and ratio of measurements was assessed The pertinent          data are given as mean  SEM for mean optical          measurements The values are expressed as percent of the          mean control values  SEM and analyzed using          ANOVA
