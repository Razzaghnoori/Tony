 Introduction HIV infection is currently the third leading cause of death in women ages 25 44 years 1 and manifestations of HIV infection show important gender dependent differences Women frequently develop menstrual abnormalities with amenorrhea and manifestations of AIDS occur at higher CD4 counts and lower viral load as compared to men 2 Plasma estradiol levels are also lower in HIV infected women 3 It remains unclear if dementia associated with HIV infection occurs more frequently in women than men A large multicenter European study showed that women were twice as likely to develop HIV dementia compared to men 4 however another study failed to confirm these differences 5 Drug abuse accounts for nearly half of the HIV infections in women in United States 1 however the effect of drug abuse on incidence rate of progression or severity of HIV dementia is not entirely clear Although no major differences were noted in cognitive functioning amongst HIV infected asymptomatics with or without a history of drug abuse 6 a subsequent study showed that a history of injection drug use and presentation with prominent psychomotor slowing was associated with more rapid neurologic progression 7 Other neuropathological studies show marked sever ity of HIV encephalitis in drug abusers 8 particularly involving loss of dopaminergic neurons 9 Long term methamphetamine use has also been associated with neuronal damage as determined by magnetic resonance spectroscopy brain imaging studies 10 Autopsy studies also confirm injury to dopaminergic neurons in cocaine as well or methamphetamine abusers 11 12 Interestingly some investigators have proposed the use of psychostimulants in the treatment of HIV dementia 13 however the effects of these drugs on cerebral function in the setting of HIV infection has not been well studied HIV proteins gp120 and Tat have been implicated in the neuropathogenesis of HIV dementia Both proteins are released from HIV infected cells and are present in the brains of HIV infected patients with dementia or encephalitis 14 Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that these proteins cause synergistic neurotoxicity that involves excitatory amino acid receptors and oxidative pathways 15 Estrogen deficiency has been implicated as a risk factor in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases 16 17 18 and estrogen replacement may result in improvement of cognitive function 19 The mechanisms by which estrogens protect neurons is currently under intense investigation and may involve receptor mediated mechanisms or non receptor mediated antioxidative effects For these reasons we assessed the combined effects of HIV proteins and drugs of abuse methamphetamine and cocaine on neuronal function and determined to what extent estrogen may protect against these neurotoxic substances Results Detection of estrogen receptors and dopaminergic neurons in human fetal brain cells Estrogen receptors were localized in the neuronal cultures by immunostaining and by mRNA analysis by RT PCR We found that 5 10 cells immunostained for estrogen receptors Estrogen receptors could be localized in both neurons and astrocytes Figures 1A Band 2D F The immunostaining was noted in the cytoplasm and nucleus of these cells mRNA for estrogen receptor but not estrogen receptor could be detected in these cultures Figure 3 Dopaminergic neurons were detected by immunostaining for dopamine and dopamine transporter which could be co localized in nearly 60 neurons Table 1 Figures 2A C as well as dopamine receptors D1A 50 cells and D2 40 cells Figures 2E and 2F Estrogen receptor colocalized with cells staining for dopamine Figure 1A as well as D1A and D2 receptor containing neurons Figures 2Eand 2F Blocking of neurotoxicity of supernatants from HIV infected monocytes with antisera to gp120 and Tat Cell culture supernatants from HIV infected monocytic cells were collected periodically and analyzed for their neurotoxic potential Maximum neurotoxicity was noted at two weeks post infection Figure 4A Complete obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted when the supernatants were immunoabsorbed against antisera to gp120 and Tat Figure 4B However when immunoabsorbed against each of the antisera alone the effect on neurotoxicity of the culture supernatants was not significant not shown Neurotoxicity of HIV proteins with methamphetamine or cocaine To determine the synergistic neurotoxic properties of the viral proteins and drugs of abuse we initially conducted time and dose response curves for each compound individually and then in combination of one another We determined that dosages for causing neuronal cell death or changes in mitochondrial potential paralleled one another however changes in mitochondrial potential could be seen as early as 4 8 hours Figure 5 significant cell death occurred at 16 hrs post treatment No significant toxicity was noted with Tat 80 nM gp120 40 pM or Tat 40 nM gp120 30 pM Figure 5 To determine the specificity of Tat action we used a two Tat deletion mutants Tat 31 61 and Tat 48 56 No changes in neuronal cell death were noted at maximal concentrations of Tat 31 61 tested 500 nM and partial obliteration of neurotoxicity was noted with Tat 48 56 Figure 6 These observations are consistent with our previous experience with synthetic Tat peptides demonstrating that Tat31 61 contains the neurotoxic epitope 20 To determine the specificity of gp120 action we used a non specific glycoprotein 2 HS glycoprotein No neurotoxicity was detected at the highest concentrations tested 1 M Similarly no significant neurotoxicity was noted with methamphetamine 500 M Figure 5A In addition all concentrations of cocaine tested were non toxic by these assays The maximal concentration tested was 16 uM 40 nM Tat 30 pM gp120 with cocaine 1 6 or 16 M or methamphetamine 250 or 500 M produced significant P 0 05 neuronal cell death Figure 5Aand 5B and decreases in mitochondrial potential in each case Figure 5C When 80 nM Tat was combined with either 30 pM gp120 500 M methamphetamine or 1 6 M cocaine significant decreases in mitochondrial potential P 0 05 were observed demonstrating a synergistic neurotoxic response between the viral proteins and drugs of abuse The synergism for both methamphetamine and cocaine showed a steep dose response suggesting an all or none phenomenon Figure 5 Protection against HIV protein induced mitochondrial toxicity by 17 estradiol We determined the ability of 17 estradiol to protect against the synergistic neurotoxicity induced by the viral proteins alone or in combination with cocaine or methamphetamine Nearly complete attenuation of neuronal cell death induced by Tat gp120 was noted in a concentration dependent manner Figure 7 1 nM 17 estradiol could also protect against the combined synergistic neurotoxicity of the viral proteins Tat 40 nM gp120 30 pM with cocaine 1 6 M or methamphetamine 500 M Figure 8 1 nM 17 estradiol protected against both changes in mitochondrial membrane potential Figure 8Aand 8B and neuronal cell death Figure 8C However this toxicity of higher concentration cocaine 16 M could be only partially reversed by 1 nM 17 estradiol Figure 8B A lower concentration of 17 estradiol 0 1 nM could also completely reverse the changes in mitochondrial membrane potential Figure 8Aand 8B but not cell death Figure 7 To determine the mechanism of estrogen action we pretreated the cells with either ICI 182 780 1 M or 10 M or tamoxifen 100 pM 1 nM We tried several different combinations and concentrations of viral proteins and methamphetamine or cocaine Although protection with 17 estradiol was consistently present in each case the estrogen antagonists failed to reverse the protective effects of 17 estradiol on mitochondrial membrane potential Figure 8Aand 8B Interestingly however ICI 182 780 a prototypic estrogen antagonist blocked the protective effect of 17 estradiol on neuronal cell death P 0 05 while tamoxifen had only a partial effect that was not significant Figure 8D Both ICI 182 780 and tamoxifen alone did not produce neurotoxicity at the above concentrations Figure 8D Discussion Although it is clear that patients with HIV infection may develop dementia and non HIV infected drug abusers develop evidence for neuronal dysfunction it is not clearly established if patients exposed to both HIV and drugs of abuse are at increased risk for neurological complications In this study we show that HIV proteins may synergize with drugs such as methamphetamine and cocaine to cause neurotoxicity These findings are supported by recent observations suggesting that HIV infected drug abusers have a more severe encephalitis at autopsy 7 8 9 and at least in some HIV infected drug abusers an accelerated form of HIV dementia may be observed 21 One possible cause of this acceleration may be the synergistic neurotoxic properties of HIV proteins and the drugs of abuse Our observations also suggest that an acute exposure may be sufficient to cause neurotoxicity The mechanism by which these substances synergize remains elusive As demonstrated in these studies at least in part the mechanism involves mitochondrial dysfunction Since both gp120 and Tat have been shown to cause toxicity to dopaminergic cells and similarly methamphetamine and cocaine also cause toxicity to dopaminergic systems we characterized the dopaminergic cell types and receptors in our culture system We found that only a small proportion of these cells underwent cell death when exposed to the proteins and drugs of abuse suggesting that there must be another susceptibility factor that characterizes these cells which needs to be identified We demonstrate that HIV proteins gp120 and Tat are important components in supernatants of HIV infected cells that cause neurotoxicity This does not exclude the role of other substances such as cytokines and other soluble cellular products implicated in neuropathogenesis of HIV infection In fact previous studies have shown that most of these substances can be induced by HIV proteins in uninfected monocytes and astrocytes 14 Although further studies are necessary to determine the relative amounts and kinetics of HIV proteins released from different HIV infected cells previous studies have shown that both gp120 and Tat are present in the brains of patients with HIV dementia and encephalitis 15 22 Gp120 and Tat may also synergize to cause neurotoxicity 15 Recently much attention has been given to the neuroprotective properties of estrogens for both chronic neurodegenerative diseases and acute insults such as stroke In vitro studies also show that estrogens can protect against a number of neurotoxic compounds 23 The mechanisms by which estrogens protect cells can be broadly classified into two categories receptor mediated and non receptor mediated effects Estrogen receptors are widely expressed in the brain with some regional differences 24 We initially demonstrated the presence of estrogen receptors in the neuronal cultures by immunocytochemistry and determined their subtypes by mRNA analysis We found that estrogen receptors are localized both in neurons and astrocytes We also found that some dopaminergic neurons co expressed estrogen receptors We next determined that 17 estradiol at concentrations that can either be achieved physiologically or easily obtained pharmacologically protected against the combined insult of HIV proteins and drug abuse Protection was noted against both cell death and mitochondrial toxicity The protection was specific since no protection was noted with 17 estradiol In subsequent experiments we determined if this protection was mediated via estrogen receptors Estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182 780 completely and tamoxifen partially reversed the neuroprotective effects of 17 estradiol using cell death as an end point However these compounds were unable to reverse the neuroprotective effects of estrogen on mitochondrial potential suggesting that the mitochondrial effects of estrogen are non receptor mediated Thus the toxic effects on mitochondria and neuronal cell survival seems to be independently regulated However it seems that 17 estradiol can protect against both these effects by receptor and non receptor mediated mechanisms These observations are consistent with recent reports showing that 17 estradiol interacts directly with a subunit of mitochondrial F0F1 ATP synthase ATPase required for the coupling of a proton gradient across the F0 sector of the enzyme in the mitochondrial membrane to ATP synthesis in the F1 sector of the enzyme 25 This accounts for the antioxidant properties of 17 estradiol Due to its multiple sites of action its wide spectrum of protection against multiple neurotoxic substances at easily obtainable concentrations and the ease of administration of estrogen this compound is a very attractive candidate for consideration for therapeutic intervention in HIV infected drug abusing women Clinical trials are now necessary to confirm these observations Caution may be necessary in the use of estrogens in this population because estrogens have been associated with a small but real risk of ischemic heart disease and cerebral infarcts 26 Some patients with HIV infection may have a hypercoagulable state and may be at increased risk of developing cerebral infarcts 27 We conclude that methamphetamine and cocaine may synergize with HIV proteins to cause neurotoxicity and resulting in increased dysfunction in HIV infected drug users Caution should also be used in the use of other structurally and functionally similar psychotropic drugs in HIV infected patients Estrogen may be neuroprotective in this population acting through receptor and non receptor mediated mechanisms Methods Cultures of human brain cells Brain specimens were obtained from human fetuses of 12 14 weeks gestational age with consent from women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy and approval by the University of Kentucky Institutional Review Board Neuronal cultures were prepared as described previously 20 28

AdaM strain at an MOI of 100 The high MOI was chosen to ensure maximal production of viral proteins Culture supernatants were collected every four days by half media exchange and frozen at 80 C till used for neurotoxicity assays For immunoabsorption of viral proteins the culture supernatants were incubated for 60 min with protein A beads conjugated with polyclonal antisera to either Tat or gp120 with constant shaking at room temperature Following centrifugation the supernatants were removed and immediately used for neurotoxicity assays Recombinant Tat and gp120 proteins Recombinant Tat was prepared as described previously 33 with minor modifications The tat gene encoding the first 72 amino acids were amplified from HIV BRU obtained from Dr Richard Gaynor through the AIDS repository at the NIH and inserted into an E coli vector PinPoint Xa 2 Promega Two deletion mutants from this plasmid were also prepared One by deleting the sequence encoding amino acids 31 61 of Tat previously shown to contain the neurotoxic epitope 20 Another one was prepared by deleting the sequences 48 56 encoding the basic region of Tat These constructs allowed the expression of the Tat proteins as a fusion protein naturally biotinylated at the N terminus The biotinylated Tat proteins were purified on a column of soft release avidin resin cleaved from the fusion protein using factor Xa and eluted from the column followed by desalting with a PD10 column All purification steps contained dithiothreitol to prevent oxidation of the proteins Tat proteins were 95 pure as determined by SDS PAGE followed by silver staining and analysis by HPLC using a C4 column showed a single symmetrical peak Western blot analysis showed that these preparations contained both monomeric and dimeric forms of Tat1 72 but monomeric form only for Tat 31 61 and Tat 48 56 The functional activity of Tat1 72 was confirmed using a transactivation assay in HL3T1 cells containing an HIV 1 LTR CAT construct 33 gp120 from HIV SF2 was obtained as a gift from Chiron Corporation Recombinant gp120 was made in a chinese hamster ovary cell line and purification yielded a product that was 95 gp120 with the remainder being break down products of gp120 as determined by western blot analysis The Tat and gp120 preparations contained 1 pg ml endotoxin as determined using a Pyrochrome Chromogenic test kit Associates of Cape Cod Inc Falmouth MA The Tat proteins were stored in a lyophilized form and gp120 as a stock solution in water at 80 C in endotoxin free siliconized microfuge tubes until taken for experimentation Tat and gp120 were highly susceptible to degradation and loss of biological activity with each freeze thaw cycle Therefore single aliquots were used for each experiment with the remaining solutions discarded Neurotoxicity Assay At the time of experimental treatment the culture media was replaced with Locke s buffer containing in mM 154 NaCl 5 6 KCl 2 3 CaCl 2 1 MgCl 2 3 6 NaHCO 3 5 glucose 5 N 2 hydroxyethylpiperazine N 2 ethanesulfonic acid pH 7 2 and neurons were incubated with culture supernatants from HIV infected monocytic cells subtoxic concentrations of Tat 40 nM gp120 30 pM various concentrations of methamphetamine or cocaine or viral proteins methamphetamine and cocaine To determine the specificity of action of the viral proteins Tat1 72 was compared to Tat 31 61 and Tat 48 56 at 500 nM concentration each Similarly gp120 500 pM was compared to a non specific glycoprotein 2 HS glycoprotein Sigma 1 uM Cell death in each case was monitored by trypan blue exclusion 15 hours later as described previously 20 28 Neuronal cell counts were determined from five fields at predetermined coordinate locations Each field was photographed coded and counted At least 200 cells were counted in each field Each experiment was conducted in triplicate wells and at least three independent experiments were conducted with each pharmacological agent The means and standard errors of the mean were calculated and data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey Kramer post hoc comparisons To investigate the neuroprotective properties of estrogen the cells were incubated with 17 estradiol Sigma at various concentrations followed by exposure to the viral proteins and or the drugs of abuse in Locke s buffer and cell death monitored as described above Preincubation with 17 estradiol in each case was 5 min To determine the mechanism of estrogen protection the cultures were incubated with either ICI 182 780 100 nM Tocris or tamoxifen 10 nM Sigma Measurement of mitochondrial membrane potential activity To determine the effect of the viral proteins on mitochondrial function we used a fluorescent dye JC 1 to measure changes in mitochondrial membrane potential Once loaded into the mitochondria JC 1 undergoes aggregate formation in the regions of high potential The resulting spectral shift of the dye can be used to detect changes in mitochondrial activity The green fluorescent JC 1 5 5 6 6 tetrachloro 1 1 3 3 tetraethylbenzimidazolylcabocyanine iodine T 3168 exist as a monomer at low membrane potential However at higher potentials JC 1 forms red fluorescent J aggregates that exhibit broad spectrum and an emission maximum at 590 nm Optical filters designed for fluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine were used to separately visualize the monomer and J aggregate forms respectively Mitochondrial function was monitored following treatment with the above compounds at different concentrations and time points Briefly after experiment treatment cells were incubated for 30 minutes at 37 C in a 5 CO 2 incubator in the presence of 10 M of the JC 1 and then washed in Locke s solution Optical measurements were acquired with excitation at 485 nm and emission at 527 nm and 590 nm The levels of fluorescence at both emission wavelengths were quantified and ratio of measurements was assessed The pertinent data are given as mean S E M for mean optical measurements The values are expressed as percent of the mean control values S E M and analyzed using ANOVA
