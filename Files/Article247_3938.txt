 The Ending of the Black Underclass Part XVIII According to tabulations obtained exclusively by kausfiles from sources deep within the federal government the percentage of the African American population on welfare is at its lowest level in at least 15 years and probably its lowest level since the early 1970s This dependency rate or recipiency rate for the PC inclined was calculated by comparing the number of welfare cases with the number of adults age 15 49 in the population Here are the numbers for non Hispanic blacks Year Dependency rate 1983 9 7 1984 9 3 1985 10 4 1986 10 2 1987 9 7 1988 9 7 1989 10 2 1990 11 0 1991 11 5 1992 11 3 1993 11 1 1994 10 9 1995 10 6 1996 9 7 1997 8 4 1998 7 0 You get the picture Welfare dependency among blacks remained at a high level until 1995 the year before the welfare system was radically reformed when there was already a lot of talk of reform in the air Since then the African American dependency rate has plummeted 34 percent There s no reason to think the drop stopped in 1999 Is the black dependency rate the lowest ever Probably not for the simple reason that before the welfare explosion of the late 1960s many poor blacks were blocked or discouraged from receiving welfare It s hard to know for sure due to a change in record keeping practices there aren t strictly comparable numbers from before 1983 But a very crude back of envelope calculation suggests that the black dependency rate in 1967 was somewhere around 5 percent and that it then more than doubled to around 12 percent by 1973 when the welfare caseload stabilized That would make the current rate the lowest since the early 70s or even the late 60s Politically sensitive officials including those in the Clinton administration may not want to publicize these encouraging statistics because they also show that the black dependency rate even at 7 percent remains far higher than the white rate which is 1 1 percent But so what The black dependency rate has always been much higher than the white rate at least since the welfare explosion This is one reason why the underclass as measured by scholars such as William Julius Wilson Isabel Sawhill and Ron Mincy has been a majority black problem And that s the point The existence of a largely black welfare dependent underclass and the way it reinforces stereotypes about all blacks and poisons race relations has been America s greatest social problem What the plunging dependency rate suggests is that this problem may be on its way to being radically ameliorated if not solved A smaller portion of blacks on welfare means not only a smaller underclass it means more working and middle class role models It means there is a much greater chance that the latter two groups will eventually swamp and assimilate the former Might the drop in black dependency just record people who are being pushed off welfare into poverty It could but it almost certainly doesn t Black poverty and black child poverty have been falling Click here for more on this issue Can a favorable tipping point be far away Things seem to be finally getting better very fast Methodological fine print Welfare means Aid to Families with Dependent Children AFDC or its successor program Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF For various technical reasons it is difficult to exactly compare the number of people including children on welfare with the total African American population including children over time As noted the table above instead compares the number of African American welfare cases with the adult population Typically there is only one adult per welfare case but not always for example under some conditions two parent families qualify for welfare There may be also be one or two or more children in a single case The case numbers also include cases in which technically only a child receives welfare although typically there is also an adult in the household
