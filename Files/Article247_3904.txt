 Weekend Cocktail Chatter Welcome to hard times Oh wait that was a couple of weeks ago This week we re looking for diamonds as big as the Ritz because the Employment Cost Index came in below expectations which means that there s no wage pressure in the economy making it a good time for capital Of course the infinite regression loop was in full effect today although no one was following it too far out See if the ECI was right then that means that inflation is pretty well under control which helped lower interest rates and spur a lot of buying in the stock market But that makes most sense if the low ECI is enough to keep the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates in November If it s not even if inflation is low the stock market could be burned So were we judging the ECI s impact on inflation or on the Fed s feelings about inflation I have no idea All I know is that when I woke up this morning switched on CNBC and saw the stock market was up big I knew without being told that the ECI was lower than expected That s not a sentence that four years ago I could even have thought of let alone imagined writing And so everything s good again Until the next big number comes out On then to this week s Cocktail Chat 1 The major U S oil companies reported earnings this week and although the Wall Street Journal reported their bottom lines were helped by higher oil prices they were hurt by gasoline prices which didn t rise as fast I know there is a logic in there somewhere but if you re selling oil and gasoline then aren t you buying from yourself And if you re buying from yourself how can higher oil prices help you 2 Shares in Amazon com were pummeled Thursday after the company said it was going to be spending very heavily on marketing in the next quarter and that its losses could continue to grow A number of brokerage houses downgraded the company to near term accumulate or hold although most retained their long term buy ratings That s always a good one If you re not supposed to buy it in the short term how can you own it for the long term It s like Zeno s Paradox for investing 3 Offering a more investor congenial outlook for the future was Priceline com which said it did better than 150 million in revenue in the latest quarter Of course Priceline has the curious habit of reporting as revenue the total value of the tickets and hotel rooms that it sells on its site even though the vast majority of that revenue goes to the airlines and companies supplying the seats and rooms So Priceline s actual revenue for the quarter was oh 18 million It s a powerhouse I tell you 4 The Brazilian government announced that MCI WorldCom would be responsible for 550 million in back taxes owed by a former state owned telephone company that MCI WorldCom bought last year Brazil admitted that MCI WorldCom had been assured in writing that it would not be responsible for the back taxes but said tax authorities had re evaluated the situation I guess the original evaluation went something like this If we lie they buy the company If we tell the truth we re stuck with it I say we lie 5 Excite Home spent almost 1 billion to acquire Bluemountain com an Internet greeting card company started by former hippies does hippies always have to have former attached to it Blue Mountain has next to no revenue again it was started by former hippies but lots of visitors At this rate pretty soon you re not even going to be able to say to someone you look like a billion bucks without insulting him 6 After news broke that Coca Cola is contemplating selling its drinks in a temperature sensitive vending machine which will be able to raise prices as it gets hotter outside a Pepsi spokesman said that Coke s plans would exploit consumers who live in warm climates Yeah what s up with that whole supply and demand thing anyway Let s get a Five Year Plan on soda pricing please 7 The Employment Cost Index for the most recent quarter came in at just 0 8 percent below expectations easing investor concerns about possible inflation This is the happy situation in which we find ourselves the less everyone makes the better Well the better for stockholders at least
