 King of the Valley Jim Clark as Dennis Rodman I like that analogy of yours but I also think that in using it you ve stumbled across the biggest problem with The New New Thing See There I go again Dennis Rodman is or rather was the most colorful bizarre and interesting player in professional basketball and he was also a helluva talent You could undoubtedly write a more interesting book about Rodman than you could about say Michael Jordan who despite being the greatest player of all time is bland as toast off the court and a tougher nut to crack in any case It takes a lot of work to write about Jordan Even David Halberstam who wrote a book about Jordan s exploits during his last season couldn t wrest an interview from him But if you were to decide that Rodman was your subject and why not since he s so much more fun to write about and since he s also much more accessible than Jordan could you then say that your book was about The Man Who Single handedly Changed Professional Basketball Nobody would dare make such a claim would they Yet isn t that what Michael Lewis has done here His main character nay his only character is truly fascinating He s deeply eccentric He boils over with absurd resentments He bubbles over with interesting ideas He spends half the book building the biggest yacht in the world He must have been a ton of fun to write about And he was accessible to the author But can it truly be claimed as Lewis in fact claims that Jim Clark more than any other single person shaped the current ethos of Silicon Valley Or is it more likely that having landed his subject Lewis created a thesis to justify his choice My own suspicion is that the truth is closer to the latter than the former This is not to say that Clark isn t a big deal but there are others who are bigger deals and have done more to change the Valley than Clark The venture capitalist John Doerr springs instantly to mind In addition there are a ton of forces at play that conspired to create modern Silicon Valley My guess is that the various changes Lewis documents would have happened with or without Jim Clark Of course the biggest force was and is the Internet Here Lewis would probably point out that as the co founder of Netscape Clark played a singularly important role in making the Internet a mass market medium which is what changed everything And oh how I longed for a detailed inside history of Netscape in The New New Thing But alas it was nowhere to be found As you correctly pointed out once Clark loses interest so does Lewis But Mosaic the first browser had already been invented by Marc Andreessen Clark s co founder And as Lewis himself points out Clark s greatest contribution with Netscape the actual thing he did that made the biggest change in the way Silicon Valley works was to take it public before it was profitable Once that offering took off it was as if a light bulb went off all over the Valley YOU DIDN T HAVE TO HAVE A PROFITABLE COMPANY TO GET RICH What an insight What caused Clark to have this insight Here I m afraid is where Lewis loses me completely He says that Clark pushed for a Netscape IPO because he wanted to build a new boat and this was the only way he could think to pay for it I m sorry I just couldn t buy that one Could you Clark in fact is such a one of a kind character that he doesn t really stand in for any Silicon Valley type I can t be a venture capitalist because I m not that kind of person Clark tells Lewis at one point And I can t be a manager because I m not that kind of person All I can do is start them That s the claim Clark makes for himself But then Lewis goes on to write His role in the Valley was suddenly clear he was the author of the story He was the man with the nerve to invent the tale in which all the characters the engineers the VCs the managers the bankers agreed to play the role he assigned to them Jim Clark Maybe you could say that about J P Morgan once upon a time Or is that journalistic myth making too But that kind of claim for Clark just doesn t hold up at least not to my mind There is one way Clark is representative of the Valley In his open lust for money Clark is willing to say out loud what everyone else there thinks but doesn t dare say And Lewis captures that exquisitely There is another of those wonderful Lewis scenes in which Clark is saying that if only he can be richer than Larry Ellison who s worth 9 billion he ll stop Lewis reminds him that not long ago Clark had said he would be satisfied with 1 billion after taxes Clark just shrugs When Lewis asks him if he wants more than Bill Gates Clark laughs off the suggestion as ludicrous But a few minutes later he adds You know just for one moment I would kind of like to have the most Just for one tiny moment Beautiful I wind up thinking that to really enjoy The New New Thing you have to forget about the claim the author is making for his subject and simply revel in scenes like that one But for me at least that s awfully hard to do I keep seeing Dennis Rodman being described as Michael Jordan P S I realize that we haven t yet talked about MyCFO and I promise to get to that tommorrow In the meantime though I couldn t help noticing that just last week Clark brought on a senior guy from Charles Schwab to be the CEO Betcha they re already planning the IPO
