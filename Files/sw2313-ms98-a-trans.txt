            well how many credit cards do you have   um ive only ive got about four maybe i try to limit them because i well one i dont use them uh too much and i use my Visa just for about for about everything and i pay it all off so i try not to i just use it for free money for thirty days basically   sounds like we have no conflict we had for a while i was carrying one card and my wife was carrying a different one and since the slips all look alike uh you commingle them and then you get the statement and you try to sort them out and it and it uh it it causes more confusion about it i finally said gee this is kind of a waste of time and then when ATT came along and offered a free one uh i accepted that and weve been using that one uh the interesting thing is is that uh the amount of money you can can run up on them i dont know do you know any people that run up big big bills   im im you know im in the age group you get out of college and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out   well did um were you able to get one while youre in college   um i dont think i ever tried   just curious because i have a son thats a senior this year and hes heading off with any kind of luck but there has been ive had a couple of ads for a for for to provide a card for a college student uh what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that   um well   yeah i i you know its you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but just depends   well that that that i guess from the from the card issuer uh that since since its its in monitor the parent gets it for them that really the parent becomes the one thats responsible but its   yeah so basically if you want to take the risk   yes its whether the parent wants to take the risk   its your risk do you trust your your son   yeah to to go run up a big bill and the thing is there some  there some advantages if he got off some place and stranded i im im leaning towards doing it for for convenience   uhhuh uhhuh id say do you know have one with you know at least a thousand dollar credit limit or something   a convenience yeah and the idea that you know if he got in trouble theres some some ways of getting out and that he doesnt have to carry cash the uh i i like the idea of credit cards that uh i dont i dont i dont carry cash around and and uh i dont even carry checks around i let my wife take the checkbook and she writes the checks and i record them so its uh its uh its but its interesting that uh the people that can that can uh the amounts of money you can run up with   yeah   on on credit cards and uh i i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that they had run up he was making oh considered a modest salary for an engineer and he had run up uh more than a years salary in in various debts to and he wound up declaring bankruptcy but there it its hard to believe that youd run up twenty thirty thousand dollars of uh well it was a combination of things he had uh there were   uhhuh   there were several credit cards and then there were several other businesses but uh i i guess whats interesting have you seen the uh the the the the ads where theyre offering to extend payments on uh things like uh like the credit unions offering   the the extended loan payment for your car   yes yeah   yeah i saw that   the interesting thing about that is is that uh that that theyre encouraging you to incur more incur more debt and   well its its its business and theyre making money off that   and they make more money if you extend your loan   yeah and and its so its business so and you notice that theyre theyre only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old   yes   and so theyve already shifted the risk if they assume that car then they just have to sell it themselves and theyll recover the loan   and they know that people own a car that new unless absolutely dire circumstances or anything theyre not going to keep on if the car were older   uhhuh   the interesting thing about it is is that from a uh uh an economy standpoint or in economics i i thinks its i think its poor poor uh economics to to carry all that consumer debt at least from a tax standpoint so   yeah   its interesting that that the American public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible and this year its ten percent or so   yeah uh   its uh its interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things   what now whats ten percent we can deduct   i think ten percent yes of your of your consumer credit   i didnt know that   oh if you had a thousand dollars that means theres another hundred dollar deduction ive given you   i didnt think you could anything on a loan or   yeah its on uh yeah   i mean a mortgage i know you can   yeah on the uh theres theres theres a place for consumer debt and then you take ten percent of it on the   oh ive never itemized yet   oh okay   so maybe thats   its on its on schedule um   schedule a or   schedule a under uh well its the same place its the same place you put uh interest but but see thats what thats what makes Texas squirrelly laws that uh you cant you cant take out a a second mortgage uh like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that and so uh its fully deductible the laws are a little squirrelly but it basically comes down to its not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint   yeah   but uh anyway   yeah i try i i really do i just try to stay out of debt and i and i use my Visa for for as much as i can and i pay it all off and   sounds like youre youre very responsible very financially responsible its uh   uhhuh   thats uh therere a lot of people who really run my boss drives quite a ways to work and hes got just enormous debts and hes uh but i mean what do you say its like shucks  boss im sure sorry youve got all that debt well hes had had two kids in college and and this kind of thing and that   uhhuh   i think that the whole credit card issue i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts and but i agree with you i dont i try to limit my debts well i did buy a new house last summer that   yeah yeah and i took a five year note out on my car when i right when i got out of college and uh ill never do that again i still got a couple of years on it to go and im   its its remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car and that uh apparently thats been going on for a really long time i didnt do it i i bought a second hand car when i was the middle of my senior year   uhhuh well you you think youre starting out well until you start paying all those bills uh apartment rent and   yep miscellaneous things like food and and other things these habits you get into eating and and uh its its its amazing how it what you learn   yeah well yeah and and yeah so   well anything else good to say about credit cards   um yeah theyre theyre convenient you know thats thats a   i might just   probably one big thing about them and uh   you dont have to carry the cash and and uh and its its its certainly accepted more places than the places you know its hard to cash a check if youre out of state and   uhhuh yeah well i was used to using my credit card like at Skaggs Alpha Beta in Dallas and stuff and now im out here in Phoenix   yeah   uh   they dont allow they dont do that   they they none of these grocery stores take any credit cards so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store which is new to me you know i got to have sixty bucks on me or something   yeah huh     so uh   carry all that cash with you   that was interesting cause i always you know you didnt have to worry about carrying that much unless i knew i   well you know they they theyve started towards a little bit of the debit card have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you   yeah ive heard about them   yeah and i think thats where   thats mostly locally the banks will line up with uh   yeah ive seen a couple although the so many of the grocery stores dont do that because of the the time frame which they get paid in general that uh they ive seen checks deposited the very next day i mean cleared my account the next day my wife will write a check for groceries and you know almost well i guess its the day after uh technically its two days but they they they took that check and scurried it to the bank and the bank scurried it back to my account and you thought thered be just a little bit of float but apparently thats why the uh the uh the uh grocery stores are reluctant to do that because their volume that is quite high and they have uh the profitability of the cash flow is a big issue for them so   yeah   anyway well its good talking to you   all righty   maybe well get across well cross paths again good night   all righty take it easy
