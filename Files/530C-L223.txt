 November 19 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name The law school s 5 539 alumni form a distinguished group They are leaders in business government and community affairs During the past three years I have had witnessed significant growth in alumni commitment to the law school The generosity of our alumni is lead by the members of our Maennerchor Society Maennerchor Society members who contribute 1000 or more through their annual contributions continue to demonstrate that support can make an impact at the school State appropriations alone are not sufficient to fund all of our faculty research library acquisitions and services professional skills programs such as Moot Court and our Civil Practice and Criminal Defense Clinics or lecture programs such as the Distinguished Jurist in Residence Alumni contributions help provide the services and programs that distinguish a great law school from just a good one We continue to attract top students and consistently our graduates have the highest success rate of any law school graduates on the Indiana Bar Exam On the February and July exams for example our pass rates were 96 5 and 91 4 Having good students is only part of the picture The law school prospers due to the commitment of a dedicated faculty As our graduates are aware the faculty excels in the classroom which is where quality in law teaching can be seen felt and heard every day The need for private giving will continue to increase as we strive for a higher level of excellence Graduates of the I U School of Law Indianapolis leave with fundamental lawyering skills and a sound legal education The Maennerchor Society brings together individuals who share a desire to provide enduring and generous support for the law school I urge you to consider a significant annual gift of at least 1 000 Your gift can be made in one payment in two semi annual payments or on a quarterly basis Your annual gift to the law school is an investment in its continued excellence Sincerely Norman Lefstein Dean P S We hope not only to revive the historical memory of the Maennerchor Building which housed the school in downtown Indianapolis for many years but also to continue to build for the law school s future through the philanthropic support of our alumni and friends Thank you
