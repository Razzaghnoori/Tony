                     OK uh this is a story a little while back when uh me and uh two friends in the ninth grade got a wild hare         It was uh me a guy name Jeff Teague and Craig Barsley         And uh it was a winter night and it had just begun to snow and uh in Shelby it dont really snow that much so we were all pretty excited         And uh we were all spending the night at Craigs house and uh we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house         Well it was about  in the morning and uh Craig was scared we were going to wake his parents up or his mom up         And uh you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um we proceeded to uh go over to uh         a girls house that we knew named Mary Anne         And uh so we all snuck out of the house and uh we walked through the snow and it was real cold and we didnt really have any warm clothes on because you know we arent really used to the snow that much         And uh we had proceeded over to this uh girls house and uh she uh let us in the house when we get over there and uh we uh stayed there and watched a movie with her         And uh you know I mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um   in the morning         And uh shes her dad works uh construction so uh she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh we hurry up and get out of the house and uh were walking on the way home and uh were seeing the uh newspaper car running around throwing newspapers out         And uh I dont know who thought of it I dont know if it was me or         Jeff or Craig but uh we uh we had some cigarettes on us and we were smoking trying to be the big rebels you know and we had a lighter         And uh one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire         So uh one of us we were walking down the road picked up uh a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh this was uh metal mailbox with uh brick around it         And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame you know lit up the whole sky         And I mean we were just you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh we were walking along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox         So uh we were like Cool         and we lit it up again and uh this big old flame shot out and we all ran off         And uh as we got closer to Craigs house that we were staying at we came by uh it was a plastic mailbox and uh so we uh stuffed the newspaper in it and lit it on fire and we we werent really thinking and all the sudden the newspaper caught on fire and then the whole mailbox caught on fire         It it was plastic and it started dripping and fireballs of plastic came off         And uh you know we were all fired up         We came up to uh newspaper mailbox that was plastic and we lit that on fire we actually set a couple of those on fire and uh I mean by this time I mean you could the sun you could almost see the sun coming up so we run as fast as we can to get back to Craigs house and we sneak back into the back window and uh we go to sleep         OK we uh went to sleep and uh about an hour and a half later about  in the morning uh Craigs mom comes in to wake us up and says theres two guys that want to see us at the front door         And uh so we walked to the foyer area of the front house at the front door and uh these two old men say uh ask us uh what we were doing last night         And we were like We didnt do anything last night and Craigs mom asked us you know did we sneak out last night and we all said No no         We denied it and uh the old man said the old man asked us you know Did you I mean he said Did you or did you not sneak out and burn any mailboxes         And we just denied the whole thing you know and uh finally the old man says Well you know I wouldnt have never thought it was yall but uh seeing it was snowing last night and uh foot tracks go all the way from my mailbox to this house right here uh I dont have any choice but to believe it was yall         And uh he said Especially the fellow that was wearing these soles that say Vivran on them and uh Craig has his boots sitting by the door and looked on the bottom of them and had uh the sole had uh was written it said Vivran on the bottom of it         And he said These soles right here match right up to it         And uh we were just like Damn uh so uh we finally confessed to it and uh we told him yeah we did we were out there         Found out later that the uh one of the old men got up every morning about  and uh walked the uh around the neighborhood and he saw us uh do it actually         And uh he just followed our footprints back to the house and waited until earlier the next morning to uh come to say anything         So we thought we were being sneaky but uh found out the whole time we were being watched         And uh so after that uh the uh old man that we burned his mailbox down uh told us that uh he was going to he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox         So uh that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes uh one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground         And uh so it was uh not a very good night for us not a very good day         And uh but one of the cool things that happened was uh that morning in the paper in the write up columns with police reports and they had a little column had what we had did that night and it said they were looking for suspects but uh said but they never followed through on that the guy never pressed charges or anything like that so uh we got off easy on that                     Do you got another one                     Uh                     Do you want me to turn it off so you can think                     Uh nah I got it         uh another story uh when I uh this happened uh senior year over the summer after my graduating senior year         Uh          I live out on Moss Lake it is in Shelby North Carolina Cherryville actually uh          me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school we were best friends back then uh I invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lake         I have a jet ski and hes got one too and uh so we we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers         And uh         we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and uh we were out in the water and uh we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and uh he uh runs his jet ski up on land and we had to pull it back and put it in water         And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty uh inebriated I guess youd call it and uh we were out there just acting stupid on the jet skis         And uh at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and uh bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs but Im not feeling it then Im pretty well gone by this time         And uh its getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home and he doesnt live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and uh put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh were going to go back to his house to take it back         So uh we get it back on the trailer and we find out that uh we bent the handlebar on it         So we take it back to my house and uh we are sitting there trying to bend it back and uh so his parents dont get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever         So uh we are at the house trying to bend it back and my parents come down and they are like Are yall all right         Were like Yeah yeah were fine you know         And uh theyre like All right but they they didnt have any idea that we were uh that we were leaving and we were going to take the uh jet ski back to his house         They thought we were just going to stay at the house         So uh we get the handlebar bent back and uh we take off and um we are on the way to his house and uh I run off the road at one point         And uh the trailer the trailer doesnt hit anything but at one point it hits a mailbox and my friend asked if I was all right and I said Sure Im fine you know I had no idea what I was doing so we get to his house and uh I found out my parents had uh called over there beforehand to tell his parents to come out there and meet me and take me home when I got there         Well when I got there uh I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off and I just jetted right out all of the sudden you know his parents didnt even know we had got there and uh my friend Eric and he asked me again Are you OK to drive         and I was like Yeah sure you know         I mean I thought I was fine obviously I wasnt         But uh Im coming on the way home and not really paying that much attention and uh just got this truck about a year ago before this and uh end up not looking at the road I dont know what the heck I was doing         And uh ran my truck into a telephone pole         And I had the window open         I didnt know it was happening and uh the side view mirror glass all of the sudden I just felt this bang and I looked up and I saw I had glass on me         And I was in the truck I didnt know what was wrong         And I swerved and uh luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole and it was still going and uh I had no I mean I was just totally in shock         I didnt know what was going on         And uh   the truck and Im like I am all right         The first thing I do is I got a cell phone on me so I call uh I call a friend of mine that uh lives real close to where I hit the telephone pole is at         And I drive to her house and uh I get her to uh drive my truck the rest of the way home         And I call my parents up on the way home and tell them what happened         Um what not          Ended up taking about all my summer wages that I earned that summer to pay to fix it         One of the hardest lessons to learn
