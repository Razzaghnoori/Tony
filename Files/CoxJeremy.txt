 OK uh this is a story a little while back when uh me and uh two friends in the ninth grade got a wild hare It was uh me a guy name Jeff Teague and Craig Barsley And uh it was a winter night and it had just begun to snow and uh in Shelby it don t really snow that much so we were all pretty excited And uh we were all spending the night at Craig s house and uh we decided we wanted to sneak out of the house Well it was about 1 00 in the morning and uh Craig was scared we were going to wake his parents up or his mom up And uh you know after a little while we ended up talking him into it and uh so we all snuck out his window in his bedroom and um we proceeded to uh go over to uh a girl s house that we knew named Mary Anne And uh so we all snuck out of the house and uh we walked through the snow and it was real cold and we didn t really have any warm clothes on because you know we aren t really used to the snow that much And uh we had proceeded over to this uh girl s house and uh she uh let us in the house when we get over there and uh we uh stayed there and watched a movie with her And uh you know I mean we were trying to be quiet not to wake her parents up so you know and uh we ended up watching this movie and this movie ends up lasting until about um 4 30 5 00 in the morning And uh she s her dad works uh construction so uh she told us we had to leave because her dad gets up real early in the morning so uh we hurry up and get out of the house and uh we re walking on the way home and uh we re seeing the uh newspaper car running around throwing newspapers out And uh I don t know who thought of it I don t know if it was me or Jeff or Craig but uh we uh we had some cigarettes on us and we were smoking trying to be the big rebels you know and we had a lighter And uh one of us thought of the idea of sticking a newspaper in the mailbox and setting the mailbox and newspaper on fire So uh one of us we were walking down the road picked up uh a newspaper wadded it up and stuck it in the mailbox and uh this was uh metal mailbox with uh brick around it And we stuck it in there and we lit it and it shot into a big old flame you know lit up the whole sky And I mean we were just you know it got us real fired up you know and so uh we were walking along a little further and we saw another newspaper and uh we stuck it in the mailbox and it was another metal mailbox So uh we were like Cool and we lit it up again and uh this big old flame shot out and we all ran off And uh as we got closer to Craig s house that we were staying at we came by uh it was a plastic mailbox and uh so we uh stuffed the newspaper in it and lit it on fire and we we weren t really thinking and all the sudden the newspaper caught on fire and then the whole mailbox caught on fire It it was plastic and it started dripping and fireballs of plastic came off And uh you know we were all fired up We came up to uh newspaper mailbox that was plastic and we lit that on fire we actually set a couple of those on fire and uh I mean by this time I mean you could the sun you could almost see the sun coming up so we run as fast as we can to get back to Craig s house and we sneak back into the back window and uh we go to sleep OK we uh went to sleep and uh about an hour and a half later about 8 00 in the morning uh Craig s mom comes in to wake us up and says there s two guys that want to see us at the front door And uh so we walked to the foyer area of the front house at the front door and uh these two old men say uh ask us uh what we were doing last night And we were like We didn t do anything last night and Craig s mom asked us you know did we sneak out last night and we all said No no We denied it and uh the old man said the old man asked us you know Did you I mean he said Did you or did you not sneak out and burn any mailboxes And we just denied the whole thing you know and uh finally the old man says Well you know I wouldn t have never thought it was y all but uh seeing it was snowing last night and uh foot tracks go all the way from my mailbox to this house right here uh I don t have any choice but to believe it was y all And uh he said Especially the fellow that was wearing these soles that say Vivran on them and uh Craig has his boots sitting by the door and looked on the bottom of them and had uh the sole had uh was written it said Vivran on the bottom of it And he said These soles right here match right up to it And uh we were just like Damn uh so uh we finally confessed to it and uh we told him yeah we did we were out there Found out later that the uh one of the old men got up every morning about 5 30 and uh walked the uh around the neighborhood and he saw us uh do it actually And uh he just followed our footprints back to the house and waited until earlier the next morning to uh come to say anything So we thought we were being sneaky but uh found out the whole time we were being watched And uh so after that uh the uh old man that we burned his mailbox down uh told us that uh he was going to he would press charges unless we replaced and fixed his mailbox So uh that whole day I think we put up two newspaper mailboxes uh one complete wood frame and plastic mailbox and that was cemented in the ground And uh so it was uh not a very good night for us not a very good day And uh but one of the cool things that happened was uh that morning in the paper in the write up columns with police reports and they had a little column had what we had did that night and it said they were looking for suspects but uh said but they never followed through on that the guy never pressed charges or anything like that so uh we got off easy on that Do you got another one Uh Do you want me to turn it off so you can think Uh nah I got it uh another story uh when I uh this happened uh senior year over the summer after my graduating senior year Uh I live out on Moss Lake it is in Shelby North Carolina Cherryville actually uh me and a buddy of mine from way back in elementary school we were best friends back then uh I invited him over to my house and we were going to go out onto the lake I have a jet ski and he s got one too and uh so we we went out there and started drinking a couple of beers And uh we ended up drinking more then going out in the water and uh we were out in the water and uh we come up and we were going to get another beer off the dock and uh he uh runs his jet ski up on land and we had to pull it back and put it in water And we check it out and it is all right and by this time we are getting pretty uh inebriated I guess you d call it and uh we were out there just acting stupid on the jet skis And uh at one point in time he actually runs into me on my jet ski and uh bends the handle bars and runs up on my legs and I got a big bruise on my legs but I m not feeling it then I m pretty well gone by this time And uh it s getting late in the afternoon and he says he has to get home and he doesn t live on the lake so we load up his jet ski and uh put it on the trailer on the back of my truck and uh we re going to go back to his house to take it back So uh we get it back on the trailer and we find out that uh we bent the handlebar on it So we take it back to my house and uh we are sitting there trying to bend it back and uh so his parents don t get mad at him that he messed up his jet ski or whatever So uh we are at the house trying to bend it back and my parents come down and they are like Are y all all right We re like Yeah yeah we re fine you know And uh they re like All right but they they didn t have any idea that we were uh that we were leaving and we were going to take the uh jet ski back to his house They thought we were just going to stay at the house So uh we get the handlebar bent back and uh we take off and um we are on the way to his house and uh I run off the road at one point And uh the trailer the trailer doesn t hit anything but at one point it hits a mailbox and my friend asked if I was all right and I said Sure I m fine you know I had no idea what I was doing so we get to his house and uh I found out my parent s had uh called over there beforehand to tell his parents to come out there and meet me and take me home when I got there Well when I got there uh I just rolled in there we dropped the jet skis off and I just jetted right out all of the sudden you know his parents didn t even know we had got there and uh my friend Eric and he asked me again Are you OK to drive and I was like Yeah sure you know I mean I thought I was fine obviously I wasn t But uh I m coming on the way home and not really paying that much attention and uh just got this truck about a year ago before this and uh end up not looking at the road I don t know what the heck I was doing And uh ran my truck into a telephone pole And I had the window open I didn t know it was happening and uh the side view mirror glass all of the sudden I just felt this bang and I looked up and I saw I had glass on me And I was in the truck I didn t know what was wrong And I swerved and uh luckily enough the truck hit the front fender somehow and I bounced off the telephone pole and it was still going and uh I had no I mean I was just totally in shock I didn t know what was going on And uh the truck and I m like I am all right The first thing I do is I got a cell phone on me so I call uh I call a friend of mine that uh lives real close to where I hit the telephone pole is at And I drive to her house and uh I get her to uh drive my truck the rest of the way home And I call my parent s up on the way home and tell them what happened Um what not Ended up taking about all my summer wages that I earned that summer to pay to fix it One of the hardest lessons to learn
