 Me on Me on Garrison Keillor Note Garrison Keillor s new book Me by Jimmy Big Boy Valente as Told to Garrison Keillor was published Monday The publisher describes it as an uproarious political satire about a professional wrestler who s elected governor What have you got against Garrison Keillor Me Nothing Come on you re talking to me Me Nothing really Just one time this was years before I was a second tier public radio personality I went to see his show at the Tech College caught him out in the corridor and lied to him about how much I liked his show really he talks so slow it makes me nervous plus all that lip noise indicating introspection being released into the atmosphere and silly boy launched into how I was doing a live daily radio show from a greasy spoon and all and he looked at me and said Do you know where the bathroom is I did having just been there But I vowed on the spot that should I ever be in a position to be accosted by fans or faux fans in a hallway wanting to tell me about their life I would always have something more constructive to say Unless you really have to pee Me True But I try to emulate country music stars they may be assholes but they re great to their public Working on the asshole part Me You should talk Right So what besides that Me Nothing Well in every press interview I ve ever had that goes over 25 words two of them are Garrison and Keillor That gets to you pretty quick They all want to talk about what we have in common as if I m doing Lutheran standup I told one guy from Night Scene in Biloxi Miss that I was up to 67 Keillor Units but that was just bravado and doesn t include royalties speaking fees catalog sales ancillary rights etc Now this well timed new book should put him way ahead You could probably get two or three of me for one Garrison now And a player to be named later So it s the shadow thing Me Yeah Either he s getting bigger or the sun is setting On the other hand he s got Mark Twain between him and daylight Me That would account for the occasional white suit And he s got to get past Ring Lardner first Me True And Benchley And S J Perelman can rest in peace Me You said it Who wins a Jesse The Body vs Gary The Kitty Boutique grudge match Me My money s on Garrison as long as it stays out of the parking lot Yeah in a parking lot he s dead bent over the trunk of a Trans Am face smeared against the rear window Me Brains all over the Oakley Thermonuclear Protection decal Yeah For messing with the best Me Hooyah But if it s strictly hyperbole with the ring strung with verbal barbed wire Garrison will helicopter him on one finger so Jesse pees outside the ring Read the new book huh Me Worse I took it on vacation Fortunately I had Nabokov s short stories White Russians drinking the same Anyway Me is kind of a comic book very heavy on graphics like you used to find in Johnson and Smith catalogs and rife with bold print emphasizing nothing in particular Fairbanks White Blaze Vanderbilt Used Rambler Alcan Highway The post office The cogs simply do not mesh As a bear would say goodbye to a leg trap That s not bad I kind of like that Me Sounds like Red Green on acid So you pretty much liked the book then Me No It s pretty hard to parody a parody But it s a political satire Me Animal Farm was a political satire A Modest Proposal was a political satire What Garrison has written is a parody Look it up And why do we call him by his first name anyway What is he Saddam Anything else you liked about the book Me The guy looking at the Playboy spread The Women of NPR Now that s funny
