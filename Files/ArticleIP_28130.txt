 Let s Blame Bill The frustration of the bellicose British press at the half hearted pursuit of the war in Kosovo vented itself Wednesday in an editorial in the Times attacking President Clinton who it said has proved his absolute inadequacy as a Commander in Chief stumbling on a stage that is bigger than his talents can match and performing with hesitancy frailty and fear It added T his war will not be serious until Mr Clinton listens to the Pentagon rather than the latest opinion poll He has never countenanced a campaign plan and in the absence of one even air power has been misapplied Mr Clinton has retreated into the semantic ambiguities for which his presidency has become infamous The editorial concluded that f or Nato for European peace and for Britain the true high reckoning begins it is called failure The Daily Telegraph led its front page Wednesday with a report that both Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair were struggling to hold back a growing tide of criticism of their leadership of the Kosovo conflict Along with other papers the Telegraph reported cracks in British bipartisan support for the NATO offensive In an article in the Telegraph the Conservative Party spokesman on foreign affairs Michael Howard called for the establishment of a committee of inquiry into the war and the diplomatic failures that preceded it Howard described the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade as an act of gross incompetence He said To use outdated street maps for an operation of this kind beggars belief The liberal Guardian led Wednesday on gloom in NATO as China and Russia hardened their demands for a halt to airstrikes before they will agree to support peace moves in the United Nations Having consistently urged the use of ground forces the paper finally recognized in an editorial that the possibility of a ground attack has dwindled It said that the British and the French have been willing to do their bit but that Clinton could not muster the will or lacks the necessary political weight to commit the United States to ground action The central issue now it said is that NATO forces acting for the Kosovo Albanians must have preponderant physical power on the ground whatever the formalities of status may be The liberal Independent s front page lead spoke of an unmistakable whiff of panic and confusion in the West s councils of war There was gloom on the continent as well Le Monde of Paris led its front page Wednesday with the headline Kosovo emptied of half its population and said in an editorial that President Slobodan Milosevic knows because we have been at pains to tell him that he need not fear a land offensive and he knows the limits of the air bombardments He can at his leisure test the unity and determination of the allies it added One way or another it is always he who holds the cards On Tuesday the Greek daily Ta Nea published a leaked NATO document warning that Albania Montenegro and Macedonia are in imminent danger of economic and political collapse because of the Kosovo crisis The displacement of nearly 600 000 Kosovar refugees threatens to destabilize the entire region it said

before impeachment proceedings against the president were due to begin in the Duma provoked little surprise in that country s newspapers Wednesday Kommersant said Primakov has been under threat of dismissal for at least two months and that Sergei Stephasin Yeltsin s choice to succeed him as acting prime minister has already been offered the job at least three times Segodnya said it is understandable that Yeltsin ran out of sympathy for a man whose main political support came from Communists who have proclaimed as their basic goal the overthrow of the president Nezavisimaya Gazeta
