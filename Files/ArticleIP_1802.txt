 The Punditry Crisis I first realized something was terribly terribly wrong when a Fox News producer called me yesterday She wanted me to opine about the scandal on Sunday when the cable news channel will do a Flytrap marathon in anticipation of the president s testimony Her call was fishy for two reasons 1 I am not usually first or second or last on any TV booker s guest list and 2 she said the following to me imploringly We re really looking for something different Can you be different Well I thought to myself of course I can be different My mother always told me I was different The pursuit of wretched excess in Flytrap a pursuit in which Slate has eagerly participated is producing some unfortunate results One which I wrote about last week is the rising popularity of preposterous conspiracy theories The Punditry Crisis is another Not since the late O J era has America faced such an alarming moment Is there anything left to say The crisis is at bottom a market failure Ratings demonstrate that TV viewers never mind their protestations want to hear about Flytrap all the time The gross appetites of CNN MSNBC and Fox must be sated Crossfire must have fire Hardball must be hard Face the Nation must have someone to face But there s not enough supply to meet the demand As Aug 17 approaches Flytrap is in an information blackout The White House is silent and Starr s office has stopped leaking Every hypothesis has been hypothesized Every theory theorized Every spin spun Each tiny nugget of new information is chewed swallowed regurgitated as cud and chewed again Pundits are reduced to flogging thirdhand and fourthhand rumors Can any TV watcher endure another Jonathan Turley sermon or Lanny Davis wait and see or Laura Ingraham huff Too much demand too little supply TV producers are on a desperate futile quest for someone or something different to put on the air This crisis is not of course limited to television Those of us in the print and e media are thrashing through the same news vacuum Ireally don t know what pundits will do We have six days to fill And there s nothing warns Time s Margaret Carlson If I had even one new fact I would lock it in a vault until I could use it in a column or on television If I had even one new observation I would not breathe a word about it until I could use it One piece of real news would eat all this blather up like kudzu Not every pundit is worrying about the crisis Some Panglossian commentators claim there is no crisis at all One compares Flytrap to World War I trench battles No one is getting overrun but steady progress is being made In fact he says plenty of fascinating new details emerge every day When asked for an example of such a detail he suggests halfheartedly what Monica ate for lunch And for freshly minted Flytrap pundits such as Turley there is no crisis either This is their moment No topic is so stale that it cannot be reheated After all it gets you air time And besides say the Panglossians no matter how much Flytrap nothing is being spewed think how much worse it would be if there were no scandal at all At least it s something to talk about But should we simply relax and let the Punditry Crisis grow into a catastrophe Right thinking people can agree We should not Stuart Taylor Jr in a moment of high minded optimism proposes that pundits take advantage of the information vacuum to talk about first principles Instead of jabbing fingers over Monica s dress for example they should discuss the fundamentals of sexual harassment law I m not sure Taylor s worthy solution is possible but whether it is or it isn t I think we can all concur that that the Punditry Crisis requires immediate action Well maybe not action but definitely a lot more talk More Evidence That He Won t Do a Mea Culpa One popular hypothesis about Aug 17 is the notion that Clinton won t admit apologize because Hillary Clinton won t let him She refuses to let him humiliate her Further support for this theory comes from a profile of Hillary in today s Washington Post The Post rediscovered an astonishing 7 month old quote from the first lady Everyone remembers that the first lady blamed Flytrap on a vast right wing conspiracy in a Today show interview during the first days of the crisis The Post reminds readers of what else she said Hillary s words are in italics If a president were proved to have had an adulterous liaison while in the White House the American people should certainly be concerned about it if all that were proven true I think that would be a very serious offense That is not going to be proven true I think we re going to find some other things This is admittedly just a single line from a long ago interview but it suggests that the Clintons are locked into a denial If Clinton admits an affair how could Hillary ever explain away this quote Can the president do a mea culpa knowing that the video of Hillary saying it would be a very serious offense would be thrown back in his face again and again and again Flytrap Today The complete chronicles More Flytrap
