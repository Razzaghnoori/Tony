 On Rereading Old age is the new rage That was apparent even before John Glenn aged 77 went up into space There are more old people than ever Many of them have word processors Many of those pass their free time writing And following the advice of all teachers of writing they write about what they know which is old age So there is a lot of writing on that subject Even Jimmy Carter has written a book about old age Wanting to keep up with this trend I have just reread the classic on the subject Marcus Tullius Cicero s De Senectute The last time I read it was 68 years ago I read it then in Latin Today I read it in the wonderful Loeb Classic Library edition with the Latin on the left page and the English on the right I read the right page I can hardly believe that I read it in Latin when I was a junior in high school And I can t imagine what I learned about old age reading it in my teens We didn t read De Senectute to learn about old age My Latin teacher believed that reading Latin any Latin made tiny grooves in your brain that increased your general intelligence not just your capacity to read Latin Cicero wrote the essay in 44 B C when he was 62 years old One might think that was pretty old for a Roman of that time but Cicero evidently didn t think it was old enough to qualify him to discourse on the subject He wrote in the voice of Cato the Elder in the year 150 B C when Cato was 84 years old In fact Cicero did not live to experience much old age The year after writing the essay he was executed for being on the wrong side of a political dispute The essay consists of a long answer by Cato to questions posed by two younger men one 35 and one 36 They ask him on what principles we may most easily support the weight of increasing years Cato breaks down the question He identifies four reasons why old age appears to be an unhappy time First it withdraws us from active pursuits Second it makes the body weaker Third it deprives us of all physical pleasures And fourth it is not far removed from death He then discusses these four concerns Translating the answers into the English of 1998 they almost all consist of saying that the quality of one s old age depends on the investments one made in earlier years I don t refer and Cicero didn t either to financial investments that assure one a comfortable income in old age Cicero came from a wealthy family I am sure that financial investments are important and I don t suppose Cicero would have denied that But there are other kinds of investments implicit in Cicero s discussion The most obvious is investment in one s health and bodily strength I don t think the Romans of Cicero s time had a cigarette problem But it seems clear from the examples he gives that having a satisfactory old age depends on adequacy of physical exercise and moderation of eating and drinking in the years before Another investment important for old age is friendships Cicero has Cato say I have always had my club companions Cato takes pride in having been instrumental when he was 30 years old in establishing certain clubs in Rome and therefore I used to dine with these companions in an altogether moderate way yet with a certain ardor appropriate to my age which as time goes on daily mitigates my zest for every pleasure Being a Stoic Cicero Cato does not regret but rather welcomes the decline of appetite for what he calls sensual pleasure Cato quotes a man who asked Sophocles whether being old he still indulged in the delights of love When I look across the page at the Latin I see rebus veneriis which looks more like sexual love but it s a long time since I studied Latin and I may be wrong In any case he praises the value of the intellectual and aesthetic pleasures in which an old man can still indulge But to fully appreciate art science and nature in old age requires some prior investment in cultivating them An even older source reminds me of an investment for old age at which Cicero only hints Genesis 24 1 says And Abraham was old well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things According to my rabbi I don t want to pretend to be a student of such things later commentators said that meant that Abraham was blessed with the recognition that he had passed the trials of his life with valor and devotion and could now enjoy a peaceful retirement content in his own eyes and in the eyes of God He had in today s parlance paid his dues That is another investment one can make for old age so to conduct oneself in prior years that one can feel one has paid one s dues On the final question of how to invest to prepare for the proximity of death in old age Cicero is not very helpful Who is He offers his philosophical view Death brings at least an end to those troublesome appetites and may open the way to something better he doesn t say what Perhaps one could indoctrinate oneself in that attitude in youth and so prepare for old age But obviously Cicero did not find that philosophy sufficient As the introduction to the Loeb edition says In February 45 a year before he wrote De Senectute the death of his adored and only daughter drove him into a frenzy of writing in an effort to forget his grief He did not accept the fact of his daughter Tullia s death with the thought that she had at least escaped all appetites His philosophy might have prepared him for his own death it did not prepare him for the death of one he loved Later he wrote an essay titled Consolatio which probably dealt with this subject and which I have not read If he was rescued from his grief it was apparently time and work not philosophy that rescued him Herbert Stein thanks his high school Latin teacher
