 so what kind of music do you like i like all kinds of music actually yeah that s same here i m kind of partial to country western i like that do you and i like mood music like you know when i m in the mood for that i like semi classical yeah the real classics i m not as familiar with as you know the ordinary sounds that you hear every day type of thing uh huh yeah that s about that s about all i listen to is the classical stuff we have a we have a really good classical radio station here uh huh it s uh gets no money from the state or the feds or anybody it s uh one hundred percent listener supported oh huh and it s a twenty four hour station oh that s fantastic yeah they they get a lot of support here well we have a similar um radio station here and because of the uh people i guess being pressured to have advertisers you know a lot of the stations have to have advertisers they kind of like uh huh compromised and they do some of it at like certain hours but it s not always at a time when you can you know sit down and listen to it so uh huh you you kind of get trapped into listening to whatever there is available type of thing you know yeah yeah that s the good thing about them they do no advertising that s it s really nice just music uh huh we have that on TV we have two public uh broadcasting systems uh channel two and thirty six also that are publicly supported and they have excellent programming yeah i like i like PBS yeah yep same thing uh PBS here you can t get it unless you have cable uh huh and that really upsets me because i won t pay cable prices because there s it s it s useless having cable i think it is it s expensive it s uh it s far too expensive and they don t have anything on there no and the the problem is that they can do it at will you know like up the prices and you re if you have it you just have to pay it yeah exactly you know that s the hard part i ve almost given in a couple of times and gotten it every time i get one of those special offers in the mail but yeah uh huh i ve avoided the temptation so far but i sure do miss PBS yeah because they they have lots of good stuff Masterpiece Theatre and mystery and nature yep see we have cable here yeah and almost everyone here has cable and it it s uh it s good because you don t need the outside antennas with your TV and stuff and it gives you a lot more um yeah of the other you know of the widest uh uh television that s available to you um hum yeah i i had cable before i uh came up here and i miss some of it i mean we had pretty good cable where i was but i miss Discovery Channel and A E and CNN uh huh yeah that s what i like yep right and i love that you know i m having CNN withdrawal pains uh huh do you go to the theatre for for music uh every once in a while um have you been to the opera ever uh occasionally down in Charlotte yeah oh that s nice yeah it it s it s pretty good i ve seen Man of La Mancha and uh a few of those you know that in Boston and uh i enjoyed it thoroughly i really did um yeah i ve seen a few musicals and i uh go to Atlantic City once in a while and i always like to catch some shows when i m there um hum especially like when they have special singers and things and La Cage au Faux that was excellent yeah yeah i been into Boston a few times uh i was there last year during the Fourth of July thing and went out to the um uh huh Esplanade and listened to the Boston Pops and oh wow well we re only about two hours from there yeah they re good they re really oh really yeah i Boston s okay i mean i wouldn t want to live there but it s a nice place to visit no right in fact i yeah it s crowded i know that sure is it s murder driving in that place isn t it awful yeah and i always get stuck in the in the afternoon traffic oh yeah i i think that the commute to to and from work has to be the worst horror show because even the breakdown lane is used for a passing you know a travel lane in the morning um hum and that s really i think that s a very serious thing you know i m surprised they haven t had more you know really fatal accidents out there doing that well i tell you the way people are driving nowadays i m surprised we re not killing more people than we are oh i know it s true it s true seems like drivers are getting worse and worse every year so what are you majoring in um human factors oh and and what is that that s um well it s sort of difficult to explain it s it s industrial engineering and you look at applications and things from the human from the human factor standpoint how does it interface with the person using it oh oh i see and and yeah we had someone from uh do some ergonomics in our area do you do yeah it that s very similar cover some of that yeah yeah very similar um uh specializing in the computer and you know uh interfacing with computers and software and all that kind of good stuff oh oh oh oh well then this is right up your alley what they re trying yeah this is uh sort of the same sort of thing that s why it s it was the uh professor who brought this thing in he d gone to a conference yeah yeah uh huh down there and brought this thing up i yeah sure i ll do it yeah why not really hey if TI wants to give me five bucks a phone call that s okay sure sure you have to talk to all kinds of neat people all over the place yeah it s true it is in in fact i have a friend of mine that moved to North Carolina she s um an emergency room nurse she does the operating room um hum and uh she s been down there a couple years and she really loves it where s she at i don t know the city yeah there s all i know is it s down in in North Carolina in fact the last time she was up i meant to ask her you know what city she was in i didn t but she said it s really nice yeah there s not too many not too many big ones around here no uh matter fact we don t have any big ones after you know after being used to places like Boston and Atlanta you come here and you know they people think Charlotte is the big town you know yeah oh wow and it s small really yeah what s the population uh Charlotte oh what about quarter of a million oh that s that s pretty good size though oh it s fairly good size i mean it s it s not it s not small but it s certainly small by Atlanta standards yeah yeah yeah course everything s small consider compared to Atlanta i i liked Atlanta too i have a sister in law that lives in Atlanta yeah my my brother and uh sister in law live there i like they she uh she in fact went from Massachusetts to uh Florida then to Atlanta and she really really likes it yeah Atlanta s Atlanta s a good city it really is uh you have to get used to that cotton picking traffic on two eighty five yeah but uh if you if you miss it at the right time of the day then you re okay yeah yeah but it always seemed like when i was there i was always finishing i lived in Duluth which is uh north of Atlanta well not north it s more east uh huh uh along I eighty five um hum and i would always be on the other end of two eighty five having to go all the way around two eighty five and then onto eighty five to go home and it was always at the end of the day oh yeah i never managed to plan my departure right the airport s something down there oh yeah oh my God i i swear those planes going or coming going or coming yeah yeah it s scary it is it s um it s scary they they rival even uh Chicago on uh departure and arrival uh number of arrivals every day yes unbelievable in fact when we went down to visit one time we just sat there and we watched i couldn t believe yeah oh it s a busy it s a busy place and they have amazingly few accidents there the traffic it is i know isn t it amazingly few unreal because uh i mean if you re flying anywhere down here you always go through Atlanta you can t avoid it uh huh it s the hub city yep yep and uh God i went there to to visit the Underground when that was you know the Underground City um hum yeah and i thought that was really neat yeah that s super it s getting even better too that amazing oh really yeah they they just they never stop doing things to it is that right all kinds of good stuff go course i haven t been there in about uh eight years yeah last well see i left there in uh eighty so what was it eighty six yeah so it s been it s been five years for me five years the the growth in that place is phenomenal yeah it just doesn t stop they don t stand still that s for sure i mean it we re having our problems out this way with the banking crisis and yeah credit unions and all that kind of good stuff yeah yeah and it s starting to effect you know the economy sure because of uh the uh businesses that have their money tied up yeah exactly every place you go you know the couple of years ago i was thinking about moving to Massachusetts but uh boy i m glad i didn t uh huh yeah yeah because it s really going downhill up there it has i don t know what they re going to have to do to boost it but they need to do something quick well you know i i was when when the big boom was going on i was thinking well Dukakis must be an absolute genius yeah and then i i i really think that all of that was just you know temporary growth and everything to make him look good for the Presidential election yeah because it certainly wasn t sustained sometimes i wonder though if the presidential election isn t what really did everything in because he wasn t really paying attention to business you know you can t do both things well well yeah but on the other hand if it if it needed his personal intervention all the time then it wasn t a good system anyway no true but uh you know it should it should have been rolling right along without him yeah you know good a good chief executive would be able to sit back and not do anything that s true yep that s true hopefully yeah somebody has to watch the store though you can t really you know without overseeing no that s true and and and Lord knows with that legislature up there they probably did all kinds of things while he wasn t looking sure sure so look at what happened just in Washington alone God yeah well you can t it s mind boggling you can t trust legislators anyway no well it s been interesting talking to you yeah we need we didn t talk too much about music but we had a good conversation but oh yeah right i hope to hear
