 Introduction Progression through the mammalian cell cycle requires that gene expression is coordinated with the activity of cell cycle control proteins A critical period is the transition from the G1 into the S phase as cells become committed to the division cycle Binding of free E2F DP heterodimers to E2F sites generally activates transcription of proteins required for G1 S transition and DNA synthesis 1 2 3 4 5 whereas complex formation with pRb or other pocket proteins including p107 and pRb 2 p130 silences transcriptional activities of downstream target genes 6 7 8 9 10 The resulting retinoblastoma protein Rb E2F interaction not only blocks transcriptional activation by E2F but also forms an active transcriptional repressor complex at the promoter of cell cycle genes that can block transcription by recruiting histone deacetylase HDAC and remodeling chromatin 11 12 13 14 Several HDAC inhibitors mediate cell growth arrest and or differentiation 15 16 17 We chose to examine the effect of HPCs which have been reported to induce terminal differentiation and or apoptosis 18 19 20 in many transformed cells Although treatment with HMBA induces remission in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myelogenoud leukemia it is not currently used therapeutically because of the high dosage required millimolar blood levels and the accompanying toxic side effects thrombocytopenia 21 In this study we report a novel mechanism of cell growth inhibition by the second generation of HPCs named SAHA which is 2000 fold more potent than HMBA and bears at least one hydroxamide in place of the amides in HMBA 17 SAHA was reported to be a histone deacetylase inhibitor and caused accumulation of hyperacetylated histone H4 in murine erythroleukemia 17 Very little is known about the anticancer mechanism of SAHA in epithelial cells however a recent study demonstrated that SAHA diet at 900 parts per million ppm fed to rats reduced methylenitrosouren induced mammary tumor incidence by 40 total tumors by 66 and tumor volume by 78 22 In this study we tested whether SAHA has similar potency to inhibit cell growth in two mouse mammary epithelial cell lines TM10 p53 wt and TM2H p53 null We identified a novel mechanism for SAHA in cell growth arrest through inhibition in DNA synthesis concomitant with significant increases in the nuclear localization of pRb 2 p130 associated with E2F 4 decreases in key molecules in DNA synthesis E2F 1 PCNA and p21 and increases in histone H3 and H4 protein and acetylation levels This study discusses the difference in recovery from cell growth inhibition in two mammary epithelial cell lines TM10 and TM2H after SAHA removal from cultures Materials and methods Development of cell lines and cell culture The TM10 and TM2H cell lines chosen for this study were isolated from two different mouse mammary hyperplastic outgrowths TM10 and TM2H respectively as described earlier 23 The parental TM10 outgrowth is a moderately tumorigenic outgrowth line in vivo time for 50 of the transplants to produce tumors 11 months that is karyotypically diploid and maintains wild type p53 expression TM2H in contrast is a highly tumorigenic outgrowth line in vivo time for 50 of the transplants to produce tumors 4 months karyotypically aneuploid DNA index 1 69 and contains a p53 mutation resulting in a null phenotype 24 Exponentially growing TM10 and TM2H cell lines in DMEM F12 media buffered with 10 mM HEPES at pH 7 6 with 2 adult bovine serum 10 g ml insulin 5 ng ml epidermal growth factor EGF and 5 g ml gentamycin at 60 70 confluence were treated with SAHA courtesy of Dr Paul Marks and Dr Victoria Richon Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York NY USA Cells were examined at the time points indicated for cell growth and cell cycle activities Analysis of cell growth Cell growth rates of TM10 and TM2H lines were determined using a 3H thymidine uptake assay as described earlier 25 In initial studies both cell lines were cultured in the absence or presence of 0 1 2 5 5 0 and 10 M SAHA for 6 days Both cell lines were also cultured for 2 days in the presence of SAHA at the concentrations already mentioned followed by removing SAHA from the media for a subsequent 4 days Based on the results of these studies subsequent experiments examined asynchronously growing TM10 and TM2H cell lines in the presence or absence of 2 5 M SAHA for 24 h FACS analysis Exponentially growing cells at 60 70 confluence at control or treated with 2 5 M SAHA for 24 h were pulse labeled for 1 h with 10 M BrdU Sigma St Louis MO USA The cell cultures were rinsed once with phosphate buffered saline PBS trypsinized for 3 min and rinsed three times with PBS Cells were resuspended in 200 l PBS and fixed in 5 ml cold 70 ethanol overnight Fixed cells were counted and generally 4 10 6cells were transferred to 15 ml polypropylene tubes centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant removed Cells were stained for the newly incorporated BrdU for DNA synthesis using BrdU monoclonal antibodies conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate FITC and stained with propidium iodide for DNA content following the protocol described in Becton and Dickinson s San Diego CA USA instructions for flow cytometric analysis Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts To obtain nuclei 4 6 10 7cells of each cell line grown in the presence and absence of 2 5 M SAHA were washed twice in PBS followed by suspension in 0 3 ml nuclear buffer consisting of 2 mM MgCl 2 5 mM K 2 HPO 4 0 1 mM EDTA 1 mM PMSF 20 g ml aprotinin 20 g ml leupeptin 0 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 and 5 mM glycerophosphate An additional 0 3 ml nuclear buffer containing 0 7 Triton X 100 was then added after standing on ice for 8 10 min The suspensions were examined for cell lysis microscopically centrifuged at 800 rpm for 10 min at 4 C and the supernatant designated the cytoplasmic fraction The pellets were washed once with nuclear buffer and the nuclear extracts were prepared by resuspending the pellets in 0 3 ml buffer containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7 8 25 glycerol 0 42 M NaCl 1 5 mM MgCl 2 0 2 mM EDTA 0 5 mM PMSF 0 5 mM DTTl 0 1 mM Na 3 VO 4 50 mM NaF 20 g ml leupeptin and 5 mM glycerophosphate Sonication was carried out on ice using an ultrasonicator processor PGC Scientific Caithersburg MA USA and the mixtures were examined microscopically for complete break of the nuclei The supernatants were designated as nuclear extracts after centrifugation of the mixtures and the total protein was determined in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions Western blot and immunoprecipitation analysis Histones were isolated and lyophilized from nuclear extracts in SAHA treated and untreated TM10 and TM2H cell lines following a protocol described earlier 26 Histone samples were assessed for purification quality on 15 SDS acrylamide gel including calf thymus histones as controls before western blot analysis was carried out Histone samples were resolved by electrophoresis using 15 acid urea gel containing 36 w v urea 5 v v acetic acid 600 l TEMED and 0 7 ml of 10 ammonium persulfate prepared as described elsewhere 27 Gels were either stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue or equilibrated to be transferred into transfer buffer 0 7 acetic acid The gel sandwich was set up as usual except for the placement of the blotting membrane because proteins in this type of gel will migrate toward the negative electrode and the procedure was continued as described earlier 27 Each histone was resolved into multiple bands and were visualized in Coomassie blue gel The acetylated histone isoforms were detected by immunoblot against acetylated histone H3 isoforms using anti H3 antibodies raised and characterized by Dr Sharon Roth at MD Anderson Cancer Center personal communication or against acetylated histone H4 isoforms using anti H4 polyclonal antibody Upstate Biotechnology Inc Lake Placid NY USA Western blot analysis for all the proteins

already described for western blot analysis Cyclin dependent kinase assay The TM10 and TM2H cell cultures at control and treated with 2 5 M SAHA for 24 h were examined for cyclin D1 E and A associated kinase activities as described previously 28 Briefly cellular protein extracts 25 g were precleared with 10 l of 10 preimmune normal rabbit serum followed by immunoprecipitation with either 3 g anti cyclin D1 E polyclonal antibodies Upstate Biotechnology 2 g anti cyclin A polyclonal antibody antibodies C 19 G Pharmingen or normal rabbit preimmune serum as a negative control All antibodies were examined for specificity 28 Immunoprecipitate complexes were examined for kinase assay following a procedure described previously 28 The substrates utilized in the kinase assays were either Histone H1 Sigma or RB protein Santa Cruz Biotechnology The phosphorylated H1 and pRb bands were scanned and quantitated densitometrically using a Phosphoimager Molecular Dynamics Sunnyvle CA USA Immunofluorescent staining Exponentially growing cells on slides were fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde in PEM buffer 80 mM Pipes pH 7 0 5 mM EGTA and 2 mM MgCl 2 for 30 min permeabilized in 0 5 Triton X 100 in PEM buffer at room temperature for 15 min and rinsed three times with TBS 0 1 Tween 20 followed by incubation in 0 5 nonfat dry milk in TBS 0 1 Tween 20 for 2 h at room temperature For BrdU and DAPI double immunostaining cells were incubated for 30 min in media supplemented with 5 M BrdU After 30 min cells were incubated in 2N HCl for 5 min at room temperature prior to incubation with the primary antibody this step was omitted for pRb 2 p130 immunostaining Following washing three times cells were incubated in a 1 50 dilution of mouse anti BrdU monoclonal antibody Boehringer Mannheim Indianapolis IN USA for 2 h at 37 C After washing three times cells were then incubated in FITC conjugated anti mouse secondary antibody 1 400 dilution for 1 h at 37 C followed by washing three times with anti fade equilibrating buffer and mounting in anti fade mounting medium Molecular Probe Eugene OR USA The same sequential steps were followed for pRb 2 p130 immunostaining using anti pRb 2 p130 monoclonal antibodies Santa Cruz Biotechnology Apoptosis Apoptotic activities in TM10 and TM2H cells in the absence and presence of 2 5 M SAHA were examined by two procedures the TACS 2TdT In Situ Apoptosis Detection assay following the manufacturer s instructions Trevingen Gaithersburg MD USA and the DNA Fragmentation Assay described elsewhere 29 Results Effect of SAHA on TM10 and TM2H cell proliferation and morphology The TM10 and TM2H cell lines were used to investigate whether the status of p53 influences the outcome of SAHA treatment The origin of TM10 and TM2H cell lines was described earlier 30 The rate of cell proliferation at concentrations of 0 1 0 2 5 5 and 10 M SAHA was examined by 3H thymidine assay at the indicated time points The inhibitory effect of SAHA at concentrations of 2 5 M and higher on cell proliferation was profound on both cell lines after 24 h The TM10 cell proliferation continued to be inhibited during the following 5 days in the presence of SAHA whereas minimal growth in TM2H cell growth on days 3 and 4 was observed Figs 1A C After removing SAHA from the cultures following 2 days of exposure to all SAHA concentrations TM10 cells continued to be inhibited at concentrations of 2 5 M and higher during the following 4 days of SAHA free cultures Fig 1B whereas TM2H cells resumed proliferation Fig 1D These results suggest that SAHA induced a dose dependent block in DNA replication on both cell lines A 2 5 M dose of SAHA was used in further experiments because this concentration seems to be unequivocally effective on cell growth inhibition on both cell lines after 24 h of treatment Furthermore no apoptotic activity was observed after 24 and 48 h of treatment with 2 5 M SAHA in both cell lines data not shown The effect of SAHA on blocking cell proliferation through blocking DNA synthesis was examined by BrdU labeling as determined by immunofluorescence staining Fig 2A and the cell cycle profile by flow cytometric analysis Fig 2B The BrdU indices in the control TM10 and TM2H cells including all types of BrdU staining patterns were 16 and 34 respectively indicating that the percentage of TM2H cells synthesizing DNA or in the S phase were more than double that of TM10 cells Fig 2A Upon 2 5 M SAHA treatment for 24 h 800 cells per sample were counted stained with BrdU against cells stained with DAPI and BrdU labeling indices dropped dramatically to 4 and 6 in TM10 and TM2H cells respectively Furthermore the BrdU staining revealed the size and pattern of replication clusters which are related to the general patterns of DNA replication in mammalian cell nuclei at early mid and late S phase 31 These data suggested that 2 5 M SAHA was capable of inhibiting cell proliferation in both TM10 and TM2H cell lines by blocking DNA synthesis regardless of their differences in the number of cells synthesizing DNA These results were confirmed by flow cytometric analysis after staining cells with BrdU for newly synthesized DNA and with propidium iodide for DNA content The percentages of cells in the G1 and S phases in control TM10 cells at the time of treatment were 57 and 18 respectively and those for TM2H cells were 39 and 28 respectively Fig 2B The number of TM2H cells growth arrested in the G1 phase upon SAHA treatment for 24 h increased by 21 compared with the 8 increase in the TM10 cell line concomitant with similar differences in the percentage of cells inhibited in the S and G2 M phases Fig 2B This difference in G1 cell growth arrest between the two cell lines may be attributed to their differences in the initial number of cells distributed in each cell cycle phase before treatment The shape and morphology of TM10 and TM2H cells grown on slides in the presence and absence of 2 5 M SAHA were examined The dimensions of 50 randomly selected cells of each cell line were measured using a microscope scale The TM10 and TM2H mammary epithelial cells measured 5 4 2 1 and 3 6 1 4 m in width and 13 7 5 9 and 18 6 8 0 m in length respectively TM10 cells generally had five to seven extensions whereas TM2H cells had three to five extensions TM10 and TM2H cells became flattened and increased in both nuclear and cytoplasmic volume after 24 h of 2 5 M SAHA treatment Both cells exhibited less distinct intracellular borders Fig 3 The morphology of both cell lines was similar to cells committed to cell differentiation however these mammary cells grown on plastic dishes were unable to differentiate by SAHA Effect of SAHA on histone protein and acetylation levels in TM10 and TM2H cell lines It is not known whether SAHA alters the protein acetylation levels of various histones in the mammary epithelial cells Changes in the acetylation or phosphorylation of histones result in alterations that can be visualized as changes in protein mobility on an acid urea gel following western blot analysis 26 27 These gels separate histones on the basis of charges as well as size resulting in multiple bands for each histone that correspond to differently modified isoforms These isoforms can be identified by their characteristic mobility and by staining with antibodies specific to each histone isoform 26 Protein and acetylation levels of histone H3 and H4 isoforms on histone samples isolated from SAHA treated and untreated TM10 and TM2H cells stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue Fig 4A and by western blots Fig 4B were examined to identify the potency of SAHA as a histone deacetylase inhibitor on mammary epithelial cells We focused on H3 and H4 because antibodies are available and acetylation events in those histones have been studied These results suggested that SAHA not only increased histone acetylation as shown in H4 Fig 4A but also increased histone protein levels in TM10 and TM2H cells Fig 4B The increases in protein and acetylation levels of H3 and H4 in SAHA treated TM10 and TM2H cell lines were indicated by the strong staining with the acetylation specific antibodies of H3 and H4 while the acetylated slow migrated isoforms showed smearing due to the increases in their protein level Fig 5B We did not however observe differences in the initial acetylation levels between untreated TM10 and TM2H cell lines SAHA induced hypophosphorylation of all the three pocket proteins Phosphorylation of three major pocket proteins Rb p107 and Rb2 p130 were examined after SAHA treatment as each pocket protein affects the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle Upon treatment with 2 5 M SAHA for 24 h a profound increase in hypophosphorylation of the three pocket proteins was observed in both TM10 and to a lesser extent in TM2H cells as compared with their control counterparts judged by the faster mobility of the Rb pocket protein isoforms on SDS gel Fig 5 The difference in the level of hypophosphorylated pRb pocket protein isoforms between the two cell lines treated with SAHA may be attributed to differences in G1 and S phase cdk activity examined in the following section Results suggested that SAHA induced cell growth arrest through dephosphorylation of three pRb pocket proteins which may be related to inhibition in G1 S phase cdk activities SAHA inhibits multiple cyclin associated kinase activities There are extensive studies on the relation between specific phosphorylation sites on pRb and its potential transcription repression 32 33 34 It is well known that pRb phosphorylation sites are recognized by specific cdks 33 and that most of the 16 pRb phosphorylation sites are sequentially phosphorylated throughout the cell cycle reviewed in 34 35 SAHA treatment resulted in G1 cell growth arrest in TM10 and TM2H cell lines concomitant with the profound increase in dephosphorylation of the three pRb pocket proteins Therefore we examined cyclin D1 E and A cdk2 activities in TM10 and TM2H cell cultures after 24 h treatment with SAHA because they reflect kinase activities before during and after the G1 S checkpoint respectively The three cyclin cdk2 complexes directly reflect the sequential events in DNA synthesis 36 The initial levels of cyclin D1 E and A associated kinase activities were 3 2 5 and 4 fold higher in untreated TM2H compared with TM10 cells respectively Fig 6A B C These results were predicted based on their differences in cell distribution throughout the cell cycle as appeared in the cell cycle profile analysis and may reflect the cell line differences in known p53 status Cyclin D1 E and A associated kinase activities decreased by four four and fivefold respectively in TM10 cells compared with control on SAHA treatment whereas only cyclin D1 and A associated kinase activities decreased 2 2 and 2 6 fold respectively in SAHA treated TM2H cells compared with control Fig 6 These data demonstrate that SAHA inhibits multiple cdk activities and the degree of inhibition was more profound in TM10 verses TM2H cells Effect of SAHA on p21 PCNA E2F 1 and E2F 4 proteins as a function of cell growth inhibition The difference in the protein level of p21 Cip1 between TM10 and TM2H cell lines was predicted based on their differences in p53 status Fig 7A Perinuclear localization of p21 was detected in only few TM2H cells p53 null when both cell lines were immunostained for p21 whereas p21 was localized in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in TM10 cells p53 wt data not shown The p21 expression level decreased by 50 in TM10 cells upon SAHA treatment Fig 7A These results suggest that SAHA inhibited DNA synthesis in the presence or absence of p21 protein PCNA 37 and E2F 1 1 7 are two key mediators of the G1 S transition and DNA synthesis Because such regulatory proteins can be present at different levels and in different molecular complexes in nuclei as compared with the cytoplasm separation of the two cellular compartments allowed an assessment of the site s at which these proteins exert their primary activity unimpeded by artifacts that may result from intermixing the two compartments In the untreated cells the cytoplasmic PCNA protein levels in TM10 and TM2H cell lines were similar but the level of PCNA in the nuclear fraction was fourfold higher in TM2H cells compared with TM10 cells Fig 7B The effect of SAHA was profound on the nuclear PCNA fraction in both cell lines but minimal on the cytoplasmic PCNA fraction The pronounced difference in the levels of PCNA in growing versus arrested cells is in accordance with the determinant role PCNA plays in DNA synthesis 37 38 To further investigate the effect of SAHA on inhibition of DNA synthesis we examined E2F 1 as a key mediator for G1 S transition and DNA synthesis The initial nuclear protein level of E2F 1 in the untreated TM2H cells was 4 8 fold higher compared with the TM10 cell line Fig 7C Nuclear E2F 1 protein was completely abolished in TM10 cells after 24 h of SAHA treatment and decreased 2 2 fold in TM2H cells Fig 7C These results demonstrate that SAHA treatment also inhibits E2F 1 protein levels It has been reported that expression of E2F 4 gene does not change in relation to cell growth although a modest increase can sometimes be observed in growing cells 39 E2F 4 protein levels were examined in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions in both cell lines with and without SAHA and the protein levels did not change upon SAHA treatment in either fractions of either cell line Fig 7D It is noteworthy that the mechanism of SAHA in G1 cell growth arrest may target the expression of specific proteins involved in DNA synthesis as it inhibited E2F 1 and PCNA but not E2F 4 suggesting that SAHA may cause different levels of histone acetylation at distinct regions of the genome Rb2 p130 subcellular localization and interaction with E2F 4 was examined in both cell lines in the absence and presence of SAHA because Rb2 p130 is an important cytoplasmic partner of E2F 4 and is capable of inducing nuclear localization of the complex upon cell growth arrest and differentiation 40 41 Immunostaining analysis using monoclonal antibody specific for pRb2 p130 revealed that SAHA enhanced pRb2 p130 nuclear localization in both cell lines treated with SAHA for 24 h compared with their controls Fig 8A To examine whether the increase in hypophosphorylation of pRb2 p130 Fig 5 and its nuclear localization after SAHA treatment was associated with interaction to E2F 4 equal amounts of nuclear protein extracts were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against E2F 4 followed by western blot analysis against pRb2 p130 antibodies Interestingly the results revealed an unequivocal increase in the nuclear pRb2 p130 protein level associated with E2F 4 in both cell lines treated with SAHA Fig 8B These intriguing results indicate that the interaction of hypophosphorylated pRb2 p130 with E2F 4 followed by enhancement in nuclear location after SAHA treatment is a novel mechanism in SAHA mediating cell growth arrest Discussion In this study we present novel data on the mechanism of SAHA in cell growth arrest on two mouse mammary epithelial cell lines TM10 p53 wt and TM2H p53 null SAHA was able to increase histone H3 and H4 protein and acetylation levels and caused a profound decrease in the protein levels of key molecules PCNA and E2F 1 essential for DNA synthesis Furthermore SAHA significantly enhanced the interaction of pRb2 p130 to E2F 4 and the nuclear localization of the pRb2 p130 E2F 4 complex SAHA also resulted in the inhibition of G1 S kinase activities and consequently hypophosphorylation of the three pRb pocket proteins which led to G1 cell growth arrest and dramatic decreases in DNA synthesis in both cell lines TM10 cells continued to be inhibited for 4 days upon removing SAHA after 2 days of treatment whereas TM2H cells were able to recover their proliferation potentials A summary of the differences in the molecular status and cell cycle profile between TM10 and TM2H cell lines before SAHA treatment are summarized in Table 1 These differences in p21 protein and BrdU index were predicted based on p53 status of these two cell lines and are in parallel with other reports on mammary tumors where the absence of p53 results primarily in greater proliferation response in the affected cell 42 No differences in histone H3 and H4 acetylation levels were however observed in relation to p53 status between the two cell lines It is not known at this point whether specific mutations of p53 alter the degree of histone acetylation in cells Histone acetylation and p53 mutation appear not to be correlated in this study nevertheless it is necessary and more sensitive to examine histone acetylase and deacetylase activities in correlation to p53 status The mechanism of SAHA in blocking DNA synthesis as demonstrated by flow cytometric analysis appeared similar in both TM10 and TM2H cell lines and implicated several events First SAHA increased histones H3 and H4 protein levels after 24 h of treatment which could result in cell cycle arrest It has been reported that upregulation of KIAA0128 gene expression which has been implicated in activation of histone mRNA synthesis was related to cell cycle arrest in MCF 7 cells after treatment with SAHA 43 As SAHA treatment increased histone H3 and H4 protein and acetylation levels in both cell lines this may have altered the association of histones with DNA thereby altering nucleosomal conformation and stability 27 44 Local perturbations of chromatin structure can specifically affect the accessibility and or function of transcriptional regulatory proteins that bind DNA sequences in the region where histone acetylation or deacetylation took place 44 HDAC inhibitors such as trichostatin A and trapoxin modulate gene expression in either a positive negative or neutral fashion 45 Ample studies have demonstrated the implication of histone hyperacetylation in gene transcription but also in silencing gene expression of others 27 44 45 It is well known that E2F 1 regulates transcription of genes predominantly expressed during the G1 S transition such as cyclins 1 5 cdks 1 E2F 1 gene 46 the RB1 tumor suppressor gene 8 47 and genes for DNA replication and repair enzymes and factors 4 It appears that SAHA has a profound inhibitory impact on the protein levels of key molecules E2F 1 PCNA and p21 essential for DNA synthesis Based on previous reports disintegration of the cyclin cdk complexes important for DNA synthesis is correlated to E2F 1 expression level 1 5 It is thus conceivable to interpret that the profound inhibition in E2F 1 and PCNA protein levels after 24 h of exposure to 2 5 M SAHA may result in disintegration and deactivation of D1 E and A cdk2 complexes which consequently leads to hypophosphorylation of the three Rb pocket proteins It is plausible to suggest that the inhibition in E2F 1 protein levels by SAHA was either at the transcription level or induction of the ubiquitin protein ligase responsible for E2F 1 degradation but not E2F 4 and this resulted in blocked DNA synthesis Further work is necessary to prove whether the effect of SAHA is at the RNA transcription level or on stability of E2F 1 protein The inhibition in nuclear p21 in SAHA treated TM2H as well as TM10 cells underscores that SAHA arrested cell growth is through a p53 independent pathway A recent report indicated that the transcription of p21 Cip1and accumulation of acetylated histones associated with the promoter and coding regions of that gene were induced after 2 h in 7 5 M SAHA and fall by 24 h in T24 bladder carcinoma cells 48 Although we have utilized 2 5 M SAHA our results are in agreement with their data on the fall in p21 level after 24 h of treatment A more intriguing and novel mechanism of SAHA mediated cell growth arrest was the enhanced interaction and nuclear localization of Rb2 p130 E2F 4 complexes in both cell lines after 24 h of treatment It is well documented that E2F 1 possesses an intrinsic nuclear localization signal whereas E2F 4 is devoid of such signal 49 50 and that the mechanism of E2F 4 nuclear localization has been documented to be through its interaction with Rb2 p130 pocket protein which impedes cell cycle progression 39 40 Furthermore recent studies demonstrated that Rb2 p130 in complexes with E2F 4 actively represses E2F 1 transcription in cell differentiation and growth arrest and that this complex was considered the main E2F 1 regulator during the early G1 phase 39 51 52 Other reports suggest that Rb recruitment of HDAC1 activity repressed E2F 1 12 13 Although SAHA increases acetylation of histones H3 and H4 it is not known whether SAHA is able to inhibit all HDAC activities of all types of histones including HDAC1 or whether the profound increase in Rb2 p130 E2F 4 nuclear complex after SAHA treatment may have an alternative pathway other than recruitment of HDAC1 activity The difference between TM10 p53 wt and TM2H p53 null cell cultures in response to removing 2 5 M SAHA following 2 or 3 days of treatment was significant We suggest that it might reflect their difference in p53 status The TM10 cells did not exhibit signs of cell proliferation or recovery during the following 3 4 days TM2H cells in contrast recovered by 88 after 2 days of treatment Longer treatment may be necessary to inhibit TM2H p53 null mammary epithelial cells as preliminary results indicate TM2H cells did not recover after 3 days of SAHA treatment data not shown We suggest that the difference in growth recovery between TM10 p53 wt and TM2H p53 null cell lines after 2 days in 2 5 M SAHA may be attributed to two factors both related to their p53 status Firstly the p53 in TM10 p53 wt cells might have been acetylated upon treatment with 2 5 M SAHA for 2 or 3 days Recent studies demonstrated acetylation of p53 in the C terminal domain increased the DNA binding capacity of the protein 53 54 55 This event is obviously not present in TM2H p53 null Secondly although TM10 cells p53 wt have lost 64 of their nuclear p21 during SAHA treatment the remaining 36 of the nuclear p21 plus the continued synthesis of p21 by p53 activity 55 56 57 during the recovery period would maintain TM10 cells in the inhibited state for several days without SAHA TM2H cells p53 null in contrast lack both negative regulatory potentials of acetylated p53 and the availability of nuclear p21 We conclude that the mechanisms of SAHA inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth arrest at G1 were similar in both TM10 p53 wt and TM2H p53 null mouse mammary epithelial cell lines A proposed mechanism of SAHA stresses the involvement of pRb2 p130 E2F 4 interaction and nuclear localization which ultimately results in cell growth arrest and repression in nuclear E2F 1 and PCNA protein levels and the subsequent inhibition of DNA synthesis in both cell lines However p53 status was critical in maintaining growth arrest in TM10 cells 4 days after removing SAHA treatment whereas TM2H cells p53 null recovered growth arrest under the same conditions We therefore suggest that the dose and time regimen for histone deacetylase inhibitors such as SAHA may have to consider the p53 status of breast cancers
