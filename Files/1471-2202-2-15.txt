 Background Metabotropic glutamate receptors mGluRs are a family of class 3 G protein coupled receptors with important functions in the regulation of synaptic transmission plasticity neuronal excitability and the regulation sensory transduction 1 2 3 4 5 The eight mGluRs mGluR1 8 and their splice variants have been divided into three groups I III based on sequence homology pharmacology and G protein coupling profiles 3 6 7 Group II mGluR2 and 3 and III mGluR4 and 6 through 8 couple negatively to adenylate cyclase through activation of the G i o family of G proteins 8 Group I mGluRs mGluR1 and 5 couple to multiple G proteins in native and heterologous systems and have been observed to couple to G q 11 G i o and or G s 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 mGluRs appear to be important mediators of synaptic transmission in the brain The group I mGluRs typically are located postsynaptically as well as in other compartments of the cell 16 17 18 where they regulate activity of ionotropic receptors and are necessary in some forms of synaptic plasticity 19 The association of mGluRs with scaffolding proteins such as Homer group I 20 and PICK 1 group III 21 is important in regulating mGluR localization and function 21 22 23 24 In addition to those proteins involved in scaffolding other proteins have been shown to associate with mGluRs For example group I and group III mGluRs are both known to bind Calmodulin CaM 25 26 In the case of group III mGluRs the interaction with CaM is important in regulating the efficacy of G protein activation 27 28 CaM binding to both group I and group III mGluRs can be inhibited by serine threonine phosphorylation at specific sites 25 28 Therefore it is of interest in terms of mGluR function and localization to understand the roles of proteins which interact with these receptors The Seven in Absentia SinA protein was discovered in Drosophila as a mediator of photoreceptor development 29 Subsequently SinA was shown to participate in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway 30 31 The presence of a RING finger domain in the N terminus of the mammalian homologue of SinA Siah suggests it may be involved in targeting specific proteins for degradation in the proteasome as a ubiquitin ligase 32 Two mammalian genes encoding Siah Siah1 and 2 are known These proteins have been implicated in many processes including cancer 33 apoptosis 34 and cell cycle regulation 35 More recently an interaction between Siah1a and the C terminal tail of group I mGluRs was demonstrated 36 This interaction was specific for group I mGluRs as it was not observed in the analogous sequences from group II mGluR2 or group III mGluR7 receptors Due to the novelty of the mammalian homolog of Seven in Absentia Siah little information is available regarding its tissue distribution or subcellular localization in mammalian cells To date the functional consequences of Siah1a association with group I mGluRs are unknown To assess the role of Siah1a binding specific group I mGluRs were heterologously expressed in sympathetic neurons from the rat superior cervical ganglion SCG which do not natively express mGluRs 37 38 The functional role of Siah1a was assessed by examining calcium current inhibition mediated by the expressed mGluRs in the absence and presence of heterologous Siah1a expression In addition the surface expression and subcellular distribution of group I mGluRs was examined with and without Siah1a using various fluorescence techniques Finally the effect of CaM overexpression on Siah1a function was assessed Results and Discussion Coexpression of Siah1a with group I mGluRs To examine the role of Siah1a expression on mGluR function SCG neurons were injected with cDNA encoding several group I mGluRs mGluR1 5 and their splice variants with or without Siah1a expression Calcium current modulation was then examined upon application of extracellular 100 M glutamate The triple pulse voltage protocol 39 was used as the standard test pulse to assess calcium current magnitude and voltage dependence of inhibition 38 40 Figure 1Aillustrates sample current traces from before con and during inhibition by glutamate Glu in an mGluR5b expressing cell Consistent with previous reports 24 38 calcium current inhibition via mGluR5b appeared partially voltage dependent The time course of inhibition by glutamate and 10 M norepinephrine NE acting through endogenous 2 adrenergic receptors 41 in this cell figure 1B illustrates that inhibition was rapid and reversible In contrast to that in cells expressing mGluR5b alone calcium current inhibition by glutamate in cells coexpressing mGluR5b and Siah1a was quite small figure 1C Average inhibition of calcium currents by glutamate in mGluR5b expressing cells was 33 5 n 7 Inhibition was significantly reduced to 10 6 n 5 p 0 05 in cells coexpressing mGluR5b and Siah1a figure 2 This reduction of modulation by glutamate appeared to be specific for mGluRs as NE mediated calcium current inhibition was unaltered figure ID Calcium current inhibition resulting from NE application in mGluR expressing cells was 58 6 n 12 In cells coexpressing Siah1a NE produced an inhibition of 54 6 n 11 figure 2 The strong reduction in calcium current modulation by glutamate in the presence of Siah1a was observed with every group I mGluR tested Cells expressing an extracellularly myc tagged mGluR5a mGluR5a myc exhibited calcium current inhibition of 42 4 n 6 upon glutamate application This inhibition was significantly reduced to 22 5 n 6 in cells coexpressing Siah1a p 0 05 figure 2 Similarly calcium current inhibition in cells expressing a C terminally GFP tagged mGluR1a mGluR1a GFP and mGluR1a GFP Siah1a was 46 5 n 5 and 23 6 n 6 respectively In addition to group I mGluRs mGluR2 a group II mGluR was also examined However Siah1a had no detectable effect on mGluR2 mediated calcium current inhibition consistent with reports demonstrating that Siah1a does not bind to group II mGluRs 36 Cells expressing mGluR2 alone exhibited 57 5 inhibition of calcium current in response to glutamate n 6 while those coexpressing Siah1a were inhibited 61 2 n 6 figure 2 Together these data demonstrate that in the presence of Siah1a the function of group I mGluRs is selectively inhibited These data also suggest that Siah1a is acting at the level of the receptor since much of the calcium current modulation through group I mGluRs proceeds through a G mediated pathway similar to that used by 2 adrenergic receptors and mGluR2 38 40 Effect of Siah1a on mGluR surface expression and localization The reduction in group I mGluR signaling induced by Siah1a expression may be attributed to several possible mechanisms For example binding of Siah1a to the C terminus of group I mGluRs may occlude the region or regions responsible for G protein activation This is possible since both Siah1a binding and G protein activation have been attributed to areas on the C terminus of group I mGluRs 36 42 43 Alternatively Siah1a binding may alter the normal interactions of the receptors with scaffolding proteins or may cause the receptors to be targeted for degradation in the proteasome effectively reducing the number of receptors that are correctly assembled or the number of functional receptors at the membrane The latter hypothesis predicts a reduction in mGluR cell surface expression or perhaps a change in surface distribution in the presence of Siah1a such as occurs in the presence of Homer proteins 24 44 45 To test whether Siah1a expression altered the surface expression of group I mGluRs the surface distribution of mGluR5a myc was examined in the absence and presence of Siah1a The subcellular distribution of mGluR1a GFP was also examined with and without Siah1a Figure 3A upper illustrates a cell injected with cDNA encoding mGluR5a myc alone and coexpressing pEGFP as a positive marker for expression Column 1 Phase and column 2 GFP show a phase contrast image and GFP fluorescence of such a cell Column 3 anti myc cy3 shows surface labeling of the extracullular myc epitope on mGluR5a myc using a cy3 fluorescently conjugated primary antibody Live cells were exposed to antibody prior to fixation to ensure that only receptors expressed on the cell surface would be detected Uninjected cells displayed no detectable cy3 labeling data not shown In similarly treated cells coexpressing Siah1a surface expression measured as total cell fluorescence figure 3B was not significantly reduced p 0 33 and no receptor clustering was observed figure 3A lower Similar experiments using a GFP tagged group I mGluR GFP mGluR1a indicated no detectable changes in receptor distribution when coexpressed with Siah1a figure 3C These data suggest that neither a reduction in receptor levels nor a change in receptor association with scaffolding proteins appears to be responsible for the diminished group I mGluR mediated calcium current modulation observed in the presence of Siah1a Does Siah1a target group I mGluRs for proteolysis Siah1a has been shown to be a member of the ubiquitin family of proteins involved in protein degradation through the proteasome 30 31 33 Therefore group I mGluR degradation was considered a potential mechanism for the decrease in mGluR mediated calcium current modulation observed in SCG neurons Although an obvious decrease in receptor levels in the presence of Siah1a was not detected figure 3 it is possible that introduction of high levels of Siah1a changed the rate of mGluR degradation such that a new equilibrium was reached with lower levels of active receptor than in the absence of Siah1a Such a change may have been difficult to detect with the fluorescence techniques used here figure 3 Therefore a deletion mutant of Siah1a was constructed GFP Siah1a CT with the N terminal RING fmger domain deleted This RING fmger domain has been shown to be necessary for the ubiquitination function of Siah1a 46 As a positive control for expression this construct was fused to the C terminus of GFP figure 5A Figure 4Aillustrates sample currents from a cell expressing mGluR5a alone As with mGluR5b mGluR5a produced a rapid and reversible calcium current inhibition when 100 M glutamate was applied to the bath figure 4B Coexpression of GFP Siah1a CT caused a significant reduction in the magnitude of calcium current modulation via mGluR5a figure 4C D Glutamate mediated calcium current inhibition in cells expressing mGluR5a alone was 33 4 n 7 In cells expressing mGluR5a and GFP Siah1a CT inhibition was reduced to 14 3 n 6 p 0 05 figure 5B Therefore a ubiquitin deficient Siah1a construct that can bind mGluRs is capable of producing a similar reduction in mGluR mediated calcium current modulation as the full length Siah1a This suggests that the effect of Siah1a on group I mGluRs is a result of its physical association with the receptor rather than a change in receptor levels The role of Calmodulin Calmodulin CaM a calcium binding protein intricately involved in intracellular signaling interacts with the C terminal tail of group I mGluRs 25 This interaction appears to be dynamically regulated Phosphorylation of the receptors at specific sites prevents CaM binding to mGluRs 25 Association of Siah1a with group I mGluRs can also prevent the interaction of CaM and the receptor 36 This competition for binding was predicted due to the overlap in binding sites on the C terminal tail for CaM and Siah1a 36 Although CaM has been known to associate with group I mGluRs for some time the functional role of this interaction is unknown However CaM can also interact with group III mGluRs 26 28 Recent data suggests that the association of CaM with group III mGluRs is necessary for normal G protein activation 27 By analogy to group III mGluRs the ability of Siah1a to compete with CaM for binding to group I mGluRs was considered a potential mechanism for the actions of Siah1a on group I mGluR mediated calcium current inhibition Therefore overexpression of CaM was tested for its ability to reverse the effect of Siah1a Calcium current inhibition in cells expressing the group I mGluR mGluR5b was 29 2 figure 6 n 21 similar to that through other group I mGluRs tested see figure 2 Coexpression of Siah1a caused a reduction in calcium current modulation to 12 3 as observed previously n 14 Next when CaM was coexpressed with mGluR5b and Siah1a calcium current modulation was significantly increased over that in cells expressing mGluR5b and Siah1a to 25 5 n 12 figure 6 Finally CaM binding to the mGluRs did not appear to be Ca 2 dependent When results obtained in the presence of 11 mM EGTA a relatively high level of Ca 2 buffering were compared to those in low Ca 2 buffering with 0 1 mM intracellular BAPTA no difference was detected Under low Ca 2 buffering conditions calcium current inhibition in control mGluR5b alone was 25 4 n 9 With Siah1a and Siah1a CaM inhibition was 7 6 n 3 and 30 18 n 3 respectively Since the results were indistinguishable with high or low Ca 2 buffering the data from both sets were pooled in the final results figure 6 It should also be noted that coexpression of CaM with mGluR5a in the absence of Siah1a yields no changes in calcium current modulation data not shown These results indicate that the presence of high levels of CaM can reverse the effect of Siah1a on calcium current modulation presumably by competing for binding on the C terminal tail of the receptor The data imply two possible mechanisms for the effect of Siah1a on mGluR signaling First CaM association with group I mGluRs increases G protein coupling or perhaps is required as may be the case with group III mGluRs This model predicts that Siah1a association produces its effect by disrupting the interaction of CaM with the group I mGluRs In this case it must be assumed that under control conditions cells heterologously expressing only the receptors mGluRs associate with natively expressed CaM CaM expression levels would presumably be much lower natively than in cells injected with CaM cDNA When Siah1a is caused to express heterologously at presumably high levels it expresses at levels high enough to out compete native CaM for mGluR binding Alternatively the presence of Siah1a itself may occlude G protein coupling with the CaM interaction being incidental Since a portion of the C terminal tail of group I mGluRs is involved in G protein activation 43 this model is plausible However only the proximal 20 amino acids of the C terminal tail appear to be involved in G protein coupling The site of Siah1a interaction is 50 residues distal to that site 36 Although this does not rule out this model it suggests that it may be less likely than the former model which implicates CaM as the pivotal interacting protein However until a more detailed picture of these interactions is available it will be difficult to answer this question definitively Nonetheless the data presented here suggest a novel role for Siah1a and CaM in regulating the function of group I mGluRs The notion that Siah a putative ubiquitin ligase would have other roles in cell signaling is not surprising Many RING finger containing proteins that may act as ubiquitin ligases under certain conditions have otherwise diverse structures and functions 32 It is clear that Siah can act in the ubiquitin pathway targeting some proteins for proteolysis under certain circumstances In addition the data presented here do not rule out the possibility that Siah may target group I mGluRs to the proteasome should they become damaged misfolded or should other conditions in the cell warrant mGluR proteolysis At this time however there is no evidence to support this claim Still it appears likely that Siah1a may play an important role in mGluR signaling in addition to any putative function regarding the proteasome pathway Further studies will be needed to determine if group I mGluRs and Siah1a interact physiologically and whether this interaction has functional consequences For example are these proteins coexpressed in certain regions of the brain Do they co localize when expressed in a particular cell type If the results presented here can be exprapolated to physiological situations that involve group I mGluRs Siah1a expression in the mammalian nervous system could potentially play a role in cell excitability by influencing mGluR mediated potassium current modulation of M type currents and perhaps of GIRK currents and synaptic plasticity due to the role that group I mGluRs play in these processes 2 5 38 Conclusions The findings described here demonstrate that the mammalian homologue of seven in absentia Siah1a regulates the function of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors Sympathetic neurons from the rat SCG that were made to express Siah1a with a group I mGluR attenuated mGluR mediated calcium current modulation This attenuation did not appear to be accompanied by a reduction in cell surface expression levels of receptor nor by an obvious change in receptor distribution in the cells Further a mutant of Siah1a was constructed with the RING finger domain deleted such that the protein was unable to act in the ubiquitin proteasome pathway 46 This deletion construct was as effective in attenuating group I mGluR function as the wild type Siah1a providing supporting evidence that the effect of Siah1a resulted from its physical association with the receptors rather than through a resulting reduction in receptor expression levels Finally coexpression of CaM reversed the effect of Siah1a on mGluR5b indicating that the interaction of CaM and Siah1a in binding to group I mGluRs plays a novel and important role in mGluR function
