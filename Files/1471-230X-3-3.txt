 Background Endothelial cell adhesion molecules ECAMs play essential roles in the development of chronic inflammation by recruiting leukocytes especially lymphocytes to tissues ECAMs support several forms of leukocyte adhesion including rolling firm adhesion and extravasation 1 Infiltration of tissues by leukocytes is a common hallmark of many chronic inflammatory states that include the inflammatory bowel diseases IBD ulcerative colitis UC and Crohn s disease CD In the setting of IBD the expression of ECAMs like ICAM 1 VCAM 1 and MAdCAM 1 mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 is observed in experimental models of colitis 2 3 4 5 and also within the inflamed human colon in Crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis 6 7 Among the adhesion molecules up regulated in IBD MAdCAM 1 the mucosal cell adhesion molecule is thought to be preeminent in the development of chronic gut inflammation MAdCAM 1 is normally expressed in the gut and its expression is dramatically amplified during inflammation 2 3 The functional significance of increased appearance of MAdCAM 1 in IBD is supported by several reports which show that immunoneutralization of either MAdCAM 1 or its ligand the 4 7 integrin attenuate inflammation and mucosal damage in animal models of colitis 8 9 10 However since monoclonal antibodies directed against other ECAMs particularly VCAM 1 can as well reduce disease activity in colitis models 11 12 13 14 the literature suggests that MAdCAM 1 is probably necessary but insufficient for the maximal penetrance of experimental and probably also clinical IBD Based on these findings it is apparent that a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating ECAM expression especially that of MAdCAM 1 might help to devise improved therapies for colitis It has been suggested that pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of IBD Furthermore changes in leukocyte migration and cytokine production appear to contribute the perpetuation of IBD 15 Based on modern advances recombinant anti inflammatory cytokines i e IL 10 treatment is now being developed for experimental colitis and human IBD IL 10 produced by macrophages and monocytes appears to limit chronic inflammation 16 17 18 through a decreased release of inflammatory factors IL 1 IL 6 IL 12 TNF GM CSF GCSF suppression of adhesive determinants MHC class II molecule 7 and by blocking ICAM 1 induction 19 20 21 22 23 24 Conversely IL 10 gene knockout mice develop a chronic colitis that is extremely similar to IBD 25 IL 10 treatment can reduce inflammation in several models of colitis 26 27 28 29 30 and human IBD 31 32 33 34 35 However the clinical efficacy of systemically administered IL 10 for patients mild to moderately active Crohn s disease has not been as effective as hoped 33 34 35 Furthermore the efficacy of IL 10 administration in mouse colitis models is contentious 36 We have described in vitro that exogenous IL 10 can block the expression of MAdCAM 1 in response to TNF and attenuates lymphocyte adhesion to lymphatic node derived endothelium under cytokine stimulating conditions via NF kB inhibition 5 The purpose of the current study was to show that induction of endothelial expression of IL 10 through an IL 10 expression vector attenuates MAdCAM 1 expression in response to TNF and optimistically suggests the possibility of targeted Th2 cytokine gene therapy in IBD Methods Reagents Recombinant mouse TNF was purchased from ENDOGEN Stoughton MA amd plasmid containing human IL 10

vector which was established by Dr Xianmin Meng based on the pCY4B vector 40 Cultured SVEC endothelial cells seeded in 24 wells were transfected at 70 confluency with SuperFect Qiagen Briefly 1 g plasmid DNA was diluted with 60 l DMEM and then 5 l Superfect 3 mg ml was added After incubation at room temperature for 10 min the complex was mixed with 350 l medium and added to the each wells After 2 h at 37 C 5 CO2 the complex was aspirated and washed 2 times with medium following replace by 1 ml of medium After incubation at 37 C for 24 h cells were stimulated with TNF Western analysis of cell lysates 24 h of IL 10 gene transfer monolayers were treated with TNF 1 ng ml 24 h All cell samples were harvested at 24 hours Equal quantities of protein 75 g from each sample were electrophoretically separated on 7 5 SDS PAGE gels Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes Sigma and blocked with 5 milk powder in PBS at 4 C overnight These membranes were washed twice for 10 min with wash buffer 0 1 milk powder in PBS Primary rat anti mouse MAdCAM 1 mAb was added at a concentration of 10 g ml and incubated at room temperature for 2 h These membranes were washed twice

the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL detection system Amersham La Jolla CA The density of MAdCAM 1 staining was measured by scanning the 60 kD band using a HP ScanJet flatbed scanner Images were analyzed for density using Image Pro Plus image analysis software Media Cybernetics The data are expressed as a percentage of TNF induced level of density In each protocol treatments were performed at least in triplicate TK 1 lymphocyte adhesion assay Briefly TK 1 cells were suspended in culture medium and fluorescence labeled by incubating TK 1 cells at 2 10 6cells ml with 0 02 mg fluorescein diacetate FDA Sigma at 37 C for 30 min The cells were then washed twice with ice cold HBSS spun at 250 g for 5 min to remove unincorporated fluorescence and suspended in HBSS The TK 1 lymphocyte cell line used in this assay expresses high levels of the 4 7 integrin 39 41 which can interact with multiple ligands including mucosal addressin 1 MAdCAM 1 as well as VCAM 1 L selectin and fibronectin 42 In this system TNF stimulated TK 1 adhesion to SVEC4 10 endothelial cells is at least 50 MAdCAM 1 dependent 41 SVEC monolayers were grown in 48 well plates as described and to activate endothelium the monolayers were incubated with TNF 1 ng ml for 24 h Cytokine treated endothelial cells were washed three times with media Labeled TK 1 cells were then added to the endothelium at a 5 1 lymphocyte to

mean SD Data were analyzed using multiple comparisons Probability P values of 0 05 were considered significant Results Secretion of human IL 10 concentration by transfected endothelial cells To screen for the efficacy of IL 10 transfected SVEC we initially measured the IL 10 concentration in the medium prior to gene transfection There was no detectable human IL 10 signal in the non transfected cell medium control nor any mouse IL 10 data not shown However the medium from the IL 10 transfected SVEC medium showed a large and significant increase in the IL 10 concentration 1209 2 pg ml at 48 h after IL 10 gene transfection Figure 1 Importantly SVEC cells transfected with this vector showed no evidence of toxicity altered proliferation and morphologically were indistinguishable from mock transfected and untreated controls MAdCAM 1 expression in IL 10 gene transfected endothelial cells The anti inflammatory effect of IL 10 gene transfection in endothelial cells was measured by the reduction in the expression of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule MAdCAM 1 induced by TNF 1 ng ml 24 h TNF strongly induced expression of MAdCAM 1 This effect was significantly reduced by IL 10 gene transfection Fig 2 Alone the IL 10 gene transfection had no effect on MAdCAM 1 expression 4 7 integrin lymphocyte adhesion to IL 10 gene transfected endothelial cells Having established that IL 10 gene transfection exerts a significant protective effect against TNF stimulated endothelial MAdCAM 1 induction we next examined the effects of IL 10 gene transfection on the adhesion of 4 7 expressing lymphocytes using the mouse cell line TK 1 to endothelial monolayers TNF stimulation 1 ng ml 24 h significantly increased the adhesion of TK 1 lymphocytes to SVEC monolayers IL 10 gene transfection significantly reduced TK 1 adhesion in response to TNF stimulation at 24 h Fig 3 Alone IL 10 gene transfection did not modify the basal level of lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelium without TNF treatment Discussion MAdCAM 1 is a 60 kDa endothelial cell surface molecule that is strongly expressed by mucosal endothelial cells particularly following exposure of these cells to pro inflammatory cytokines such as TNF Expression of MAdCAM 1 has also been reported in the brain and in the heart 44 45 based on these findings it is now been suggested that MAdCAM 1 might play roles in chronic inflammation of these organs as well With respect to inflammatory bowel disease MAdCAM 1 appears to be essential to the lymphocyte homing to the mucosa associated lymphoid tissue MALT 6 37 38 46 Since MAdCAM 1 is normally expressed mainly within the gut microvasculature and is dramatically amplified during IBD it has been suggested that increased MAdCAM 1 expression contributes to the etiology of IBD through its ability to direct homing of lymphocytes to the gut This notion is well supported by several reports that show that antibodies directed against either MAdCAM 1 or its lymphocyte ligand the 4 7 integrin will significantly attenuate several indices of gut damage in experimental models of colitis 9 47 Several studies have indicated that T helper Th1 immune response has important roles in the development of IBD 48 49 50 Moreover dysregulation of cytokine networks is involved in Th1 dominant immune responses in IBD 48 49 50 Among the Th1 cytokines TNF is thought to be perhaps the most important cytokine responsible for driving the onset and evolution of IBD Because of this prime role of TNF in IBD anti TNF antibody therapy has been very successfully used in IBD to reduce both colonic injury and expression of ECAMs in IBD 51 IL 10 a cytokine produced by activated macrophages and Th2 type T cells has crucial inhibitory effect against several Th 1 type immune responses such as the antigen presenting functions of monocytes and macrophages 52 53 IL 10 may play an important role in preventing the induction of IBD since animals deficient in IL 10 will develop colitis spontaneously and low levels of IL 10 are positively correlated with recurrences of Crohn s disease 25 54 However unlike TNF based therapies the administration of recombinant IL 10 rIL 10 shows poor clinical efficacy This may reflect the fact that TNF therapies for IBD are aimed at efficiently clearing TNF while IL 10 therapies must increase IL 10 and recombinant IL 10 is likely too rapidly cleared from the circulation after in vivo administration to provide a uniform protection 55 On the other hand IL 10 gene transfer technology has been used with some success in models of colitis however its effectiveness is also variable One reason for this variability may be that the final serum IL 10 concentration of gene transfected mice might be below the critical threshold needed for gut protection 55 56 Therefore targeting of the IL 10 gene to the inflamed colon should ideally exploit tissue i e gut specific promoters to control selective organ gene transfer technology endothelial specific promoters and also organ specific intra arterial injection of vector to activate some genes in specific locations 57 Administration of IL 10 in vitro prevents TNF stimulated expression of MAdCAM 1 and also blocks lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells to the same extent as dexamethasone treatment currently a key therapy in IBD 5 Interestingly the low basal levels of MAdCAM 1 expressed by control cytokine unstimulated cells were not affected by IL 10 transfection This suggests that basal expression of MAdCAM 1 is IL 10 independent while cytokine stimulated MAdCAM 1 is modulated by IL 10 While we previously showed that delivery of IL 10 to the endothelium in vitro is protective against TNF 5 in vivo IL 10 has not been as effective There are at least two regulating pathways in ECAM expression one is a cytokine dependent pathway which is widely studied and the other is cytokine independent 58 IL 10 apparently prevents cytokine induced NF kB binding activity to the ECAM promoter 59 and blocks the excessive expression of ECAMs in cytokine mediated inflammatory conditions In this regard IL 10 has been used as a treatment in inflammatory diseases like IBD for precisely this reason because it has few effects at sites remote from inflammation Similarly we found that IL 10 transfection did not affect cell morphology total protein level or the expression of actin and vimentin in these cells measured by Ponceau red S staining density on immunoblots Therefore methods like endothelial gene transfection transfer in vivo may effectively maintain adequate IL 10 concentrations near the endothelial cells that finally achieve the protection against cytokines that is not uniformly produced by systemic IL 10 administration The most important index for how well gene mediated recombinant IL 10 delivery might work in IBD appears to be measurement of the inhibition of lymphocyte endothelium binding mediated by TNF induced MAdCAM 1 expression In this experiment IL 10 induction in the endothelium efficiently blocked TNF induced MAdCAM 1 expression and 4 7 dependent lymphocyte adhesion on SVEC endothelial cells IL 10 deficiency in colitis increases expression of several ECAMs including ICAM 1 VCAM 1 and MAdCAM 1 60 We performed an experiment where under non stimulated conditions only 55 7 5 4 as many of the TK 1 lymphocytes bound to SVEC compared to TNF stimulation 100 or maximal binding TK 1 were seen to interact with SVEC through ICAM 1 as well MAdCAM 1 but not VCAM 1 since an antibody against MAdCAM 1 reduced adhesion to 27 4 6 of maximum and an anti ICAM 1 reduced adhesion to 54 6 8 3 of maximum anti VCAM 1 reduced adhesion to 91 of maximum blocks lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial cells data not shown Therefore we feel that adhesion in this system is mostly MAdCAM 1 dependent IL 10 transfection of endothelial cells reduced MAdCAM 1 expression by 42 following TNF stimulation and reduced TK 1 adhesion by 50 Therefore these data suggest that the reduction of TK 1 adhesion is approximately 84 42 50 MAdCAM 1 dependent and that the remaining 16 of adhesion depends on other ECAMs such as ICAM 1 Although tissue specific promoters might further increase the organ specificity and transgene delivery of this approach they have not been evaluated in this report Our findings suggest that lymphatic or gut endothelial transfection with Th2 cytokines like IL 10 may be an effective method to reduce important clinical symptoms associated with IBD which are mediated by MAdCAM 1 dependent lymphocyte adhesion
