 PLoS Medicine is a sufficiently new journal that we are often doing something for the first time This issue s first is the publication of a research article that reports data exclusively from animals more precisely from six cynomolgus macaques used to test the efficacy of a new Lassa fever vaccine There is no question that animal studies are an important part of medical research but which ones if any belong in a medical journal More to the point which ones belong in PLoS Medicine Although our journal s focus is on human studies we have decided on occasion to publish animal studies that have important and proximal implications for clinical research and maybe even practice Lassa fever causes serious morbidity and mortality in West Africa The virus s natural hosts are rodents and as there is little chance for effective rodent control in the endemic areas a vaccine is the most feasible way to gain control of the disease Several research groups around the world have worked on vaccine development and their efforts have been boosted by the classification of Lassa virus as a Category A bioweapons agent but to date no vaccine is available for either general or high risk application in humans Thomas Geisbert and colleagues have developed and now report tests of a recombinant vaccine based on a replication competent vesicular stomatitis virus DOI 10 1371 journal pmed 0020183 One shot of this vaccine protected four out of four vaccinated monkeys against a lethal virus challenge whereas the two control animals died making the vaccine a serious candidate for future application in humans Clearly many issues about this vaccine still need to be resolved such as vector safety duration of protection and breadth of protection there are at least four distinct Lassa virus strains Nevertheless we accepted this paper because we and our advisers felt that the research was at a stage where clinical questions such as patient safety and design of early human trials should inform any additional studies in animals The proper place for such a study is we believe a clinical journal There are several other types of animal studies we consider appropriate for publication in PLoS Medicine These include studies that explore off label uses of approved medical interventions in validated animal disease models again based on the studies direct relevance to potential treatment of human patients More often we would publish human studies that also include experimental animal data which typically explore molecular mechanisms suggested by the human data Animal studies that are submitted to medical journals can be broadly divided into two groups animal clinical trials and exploratory studies We will assess the former in a similar way to how we look at human trials This assessment will include not only the ethical conduct of the study and approval by the respective regulatory authority but also the rigor of the methodology Too often animal clinical trials i e prospective hypothesis testing studies that evaluate the effects of a health related intervention in animals are not performed with the same rigor that has been developed over past decades and widely adopted by the clinical research community In particular animal studies often have inappropriate controls are underpowered involve researchers monitoring outcomes who are not blinded to treatment allocation or lack proper statistical analysis Exploratory studies designed to yield insight into disease etiology pathology or the mechanisms by which a particular treatment affects a disease state are a crucial early part of the translation of basic research findings into clinical practice However by and large they will not be appropriate for PLoS Medicine Instead we encourage submission of important advances from this early translational stage to PLoS Biology our flagship open access biology journal www plosbiology org It would be foolish to deny the existence of a sizeable grey area between these types of study Between our journals we will try to provide open access publication for any important study at this interface between biology and medicine and will be happy to talk with authors on a case by case basis In addition we currently cross reference studies between the two journals and will do so even more when our new journals come on line For example PLoS Medicine has published a number of Perspectives on research articles published in PLoS Biology and PLoS Biology regularly highlights papers from PLoS Medicine on its home page In this way because all our journals are open access the difference to the reader between a paper published in PLoS Medicine and any other PLoS journal is just a rodent click
