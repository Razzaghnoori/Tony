 okay we re supposed to talk about what the weather s been like let s see uh it s been pretty windy yeah it s been windy the past few weeks i ve noticed that yeah so far has been hasn t been too much rain which is really nice because last week all that rain and it was just bad with all the flooding when uh Trinity Mills Road flooded over all those times you couldn t i couldn t pass by it yeah oh yeah oh really well i i didn t have to go down there but uh uh driving on the freeway was uh made it difficult because everybody couldn t get off and they d get off somewhere else uh huh right well you know they said that we haven t had enough rain though and that surprises me because it seems like we ve had a lot of rain this year but since we ve uh last i heard that we hadn t met our you know hadn t got up to the right level yet that we yeah the current average or whatever right well it truly surprises me because it seems like we seems like we do get a lot of rain but i guess not i guess it doesn t accumulate too much but um i m glad it s summer yeah finally i like the warm weather me too and the winter wasn t that bad i was really grateful that it didn t get that bad this winter yeah i m not uh fan of cold weather i ve lived up in in the northern part of the country and i never did like the cold weather that much i don t either i want some you know ski or something you know i m benefiting from it yeah yeah i guess in a way i just i really like the summer like to uh be able to lay out or you know just be outside yeah i don t mind the heat that much it doesn t bother me that much cold weather i just i don t know i just can t tolerate too much with the yeah i know it seems like you can never get warm enough to yeah so i like Texas it s a nice place to be i do too and so i guess it s probably the same over where you re at in Garland as opposed to Lewisville yeah yeah i would think i don t know might be a little bit different because the city interferes with the weather patterns to a certain extent because of the heating of the of the concrete and asphalt true that s true that s true it does seem to uh that s why they say always say it s like five degrees warmer in the city at night time than out in the country uh huh uh huh i do like um like an old uh warm summer the breezes that it gets at night you know you can open your windows and yeah oh and it gets those nice warm breezes coming in that s nice yeah and that helps on utilities of course who can t use that yeah and that s especially in Garland it s real bad yeah especially in Texas period yeah yeah well we didn t have much we had some good ice but not a lot thank goodness not well have you lived in Texas all your life yeah sure have how about you no uh this is this is the fifth state i ve lived in are you serious yeah so i ve just been all over the country and uh some places had really cold weather when i was living in Indiana it got really cold ugh i mean one day it was like sixty below zero are you serious and uh uh they said you know stay inside um in fact last year i was driving home one night and i was listening to some station some radio station in Iowa and uh the uh DJ was saying uh tonight s going to be like eighty below gosh and he said uh this is serious folks this is serious business stay inside do not go outside at any for any reason boy that s horrible and i thought yeah no kidding ooh i hate that that s horrible that of course that was last year when we had the real bad freeze you know in the country and this last winter wasn t wasn t that bad as as i remember it right know well that s true well a friend of mine went home this weekend uh he lives up in the uh Pan Handle uh huh and um he went home for Easter and it snowed up there and then the next day it was up to seventy five is that right yeah that would be horrible i wouldn t like that well you just can t depend on it schizophrenic weather yeah yeah it s just real comfortable here where we live and that s the way i like it i like being able to depend on a hot summer and yeah you know it does it gets cold enough in the winter to where you you realize it yeah and you can do your fires and everything and then move on yeah when i lived in California they had uh what i describe as boring weather it was the same virtually year round which what i thought was great you didn t have to worry about tornadoes you didn t have to worry about uh too cold or too hot it was just nice and even and i liked that it was it was nice yeah right yeah yeah but uh i don t mind the heat i don t either i don t i don t miss the cold at all but i don t mind the heat yeah yeah i wouldn t mind some you know like i guess after awhile in the summer when it hits i guess about October and you get a few cool days i don t mind that because it kind of gives you some relief yeah that s right it s kind of nice too to have that fall you know that s nice yeah spring and fall are nice times of the year yeah they really are spring because we re getting that getting rid of winter finally yeah and all the trees and plants are coming out thank goodness and grass yeah yeah for a change i i got i get sick of winter just looking everything so dead i hate that yeah no kidding so that s uh kind of depressing to see all that yeah yeah it really is it s just an old gray looking sky and it s boring yeah really i guess it wouldn t be bad if you i guess up north it wouldn t be bad to visit we we love to go skiing and um snow it s beautiful when it snows and you have all those pine trees and everything that is pr etty but i sure couldn t live there yeah yeah it s something you have to get used to i guess i mean i lived with that for a while and yeah you just adapt i guess so to a certain extent here in the summer time we go back and forth between air conditioned buildings there you go back and forth between warmed up areas i mean uh warm i guess so i remember when i was living in Indiana i was uh uh going going to school there and i used to ride my bike across campus and one day it was it must ve been close to ten degrees above zero and um God and i thought well if i ride my bike the wind chill will be close to zero it will last seven minutes six minutes if i walk it ll be ten degrees warmer but it will last twenty minutes um um hum that s right which do i want you know it s colder for a shorter time or a little bit warmer for a for a longer time and so i took the shorter colder option yeah hum right right i don t blame you i would too and i got down to where i uh to to the building i was going to and my face was about frozen off and i thought was that such a good choice i weren t quite so sure at that point i do hate that feeling though it oh yeah frostbites yeah yeah my fingers always get get it real bad i hate that i mean i bundle them up and everything and and i still get it yeah i guess i can bare the cold it s just when it does the wind hits oh yeah oh that just feels like it goes all the way to the bone it does you can feel all the way through it s like a knife like a sword like a sword a sword slicing in half or whatever yeah it hurts exactly hurts i hate it yeah oh well i don t know what else i can say about it well me either it s kind of a boring topic i guess well i guess that s all i to say you too all right then i m through you too bye bye have a good evening bye
