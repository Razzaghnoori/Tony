 Introduction In population studies a dose response relationship between short sleep duration and high body mass index BMI has been reported across all age groups 1 7 In the largest studied sample elevated BMI occurred for habitual sleep amounts below 7 8 h 2 A U shaped curvilinear relationship between sleep duration and BMI was observed for women but for men there was a monotonic trend towards higher BMI with shorter sleep duration Importantly a recent prospective study identified a longitudinal association between sleep curtailment and future weight gain 6 How sleep curtailment may interact with body weight is unknown but hormones regulating appetite and energy expenditure may be involved A number of hormones may mediate the interactions between short sleep duration metabolism and high BMI We hypothesized that the two key opposing hormones in appetite regulation leptin and ghrelin 8 9 play a significant role in the interaction between short sleep duration and high BMI Leptin is an adipocyte derived hormone that suppresses appetite 10 Ghrelin is predominantly a stomach derived peptide that stimulates appetite 9 11 Other mediators of metabolism that may contribute include adiponectin and insulin Adiponectin is a novel hormone secreted by adipocytes and is associated with insulin sensitivity 12 13 We investigated the associations among sleep duration acute and habitual metabolic hormones and BMI in the population based Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study 14 Methods Overview The institutional review board of the University of Wisconsin Medical School approved all protocols for the study and informed consent was obtained from all participants The Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study is an ongoing longitudinal study of sleep habits and disorders in the general population 14 Briefly to construct a defined sampling frame all employees aged 30 60 y of four state agencies in south central Wisconsin were mailed a survey on sleep habits health and demographics in 1989 Mailed surveys were repeated at 5 y intervals A stratified random sample of respondents was then recruited for an extensive overnight protocol including polysomnography at baseline Stratification was based on risk for sleep disordered breathing SDB with an oversampling of habitual snorers to ensure an adequate distribution of SDB Analyses were adjusted for the weighted sampling when appropriate Recruitment for baseline studies was staggered to conduct seven studies per week study entry and follow up time thus varied within the cohort Exclusion criteria included pregnancy unstable cardiopulmonary disease airway cancers and recent upper respiratory tract surgery The baseline response rate was 51 with most refusals due to the inconvenience of sleeping away from home Follow up studies have been conducted at 4 y intervals with up to three follow up studies to date Collection of morning fasted blood was added to the protocol in 1995 Extensive survey and other data available from the sampling frame have been used to evaluate the potential for response and drop out biases Figure 1 provides an overview of the study population and the data collected The sample comprised 1 024 participants with an overnight study and blood sample A 6 d diary of sleep duration was added as part of a protocol to assess daytime sleepiness after the initiation of the cohort study these data were available for 721 participants Data Collection This investigation is based on Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study data collected from the mailed sleep surveys overnight studies and 6 d sleep diaries Overnight studies were conducted in laboratory bedrooms with participants setting their own sleep and rise times After informed consent was obtained questionnaires on lifestyle and health history were administered and height and weight measured A blood sample was collected shortly after awakening from overnight polysomnography Polysomnography An 18 channel polysomnographic system was used to assess sleep states and respiratory and cardiac variables 14 Sleep was studied using electroencephalography electro oculography and chin electromyography Grass Instruments Quincy Massachusetts United States Continuous measurement of arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation by pulse oximetry Ohmeda Englewood Colorado United States oral and nasal airflow nasal air pressure and thoracic cage and abdominal respiratory motion Respitrace Ambulatory Monitoring Ardsley New York United States were used to assess SDB 14 Each 30 s interval of the polysomnographic record was scored for sleep stage and SDB using standard criteria 14 The average number of apneas and hypopneas per hour of measured sleep the apnea hypopnea index AHI was the measure for SDB For analyses including AHI as a covariate participants were excluded if they had sleep studies with less than 4 h of usable polysomnography or if they were receiving treatment for SDB Polysomnographic measures of acute sleep Polysomnographic measures of sleep duration just prior to blood sampling were used to evaluate degree of acute sleep restriction Total sleep time was total hours of polysomnographically defined sleep Wake after sleep onset WASO was hours of wake time after three epochs of sleep had occurred Sleep efficiency was total sleep time divided by time from lights out until arising in the morning Self reported sleep measures of chronic sleep Two variables were used to evaluate degree of chronic sleep restriction by estimating average nightly sleep duration i usual sleep from questionnaires and ii average nightly sleep from sleep diaries Questionnaire Usual sleep was estimated from the following questions how many hours of sleep do you usually get in a a workday night b a weekend or non work night These questions were included in all mailed surveys and were added to questionnaires completed at the overnight study in 1998 For participants studied after 1998 data from questionnaires administered at the overnight study were used 58 for the remainder of the sample data from the mailed survey closest in time to the overnight study were used Usual sleep was calculated as 5 workday sleep 2 weekend sleep 7 Sleep diary Average sleep duration was also estimated using a 6 d sleep diary kept by 721 participants as part of an added protocol to measure daytime sleepiness The median time between the blood collection and completion of the diary was 18 d Almost all diaries 97 were completed within 6 mo of blood sampling In diaries participants recorded the time they went to bed and arose each day and the duration of any naps Average nightly sleep was calculated as the sum of the hours between bedtime and arising divided by six Average nightly sleep plus naps added naps to the above sum The Relationship between BMI and Sleep Duration For the analysis of the association of BMI and sleep duration the sample comprised 1 040 participants with at least one 6 d sleep diary Of these 4 8 and 12 y follow up studies had been completed by 397 179 and 11 participants respectively 1 828 visits providing repeated measures data for greater analytic efficiency and precision Hormone Assays Following overnight fasting serum was collected soon after awakening and stored at 70 C All samples were assayed in duplicate It was not possible to assay samples from all participants in all assays because of the volume of serum available this particularly affected the ghrelin assay which required the most volume Leptin and insulin were determined using enzyme linked immunoassays ELISA Linco Research St Charles Missouri United States Total ghrelin and adiponectin were measured by radioimmunoassay Linco Research Sensitivity for the leptin and insulin enzyme linked immunoassays was 0 5 ng ml and 2 U ml respectively Sensitivity for the ghrelin and adiponectin radioimmunoassays was 10 pg ml and 1 ng ml respectively Intra and inter assay variations were all less than 5 and less than 10 respectively The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index QUICKI was 1 log I log G where I is fasting insulin and G is fasting glucose 15 16 Statistical Analysis All analyses were cross sectional and performed using SAS STAT 8 2 Leptin ghrelin and adiponectin were square root transformed and insulin log transformed based on the distribution of residuals from the multivariate regression models We evaluated the relationship of age sex BMI and time of storage of blood sample on hormones using multiple regression Partial correlations adjusted for age sex and BMI were calculated for hormones and QUICKI with and without control of other potential confounders The relationships between hormones and sleep were evaluated using multiple linear regression after control for potential confounders including age sex BMI SDB and morningness tendencies as measured using the Horne Ostberg questionnaire an indirect surrogate of earlier rising time In all analyses involving insulin glucose and QUICKI but not leptin ghrelin and adiponectin participants with diabetes self reported diagnosis or currently taking insulin or diabetic medications or with glucose 300 mg dl were excluded Participants with SDB were not removed from the analyses shown When controlling for AHI in models participants who used continuous positive airway pressure or who had inadequate sleep were excluded Because controlling for AHI did not significantly change the sleep hormone regression coefficients these analyses are not shown The relationship of BMI with average nightly sleep was evaluated using a quadratic fit This was examined using multiple visits n 1 828 from 1 040 participants with sleep diary data available Mixed modeling techniques were used to account for within subject correlation for participants with multiple visits SAS procedure mixed was used for modeling and hypothesis testing using robust standard errors and a compound symmetric within subject correlation structure All reported p values are two sided For illustrative purposes changes in leptin ghrelin and BMI for different sleep amounts were calculated at the average values and sex distribution of the relevant sample Results Table 1 shows the characteristics of the sample unadjusted for the weighted sampling scheme Figure 2 shows the mean BMI for 45 min intervals of average nightly sleep after adjustment for age and sex We found a significant U shaped curvilinear relationship between average nightly sleep and BMI after adjustment for age and sex average nightly sleep coefficient 2 40 p 0 008 average nightly sleep 2 coefficient 0 156 p 0 008 the two coefficients define a curve The minimum BMI was predicted at 7 7 h of average nightly sleep The most striking portion of the curve was for persons sleeping less than 8 h 74 4 of the sample where increased BMI was proportional to decreased sleep An increase in BMI from 31 3 to 32 4 3 6 corresponded approximately to an average nightly sleep duration decrease from 8 h to 5 h as estimated at the mean age 53 1 y and sex distribution 54 4 male of the sample with available sleep diary data Table 2 shows the association of each of the hormones glucose and QUICKI with age sex and BMI Serum ghrelin leptin adiponectin insulin and glucose were significantly correlated with BMI and sex Storage time had significant effects on some but not all variables in all cases however effect size was small and the effect was corrected for in all calculations Adiponectin and glucose were correlated with age Table 3 shows partial correlations among the measured and calculated variables adjusted for age sex and BMI All correlations agree with previous studies and validate our assays and population sample We also examined several potential confounders to be later controlled for if needed in our models Identified relationships included ghrelin with high density lipoprotein HDL alcohol intake and creatinine leptin with diastolic blood pressure smoking and blood urea nitrogen BUN adiponectin with HDL triglycerides uric acid and BUN insulin with HDL triglycerides uric acid and smoking glucose with HDL triglycerides uric acid alcohol intake BUN and creatinine QUICKI with HDL triglycerides uric acid smoking and BUN When diabetics diagnosed and participants with high glucose glucose 300 mg dl were removed from this analysis all relationships remained significant except for the correlation between ghrelin and adiponectin and ghrelin and insulin Using polysomnography to measure objective sleep immediately prior to blood sampling ghrelin correlated significantly with total sleep time sleep efficiency and WASO Table 4 Using questionnaire and diary data estimating chronic sleep significant correlations were found between leptin and average nightly sleep with and without naps and usual sleep amounts Table 4 A significant correlation was also observed between ghrelin and average nightly sleep plus naps These relationships were consistently found when other possible confounding factors such as medications hypertension AHI and factors listed above were included in the statistical model analysis not shown In unadjusted models leptin was significantly correlated with total sleep time and average weekly sleep with naps and ghrelin was significantly correlated with sleep efficiency and WASO Figure 3A shows the mean leptin levels for half hour increments of average nightly sleep after adjustment for age sex BMI and time of storage see Table 2 In the multiple regression model see Table 4 there was a significant increasing trend in leptin for average nightly sleep duration p 0 01 When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of our sample a decrease from 8 to 5 h in average nightly sleep was associated with a predicted 15 5 decrease in leptin Figure 3B shows the mean ghrelin levels for half hour increments of total sleep time after adjustment for age sex BMI and time of storage see Table 2 In the multiple regression model see Table 4 there was a significant decreasing trend in ghrelin with total sleep time p 0 008 When evaluated at the average values and sex distribution of our sample a decrease from 8 to 5 h of polysomnographically defined total sleep time was associated with a predicted 14 9 increase in ghrelin There was no significant correlation between sleep duration acute or chronic and serum adiponectin insulin glucose or QUICKI Results of our analyses were unchanged after adjusting for the weighted sampling scheme Discussion We found that habitual sleep duration below 7 7 h was associated with increased BMI similar to findings in other studies including children 1 17 adolescents 5 and adults 2 3 We also report a significant association of sleep duration with leptin and ghrelin that is independent of BMI age sex SDB and other possible confounding factors analysis not shown for SDB and other confounders Short sleep duration was associated with decreased leptin and increased ghrelin changes that have also been observed in reaction to food restriction and weight loss and are typically associated with increased appetite These hormone alterations may contribute to the BMI increase that occurs with sleep curtailment Previous studies have shown that both acute sleep deprivation 18 and chronic partial sleep deprivation sleep restriction 19 can cause a decrease in serum leptin concentrations These studies however were performed under highly controlled laboratory circumstances Our results validate the association of decreased leptin with decreased sleep time in a large sample of adults under real life conditions and now indicate a role for ghrelin Leptin deficiency increases appetite and produces obesity 8 20 Leptin administration suppresses food intake and reduces energy expenditure 21 22 Importantly low leptin as observed with sleep loss has a greater impact on appetite than high leptin levels which are associated with leptin resistance as occurs with obesity 8 Levels of ghrelin a potent stimulator of appetite 23 24 25 were higher in those with shorter sleep Ghrelin levels are also positively associated with hunger ratings 26 but decrease with increased BMI see Table 2 In one study after 3 mo of dietary supervision a reduction in BMI of approximately 5 was associated with a 12 increase in ghrelin and a 15 decrease in leptin 27 These changes in participants of similar BMI to our sample and presumably producing increased appetite are comparable to those observed with sleep loss of 2 3 h night With sleep loss however relatively high ghrelin and low leptin levels are associated with increased BMI These changes can be hypothesized to play a contributory rather than compensatory role in the development of overweight and obesity with sleep restriction Our findings are strengthened by the large and well characterized population based sample attention to bias and confounding factors and in laboratory polysomnographic data The changes in hormones with sleep duration were consistent and of significant magnitude They also represent the first demonstration of a correlation between peripheral hormone levels and both self reported questionnaire and diary data and polysomnographically determined sleep amounts in a general population sample While these data are more comprehensive than previous studies on this topic some misclassification error may exist because of intra person variability or limitations of polysomnographic measurement Little is known about the stability of self reported sleep duration and polysomnographic measures of sleep duration over time We examined the stability of the self reported sleep duration data and found these measures to be stable For 860 participants who completed three surveys the mean standard deviation of intra person differences in usual sleep for two 5 y periods was 0 10 0 47 h For 190 participants with at least three sleep diaries the mean standard deviation of intra person differences in average nightly sleep for two 4 y intervals was 0 09 0 41 h Furthermore the subjectively reported hours of usual sleep and the diary derived average nightly sleep values were highly correlated r 0 55 p 0 001 One night polysomnographically defined total sleep time had a similar intra person mean difference 0 10 h with a somewhat larger standard deviation 0 68 for 713 participants with at least three sleep studies Elevated ghrelin mainly correlated with acute sleep loss as measured by polysomnography immediately prior to blood sampling see Table 4 Figure 3B while reduced leptin correlated with chronic sleep restriction indicated by self reported sleep measures see Table 4 Figure 3A Measures of usual and one night polysomnographically defined sleep time were only weakly but statistically significantly correlated r 0 12 p 0 001 supporting the concept that these measures reflect long term and short term changes in sleep amounts respectively Our findings are in agreement with the current view that leptin is important in signaling long term nutritional status while ghrelin has a more significant role in acute hunger The changes in leptin and ghrelin with sleep restriction could therefore provide a powerful dual stimulus to food intake that may culminate in obesity Longitudinal and intervention studies will be necessary to define further the link between sleep curtailment and increased BMI Only total ghrelin was measured since active octanoylated ghrelin is unstable Although both total and active ghrelin appear to be regulated in a similar and parallel manner future studies will need to focus on measurement of the biologically active form Other potentially important appetite regulatory hormones such as PYY 3 36 28 were not measured Measures of appetite were not included in the Wisconsin Sleep Cohort Study overnight protocol therefore a direct examination of the relationship between the observed hormone changes with sleep duration and alterations in appetite was not possible Hormone measurements were all performed on a single fasted morning sample and may not reflect the 24 h profile It is possible that participants with shorter sleep woke up earlier and that hormone differences may be partially related to circadian time Leptin and ghrelin levels rise slightly during the night 29 and this could result in higher hormone levels in short sleepers This may be an issue for ghrelin as levels increased with acute sleep restriction It is however unlikely to play a role in the leptin finding since lower levels were found with chronic but not acute sleep restriction Additionally studies have shown a high correlation between morning fasting leptin and ghrelin levels and 24 h mean profile 29 30 We also found that the ghrelin and leptin changes were unaffected by morningness tendencies The fact that studies investigating the diurnal profile of these hormones found similar hormonal changes over the entire 24 h period after experimental sleep restriction also corroborates our results 18 19 The robustness of our findings and similar observations from smaller controlled studies 18 19 also suggest that our statistically significant results are unlikely to be a reflection of the number of analyses carried out Animal studies have suggested a link between sleep and metabolism 31 32 In rats prolonged complete sleep deprivation increased both food intake and energy expenditure The net effect was weight loss and ultimately death 33 Rats fed a high protein to calorie diet had accelerated weight loss compared to sleep deprived rats fed calorie augmented fatty diets 32 Food consumption remained normal in sleep deprived rats fed protein rich diets but increased 250 in rats fed calorie rich diets Preference for fatty foods has also been reported anecdotally in sleep deprived humans 32 34 Sleep deprivation may thus increase not only appetite but also preference for lipid rich high calorie foods Animal experiments that have found weight loss after prolonged sleep deprivation have to be interpreted in the context of a stressful procedure producing intense sleep debt 35 36 which may interfere with adequate food intake From our study we hypothesize that the moderate chronic sleep debt associated with habitual short sleep is associated with increased appetite and energy expenditure In societies where high calorie food is freely available and consumption uncontrolled after milder chronic sleep restriction the equation may be tipped towards food intake for high calorie food rather than expenditure culminating in obesity Short sleepers may also have more time to overeat Sleep loss from a baseline of 7 7 h was associated with a dose dependent increase in BMI This was the predominant effect in a population increasingly curtailing sleep 37 Sleep greater than 7 7 h however was also associated with increased BMI Patients with SDB a pathology associated with increased BMI may spend a longer time in bed to compensate for fragmented sleep however controlling for AHI did not change the curvilinear BMI sleep association Another possibility is that in long sleepers reduced energy expenditure due to increased time in bed has a greater impact than reduced food intake In favor of this hypothesis long sleepers exercise less 38 In our data we found that the odds ratio of high levels of self reported exercise 7 h wk based on a single survey question decreased with increased sleep time but controlling for this variable also did not change our findings analyses not shown Insulin resistance with sleep deprivation has been reported in a laboratory study of young healthy volunteers 39 When controlling for BMI we found no significant correlation between insulin glucose or adiponectin levels and various measures of sleep duration Also there was no significant correlation between QUICKI or the homeostatic model assessment HOMA 16 data not shown and sleep duration This may be due to difficulties in detecting small effects on glucose tolerance under less controlled conditions of large population studies Our results demonstrate an important relationship between sleep and metabolic hormones The direct effect of chronic partial sleep loss on food intake energy expenditure and obesity now needs to be explored Altering sleep duration may prove to be an important adjunct to preventing and treating obesity
