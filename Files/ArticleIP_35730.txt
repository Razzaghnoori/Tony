 Kenneth Starr a quot Witty and Benign Companion quot In an interview Tuesday with Britain s Daily Telegraph Kenneth Starr accused President Clinton of continuing to lie to the American people but reserved his harshest words for Monica Lewinsky The independent counsel s only stated regret was that he didn t do enough to stop Congress publishing the most salacious material in his report He deplored Congress decision to authorize publication of the unexpurgated evidence instead of screening and winnowing it first I wish I had done more to say to Congress be careful he said Some of the most sensitive evidence he gathered has never been made public he said and had the President seen fit to tell the truth we would have been spared the intrusive nature of the details But he said that much of the information published was vital to the credibility of Lewinsky s testimony Starr complained that even now a year later Clinton has admitted no offences other than to have the inappropriate relationship which is not a matter of interest to federal law To the contrary he has very vigorously stated that he at no time committed any federal offences Starr said that in one of the most unfortunate episodes of the entire drama Clinton made the decision when his relationship with Lewinsky came to light in January 1998 that he was not going to tell the truth He was advised by Dick Morris that the American people would readily forgive an adulterous relationship but they would not be forgiving of offences against the justice system And the President informed him Well we will just have to win then Thus instead of telling the truth admitting the facts and seeking forgiveness of family and nation he launched a campaign designed to erode confidence in the duly appointed system of justice Asked if he regretted the personal distress suffered by Lewinsky Starr replied She as an obviously highly intelligent young adult a professional a college graduate made a most unfortunate judgment and that was that she would commit federal crimes in order to obstruct the judicial process in the form of a sexual harassment action the Paula Jones case Not only that she importuned another person Linda Tripp to likewise engage in federal crimes That was serious business She did it not on the spur of the moment she did it over a considerable period of time She knowingly went to one of the most powerful lawyers in the country who in turn guided her to another lawyer to prepare what she knew to be a perjurious affidavit One should not blink at those kinds of offences Because of her decision not to be readily forthcoming Lewinsky had put the nation through seven months of a wretched and miserable 24 hour news cycle he said Miss Lewinsky did not co operate until July 1998 This could have been over in January The enduring lesson of the whole affair Starr said was that we in the United States take the law seriously and that we are all accountable The Telegraph a conservative paper that was vigorously anti Clinton throughout the scandal sponsored a lecture by Starr Tuesday His interviewer was much taken with him The grimly bespectacled prosecutor is only the public face he wrote In private he is a witty and benign companion He enjoys a Martini and is relaxed on the subject of sex by no means the prudish teetotaller portrayed by the White House One of the best legal minds of his generation he speaks in perfectly grammatical sentences with the same exhaustive precision as his celebrated report In an editorial Wednesday headlined Gore s Burden the Times of London said Vice President Al Gore s virtues are largely being ignored in the election campaign because of his intense and inevitable association with President Clinton to whom some 55 per cent of the electorate believe that Mr Gore is too close for their comfort If he is to beat Bill Bradley for the Democratic nomination he must emerge as something more than the President s favoured successor the paper said Mr Clinton secured the White House as the candidate of change In this respect at least Mr Gore has lessons to learn from his President But the main focus of the British press Wednesday was Prime Minister Tony Blair whose speech at the annual Labor Party Conference promising to end the class war create equality of opportunity and purge Britain forever of the forces of conservatism generated many editorials His vision of a nation more like America than Britain is laudable the Times said but he will have to pursue it with a passion and defend it with care The Daily Telegraph however called it a strangely nerve wracked speech at once belligerent and insecure that seemed to reveal an inner uncertainty about what his Government is trying to achieve and why The liberal Guardian said the speech was as accomplished as any speech Mr Blair has given but the Independent said real radicalism needs substance not just a collection of good tunes The Financial Times praised his radical rhetoric but also said he failed to explain how all this translates into hard edged policies Another FT editorial said the ice is breaking in corporate Japan with companies changing in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few years ago It concluded As Japan s politicians continue to posture in much the same old familiar ways the economy is at last beginning to be restructured from the bottom up But in Tokyo Asahi Shimbun dwelt on the human cost of this reporting a rapid rise in the number of Japanese businessmen diagnosed as psychotic depressives The trigger for their slide into mental illness is constant anxiety in the workplace it said Many are alarmed by the prospect that their company s restructuring drive will single them out Some of them check into a Tokyo psychiatric clinic at weekends in order to find the strength to go to work on Mondays when important business meetings are often held the paper added In Israel Ha aretz led its front page Wednesday with a report that the change of government in Israel has ended efforts by Russian mobsters to establish ties with Israeli government officials Such ties had been ripening under the premiership of Benjamin Netanyahu it said quoting police and intelligence sources but were broken after Ehud Barak won the election
