 Background The expression first pass metabolism FPM refers to the metabolism that an ingested compound undergoes in its passage through the gut and liver before reaching the systemic circulation It is a useful concept for a drug because it provides information about the relative therapeutic effect of an orally administered drug relative to its intravenous administration IV The standard approach to quantitate FPM is to compare the area under the curve AUC for equal IV and oral doses The fractional FPM is then defined as the fractional difference in these two areas The mathematical basis of this definition is based on the following arguments Given some time dependent input to the systemic compartment I t and some removal rate from the systemic compartment Q t the integral over all time of these two rates must be equal If the removal rate has a linear dependence on concentration Q t KC t then this total input can be related to the AUC Since the total input to the systemic compartment is proportional to the AUC eq 3 the fractional difference in the AUC for an oral and IV dose eq 1 is a measure of the amount of the oral drug that never reached the systemic compartment because of FPM This standard operational definition of FPM eq 1 is crucially dependent on the assumption that the removal rate is linear If this assumption is invalid then use of this definition can return very misleading results A recent review has described the confusion that has resulted from applying this definition to human ethanol pharmacokinetics a compound that has extremely non linear liver metabolism 1 For the non linear case the intuitive idea that FPM is equal to the fraction of the absorbed drug that is metabolized in its first pass through the liver is no longer valid 2 Consider the case where GI absorption is occurring at a time when the systemic drug concentration is so high that the liver metabolism is completely saturated and the metabolic rate is constant independent of concentration Clearly at this time the rate of drug metabolism for an oral input must be identical to that for an IV input so that FPM must be zero even though a large fraction of the absorbed drug may be metabolized in its first pass through the liver This metabolized GI component is simply displacing systemic drug that would otherwise have been metabolized In order to avoid these problems Lieber and colleagues 3 introduced a new definition of FPM based on estimating the Peripheral Availability PA of ethanol The PA is defined as the total amount of ethanol that reaches the systemic circulation Gentry et al 3 estimated the value of PA by assuming that the tail of the IV ethanol venous concentration curve can be approximated by a one compartment model in which the ethanol rate of metabolism M was defined by a Michaelis Menten function M VmC Km C The values of Vm and Km are found by curve fitting and then PA is defined as the integral of M from time 0 to a long time when no ethanol is present Thus PA is defined as the total amount of ethanol that was metabolized from the systemic circulation The FPM is then defined as the difference between the PA for an IV infusion and the PA for the oral intake of an identical dose This one compartment definition of FPM has become the standard definition in some laboratories 4 This definition of FPM of Gentry et al 3 is inaccurate because it is a poor approximation to treat ethanol metabolism as a one compartment system see below Levitt and Levitt 2 described an approach to estimate PA using a two compartment model They distinguished the liver ethanol that came directly from the GI tract from the recirculating ethanol and derived an accurate approximation for this recirculating component This 2 compartment approach provides a significantly more accurate and smaller estimate of FPM than the one compartment model The 2 compartment model still makes some simplifying assumptions These assumptions are eliminated in PKQuest 5 a new general purpose physiologically based pharmacokinetic PBPK software routine The approach used by PKQuest is to first use the IV input data to find the PBPK parameters for ethanol and then using these parameters solve for the time dependent IV input function that would produce a blood time course identical to the time course observed with the orally administered drug This IV input function is a direct measure of the rate that the oral dose reaches the systemic circulation i e the PA Using as input just the PBPK parameters and the blood ethanol levels produced by an oral dose PKQuest outputs in both tabular and graphical form the time course of the intestinal absorption and the PA see 5 for the mathematical and computational details The difficulty in defining the FPM of ethanol has created a controversy over the question of the magnitude of ethanol metabolism that occurs in the stomach before reaching the liver 1 It has been observed that the FPM is significantly reduced when ethanol is infused intraduodenally compared to the standard oral administration and this difference has been interpreted as representing gastric mucosal metabolism 6 7 8 Clearly if there are errors in the measurement of FPM then this estimate of gastric metabolism may be spurious In addition to providing a value for FPM PKQuest also provides a direct measurement of the rate and amount of the orally administered solute that reaches the liver In this paper PKQuest will be applied to investigations of human ethanol pharmacokinetics providing information about the FPM the time course of intestinal absorption and the total amount of ethanol reaching the liver This is the first human PBPK model for ethanol incorporating intestinal absorption and FPM Pistino and Conolly 9 have previously developed a rat PBPK that quantitated ethanol FPM The PKQuest program and all the examples used here are freely available on the WEB at www pkquest com Methods PBPK program and its assumptions PKQuest 5 was used for all the analysis in this paper All the figures shown in this paper are direct copies in jpeg format of standard PKQuest output PKQuest makes several simplifying assumptions see 5 for details It is assumed that each organ can be modeled as a single well stirred compartment In addition for the two solutes investigated in this paper D 2 O and ethanol it is also assumed that the blood tissue exchange is flow limited so that the unbound water concentration in the tissue is equal to that in the vein leaving the tissue This is clearly an approximation and effects such as diffusion gradients countercurrent exchange and heterogeneous organ blood flows 10 11 12 will produce small deviations from this assumption Standard human parameters The PBPK parameters used here are identical to those used in all the other applications of PKQuest 5 13 14 The procedures used for choosing and refining these parameters has been described in 5 Table 1lists

concentration after a 15 second bolus injection The results are for one experiment on one male subject J O total body water of 48 0 liters Table I 15 The amount of D 2 O injected was back calculated from the total body water and the concentration after 90 minutes when the D 2 O had equilibrated A baseline ethanol PBPK model was developed based on the careful and detailed measurements of Norberg et al 16 of the simultaneous breath and venous blood concentrations for a 30 minute constant IV ethanol infusion The concentration calculated from the breath measurements was in good agreement with the direct venous measurements The breath results were used here since they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample then the venous measurements from the cubital vein The total body water for each subject in this study was directly measured using D 2 O The time course of the mean values for all 16 subjects figure 1 16 was modeled using PKQuest The data of DiPadova et al 17 was used for the determination of the rate of absorption of oral ethanol along with calculations of the PA and FPM PKQuest was applied to the data plotted in figures 1and 3of DiPadova et al 17 which describe the mean blood ethanol for subjects given 0 15 g Kg body weight fig 1 or 0 3 g Kg fig 3 either orally with or without a breakfast or IV on alternate days The experimental data points were obtained by using UN SCAN IT Silk Scientific Corporation to read the data from the published figures Results Determination of baseline resting muscle blood flow The baseline resting muscle blood flow used in PKQuest was determined by fitting the D 2 O data of Schoerb et al 15 in which the arterial D 2 O concentration was measured after a 15 second venous injection of D 2 O As described previously 5 each compound modeled by PKQuest is characterized by a short Maple www maplesoft comprocedure that lists the model parameters that are unique for that solute The procedure for D 2 O is very simple because it corresponds to the default case so that very few parameters have to be input d20_schoerb proc defaultpar Wtot 81 9 standardhuman Wtot cunit 10 ml D20 10 ml liter is equivalent to vol concunit

9 Kg and total body water 48 liters This value for total body water 0 58 liter Kg corresponds to a body fat fraction of about 0 2 18 This subject was defined as the standardhuman Fat 0 2 The values of the water fraction parameter for each tissue compartment in PKQuest was then adjusted so that the model total body water equaled this measured value Since this man is the standardhuman all the PBPK parameter are input simply by calls to the defaultpar and standardhuman procedures All units in PKQuest are in terms of liters Kg and minutes The parameter cunit is the amount unit concentration cunit liter Since the D 2 O concentration was expressed in vol this corresponds to a cunit of 10 ml The only other information that is needed is concunit artery 3 which indicates that the input data is the arterial free water concentration The observed equilibrium concentration was 0 144 vol which corresponds to a total D 2 O dose of 69 05 ml or 276 ml min for 0 25 minutes or 27 6 units min if 1 unit 10 ml The output of PKQuest for this data is shown in fig 1A all of the figures in this paper are taken unmodified from the standard output of PKQuest The value for the resting muscle blood flow 0 0266 Lit min Kg was determined by adjusting the flow to optimize the fit to the data using the Powell minimization procedure of PKQuest The agreement between the PBPK prediction solid line and the experimental measurements squares is very good This agreement is sensitive to the value used for the muscle blood flow For example fig 1Bshows the effect of doubling the total muscle blood flow from this default best fit value of 0 0266 to 0 0532 liters min kg increasing the cardiac output from 6 06 to 6 93 liters min for a 70 Kg man Muscle blood flow can vary many fold and one would expect that it would depend on the specific experimental conditions such as whether the subject was supine or ambulatory In any case muscle blood flow is routinely varied when fitting data with PKQuest This variation may have some physiological significance and or it may be just a fudge factor Standard Ethanol PBPK parameters The recent measurements of Norberg et al 16 of the time course of ethanol blood levels after an IV input were used to determine the standard ethanol PBPK parameters PKQuest was used to model the time course of the mean blood values of the 16 subjects 8 men 8 women This data was expressed as the concentration in the blood in units of millimoles liter of blood water Both breath and direct venous sampling results were reported and they were in very good agreement The results shown in fig 2use the breath measurements since they should be closer to the ideal of an arterial sample then the venous measurements from the cubital vein The PKQuest procedure that is used for

value for Fat fraction of body weight that is fat of 0 24 was chosen so that the model subject had a water volume equal to the average D 2 O volume of distribution of the 8 males and 8 females in the study 44 5 liters for 80 Kg human The muscle blood flow was the same as the default value that was used in fig 1Afor the D 2 O data Since liver metabolism accounts for greater than 95 of ethanol removal it is assumed that the liver is the only site of ethanol elimination 19 The liver metabolic constants Vm 2 1 millimoles min for 80 Kg man Km 0 04 mM were adjusted using the Powell minimization procedure of PKQuest to give the best fit to the data These values refer to the free water concentration in the liver see 5 for details There are a number of isoenzymes of alcohol dehyrogrenase ADH in the human liver and this model Km of 0 04 mM is consistent with the in vitro Km of 0 048 mM observed for one of these isoenzyme 20 It is assumed that ethanol distributes in the total body water which is the default in PKQuest The parameter fw lipid 1 0 074 represents the inverse of the oil water partition coefficient and indicates that the equilibrium ethanol concentration in the body fat is 7 4 of the concentration in body water 21 The ethanol dose was 0 4 gm Kg given as a constant 30 minute infusion corresponding to an infusion rate of 23 15 millimoles min for an 80 Kg human This Maple procedure ethanol_norberg completely specifies the PBPK parameters All the other model parameters are set by the calls to defaultpar and standardhuman Figure 2shows the output of PKQuest for this input Again the agreement between the PBPK prediction for the arterial blood concentration solid line and the observed breath data squares is quite good Quantitation of ethanol first pass metabolism FPM DiPadova et al 17 measured the blood ethanol in subjects that were given the same dose of ethanol either IV 20 minute constant infusion or orally over 10 minutes on consecutive days Figure 3shows the venous concentrations as a function of time when a low dose of ethanol 0 15 g Kg equivalent to approximately 12 oz of beer was given at the same time as a standard breakfast either IV black or orally red The area under the oral dose curve is only 27 of that for the IV dose This would correspond to a FPM of 73 if metabolism was linear i e only 27 of the orally ingested ethanol reaches the systemic circulation As will be shown below the actual FPM is much less than this The data in fig 3was analyzed using PKQuest Figure 4Ashows the agreement between the PBPK model and the venous plasma ethanol concentration for the IV input data The PBPK parameters used in this calculation were identical to those used for figure 2except that the portal blood flow was increased 50 because of the coincident meal 22 23 24 the liver Vm was increased from 2 1 to 2 5 because of the induced ethanol effect 25 26 and the muscle blood flow was doubled Also the parameter concunit vein was set 2 indicating that the whole blood venous concentration was used as the input data Figure 4Bshows the output of PKQuest when the findabsorption 5 option was applied to the oral ethanol input data Since the IV and oral data used for figs 4Aand 4Bwere collected in the same subjects under identical conditions exactly the same PBPK parameters where used for both calculations The open squares show the time course of the predicted GI ethanol absorption amount entering the liver in the portal vein 5 The solid line is a 3 parameter approximation to the absorption data absorption at time t A t H t H T H where A total absorption H Hill exponent T half time It can be seen that the intestinal absorption fig 4B is complete within about 2 hours The total predicted absorption of 250 millimoles is slightly less than the actual total oral dose of 260 millimoles Although this is consistent with a small amount of gastric mucosal metabolism 10 millimoles it is probably not significant The calculation of the total absorption for this low dose is critically dependent on the accuracy of the venous blood measurements at long times Since the liver has such a low Km 0 04 mM significant amounts of intestinal absorption could be occurring at long times even though the venous concentration remained close to zero because of the high rate of liver clearance The fluctuation in the total absorption points at long times in fig 4Bis caused by errors in these long time blood measurements When the findabsorption option is used PKQuest also routinely calculates the time course of the Peripheral Availability PA indicated by the diamonds in fig 4BThe PA is defined as the equivalent IV input that would produce the observed venous concentration Thus an IV input with the time course of the diamonds in fig 4Bwould produce exactly the same blood concentration as a function of time as the GI absorption represented by the open squares PA is related to FPM by the relation FPM Total Dose PA Thus for the data used for fig 4B the PA of 160 millimoles corresponds to a FPM of 100 millimoles total dose 260 This represents 38 of the total dose about half the value of 73 using the classical AUC approach The FPM for this data was also estimated by using the one compartment approach 3 Figure 5Ashows the optimized one compartment Michaelis Menten fit to the tail of the venous ethanol data Vm 8 68 millimoles min Km 5 46 mM Figure 5Bshows the corresponding fit to the data of DiPadova etal 17 for a doubling 0 3 gm Kg of the oral dose see below Not surprisingly a one compartment model does not provide an accurate fit to the ethanol data The fit is better for the large input dose Using these values of Vm and Km the PA was determined for the IV and oral dose by assuming a one compartment model and integrating the liver metabolism VmC Km C where C equals venous blood concentration over the time For the data of fig 4 this one compartment method yielded a FPM of 59 This is less than the 73 estimated from the AUC but significantly greater than the 38 using PKQuest DiPadova et al 17 also measured the blood levels resulting from an IV or oral input of a larger ethanol dose 0 3 gm Kg total dose of 520 millimoles for the 80 Kg model subject and this time they also compared the fasting and standard breakfast case Figures 6Aand 6Bshow the PKQuest output for the IV and oral data when the ethanol was taken with the same standard meal as was used for the data in figs 4Aand 4B The parameters were identical to those used in figs 4except that the liver Vm was reduced from 2 5 to 2 4 a different set of subjects were used in the two sets of experiments It can be seen from fig 6Bthat for this higher dose the total peripheral availability diamonds is only about 40 millimoles less than the total dose of 520 millimoles corresponding to a fractional FPM of 7 This is much less than the FPM value of 44 determined by using the AUC approach or of 30 using the one compartment approach The time course of the intestinal absorption for the two doses compare fig 4Band fig 6B has the same shape e g same Hill coefficient but occurs over a slightly longer time for the larger dose Hill half time 34 minutes for 0 15 gm Kg dose and 48 minutes for 0 3 gm Kg dose presumably because the larger oral dose was ingested over a longer time 20 minutes for 0 3 gm Kg versus 10 minutes for 0 15 gm Kg Figures 7Aand 7Bshow the PKQuest output for the same ethanol dose 0 3 gm Kg given to fasting subjects The PBPK parameters for these experiments had the portal blood flow reduced back to the default fasting value Also the liver Vm was reduced back to 2 0 the same value that was used for the fasting data of Norberg et al 16 in fig 2 This change in ethanol metabolism is consistent with earlier observations that the rate of ethanol disappearance from the blood is increased by a coincident meal 25 26 It can be seen in fig 7Bthat the PA diamonds is nearly identical to the GI absorption squares so that FPM is close to zero for the fasting subjects The AUC and one compartment approach also indicate a small FPM for this case Discussion and conclusions Validity of the PBPK model The philosophy behind the use and development of PKQuest differs from that of the standard PBPK applications PBPK models have usually been applied to animal data where it is possible to accurately measure and control the relevant parameters tissue distribution organ blood flows etc In contrast for human studies not only are the PBPK parameters poorly characterized but they are subject to large individual variation The impetus behind PKQuest is to try and develop a standard set of human PBPK parameters that can be applied in the absence of this detailed information For this reason the application of PKQuest to human data should be regarded as a first approximation Since muscle represents roughly 50 of the body mass the muscle blood flow which can vary 10 fold or more depending on experimental conditions is the single most important PBPK parameter and the parameter that limits the accuracy of the PBPK model The pharmacokinetics of D 2 O or other tracers of water are especially simple since the rate of elimination is very slow and it distributes simply in the organ water As shown by figs 1Aand 1B the D 2 O kinetics are sensitive to the muscle blood flow and the data of Schloerb et al 15 was used to determine the resting muscle blood flow value 0 0266 liters min Kg for the standardhuman Although it is problematical to base such an important parameter on just one set of measurements on one subject this represents the only published measurement of this type that I could find It is also an approximation to treat the muscle as a single compartment with a uniform blood flow and in some human PBPK models 27 two muscle compartments resting and working are included For the PKQuest modeling the muscle blood flow is usually treated as an adjustable parameter and not as a strictly determined PBPK constant The ethanol data that was modeled are the mean values averaged over a number of individuals Because of the non linear nature of the pharmacokinetics it is an approximation to treat these mean values as representative of an equivalent average human 28 However it should provide a first approximation to the PBPK parameters of an average human For the common case where the published mean values are the only data that is available there is no other option In the PKQuest modeling of ethanol it is assumed that ethanol distributes freely in the tissue water This seems like a reasonable assumption given the physical chemical properties of ethanol Measurements of plasma whole blood concentration ratios show that this assumption is valid for red blood cells 29 However Norberg et al 16 19 has shown that the ethanol volume of distribution estimated using a 2 compartment model is significantly less than the total water volume and they have reviewed the literature that suggests that the tissue ethanol distribution may be restricted Despite this the agreement between PKQuest results and the Norberg et al data figure 2 indicate that this assumption is a useful approximation given the limitations of using the mean data Ethanol first pass metabolism and intestinal absorption The definition of FPM implemented in PKQuest is both rigorous and intuitive It is based on defining a time dependent peripheral availability PA that is equal to the rate of IV input that would produce the observed time course of the plasma ethanol concentration This PA is a direct quantitative measure of the amount of ethanol that has reached the systemic circulation The FPM is then defined as the difference between the total dose administered and the PA The classical procedure of determining FPM from the AUC eq 1 markedly overestimates the FPM For the case of the small ethanol dose 0 15 gm Kg taken with a meal the AUC estimate of fractional FPM of 73 was about twice the value 38 obtained using PKQuest For the higher dose 0 3 gm Kg the error was even larger 44 versus 7 Although the more recent one compartment approximation provides a better estimate of FPM it is still significantly larger than the PKQuest values 59 versus 38 for 0 15 gm Kg dose and 30 versus 7 for 0 3 gm Kg dose The error in both these approximations to FPM results primarily from the fact that the systemic appearance of the oral ethanol taken with a meal is slow compared to the 20 minute constant infusion that was used to obtain the IV AUC Since the liver ethanol metabolism saturates at low concentrations the shorter dose will have a higher average blood concentration and a corresponding lower value of fractional metabolism The error would be less if the time course of the oral absorption was similar to that of the IV input This explains why the AUC calculated FPM 17 was greatly reduced when the subjects were fasting so that the gastric emptying rate was increased and GI absorption was more rapid compare figs 6Band 7B and closer to the rate of IV infusion The critical dependence of the AUC on the rate of systemic ethanol input was first pointed out by Wagner 30 He showed that the AUC for the oral input was equal to or even larger than the IV AUC if the IV infusion was administered at a slower rate for 2 hours than the rate of intestinal absorption Failure to appreciate the problems inherent in using the AUC or one compartment method to measure FPM has led to the concept that the gastric mucosa metabolizes a significant fraction of oral ethanol Lieber and colleague observed that the FPM was reduced when ethanol was infused intraduodenally compared to the standard oral administration and concluded that the difference must have resulted from gastric mucosa metabolism 6 7 This decreased FPM for the intradudenal dose is probably a result of the much more rapid time course of absorption when the ethanol is administered directly into the duodenum PKQuest provides a direct estimate of the amount of ethanol reaching the liver As shown by figs 4B 6Band 7B the total amount of absorbed ethanol reaching the liver does not differ significantly from the total oral dose indicating that gastric mucosa metabolism is negligible In addition to providing a direct measure of PA and FPM PKQuest also provides for the first time quantitative information about the rate of intestinal absorption of an orally administered drug that has non linear metabolism A comparison of figs 6Band 7Bprovides a dramatic view of the decreased rate of ethanol absorption when it is accompanied by a meal In the fasting state ethanol is almost completely absorbed within 50 minutes fig 7B while the ethanol administered with a standard breakfast takes 3 or more hours for complete absorption fig 6B Levitt et al 31 simultaneously measured the rate of human gastric emptying and ethanol blood concentration with and without a meal and concluded that the rate of ethanol absorption was primarily limited by the rate of gastric emptying The similarity between the time course of ethanol absorption seen in figs 6Band 7Band the gastric emptying time course observed by Levitt et al 31 supports this conclusion Simulation of ethanol blood levels after oral intake Another feature of PKQuest is that it provides a simple interface that can be used to make quantitative predictions of the blood levels produced by different oral doses As shown in figs 4B 6Band 7B PKQuest routinely fits the time course of the intestinal absorption with a 3 parameter Hill type equation Absorption at time t A t H t H T H where A total absorption H Hill exponent T half time This 3 parameter input function can then be used as the input into PKQuest For example the intestinal absorption input function that was determined for the 0 3 gm Kg dose of ethanol ingested with a meal see fig 6B can be used for a model simulation using the following settings for finput ninput 1 findabs 0 finput 1 table organ liver type 3 rate 524 tbeg 0 tend 48 28 hn 1 87 csteady 0 This corresponds to a total input of 524 millimoles into the portal vein organ liver with a Hill coefficient hn of 1 87 and a half time tend of 48 28 minutes Figure 8shows that the simulated blood level for this input function solid line slightly underestimates the peak value but otherwise is in good agreement with the experimental data squares that was used to determine this input function In Figure 9this feature is used to illustrate the dramatic effect of a concomitant meal on the blood levels resulting from an oral intake The figure shows the blood levels for an oral intake of 260 millimoles of ethanol red line roughly equivalent to one 12 ounce can of beer and 2 green or 3 blue times this dose all ingested for a 20 minute time period either with fed or without fasted a meal The model results for the fed case fig 9 left used the above rate of intestinal absorption determined from the data in fig 6B The fasted case fig 9 right used the intestinal absorption rate determined for the fasting data in fig 7B Hill coefficient 2 6 half time 26 84 minutes In addition the corresponding values of liver Vm and portal blood flow for the fed and fasting conditions are used in this simulation The influence of a meal on ethanol blood levels is especially dramatic at the low intake dose decreasing the peak blood level by about 4 fold Competing interests None declared
