 uh the last movie that i saw i i don t go to that many so i ll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see but uh it was Awakenings with uh Robin Williams and uh Peter DeNiro okay yes uh huh have you seen it no unfortunately i haven t i heard it s really good but it is i just have to take my hat off to Peter DeNiro he is one of the best actors i ve ever seen it s uh huh there s a point where the uh the show is about these uh catatonic type people that this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the the living more or less uh huh but it wears off and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic you know uh it starts off with like a tic and then it gets to where he can t you know control his movements at all um hum and it was just so realistic the way you know you have to just keep reminding yourself that he s an actor uh huh though what does um is Robby Robin Williams does he have a funny part in the movie or is no it was very serious very serious oh how does he do serious stuff he s good he s he s talented boy he is yes yes i ve only seen him in funny stuff and so i know me too but uh well what was that show um Garfield uh Garfield i want to say Garfield but that wasn t yeah uh Garp The World of Garp yeah The World According to Garp he wasn t always funny in that show was he i didn t read see the the movie i read the book but i i did too and that s why i was thinking it couldn t be just a totally funny part but yeah yeah yeah in fact it got some pretty serious deep parts in it so yeah right yeah well what have you seen i think the last movie that we went out to see was Dances With Wolves oh i saw it uh well good we ve both seen one did you cry through much of yes the whole way i was telling a friend i i said i only cried twice but each was about half an hour long so where did you cry um let s see when i each time that i thought that the Indians were going to get killed i cried um i cried the first time when the um um hum the wagon man got killed when they attacked him uh huh yeah yeah and um i think from there on through the movie let s see what else did it um what other parts i can t remember any of the other parts right yeah i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed well i don t remember when the horse got killed oh they when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him oh yeah yeah and then he uh the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards you know and that horse has been such a pal to him um hum yeah when he was alone you can tell i m an animal lover you can hear my dog uh unfortunately we don t have any animals so um yeah but it was a beautiful story it really was it there was a lot of pretty scenery too in that movie what did you think about the buffalo scenes um hum um oh i thought it was awful that was and so graphic i mean i hadn t even imagined it you know i think we ve all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo yeah um hum um i had a friend who had fixed some uh chili buffalo chili and about a week before went to see the movie of course they raise them now you know to eat oh oh uh huh yeah that s not but she we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili uh after seeing that um hum yeah well at least you know that it wasn t same situation that the buffalo died in no it wasn t um i thought the scenes when the buffaloes running though were beautiful like that was great and there were so many of them i didn t know that that many buffaloes alive much less in one place oh yeah yeah really so that was pretty really and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape you know you could follow this this beaten down path um hum yeah and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing i wonder how they kept up with them though it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast i guess they graze though that wouldn t have been a problem i know yeah yeah it uh uh have you seen any of the behind the scenes uh of of that movie no huh uh it was they tried to keep it you know as very close to real um hum i mean like Kevin Costner did all of his own scenes and uh they had to teach a wolf how to to howl uh huh that s the part they had trouble finding was wolves oh i guess they re just not domesticated or or yeah right they just don t howl that much anymore huh i could they could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off and that s all they d have to do that ll teach them with a couple minutes huh yeah well that s funny well i think we ve made it yeah oh is that five minutes is that i don t know is it five or three okay oh i m not sure i m not either okay well i think we re we re we ve done okay though well thank you for calling okay me too well thank you hope you enjoy some more good movies lately yeah you too bye bye bye bye
