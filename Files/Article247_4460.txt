 Is Handwriting a Moral Issue Dear Peggy I confess with embarrassment that I didn t do my homework that is I didn t go to the Core s Web site to see just how Bennett s lists are treated by the originator himself E D Hirsch I took Bennett at his word that his vast lists did not mean that first graders were to make it all the way from Mesopotamia to ancient Mexico to the American colonists but that they would study topics such as those By that I assumed he meant they would pick from among them And even Hirsch can be a little obscure on his Web site emphasizing that the lesson plans are not meant as recipes though they certainly are presented that way I suppose I was misled by Bennett s own avowal that he did not have in mind a grand game of Trivial Pursuit And I was encouraged by the few occasions on which the authors elaborate and suggest projects such as analyzing a 1945 newspaper report about the Yalta conference reading immigrant diaries staging a re enactment of the surrender at Appomattox having a visitor come in to talk about life in the Depression All that sounded like plenty of pausing to do in depth interesting work It sounded better than the fancy new textbook one of my kids used last year to study the Middle Ages which aspired to spend equal time on the non Western world and so ended up spending much too little time on anything Similarly it has struck me that my other child might benefit from more writing of paragraphs and less discussion of rubrics and hamburger model graphic organizers in her writing periods And some of the new new math in its hands on emphasis does often seem to add up to busywork lots of cutting and pasting to take last night s assignment even though the concept of square feet and yards had sunk in after the first few snips I fear my reading of Bennett s lists was clouded by a wishful vision of more purposefully directed but still active and innovative learning Then again that s what makes books like these bestsellers In a format as broad as this it s possible to find some version of what you want to find But you re right my confusion and your criticism of Hirsch s hectic pace point to the need for a serious discussion about a standardized curriculum and what it might look like which Bennett et al would prefer to avoid being champions of localism in education Hence their enthusiasm for reform by grass roots parental agitation the problems of which you spelled out very well And there s another one Even if constant parental lobbying at school and hounding at home could possibly be as conflict free and effective as they suggest what would the results look like It seems to me this is a recipe for widening the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students Guess which parents are going to be poking their noses into the classroom all the time to say nothing of turning those garden chores into botany lessons The ones whose kids hardly need a superdose of after school enrichment As for character education I m all for it but not for preaching endlessly about it and calling it training as Bennett et al do in proudly old fashioned style I don t like values clarification any better in the trendy therapeutic incarnation that also seems to be popular schoolwide discussions of teasing one month being compassionate the next combatting media stereotypes the one after that As a contrived package of traditional wholesomeness the more authoritarian values of respect order obedience and cleanliness can prove stultifying distracting Legible handwriting has practical not moral virtue So can the progressive virtues of critical thinking independence creativity and community solidarity when served up as the only enlightened approach or as self esteem building therapy Religious schools have an easier job in this realm But Bennett s favorite ecumenical form of character instruction of course is moral stories As Bennett points out Herbert Kohl favors the same on the other side of the spectrum The problem both encounter in trying to script the lessons in too didactic a way rule out Babar as colonialist racist sexist Kohl rehabilitate Goody Two Shoes Bennett is that they often end up with duller stories than children deserve tidily presented with trite interpretations The homiletic approach in my experience seems to work best in connection with sports where all the uplifting talk talent is what you have effort is what you give play by the rules practice makes perfect etc goes along with real action and often very obvious consequences For kids in school rising to academic challenges posed by admired teachers it seems to me offers the best route to building the responsible committed attitude everybody hopes for in youth better surely than any special workshop is likely to People think that making right choices is a consequence of having a strong well integrated personality Bruno Bettelheim once wrote Actually it s the other way around it is making choices right ones that builds a strong personality Schools should be one important place that children have the chance to make those choices Speaking of choices without launching into a debate on school choice I wonder whether you see a growing gap between public and elite private schools I don t mean in quality however one might define that but in the pedagogical culture that prevails It s a question raised by my own observations of pretty stark contrasts plenty of homework in the early primary grades in public school vs next to none in private and by Bennett s book Is it increasingly a choice between back to basics traditionalism in the test conscious public school system and a considerably more progressive or constructivist ethos in private schools Or am I making this up Ann
