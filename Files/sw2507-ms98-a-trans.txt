          we go   so how do you rate gun control   well i think uh i think on a scale of one to ten i would be i would be more toward a uh a uh uh an a stand that would not totally ban guns but would certainly very much control them uh   i agree   yeah i think that uh uh and and you know i i say this because im coming from a im coming from my my uh uh my parents my parents and relatives in Massachusetts are all avid gun owners my dads got a big collection   umhum   uh my brothers got a collection there they both uh do police work uh they go out and shoot and theyre from the mentality that when uh uh guns were against the law only criminals owned them that sort of thing   i agree   but i uh uh i i think its far too easy for people to get guns uh let me let me tell you a little a little more of of my background where ive really come to this position i i as ive told you before uh we lived in Malaysia for four years   umhum   and it uh i tell you how against the law guns or any kind of firearms are uh its a hanging offense     oh my gosh   to have a gun theres two offenses that are hanging one is to have a gun and the other is to is to deal in narcotics and and theres no appeal once youre found guilty the sentence is automatic   so i guess they dont have a drug problem over there huh   uh well its interesting they do uh well they do and they dont not like we do here you cant buy it off the street corners but theres so much money to be made in drugs   yeah   that theres a lot of times not for selling in Malaysia but people go to Thailand and they have to bring them through the airport there the last two people that got hung werent even trying to sell them there they were just uh caught with them   oh no   and and and the uh the law says that if youve got a certain quantity on you youre presumed to be a dealer   uhhuh   uh if youre a user the penalty isnt much much less you go to rehabilitation if youre a dealer then you get hung but anyway uh they they have some very strong antigun laws there and and uh like its a hanging offense   umhum   now uh yeah people get broken into and they get slashed up with knives but at least the person has to be next to you with a knife i mean you can outrun a knife but you cant outrun a gun   thats right   so uh the violent uh there is not as many people getting killed in robberies and holdups and things like that as you see here uh thats probably why ive come to that to that way of thinking of course the uh the very emotional uh thinking over what happened to President Reagan you know the guy that got it was mentally deranged since you get one so easily   umhum   uh but im sure that they get a lot of publicity theres probably a lot of people that get shot with guns by equally mentally deranged people   well um just recently i think it was Sunday on Sixty Minutes   umhum   they had an article uh or uh a news story about uh gun control and in Florida they have started something where you know you always have to be eighteen or twenty one to buy a gun but um theyve started where they do a background check and so   umhum yeah   after you can go apply for this gun but it takes like seven days   umhum   until you can get it and i think thats a good idea you know im not for total gun control because i feel like people need to protect themselves but um i think that you know the background check is a great idea   right yeah i think its a i i think its great and im trying to think the uh secret service agent that got uh injured so badly when he was trying to protect President Reagan   was it Brady yeah   Brady and this is the law thats before the the legislature right now is is referred to as the Brady Bill right   i didnt know about that   yeah and and that requires some that would be at the federal level and require some waiting period presumably uh during that waiting period there would be a background uh uh check that would take place   uhhuh   see i think thats great but they also said on this um news story that that people can sell it to one another   yeah   and they wouldnt have to do the background check and i mean they went on to tell about all the the illegal guns and everything and that i think that Sixty Minutes bought some guns and um   umhum   like an Uzi even and   yeah   and so you know theres a lot of controversy and people walk around at gun shows with their big guns on their back saying for sale and you dont have to do any background checking i mean any they would sell it to anybody   yeah we you know i wonder i had occasion to go into a pawnshop recently ive never been in one in my life before and uh i was just looking around and and the majority of what theyve got in there are guns   uhhuh   and ill bet they dont ill bet you dont i i would imagine legitimate gun dealers youd have background checks but ill bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop guy some money for a gun   enough money thats right   he he just picks it up over the counter and and i was i was really surprised that there you can get guns of any kind that you want you know the other thing is you had talked about the uh needing a gun to protect yourself and you know maybe someday were all going to get wiped out by a robber here and then ill change my mind but   umhum   theres so many accidents with children accidentally getting a hold of guns   yeah there is   uh with the husband being out at night and the wife hearing rustling at the door he forgot his key wham hes gone uh i i absolutely dont want one in my house for that reason uh theres just too many things that can happen that are bad   oh really well um my dad and my brother both have a collection of guns and um i dont know i guess we weve been taught responsibility when it comes to guns but accidents always happen but my dad has always keep kept his hid from us i mean even to this day i dont really   yeah oh sure yeah you dont know really you dont know where it is     right i know where his big gun is like his shotgun and stuff but um his pistols and stuff like that and he keeps those hidden and it is just for our protection its you know if we did have a prowler he he keeps it like um he has the little rotary dial thing and like   yeah yeah   i think its the second shot or the third shot the bullets in there but i mean hell give them two chances   oh okay thats thats an interesting thing so uh yeah that the only way that would be a disadvantage if the other guys got a gun and fires when he sees his and its on its on the first shot uh i think that uh uh   and um right   yeah i i i think that you know people have legitimate reasons for having them the only problem is so many people have them that dont have legitimate reasons for having them And the other thing is that there are a lot of crimes of passion   yeah   uh you know a guy may have one at home for his protection but suddenly uh uh yeah wife or he gets in an argument with a neighbor and he goes home particularly when we get into the hot summers and   his wife thats happening more and more often too   oh sure he goes ho me and gets his gun out and comes back and shoot them there was a uh uh just recently here in Dallas im im trying to reconstruct it somebody jumped in front of somebody in line in front of a seven eleven and they got mad and they had a little argument over it so this one guy goes home and he is sitting talking to his his uh   huhuh   uh brother about it and he sees the guy that jumped the line in front of him coming down the street so they got out and have more words and the second party went down to his house several houses down the street and got a gun and come back and shot the other guy and killed him   oh my gosh   and and and when theyre available like that people who normally wouldnt do things like that but momentarily fly off the trigger   thats right   tend to uh uh uh uh tend to do that and then it happens in the in the cities a lot it happens in uh uh i i guess at certain times of the year tempers grow short   umhum   and and it happens then and i i uh uh you you know my uh uh oldest daughters fiance is a uh is a part part hes a college professor but he also is a reserve police officer and and he uh he has all kinds of guns and hes taken her out to teach her to shoot   umhum   and uh uh you know i think thats good because shes not afraid of them and it it teaches her to be responsible relative to guns but uh when hes out on police work you know he leaves her home alone and shows them where they are in case she needs them and i worry about that i would almost worry about that more than if she didnt have one   yeah because she might be um apt to go get it a little quicker than   see what i mean yeah uh yeah yeah yeah years ago i lived in an apartment and one night i heard wham and boy it shock the apartment   uhhuh   and uh i came out and some girls came flying out of their apartment uh next to me and they asked me to come in and look and there was chips of wood all over the place and a big hole in the ceiling and a bullet comes to rest on the pillow beside one thems head   oh no   evidently it had ricocheted around the room well a young boy ten or eleven years old uh was living with his dad in the apartment up above and his dads girlfriend was visiting and the dad took the girlfriend home and apparently the boy had uh he had a gun in there for protection so the boy was bored it was a three fifty seven magnum and he was sitting there spinning the chamber and it went off and actually shot his toe off and went through the ceiling uh through the his floor which was the ceiling of the apartment below that and i say ricocheted around the room a little bit   yeah   it was kind of scary   yeah really if it landed on her pillow beside her if she had uh just rolled over   yeah and it it it had about spent all its energy but you could see there was splintered wood from all the places that it hit going around the room   oh my gosh   and and uh so i i uh i i think were almost coming from the same place on this subject really   yeah i do too   i i i i think that that we dont want to go to the extreme of banning them completely but we sure want a lot of control then and a lot of protection   um i think i would rate probably a seven   yeah i think i would too i think i would too   just because um youre right i think that if we did ban them the bad guys would still have them   yeah  be uh well its too late hey hey if i were starting my own country from the beginning   i mean   from the beginning i would   probably like the country Malaysia is that where you said i mean they started it   yeah Malaysia but of course uh its also true in Great Britain   oh really   yeah theyre not allowed in Great Britain either even the policemen dont carry them the policemen carry clubs but dont   no i didnt know that
