 The Death of a Dynasty The Asian Age of India led its front page Friday with questions about the future of Sonia Gandhi after she led the Indian Congress Party through its worst ever electoral performance since Independence It said the Italian born widow of assassinated former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi now faces challenges to her authority following the comfortable general election victory of incumbent Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee and his National Democratic Alliance The first challenge will be over her selection as leader of the Congress Party in Parliament the paper said There is bitterness in the party over her complete failure to bring in votes it went on Leaders returning from their constituencies after countering propaganda against her foreign origin are visibly worried about this factor which they see as a handicap In London the Independent reported from New Delhi that Gandhi s lack of political experience her weak grasp of Hindi her foreign birth and a certain lack of cultural sympathy with her adoptive land despite many strenuous denials all took their toll But it said it is unlikely that anyone will be so rash as to run against her for the party leadership In the longer term the party may lean towards Priyanka Vadhera Mrs Gandhi s daughter who campaigned very effectively in Uttar Pradesh for her mother An editorial in the Financial

effects of being pounded on the head it said The Great Ali who was the master of the ring during his heyday is now a walking shadow of his once imperious self To hear him mumble his way through a conversation and hesitantly shuffle around is a surefire promo for the anti boxing brigade He may have been the greatest but now he s reduced to a pathetic bundle of nerves British newspapers were all
