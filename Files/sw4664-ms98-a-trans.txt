        okay so were supposed to discuss job benefits and such     right   uh what do you consider that youre lacking in benefits that you have   that im lacking in benefits um the fact that theyre not all paid for   umhum   um i wish they were all paid benefits uh i share in our health insurance uh half and half um im also covered under my wifes so but uh i wish i wish they were all paid for i dont have a a a dental benefit   umhum   um and uh i guess the benefits that i have i wish i had more of an HMO a health maintenance as opposed to kind of fix it after its broken kind of maintenance   well thats ive uh worked for companies that have had HMO before and it really is nice particularly if you arent you know really set on any one specific doctor if if youre flexible   yeah well i mean you get you get yearly physicals   umhum   um and i mean they just seems to make sense to do it that way   umhum   i guess in a perfect world in a perfect world uh but we arent in a perfect world so i dont know uh other than that i dont really have any benefits per se how about yourself   well im fortunate in that i have uh dental and i also have vision care the thing that i have had in the past that i wish that my company provided was uh a prescription a paid prescription plan   prescription drugs   because umhum   oh okay gotcha   you know that theyll cover uh like for five dollars or something like that that you can get anything that you want   right   but um   how about other other benefits of of the job i mean do you have uh what kind of uh time off do you have what type what type of work do you do   uh im an administrative assistant for a software company   huh okay   and what about you   im a broker i work with a uh brokerage house and we work with businesses in brokering their services or goods to other businesses   how large is your company   oh not too large thats part of the problem with the uh the health care program its probably maybe uh twelve people   oh youre right well the company i work for now in my office we have about eight people but its like two thousand people overall   gotcha   and uh uh our benefits i guess are pretty good you know we well i guess actually we have quite a few offered to us we have K and i get two weeks vacation the first year and   huh   about uh ten holidays i guess one of which is a floating holiday that i can use at my discretion the   now when you say a floating holiday what do you mean by that   well its just a day that you can use i guess youd really consider it a personal day   oh okay yeah so you have personal days you day uh i should say multiple or single   just single   okay but you can use um your holidays your holiday or uh vacation times split up into personal days   im sorry   can you split your holiday or vacation time into personal days or do you have to take them in bulk   uh the vacation i think i can split you know i dont have to take it two or a week at a time or anything like that the holiday uh   yeah   the the one day i think i can just put it anywhere that i want to   huh now does   so thats nice   does oh yeah uh does does your company do picnics or you know like uh tomorrow our company as a whole and i guess i would call this a benefit  is uh were going to the Red Sox home opener in uh Boston   thats a benefit no we dont do anything like that   yeah yeah you dont do you have any like company picnics or uh or gettogethers or things along those lines   i dont think so as a matter of fact ive only been with the company a month and a half and uh i i asked my boss i think we do have a Christmas party although he indicated the budget is kind of low   oh it always it usually is     but then with just uh ten of us in the office you know as far as a company picnic or anything i dont think that theres enough of us you know to to get together and do something like that   huh   but uh uh the office is pretty free you know as far as if i decide that i want to go out to lunch with someone and im late coming back no one complains or says anything about it and if i need some time off to go to a doctor they wouldnt penalize me for that   thats good i was yeah oh absolutely i mean the environment you work in is is uh crucial to the job   and that counts umhum   uh we have somewhat were somewhat in the same situation um i mean i feel i feel odd about taking any personal time anyway unless you know they knew about it or whatever but um   right   but being a sales organization we you know our time is our own i mean were kind of independent contractors under a common goal type of thing   umhum   so its kind of the same situation although it sounds like your office structure is more structured as an office time um but you its not so rigid that you know you punch a clock that type of thing   well a lot of it depends on your position too you know other people that are in sales in the office they come and go
