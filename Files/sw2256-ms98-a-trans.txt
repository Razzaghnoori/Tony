 um i think uh i like to listen to a program called Focus on the Family with Doctor James Dodson uh huh okay and from what i understand it s it s a new thing good about families these days um especially spending time with one another i know if if i were to have children i would have trouble yeah because i work and uh i have my dogs and i have a hard enough time spending time with them you know yeah i i m i m pretty busy myself i m in graduate school at State and i uh huh i can t see even having time for a pet let alone children yeah really but um there s a lot of single parents too that are trying yeah i think day care seems to be uh yeah a real big issue yeah and uh i m not sure or i just wonder when we ll know what the effects of day care yeah well actually there s been some studies that say it has some positive effects that the students the the kids get you know exposure to other kids their age at an earlier time yeah so they tend to be more cooperative with their peer group although they don t have real good uh role models yeah i ve heard that they they call them uh that they say that they re more um creative that they re really just more rebellious um hum from the day care yeah because uh the people don t have the time to give that one on one attention yeah and and i just wonder if maybe day uh the home schooling is going to come into more and more uh homes i can i can see that happening yeah because really if you have a good curriculum yeah do you really need to have that certification yeah of a teacher i taught i taught school for a year and it was like whoops you know it s not for me no because i i just don t have that discipline with children that uh you need for them to learn right um hum and uh i one day i was i like found myself uh telling them to write their spelling words a hundred times each and i just heard this comedian say that you know something that that s how you know you re a bad teacher um and i was doing it just keep them occupied yeah i think another problem with the families uh is is the role of television yeah um i don t know it seems they re using it as a babysitter instead of a learning tool that really that really annoys me because i think i don t know i think my parents probably did that to me a little bit yeah um using it as a baby a babysitter yeah it s just go watch TV you know leave us alone yeah will numb you out which well i ve i ve heard some uh there s a book out now called The Saturday Morning Mind Control um hum and uh he raises some serious questions about why do they have these really a lot of money goes into the advertising for children s programs oh yeah and yet uh children can t buy uh what s the deal yeah but they can they can whine and squeal and complain right i m watching Ninja Turtles i know it yeah and boy the price of toys these days is ridiculous yeah i could be and they all have to have the same one you know i can see having kids and not letting them watch TV and making them toys out of wood say oh yeah here kid this is this is all you re getting i wonder how long that last well i i used to babysit for this family that didn t have a TV and their their kids turned out fine they didn t have a TV at all they they had no TV were they Pentecostal no i mean they had a nice stereo they listen to stereo they were into Michael Jackson yeah they just yeah they just didn t watch him on TV yeah which i thought was pretty neat yeah it is it s very good i think TV has really had some bad effects on all of us especially the the violence on it i ve yeah yeah and you can t control it you you know it s the cable channels sometimes you can but yeah boy the cable TV they ll just show anything yeah and that s coming right into your homes yeah i think TV can be good if if the family watches it together on they re watching good shows uh huh yeah PBS or whatever i mean even some regular network TV is okay if the parents there and you know helps the students or help the the kids understand that yeah this that happened in the TV show but probably doesn t happen in real life yeah yeah and there s a lot greater instance of uh children committing murders too isn t there yeah killing their parents and so forth they don t they see these things happening with no consequences huh you know yeah you see it on TV The guy gets up and lives afterwards yeah yeah like Double O Seven he s supposed to do it yeah and it s okay yeah so i you going to have kids in the future huh you going to have kids in the future no huh uh because i m like forty three okay and so it s uh it s too late yeah you know i wonder sometimes wonder if i ll ever if i will regret it when i m old but uh i just can t see myself as a parent uh huh yeah you know it s i m still pretty young i m twenty five but i don t know i don t see it for for at least a few years really are you married no i m single right now and i m you know sorting things out which way i m going to go with my life before i yeah have kids you know career to to much into my career you know yeah well i wish you the best okay well it s good talking to you it s good talking to you bye bye all right bye bye
