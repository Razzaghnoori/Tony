 okay Jay um could you tell me uh what your thoughts are about crime i tell you what here in Dallas it s uh it s awful bad because that they re i i believe there s starting to be a lot more violent type crimes uh where you see armed robbery and and uh rape and murder you know are starting to be a lot more prevalent in this area and uh that s that s getting that s getting scary because i grew up in a real small town and i moved here to Dallas and uh it s been a rude awakening i tell you oh so that s what do you do work in Plano uh right right how how far away is that from Dallas from the city itself well see it s it it s really just a suburb uh i really can t even tell where Plano starts and Dallas Dallas ends oh so it but uh i grew up in a real small town in north Texas and uh moved down here to Plano an and uh it s uh it s definitely a big change yeah that s uh that s the same with me well um i grew up in a rural area there s nothing but farms right and i still live in the same area it s it s built up somewhat and crime really hasn t been a problem it s been uh uh mostly outsiders coming in and you know robbing or breaking into automobiles and stealing uh i see radios and cassettes and things like that not really the violent crimes then not so much in in the town i live in now but but the closest large city in Rhode Island is Providence and then it s Boston which is about uh i see oh forty five fifty miles away i see which is really not that far right and Providence is only like a dozen miles from from where i am okay so that s real close but the cities down there yeah and and and the next one up is uh is a small city between me and Providence right and that they re stealing handbags now in broad daylight they re taking the the crime now the latest thing up here is uh they ll somebody be driving along whether they re they re in their early twenty s or or teens right and they ll steal jackets they ll holdup kids and they ll take their jackets and chains you know just get out of the car and oh Lord because they have got some of these like the leather jackets are are quite expensive right you know i ve heard about that uh also for tennis shoes there was uh uh a big surge going on oh just last year i think where uh kids like in New York uh were uh knocking off other kids to get their tennis shoes they just that s that s incredible yeah i tell you what though if you go price some of those tennis shoes i can see why now you know they re getting up in the hundred dollar range yeah that s and that just seems ridiculous yeah for a pair of tennis shoes for a pair of tennis shoes yeah yeah yeah no shoe is worth that that price uh so that s right you know not to not to go out and scuff up and but i don t know what the it s i don t know what the answer is though to to try to fix that problem it s probably the uh the times now um right i know you guys down there have had have had a problem for a while which we re experiencing now with the savings and loans and exactly yeah just economic overall economic uh times around here in Texas have been tough yeah and rents are are extremely high i mean people and they just don t care yeah right you know it s either it s either you go out and you and you steal something or you you bash somebody over the head to get it yeah or you starve well another another problem i think is the the drugs you know uh people have to get money for the the drugs and yeah and they ll just go out and do anything they can to do it yeah we had we had uh an incident in our town not too far from where i live where uh the police made a raid on and and most of them were teenagers or or or in their early twenties right which is unheard of in a small town you know you don t usually associate associate that right but they did they made the raid you know and the whole town was upset but i m not so sure now if if uh if the drugs are really prevalent they re saying that alcohol now is is uh one of the major contributors right like all of all the students now on campus uh i guess most of them drink or have binges on weekends and exactly and going to school is also always very prohibitive now unless your parents are wealthy right you know you either have to take a loan or most of them don t work or if they work they work part time for yeah it s hard to get a job you know minimum wage yeah right yeah i m not sure down there if you guys are all picking up but up here it s it s terrible you know we really haven t uh because the oil industry just hasn t come back like it was and so much of our economy was based on that so you re still suffering then so yeah yeah as far as that goes right that that and real estate you know just have not come back uh even close to what they were yeah and um yeah Dallas is you know you can see some economic turnarounds but uh and i don t think it will ever be back to what it was because it was you know it was really blowing and going there for a while yeah i was down i was in Dallas about uh twelve thirteen years ago and then i just went down again last month for a week i see and it was it s like one huge city when i was flying in right it was just all lights but you couldn t tell there was a problem right you know because it s so huge right part part of the problem too i think up here is i mean um and all the banking crisis all the white collar crimes uh stock brokers have been getting away with bloody murder the bankers have been getting away with bloody murder right nobody s being prosecuted that s right so what s going to stop them from you know other people to right what s yeah what s what s the poor guy going to do that s that s you know being threatened or thrown out on the street and he s got a family to support and he s got no job um i m not sure how much of that is is crime rather than just kids out there for a good time yeah well that s true too yeah yeah but you know the violent crime is is uh definitely something s got to be done on that because yeah because there s more and more there s more murders we had uh right just in southern Massachusetts and Rhode Island over the weekend we had five murders golly that s ridiculous yeah i mean Rhode Rhode Island s just like a neighborhood compared to you guys down there it s just so so so small right right and nobody even cares or nobody seems to care they just overlook that as uh common occurrence yeah yeah yeah and if it s if it s drug related they turn the other way because that s one less problem that they have to put up with the law enforcement right oh that s and uh if they do come in i ve got some friends on the police force and they say that you know they apprehend somebody and they bring them in and uh they let them out they re out on the street before they get their reports done golly that s terrible isn t it so there s no checks and balances right and i m not sure what what to do about that or which way it s going to go well see i m not either because i m i m really not for higher taxes you know to go out and pay for uh more people to be out on the street as far as the officers and things like that but uh yeah they re being overwhelmed i think anyhow i mean i think yeah that s true the fire power against them now is is atrocious and uh you know they ve got all kinds of automatic weapons these criminals do right and these poor guys out there uh trying to uphold the law um i don t know i kind of think they should bring back capital punishment so i don t know well i do too and you know i know people argue that that s really not a deterrent and people don t think about that but i ve i ve got to believe that well in the back of their mind if they know they re going to go out and kill somebody and that you know they re going to get the death penalty then and that it will actually happen it s yeah yeah you know so many so many of these jokers get the death penalty and then you know just end up in prison uh yeah for twenty or thirty years or forever there s no right you know with the chance of even getting paroled and uh you know that s just i just don t understand that yeah um but and when i say there s no deterrent you know of the death penalty um that s like saying that you don t put up any stoplights anymore because it s not a deterrent for people to stop at crossroads right that s true yeah so it it just doesn t hold water and you look at some of the other countries that that have the death penalty right and they don t have anywhere near the crime rate that we do of the violent crime rates that we do right right because you know a lot of countries just shoot you on the spot you know forget that trial and the jury and all that you know they just yeah i yeah i wouldn t want to see it go that far you know give them due process and then and then let them and then do it huh and then let them appeal yeah then you d get yeah because some of it some of it s it s it s just down right that s right uh mean i mean they go out there just just for the sake of of harming somebody right exactly and those are the people that you know can you rehabilitate them the some of the ones that are you know perpetual exactly and and um you know i don t even know if they are worth rehabilitating if if uh they go out and commit some of these violent crimes so but i don t know what the answer is we ll just have to i guess each each person will just have to try to do their part and yeah yeah he can because it s eventually it s going to it s going to swing back right it was they had the death penalty way back and then it swung the other way and everybody s swore you know we re no better than they are if we if we put the death penalty in and
