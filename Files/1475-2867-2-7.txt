 Background The breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 is located at 17q21 and encodes a 1863 amino acid protein Mutations in this gene account for 60 of hereditary ovarian cancers 1 Loss of heterozygosity in this gene occurs in 30 70 of sporadic ovarian carcinomas 2 Species homology studies have shown that while the entire 22 exon gene is poorly conserved the terminal ends maintain over an 80 homology between rat human and mouse 3 BRCA1 has long been known to function in DNA repair Studies have shown BRCA1 is upregulated in cells treated by DNA damaging agents such as cisplatinum 4 BRCA1 has been shown to interact with DNA repair proteins such as Rad50 and Rad51 the tumor suppressor genes RB and BRCA2 transcriptional factors RNA pol II histone deacetylase complex ctIP as well as influence numerous cyclins and cyclin dependent kinases contributing to cell cycle regulation 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 More recently BRCA1 has been shown to influence apoptosis in a p53 independent manner 13 This apoptotic response involved the c jun kinase JNK pathway though the details of this mechanism remain unclear 14 The highly acidic carboxy terminal BRCT region of BRCA1 has been suggested to play a role in transactivation 11 BRCT interacts with BRCA2 Rad51 other tumor suppressing elements as well as numerous transcription factors such as RNA helicase A and STAT1 15 16 Recently it has been discovered that truncation of this region resulted in suppression of apoptosis following pro apoptotic stimuli 17 Further these studies also suggested that the BRCT region facilitates apoptotic functions within the caspase pathway The amino terminal BRNT of BRCA1 contains a highly conserved zinc binding or RING finger domain also involved in multiple functions within the cell Molecular modeling has shown that this domain contains two zinc finger like motifs connected through linking C 3 HC 4 regions 18 Naturally occurring splice variants of the gene suggest at least two transcription initiation points above and below the coding region for the RING domain 19 Truncation studies have shown that the RING domain may function in direct protein binding of ER ATF1 and BARD1 a ubiquitin ligase 20 21 22 While zinc RING domains are common motifs in several protein families such as oncoproteins and regulatory proteins the actual function of the domain differs among these proteins For example inhibitors of apoptosis proteins IAPs contain one to three tandem baculovirus inverted repeat BIR domains as well as a carboxy terminal RING domain Previous studies have shown this RING domain essential in the anti apoptotic function of some IAPs 23 The most common mode a cell uses to undergo apoptosis is the cysteine aspartate specific protease caspase pathway This proteolytic cascade may be triggered by a wide variety of stimuli and employs numerous initiation routes within the cell While there is extensive crosstalk between the caspases the two most common initiator pathways are the Fas Fas ligand pathway involving caspase 8 and caspase 10 and the mitochondrial pathway triggering caspase 9 24 25 Caspase 3 a pivotal downstream protease functions in virtually every caspase pathway and serves as an executioner in the cells by cleavage of downstream targets which lead to irreversible chromosomal degradation Perhaps the most prominent caspase 3 substrate is DNA Fragmentation Factor 45 DFF45 an inhibitor of caspase activated DNase 26 Following caspase 3 mediated cleavage DFF45 releases DFF40 the DNase responsible for DNA fragmentation into the characteristic apoptotic DNA ladder Caspase 3 also deactivates vital DNA repair enzymes such as poly ribose ADP polymerase PARP 27 Cleavage of PARP has been regarded as a hallmark of caspase dependent apoptosis 28 No study to date has explored the possible involvement of the BRCA1 amino terminal RING domain in caspase mediated apoptosis Therefore ovarian surface epithelial cell lines with and without the 185delAG BRCA1 mutation were used to ascertain whether the RING domain of the amino terminal affected apoptosis This mutation common among families with hereditary ovarian cancer is a frameshift mutation occurring at the beginning of the C 3 HC 4 region of exon 2 that essentially interrupts RING domain function 19 29 30 The results showed that disruption of the BRCA1 amino terminal RING domain altered caspase 3 activation and subsequent DFF45 and PARP cleavage resulting in accelerated STS induced apoptosis Results Loss of BRCA1 expression resulted in increased cell death when exposed to 1 M staurosporine treatment SV 40 large T antigen transfected ovarian surface epithelial cell lines from women with and without an amino terminal BRCA1 mutation were employed to ascertain the function of the amino terminal RING domain in apoptosis 31 To confirm BRCA1 status in these cell lines whole cell lysates were western blotted using a monoclonal anti BRCA1 antibody against the amino terminal Figure 1 Using the MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line as a positive control MCC5 cells expressed the full length 216 kDa BRCA1 protein and were confirmed BRCA1wt In contrast the HIO3261 77 cells were found to have significantly reduced levels of full length BRCA1 than the wild type cell line confirming the mutated amino terminal BRCA1 BRCA1 in these cells Due to the high molecular weight of BRCA1 actin could not be used as a loading control Thus the membranes were stained with 7 Amido black with the protein front used as a loading control Having confirmed the BRCA1 status of these cell lines cell viability was then assayed under cytotoxic stress Cells were treated with 1 M STS for 3 h and subjected to MTS assay at 0 24 and 48 h Figure 2A Results were reported as percent growth of respective untreated cells allowed to grow in serum containing media BRCA1wt cells grew 17 greater at 24 h and 8 greater at 48 h than BRCA1 cells This difference proved to be statistically significant p 03 and p 01 respectively BRCA1wt cells appeared to recover at 72 h while BRCA1 cells continued to decline in growth data not shown To confirm that the difference in cell viability was due to alterations in survival response after STS treatment and not an intrinsic property of the individual cell lines growth of both cell lines was examined by MTS assay under the same conditions in the absence of STS Figure 2B Linear regression analysis of cell growth revealed that the slopes of the BRCA1wt cells 0 12 and that of the BRCA1 cells 0 14 were essentially the same To ensure the survival difference after STS treatment seen between the BRCA1wt and BRCA1 cells was associated with cell death a trypan blue exclusion assay was conducted Figure 2C Cells were plated in triplicate and both adherent and suspended cell populations were assayed with results reported as percent of total population dead No appreciable difference was observed in the amount of death between the cell lines at 0 1 or 3 h 1 3 5 and 2 5 respectively There was however a significantly higher percentage of dead cells in the BRCA1 cell line at 24 h 12 8 p 027 and 48 h 24 6 p 001 Amino terminal BRCA1 mutation was associated with elevated caspase 3 activation following STS treatment To investigate the role of amino terminal of BRCA1 in apoptosis the effect of STS was examined on elements of the caspase pathway Figure 3 First to determine whether a mutation in amino terminal RING domain of BRCA1 preferentially targeted either the mitochondrial 25 or Fas Fas ligand apoptotic pathway 24 levels of the respective initiator caspases 9 and 8 were determined Both cell lines produced activated caspases 8 and 9 by 1 h after treatment with equivalent levels at 3 h Next levels of the executioner caspase 3 were examined Once more both cell lines produced activated caspase 3 by 1 h after treatment However BRCA1 cells showed significantly more active caspase 3 by 3 h after treatment than the wild type To quantify the difference in caspase activation the immunoblots were scanned and analyzed via ImagQuant densitometry Table 1 Densitometric analysis revealed that although BRCA1 cells initially had lower levels of caspase 3 after 3 h STS treatment caspase 3 levels were 72 higher Levels of STS induced caspase 7 a structural and functional homolog of caspase 3 32 were also evaluated Figure 3 Procaspase 7 began to be cleaved at 1 h of treatment and was completely processed by 3 h of treatment in both BRCA1 wt and BRCA1 cells Although caspase 7 plays a subsidiary role in DNA fragmentation and apoptosis morphology 33 densitometric analysis illustrated that BRCA1 cells contained substantially reduced levels of procaspase 7 in untreated cells 39 of that seen in BRCA1wt and during initial STS treatment 31 of that seen in BRCA1wt at 0 5 h To determine whether elevated levels of cleaved caspase 3 resulted in increased cleavage of caspase 3 substrates DFF45 cleavage was studied Figure 3 Degradation of full length DFF45 was used to indicate caspase 3 activity In both cell lines DFF45 began to significantly degrade by 1 h after treatment In BRCA1wt cells the levels of full length DFF45 were 95 of control at 0 5 h 40 of control at 1 h and 22 of control at 1 5 h In contrast in BRCA1 cells full length DFF45 was only 71 of control at 0 5 h 16 of control at 1 h and 10 of control at 1 5 h Table 1 Amino terminal BRCA1 mutation caused increased degradation of caspase linked DNA repair proteins To ascertain whether increased caspase 3 activity in BRCA1 cells could also affect DNA repair pathways the DNA repair enzymes PARP a known substrate of caspase 3 27 and ERCC1 a repair protein not dependent on caspase 3 35 were examined Figure 4 Interestingly cleavage and inactivation of PARP was noted only at 3 h after STS treatment in BRCA1wt cells In contrast accelerated cleavage and inactivation of PARP was seen in BRCA1 cells as early as 1 h after STS treatment Levels of ERCC1 were not significantly different between BRCA1wt and BRCA1 cells Discussion A frameshift mutation in the amino terminal of the BRCA1 gene disrupts the RING domain and all domains after it Our data showed that a BRCA1 mutation interrupting the RING domain altered apoptosis in ovarian surface epithelial cells While there was no difference in overall growth between BRCA1 and BRCA1wt cells BRCA1 cells showed a marked reduction in survival following STS treatment Reduced cellular survival in BRCA1 cells was associated with increased cell death due to alterations in apoptosis No difference was detected in the levels of caspase 9 or caspase 8 among the BRCA1 or BRCA1wt cells suggesting that the reduced cell survival in BRCA1 cells was not associated with a difference in initiation of either the mitochondrial or the Fas FasL apoptotic pathways In contrast STS induced 72 greater caspase 3 activity in BRCA1 compared to BRCA1wt cells The enhanced caspase 3 activity in BRCA1 cells was clearly functional and resulted in increased proteolysis of downstream targets of caspase 3 That is we found 40 less full length DFF45 at 1 h and 42 less at 1 5 h in BRCA1 cells compared with BRCA1wt cells The cleavage and subsequent deactivation of this caspase 3 dependent DNase inhibitor suggested that amino terminal BRCA1 mutations enhance cellular apoptosis contributing to poor cell survival With BRCA1 s extensive connection to DNA repair already established 35 we also examined whether an amino terminal BRCA1 mutation reduced cellular survival by enhanced caspase 3 dependent cleavage and subsequent inactivation of the caspase 3 dependent DNA repair enzyme PARP As with DFF45 PARP cleavage was significantly enhanced in BRCA1 cells suggesting that decreased DNA repair capacity in BRCA1 cells may in part be due to premature inactivation of PARP This pattern was not seen with ERCC1 and may be due to the choice of apoptotic stimulus used While the exact mechanism remains unclear STS has been shown to initiate caspase driven apoptosis in a manner distinct from chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatinum etoposide and tamoxifen which directly cause DNA damage and tend to favor ERCC1 activation 37 38 Previous studies have shown that truncation of the highly acidic carboxy region BRCT resulted in resistance to caspase induced apoptosis 17 Further this failure of apoptosis was traced specifically to caspase 8 and the Fas FasL pathway In contrast our data showed that the 185delAG mutation affecting the amino terminal domain of BRCA1 conferred an increased apoptotic response with no caspase pathway preferentially selected Instead this amino terminal mutation favored elevated caspase 3 levels that subsequently facilitated enhanced apoptosis by inactivating the caspase dependent DNA repair proteins PARP and by inactivating DFF45 an inhibitor of the caspase dependent DNase DFF40 The nature of the 185delAG frameshift makes it difficult to determine if the apoptotic alterations seen are directly caused by the mutation or by downstream effects of it and certainly deserves further scrutiny In this way carboxy and amino terminal BRCA1 mutations may target two distinct anti apoptotic pathways Therefore disruptions in either or both BRCA1 terminals effect apoptotic response In summary our findings suggest a possible novel mechanism by which the amino terminal of BRCA1 suppresses apoptosis and facilitates DNA repair in human ovarian surface epithelial cells Conclusions The 185delAG mutation in the BRCA1 gene disrupts the zinc linker region of the amino terminal RING domain Disruption of this domain triggered an elevated caspase 3 dependent apoptotic response and affected downstream proteins such as DFF45 and PARP Materials
