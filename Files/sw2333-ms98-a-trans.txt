 all right so we re supposed to talk about food maybe we ll get a call back saying hey you re not you re not talking about food um no no you can talk about anything you want these these things are just suggestions yeah oh golly well i live in Dallas what what area do you live in uh North Carolina North Carolina oh really it is boring here oh really well boring in the Carolinas they did have uh huh and Jimmy Baker um yes yes we re he s he s not a subject of great pride oh yes it s it s one of our prouder right along with Jessie Helms oh yeah i think i think they were pardon the phrase all in bed together or something twins separated at birth kind of thing yeah somebody somebody let the brains run out on the floor though somebody dropped that baby when it was born oh yeah oh man Jim Bakker oh what a what a dangerous individual i i i know uh how how did Jessie Helms get reelected that s that s what i want to know that s a well that s a good question um what does he do does he just do the people the are there just stupid people where you live or something okay yeah basically yeah yeah that s well that s that s most of it and he plays very heavily on the race issue oh yeah and it s still that s still a big thing here in this backwards state yeah that s too bad because i mean i ve been in the Carolinas and you know there are some places in the Carolinas it s really nice there uh huh yeah my favorite place is Ashville it s right over there in the mountains it s a beautiful place in like yeah yeah it s just that you know i mean if you took all the people out of the state it would be a great place yeah these folks are so backwards it s just ridiculous it s pathetic i i know i think literacy probably the biggest problem there yeah and i i mean the papers are just full of all of this stuff about the educational system they ve been changing their standards and this that and the other and claiming this is going to make everything better yeah uh Durham the county right next to us big city yeah had an enormous jump in the uh in the SAT rate oh really and everybody was huh how d they do that oh let me guess what they did they had classes on the SAT oh no it was even worse than that they falsified the data oh really oh Plano Plano started having yeah just just students Plano actually they went out and they had the where where i live they had the they had the classes on the SAT i ve never heard anything so preposterous in my life they re preparing people for the test by having a class specifically for the test how ridiculous i mean of course it has the highest right SAT rate well it also has the highest teen suicide rate too so i mean that and this is national i don t know where it s all going to where it s all going to go oh well i don t know i don t i don t know what s i mean public education is just going down the tubes i mean they re throwing more and more money at it and it just seems to be getting worse and worse yeah and you know what s bad i mean like i m going into you know an education related field and i just you know it just you know it really kills me you know i mean it s it it really is a shame that you know you know United States somehow we spend more money on each student and the teachers are paid so little i mean i mean how do how do they figure that out oh yeah i don t know that s that s the one thing that i ve i ve never been able to figure out why you can pay garbage men more than you can pay teachers yeah um well the prestige of being a teacher is also pretty nil well i think a lot of that has to do with the fact that they say well since this is a woman dominated field we can treat them like dirt you know oh yeah yeah i guess that that that must be the rationale for for where it comes from United States it it must be i bet you know i i i m not knocking the garbage men i mean they re necessary but there s a lot of unemployed people out there who would gladly take jobs as garbage men rate for less money yeah hey that s a hey that s a hard job to get really it is in in in Texas in Texas it s hard because it s almost like a father to son thing yeah well it s it s it s hard in New York too and i mean they get paid twenty eight thousand a year to start gee that s that s ridiculous and teachers only get paid twenty four man i d carry garbage for twenty eight thousand a year you bet you you bet you man i worked as a welder and i was you don t even get paid that much man i d i d go out and dump garbage all the time for that kind of money yeah good exercise you get outside shoot yep you have dogs are your friends knock over a can now and then and leave it open for the dogs you know well ah that s what my that s what my garbage man does i went out the other morning and my my garbage can was sitting in the middle of my driveway jeez i get tired of this i ve got a there s a nice little wooden platform out there for the garbage cans and then they throw them anywhere they want to yeah yeah and sometimes they don t even take everything that that s the biggest kick oh so you live in the Carolinas huh the Carolinas uh do much skiing no i m not i m not a fool oh okay uh i i m i m not really impressed with i mean i lived in Germany for three years i i was i m not impressed with skiing now i like i like other you know winter sports but i m not real thrilled about them i i it s okay to watch people go out and break their legs but i m not going to climb on a couple of pieces of wood and go racing down a slick mountain side i mean that s i ve got better things to do with my life uh when i uh when i was uh stationed in England i used the opportunity to travel around Europe a lot and one of my favorite places to go was Switzerland uh huh uh huh and it was just great to sit out there in uh Zurich or Bern just sit in the sidewalk cafes oh yeah the cafe um my my wife her favorite actually she was stationed at in in Germany with me too and and uh she she fell in love with Salzburg Austria yeah Salzburg nice Austria nice Europe is nice well well it s well it s such a it s it s it makes the Germans look like slobs i mean Austria and Switzerland do both but yeah yeah really i mean Switzerland is so clean oh not even a scrap of paper on the ground you know well they have these there these real like real strict laws you know they have to hose down the streets like every every other day or something yeah yeah that it s pretty ridiculous i loved it there though yeah i loved it yeah i did i did like the food in Germany it was pretty good um well i i like Europe except for Belgium yeah i i m i really don t know what the Belgians i mean they have do they really have an identity or i mean i think they have they have an identity crisis a lot of these countries they they really don t know you know what supposed to do no yeah i think i do because half of them are yeah half of them are Middle Eastern and the other half are French Expatriates yeah um hum and since i hate the French anyway the Belgians try to act like the French yeah and i it was just miserable i hated that place i hate it almost as much as i do France oh my wife and i we had it when we drove through France we paid in tolls to go to Spain and we drove from Germany like the southern southwestern most part of Germany we drove on the tolls and we spent forty six dollars in tolls one way oh and it was like uh it was yeah it was about an eighteen nineteen hour drive sure oh God what a headache what a pain in the butt and yeah and the fuel was so expensive i mean i i just i can t believe i mean when we when we came back on our way back i mean well my wife and i we first we were in Barcelona and we bought like we found this really great cafe that it was like a delicatessen um hum and we like we bought we filled a full a cooler full of food of all this delicatessen food and then we ate it all the way going up to the France because the food was so so bad and then when we came into Germany i had five centime left i mean that s like that s that s five one hundredths of a franc which is worth yeah it it was probably worth about a twentieth of a penny and and i mean i i i just about kissed the guard i mean when i got there he was like i was like we re so happy to see you he s like you re sort of knew why yeah couldn t even use it yeah really i used to take the ferry over from Dover over to Calais and and drive across France uh horrible i only did that one time yeah yeah i i ve done that before uh huh what well actually actually i ve gone where were you stationed at in England uh Mildenhall oh really i was um i was TDY at Bent Waters oh good old Bent Waters for a little while yeah my brother my brother was stationed at Bent Waters for a long time yeah that s a nice place yeah Bent Waters is a is a very nice little place nice little base out in the country yeah nobody messes with them a lot Mildenhall was pretty uh well it was big and it got a lot of attention yeah but uh yeah Bent Waters Upper Hafford all those neat little places that s where i really wanted to be hum yeah my my brother got stationed eventually at Oxbridge he he really enjoyed it there and well well his his wife was British so they had oh Oxbridge yeah they had quite a good time yeah Oxbridge is nice ah everywhere in England is nice i mean a lot of the people i mean it s funny they re just i don t know the standard of living is not as high as you would expect you would think but on the other hand it s it s in a way it s better yeah that what t hat s what i like about it for one thing everything was cheap yeah um i mean i can still remember going going to the store and getting a pint of milk a pound of butter and a loaf of bread and getting change back from my pound yeah you know you can t even buy a loaf of bread in this country
