 The City and Its People Jerusalem is an ever changing combination of the earthly and the spiritual It can be caf s and restaurants set in the 19th century lanes of Nahlat Shiv a or it can be the sky lit with an ethereal sunset over the Old City as muezzins call from the minarets of ancient mosques It is medieval bazaars a quartet of Russian musicians performing at the Bible Lands Museum or the echo of a soprano s voice inside the Crusader Church of St Anne A walk of a few blocks can take you into different worlds and centuries Jerusalem has been a Holy City longer than any other place on earth It is holy to not merely one religion but to the three great Western monotheistic faiths Judaism Christianity and Islam Its fate was changed forever 3 000 years ago when King David brought the Ark of the Covenant to rest in a tent amid the gardens beside the waters of Jerusalem s ancient source of water the Gihon Spring With those waters the Kings of Judah of the House of David were anointed for four centuries In those gardens the Song of Songs was written by Solomon On the streets of Jerusalem the Prophets walked and spoke on a hill beside the city s walls Jesus was crucified from a rock on the then ruined Temple Mount the Prophet Muhammad made a miraculous ascent to enter Paradise In no other city in the world are millions of visitors so conscious of the portentous lives of people who lived here thousands of years ago In Jerusalem historic moments can become mythic legend The saintly Omar Ibn el Khattab second successor to Muhammad and the Muslim conqueror of Jerusalem in a d 638 declined an invitation from the Christian Patriarch to pray at the Holy Sepulcher for fear his followers might then want to turn the site into a mosque On a December day in 1917 British General Allenby rode up to Jaffa Gate and dismounted from his horse because he would not ride where Jesus walked he then accepted the surrender of the city after the Ottoman Turks had fled the flag of surrender was a bed sheet from the American Colony Hotel And millions of people have seen the photograph of an unknown Jewish soldier fervently praying at the Western Wall minutes after Israeli forces captured the Old City in 1967 Being at the center of so much history allows for a bewildering religious and ethnic diversity in Jerusalem Bitter rivalries exist between followers of the major religions as well as among the sects within those religions Reform and Orthodox Jews come to blows at the Western Wall followers of different Christian traditions break into fist fights over the rights to millimeters of space inside the Church of the Holy Sepulcher But each tradition is a component of Jerusalem s greatness A dozen languages echo from the dome above the Church of the Holy Sepulcher and some of the shopkeepers in the labyrinthine bazaars speak all of them and more In few other modern cities are you likely to see such a variety of costumes Hasidic Jews wear black hats often trimmed with fur and long black or brocaded coats garb dating from their origins in 18th century eastern Europe Palestinian Arabs might be clad in flowing robes and keffiyes head scarves or in blue jeans Nuns are in their habits and Israeli women in military uniforms In the bazaars you ll pass robed Greek Orthodox priests and Bedouin tribeswomen in richly embroidered dresses At holy places you ll find Ethiopian Christians and Jews wrapped in delicately handwoven white robes Jerusalem is the spiritual and governmental center of a bustling nation with a lively contemporary cultural scene and a per capita income that ranks among the 25 highest in the world Both Jerusalem and Israel have undergone enormous change in a very short time At the end of Israel s War of Independence in 1948 the nation s population numbered 700 000 Jews and 150 000 Arabs During the half century of its existence Israel has absorbed approximately 2 5 million Jewish immigrants displaced persons refugees and survivors of the Nazi Holocaust The country s first 20 years were consumed with the struggle to house feed and educate the new arrivals despite austere economic conditions and the constant threat of military attack from neighboring countries The population of Israel is today approximately 6 million of whom about 4 780 000 are Jews 900 000 are Muslims and 130 000 are Christians There are also nearly 100 000 Druze members of a religious group that broke away from Islam in the 11th century and now live primarily in Galilee and on Mount Carmel Israel is facing major decisions about the nature of its democracy about the relationships between the many peoples who live here and also about hopes for the country s reconciliation with its neighbors in the Middle East Nowhere are these issues more acute than in Jerusalem The Jewish people in Israel are from many lands and differ in culture language and customs Some have lived in Israel for generations but most have arrived or are descended from those who arrived from every part of the world since the modern Zionist movement began in the late 19th century Ashkenazi Jews come from central and eastern Europe Among them are the mystical ultra observant Hasidim their enclave in Jerusalem the Mea She arim neighborhood is a small remnant of those traditional Jewish communities in Poland Hungary and Lithuania that were consumed by the Holocaust Ashkenazi Israelis include early 20th century idealists from eastern Europe who founded Israel s famous kibbutz movement along with families who escaped from Berlin and Frankfurt in the 1930s and built fashionable Jerusalem neighborhoods such as Rehavia lined with stone buildings influenced by the Bauhaus and International schools of architecture Sephardic Jews are the descendants of the great Jewish community exiled from Spain in 1492 at the time of the Inquisition They established communities in lands surrounding the Mediterranean and elsewhere For centuries the Sephardic Jewish neighborhoods of cities from Tangier Fez and Amsterdam to Salonika Istanbul and Aleppo echoed with Ladino a 15th century Castilian dialect sprinkled with Hebrew words spoken by the Spanish exiles wherever they settled Mizrahi or eastern Jews are from West Asia Central Asia and North Africa including black eyed high cheekboned Yemenite Jews Jews from the mountains of Kurdistan and the dusty plateaus of Bukhara and Iraqi Jews whose community existed from the days of the Babylonian Captivity in the sixth century b c until modern times Israelis from Argentina are famous for their beef barbecues many American Israelis lovingly celebrate Thanksgiving and the Fourth of July many decades after leaving the United States On the streets of Jerusalem you ll notice signs in Ethiopian Amharic and overhear Russian spoken by the thousands of recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union Whatever their ancestors cultural and ethnic origins however all native born residents of Israel are called sabras who today make up more than half of the Jewish population The exotic walled Old City excluding the Jewish Quarter is a treasure house preserving 1 300 years of Arabic culture and architectural achievement and remains the center for the many modern Palestinian neighborhoods of East Jerusalem Palestinians comprise one of the most educated and cosmopolitan populations in the Middle East and within the Old City in the bazaars and neighborhood enclaves that surround the great Christian and Islamic holy sites an intimate and very traditional urban style of life is maintained filled with the courtesy and caring found in communities where there are no strangers As you plunge into this fascinating city you ll find that planning your day is not easy Each religion has a different Sabbath and different religious holidays A day s itinerary is often confounded as shops offices mosques and museums are closed for religious or patriotic festivals prayers traditions or a summer afternoon s siesta But if some places close abruptly others open just as suddenly Jerusalem is never completely at rest In the midst of this amazing amalgam of cultures is a passion for continuity Before any change can take place even moving a candlestick dozens of beliefs and traditions must be consulted and respected By general agreement and city ordinance all buildings must be faced with Jerusalem limestone giving the city s different worlds an architectural unity and tying the city in a special way to the land on which it rests Sheltered by houses made of the same rocks revering the same stories sharing the same history many Jerusalem neighbors who come from very different backgrounds have forged unique and extraordinary friendships Their stories are the city s ongoing miracles and the source of Jerusalem s hope
