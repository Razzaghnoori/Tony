            hey Steve um they just uh they just started a recycling program here i think actually this is my first experience with recycling program but um instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about   umhum   um im starting to split stuff split split stuff off the only disadvantage is that they dont pick it up at the curb they make me drive it like a mile down the road and split it out down there what are they doing up there   well here in Saskatoon um  much the same thing there is no curb pick up of uh any of the recycled products uh were in a community of about a hundred and eighty thousand people  uh  there are areas where we could uh  actually we have a couple of the uh handicapped societies type of places where they uh one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they uh collect the paper and ship it to other retailers so uh were able to uh have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing and then there are theres a uh deposit program on plastic and glass containers well primarily soft drink bottles and so were able to uh  take it to one of the uh rehabilitation centers and then they recycle the containers  they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container and then   but the deposits only on like drink stuff   right yeah on the on primarily on soft drink pop and that kind of thing   okay okay   and uh so they induce recycling of plastic and glass soft drink containers uh we do have one one of the scrap metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum  cans as well   oh okay   and and actually the recycler there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler uh with the handicapped group will also accept those so uh its fairly fairly extensive but again its uh its the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city   so is they youre giving are you giving these products to the handicapped group and the handicapped group is getting the uh the money or or you got or they somehow distributing the funds back to you   well actually theres theres the opportunity for both   oh okay   generally the uh the handicapped group takes care of the things that actually the government has placed a deposit which is the inducement to recycle recycle the bottle so that you get your money back and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit and then i have a then then they in turn will get  some money from the bottlers and from the the people that do the canning of the pop and the beer as as well   thats very cool you know theres a i i heard about a a similar program in New York City where uh i think its called like Homeless Incorporated or something like that but what they do is employ um homeless i think mostly men but homeless people to uh go out and collect all the recyclable cans and and i think its mostly cans there may be bottles as well but like beer cans soda cans and what not and they uh bring them up to a one location one centralized location and uh are able to collect the money from the various beer and and soda manufacturers and uh and and get more money to these people that desperately need it   um yeah  um i guess partly because of our climate here in Saskatoon at least the majority of Central Canada uh well i want to say Central Canada but Central Canada tends to be referred more to Ontario and Quebec   yeah     but um we dont have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfor welfare and unemployment insurance that kind of thing  um theres psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although um scouts and hockey teams and ball teams those kinds um regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collecting the bottles at individual homes   do they do it with newspapers as well   they have done it some um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers theyre actually at virtually all of the shopping centers like the shopping malls there are several containers where the group called Cosmopolitan Industries collects or people can drop their used newspapers and other papers in the bins and then the bins are collected   hm   um some of the
