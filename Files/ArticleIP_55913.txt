 Know When To Hold Em Know When To Log Off Hurry Don t miss your big chance to lose your wife and car in a game of craps Bills are afoot in the House and Senate to outlaw online gambling before it really takes root Though rapidly changing technology and the freebooters who run offshore casinos will likely stymie any new legislation that won t stop the feds from trying So if you re interested in online gaming and or wanton self destruction deal yourself in before it s too late Or watch me instead I don t have a ton of gamble in me as the Vegas phrase goes but I have a very soft spot for a challenging game of poker I also imagine that I know a lot about sports and I enjoy controlled risk taking In short your average fairly well informed sucker So come along as I demonstrate how to lose scads of money in four easy steps without leaving my desk chair or deriving any sort of tangible return Step 1 www showgirlscasino com With at least 600 gambling sites on the Web and new ones launching every day it s tough to decide where to burn your cash Online gambling is banned on a state by state basis so check with your local cops before taking the plunge No comprehensive guide to online gaming exists and the sites that publish casino reviews take ads from those same casinos Consumer Reports where are you I happen upon Showgirls Casino which unlike many other sites 1 requires no software download to play its games and 2 posts its odds 97 8 percent payback on slots which is great the average slot payout on the Vegas strip is 95 7 percent In the standard routine Showgirls has you deposit funds with a separate e commerce outfit then you draw on that account to buy virtual chips at the casino Tapping the 500 I started with I set up a 150 account with my credit card Once I started there isn t much difference from a real casino Pros No destitute hustlers lurking about unless you count my friends and I didn t have to leave the house Cons No cocktail waitresses and a Java applet is no competition for a blackjack table s perfect green felt It s a trade off you may love the privacy and convenience you may miss the ambience Showgirls based in the Dominican Republic offers all the usual games craps roulette etc I immediately lose 40 in video poker if you play learn the strategy Then I lose 15 in roulette and another 15 on the slots Bam down 70 clams in 20 minutes Click click broke How quick and painless money losing can be when it s all just numbers on a screen A session of blackjack gouges 50 more counting cards is useless here as the deck reshuffles after every hand After an hour I staunch the bleeding and ask them to mail me my remaining 30 beans The site promises a check in a few weeks Net so far 120 Step 2 www slotland com Most online casinos offer the same games and the same software Slotland distinguishes itself with the lowest budget design on the Web Also it posts no odds I buy in for 25 and get a 10 first time bonus for registering most sites do this After losing 7 on the slots I withdraw my whole account at a 3 profit Then I go back in and deposit another 25 only to double my money on a single pull By the way on wins of 75 cents or more Slotland offers a link to a cheesy erotic photo For bare bones gaming this place will do the trick Net so far 92 though I m still waiting for the Slotland check too Step 3 www i sportsbook com Because sports betting is illegal everywhere but Nevada I predict that online sports betting will become big My friend Andy Glazer a pro gambling expert says some sites cancel your sports bets if they think you re too good or if they figure out that you gamble for a living Many online sites just plain stiff their clients for no reason Andy s advice If you must wager on sports go to Vegas or stick with your neighborhood bookie he s probably more reputable if more clearly illegal If you do go online use an Australian site as they re the best regulated Throwing caution to the wind I try i Sportsbook from Antigua because it provides the easiest interface for my credit card deposit I put 75 on the New England Patriots as a 2 5 point underdog and 50 on a Boston Red Sox playoff game against the Cleveland Indians I win both bets scoring 125 samoleans My Pats lose but cover the spread they only lost by 2 and the odds makers spotted them 2 5 points My beloved Sox beat the Indians Within a few days i Sportsbook refunds my credit card deposit as promised and a week later I get a check for my winnings Quite straightforward and trustworthy but I was making miniscule unthreatening bets Sports aren t the only events to bet on at these sites One offers George W 6 to 5 odds to win the White House bet 5 and if you win get back that fiver plus an additional 6 Al Gore is 9 5 to win and Bill Bradley is 7 2 bet 2 to win 7 You can also bet on the outcome of the Microsoft trial or whether Leonardo DiCaprio will OD before Sept 1 2000 Net so far 32 in the black Step 4 in which unfortunate things happen www planetpoker com Your best bet in any casino is at the poker tables real poker not video poker because you play a game of skill against shmoes like yourself not a game of mathematical chance against a machine or a deck of cards The more poker skill you acquire the better your odds At a meatspace casino or a virtual one the house makes its money by taking a small percentage rake from each poker pot or renting the seats by the hour There aren t a lot of live poker games on the Web but unhappily I found one All the live poker sites I visited poker com purepoker com deltapoker com require a download of the same software I decide on PlanetPoker com because Mike Caro a pro poker player whom I ve met and like endorses it I put 150 in my account with ease but when I try to play I get an error message about being unable to link up with the Planet Poker server This error message appears on a few different computers hooked up to a few different corporate networks that I try making me think that the network administrators have configured their firewalls to disable these games I succeed in connecting to PlanetPoker com when I borrow a friend s laptop and connect through his Internet service provider Once in the poker room you scan the virtual tables for empty seats and click to sit down or to join the waiting list After a 45 minute wait I still can t find a chair for the low stakes Texas Hold Em game 3 and 6 bets pots around 30 or so Impatient I jump into a higher stakes game 5 and 10 bets pots more like 100 which turns out to be a horrible idea These players are much better than the low stakes players and take my money in a hurry The playing interface is smooth and simple popping up your options to fold call or raise when it s your turn But not only does my Web connection fail in the middle of one hand if this happens the game assumes you have called the bet then kicks you off the table when the hand ends I flat get beat when I risk any chips Players with handles like nineball and fatso just outplay me On one tough hand that lost me 60 I was pretty confident with my three jacks only to see sleepy make a gutshot straight on the last card to whup my trips and steal my chips I lose 150 worth in under an hour but I love the challenge Of all the online games this is the one I could get frighteningly into Though in the future I ll stick with the low stakes games The drawbacks of live online poker You can t read bluffs in your opponents trembling fingers and bobbing Adam s apples The only guaranteed way to get a bead on players is to watch for betting patterns to emerge Another thing about these games that makes me nervous is that two players in cahoots at adjacent computers could rig the table playing in tandem and driving up the bets when they know they ve got the hand won Finally it s hard to gauge the competition With the online anonymity for all I know I was playing against Phil Hellmuth Jr But the game seemed fair and I was simply overmatched Final net 118 though I m still waiting on the Showgirls check and as for the Slotland check no yesterday s e mail confirmation of my withdrawal did not convince me that it s actually on the way Conclusion Online gambling is here probably to stay and it s going to be unfathomably big If you think video poker at airports is wait till you see co workers feed their paychecks into online slots from their desks Depending on what kind of person you are this may mean you should 1 establish an offshore casino in the Antilles before the Department of Justice cracks down or 2 wait for this stuff to shake itself out before you blow 20 bucks playing Web roulette As long as Indian casinos are only a few hours away giving your credit card number to a distant and foreign Internet operation might not be worth the risk If you do log on though perhaps I ll see you at the virtual Hold Em table My handle is seth
