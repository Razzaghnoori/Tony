                            Tyrosine kinases regulate signaling pathways that control cell growth proliferation        motility and other critical cellular processes Mutations in tyrosine kinase genes can        lead to abnormal kinase activity and some tumors become dependent upon this activity for        growth and survival Thus kinases are attractive targets for anticancer drugs Examples        of new kinase inhibitors include gefitinib and erlotinib which have recently shown promise        in treating nonsmallcell lung cancer Unfortunately gefitinib and erlotinib work only in        a subset of patients and they can have severe side effects albeit infrequently So        researchers have been trying to find ways to predict who will benefit from therapy with        these drugs and who wont        Following the work of Lynch et al N Engl J Med   and Paez et al        Science   William Pao and colleagues have previously shown that the        epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR a tyrosine kinase is often mutated in        nonsmallcell lung cancers and that tumors that harbor such mutations are sensitive to        gefitinib and erlotinib        In this new study they focused on a signaling protein called KRAS which functions        downstream of many tyrosine kinases including EGFR The KRAS gene is also often mutated in        lung cancers but very few cancers have mutations in both EGFR and the KRAS gene To find        out whether KRAS mutations could help to predict which patients would respond to gefitinib        or erlotinib the researchers looked for mutations in EGFR and KRAS genes in  tumors for        which sensitivity to either drug was known        They extended their earlier findings that EGFR mutations which were found in  of the        tumors were associated with sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors and found that tumors        that had mutations in KRAS a total of nine were refractory ie did not respond to        either drug        These results need to be validated in larger and prospective trials that use        standardized mutation detection techniques If they are confirmed knowing the mutation        status of EGFR and KRAS in tumors could help physicians decide which patients should        receive gefitinib andor erlotinib As Inoue and Nukiwa state in a Perspective that        accompanies the article By combining all the factors that relate to response or        resistance patients who will benefit from treatment can hopefully be identified        Undoubtedly we have taken a great step forward in molecular therapy for lung cancer        treatment
