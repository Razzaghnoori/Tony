 Tyrosine kinases regulate signaling pathways that control cell growth proliferation motility and other critical cellular processes Mutations in tyrosine kinase genes can lead to abnormal kinase activity and some tumors become dependent upon this activity for growth and survival Thus kinases are attractive targets for anti cancer drugs Examples of new kinase inhibitors include gefitinib and erlotinib which have recently shown promise in treating non small cell lung cancer Unfortunately gefitinib and erlotinib work only in a subset of patients and they can have severe side effects albeit infrequently So researchers have been trying to find ways to predict who will benefit from therapy with these drugs and who won t Following the work of Lynch et al N Engl J Med 350 2129 2139 and Paez et al Science 304 1497 1500 William Pao and colleagues have previously shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR a tyrosine kinase is often mutated in non small cell lung cancers and that tumors that harbor such mutations are sensitive to gefitinib and erlotinib In this new study they focused on a signaling protein called KRAS which functions downstream of many tyrosine kinases including EGFR The KRAS gene is also often mutated in lung cancers but very few cancers have mutations in both EGFR and the KRAS gene To find out whether KRAS mutations could help to predict which patients would respond to gefitinib or erlotinib the researchers looked for mutations in EGFR and KRAS genes in 60 tumors for which sensitivity to either drug was known They extended their earlier findings that EGFR mutations which were found in 17 of the tumors were associated with sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors and found that tumors that had mutations in KRAS a total of nine were refractory i e did not respond to either drug These results need to be validated in larger and prospective trials that use standardized mutation detection techniques If they are confirmed knowing the mutation status of EGFR and KRAS in tumors could help physicians decide which patients should receive gefitinib and or erlotinib As Inoue and Nukiwa state in a Perspective that accompanies the article By combining all the factors that relate to response or resistance patients who will benefit from treatment can hopefully be identified Undoubtedly we have taken a great step forward in molecular therapy for lung cancer treatment
