 Getting From Here to There By John Hollander posted Wednesday Oct 8 To hear the poet read Getting From Here to There click After the issues raised first by the dawnHad been considered for a while and darnIt lost their appeal some agent of the darkStabbed at the afternoon as if with a dirkThe disappearance of the sun s red diskIn a sea of golden dust brought us to dusk An unseen term after the after birth Emerges We re delivered of our dearth As when today you rose from bed warm hearth Promising kettle desire s best of health In the gray distance over a bare heathYou discerned striding toward you someone s death One hears such stories with one s eyes unwet She woke up one day and found that the TetOffensive had left her widowed with a totWho broke her heart as if it were a toy Luck having given her one so so try Wrung out her life and left her bones to dry How many other questions hide in how Writers should make a deep unwitting vowNever to think about such questions Wow I wish I could Rather than try to wooAnswers into the mind s arms dream of Who Where What they were wearing then and Why She took him to her place at half past oneHer bedroom windows bordered by caca d oie Chintz draperies not nice but lust says fieTo nice for which it does not give a fig He d gone there Thursday just for a quick fixAnd didn t get back home till after six Wisdom s long weary journey from the eastCeased when it halted once to take its easeIn some oasis with a book a vaseOf flowers a cup of wine love in a valeOf silken covered sand no weathervaneClattering ostentatious giving ventTo windy thoughts yet knowing where it wentThe overgoing of the sad late west He misdirected us and so we came By a long route which took us through a caveFilled with the lapping of a distant wave Our confidence already on the waneWe wandered wondering ever more in wantOf knowing where the true way really went
