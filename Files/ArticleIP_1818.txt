 The Ambassador From Shangri La It s the Year of Tibet again The press proclaimed the Year of Tibet when the Dalai Lama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 America and Europe celebrated an International Year of Tibet two years later Now Hollywood is feting the Land of the Snows with the Year of Tibet in Movies Two panegyrics will open in theaters by year s end and a third is in the works At the center of the latest round of adulation is the Dalai Lama making another triumphal world tour Last month crowds of 40 000 greeted him in Taiwan This week he visits Washington D C for a Tibetan rights conference an awards dinner with Richard Gere and the kind of gushy press coverage that other world leaders fantasize about The Dalai Lama is by all accounts a true holy man humble devout warm funny as sweet inside as outside He casts himself as a Himalayan Forrest Gump the accidental guru I am just a simple Buddhist monk But this humility which is undoubtedly sincere also serves the Dalai Lama s shrewd PR campaign His Holiness is cashing in on the West s romance with Eastern spirituality using it to attract international sympathy Dressed in his maroon robes and beatific smile the Dalai Lama

Buddhist culture Celibate nuns and priests were forced to copulate in the street others were crucified or dragged to death by horses All but 13 of Tibet s 6 000 plus monasteries were looted and

Western audiences a softhearted softheaded universalism a religion without dogma an Ansel Adams photograph He bathes his U S audiences in kindly aphorisms Be a nice person Be a good person Happiness produces health Medical scientists accept this We should learn together as brothers and sisters in the great human family We should We should also protect the environment forgive those who abuse us
