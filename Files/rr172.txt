 Introduction The association of inhaled particulate pollution and cigarette smoking with pulmonary disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is well documented 1 but the specific early responses of lung epithelial cells to toxic substances in particulates that predispose the cells to disease have not been elucidated Cigarette smoke has also been considered a major player in the pathogenesis of asthma and as a trigger for acute symptoms 2 Exposure to cigarette smoke activates an inflammatory cascade in the airway epithelium resulting in the production of a number of potent cytokines and chemokines with accompanying damage to the lung epithelium increased permeability and recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils to the airway 3 Even brief exposure to cigarette smoke has been shown to increase expression of IL 8 in primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells HBEs in the presence of dust mite allergen 4 Increased release of the chemokine IL 8 has also been shown for cultured HBEs exposed to cigarette smoke extract CSE 5 6 and diesel exhaust particles 7 However the precise molecular events that bring about these intracellular changes and acute inflammation in lung epithelial cells are not well understood Upregulation of cytokine gene expression in epithelial cells has been linked to activation of specific signaling pathways Involvement of the mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathway extracellular signal regulated protein kinase ERK 1 2 p44 p42 in cytokine regulation has been demonstrated in HBEs exposed to diesel exhaust particles 7 but not to cigarette smoke NF B is a ubiquitous transcription factor involved in regulating inflammatory responses and its targets include several of the genes encoding cytokines and chemokines The activation of NF B by oxidative stress inflammatory cytokines such as IL 1 and by TNF has been studied in depth 8 but much less is known about the effects of cigarette smoke on NF B activation The purpose of this study was to gain insight into the mechanism of inflammation induced by cigarette smoke specifically the acute response to smoke The human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 and normal human bronchial epithelial cells NHBEs were exposed to the particulate fraction of cigarette smoke cigarette smoke condensate CSC and examined for the production of proinflammatory cytokines and activation of MAPK and NF B The results demonstrate that the acute phase response of pulmonary epithelial cells to cigarette smoke involves activation of ERK1 2 and NF B Materials and methods Reagents

allowed to form for 30 min at room temperature in RPMI without antibiotics containing 1 g of reporter plasmid 20 ng of pVAX LacZ for monitoring transfection efficiency and 10 g of lipofectamine Cells were transfected for 18 h Prior to CSC challenge the transfected cells were preincubated for 4 hours in minimal Eagle s medium with Earle s salts to remove serum factors Assays were done in triplicate and consisted of untreated controls treatment with 50 ng ml TNF and treatment with 0 4 g ml CSC After treatments the cells were lysed by addition of cell lysis buffer as supplied in the luciferase

All values are expressed as mean standard error of the mean SEM Comparisons of experimental values for CSC treated cells to untreated controls were done by analysis of variance ANOVA Probability values of 0 05 were considered significant Results Effects of cigarette smoke condensate on cell viability and apoptosis To determine the effects of CSC on cell viability A549 cells and NHBEs were exposed to increasing concentrations of CSC for 30 min then examined using the trypan blue dye exclusion test Fig 1A Maximum toxicity for A549 at the highest concentration of CSC 20 g ml was 15 At lower CSC concentrations 0 1 g ml survival was greater than 90 for both A549 cells and NHBEs Induction of apoptosis by CSC was determined in A549 cells and NHBEs by using the TUNEL assay and confirmed by DNA fragmentation analysis data not shown NHBEs showed 5 to 10 apoptosis at moderate doses of CSC A549 cells showed less than 5 apoptosis Fig 1B However with increasing concentration of CSC NHBEs showed as high as 20 apoptosis while A549 cells remained unchanged Changes in expression of specific cytokines and chemokines after exposure to cigarette smoke condensate To characterize the response of epithelial cells to CSC we determined the changes in message levels for a group of cytokines chemokines and cell adhesion molecules Total RNA isolated from NHBEs following exposure to CSC was subjected to RT PCR and the results are shown in Fig 2 IL 1 was induced to a level 9 5 times that of untreated controls while the expression of IL 8 and GM CSF was increased 2 7 fold and 2 2 fold respectively Expression of the adhesion molecule ICAM 1 was found to be approximately 1 6 times the level of control IL 6 and the chemokine RANTES were elevated slightly Fig 2 This pattern of enhancement of proinflammatory mediator expression implies that specific effector compounds are present in CSC Involvement of the MAPK pathway in response to cigarette smoke condensate To examine if CSC upregulation of cytokine production involves activation of MAPKs we examined CSC treated NHBEs for specific phosphorylated species Fig 3Ashows the results of a western blot of whole cell extracts from NHBEs exposed to increasing concentrations of CSC and probed for phosphorylated ERK1 2 the activated form of ERK1 2 Band densities on the film were measured and the protein loading variations were adjusted by normalizing to the levels of non phosphorylated ERK1 2 The level of ERK1 2 phosphorylation increased rapidly with increasing exposure to CSC to a maximum of nearly twice the control To confirm the results of immunoblot detection of phosphorylated ERK1 2 NHBEs were exposed to 0 4 g ml CSC for 30 min then fixed and stained for phosphorylated ERK1 2 Exposure to CSC caused a marked increase in nuclear staining of cells with phosphorylated ERK1 2 antibodies Fig 3B This nuclear localization and phosphorylated ERK1 2 staining was largely blocked by pretreating with the MEK inhibitor PD98059 The CSC induced increase in IL 1 expression was also reduced by treatment of the cells with PD98059 or the NF B inhibitor PDTC Fig 3C These results suggest that CSC activates ERK1 2 in these cells within 30 min Cigarette smoke condensate treatment induces rapid activation of the NF B pathway To determine whether upregulation of cytokine production by CSC involved activation of NF B we examined CSC treated epithelial cells for phosphorylation of the inhibitor of NF B I B NHBEs were treated with increasing concentrations of CSC and whole cell extracts were immunoblotted for phosphorylated I B Activation of NF B involves the increased phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of I B Treatment of cells with increasing concentrations of CSC resulted in an initial rise in phosphorylated I B levels followed by a decrease Fig 4A Protein bands were quantitated by densitometry on the film and the phosphorylated I B densities were normalized to the levels of I B NHBEs exposed to CSC also showed an increase in nuclear staining of phosphorylated I B as detected by immunocytochemical staining using an antibody to phosphorylated I B Fig 4B Effect of cigarette smoke condensate on transcriptional activation of luciferase reporter construct CSC appears to activate NF B which should result in transcriptional activation of NF B inducible genes Therefore A549 cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid containing a promoter sequence that bound NF B and luciferase activity was measured after challenge with CSC Treatment with 0 4 g ml CSC for 30 min resulted in significant enhancement of luciferase reporter expression compared to control Fig 4C indicating activation of NF B TNF used as a positive control also activated luciferase gene expression with the same plasmid system Exposure of cells transfected with the reporter plasmid to increasing doses of CSC showed NF B expression peaking at a CSC concentration between 1 and 4 g ml Fig 4D Discussion The complex changes in lung function morphology and gene expression caused by compounds in cigarette smoke involve a combination of direct and indirect effects on cells but principally center around an increase in airway inflammation as a result of cigarette smoking The results of our studies demonstrate that the mechanism underlying these acute inflammatory events involves activation of specific signaling pathways such as MAPK ERK1 2 and NF B leading to the release of proinflammatory cytokines One of the important observations of this study is the effect of CSC on NHBEs Even at a concentration of 0 4 g ml which does not induce significant changes in the viability of these cells CSC induced increases in expression of several cytokines at the mRNA level IL 1 which was significantly upregulated in NHBEs following CSC exposure has been shown to be important for activation of IL 8 6 and ICAM 1 4 This is also consistent with the report that epithelial cells regulate inflammatory events by secreting cytokines and chemokines such as IL 1 IL 8 GM CSF TNF and sICAM 1 2 These paracrine effectors can then produce further primary local inflammation or amplify the effects of previously activated macrophages eosinophils mast cells or lymphocytes A notable finding from our study is that exposure of NHBEs to CSC elicits the synthesis and release of a pattern of mediators similar to that seen in A549 cells in response to CSC These results imply that neoplastic cells and normal cells respond to CSC in a similar manner Cigarette smoke has been shown by others to induce a synthesis of glutathione and gamma glutamylcysteine that was associated with transcription factor AP 1 or an AP 1 like response element 9 Although MAPKs and NF B have been implicated in the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines the role of these pathways in normal human pulmonary epithelial cells in response to CSC has not been investigated The results of our study implicate the ERK1 2 p42 44 MAPK pathway as a key element in this inflammatory response an association that has not heretofore been reported in normal human pulmonary epithelial cells A significant finding of this study is that MAPKs such as ERK1 2 p44 p42 are consistently activated in NHBEs However upon exposure to CSC the magnitude of phosphorylation increases The finding that IL 1 expression and MAPK activation are concomitantly increased by CSC exposure and inhibited by PD98059 is consistent with the report that MAPKs activate expression of IL 1 genes 10 Although the control of cytok 80
