 Background The DNA damage checkpoint of eukaryotic cells helps ensure that DNA damage is repaired before it causes permanent genetic alterations 1 2 3 To accomplish this the checkpoint monitors the genome for damaged DNA Once damage is sensed the checkpoint delays the cell cycle to allow DNA repair enzymes sufficient time to execute their activities Evidence also shows that checkpoint proteins interface with DNA repair enzymes 4 The importance of this genomic surveillance pathway in humans is underscored by the discovery that mutated DNA damage checkpoint genes are associated with an increased incidence of cancer 5 6 7 Many components of the DNA damage checkpoint have been isolated in yeast genetic screens designed to identify mutants that continued cell cycle progression in the presence of DNA damage 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Combined with recent genetic and biochemical data it is now understood that the DNA damage checkpoint is a signal transduction cascade containing sensor transducer and receiver proteins 15 In fission yeast the checkpoint rad genes hus1 rad1 rad3 rad9 rad17 and rad26 and chk1 manage the sensing and transducing operations of the DNA damage checkpoint 1 16 Current data suggest that the Rad26 Rad3 kinase complex initially senses DNA damage by an unknown mechanism 17 This response leads to an increase in the kinase activity of the complex 18 which phosphorylates and activates the transducing protein kinase Chk1 19 Finally Chk1 delays mitotic entry by targeting Cdc25 and Wee1 regulators of cyclin dependent kinase activity 20 21 22 Hus1 Rad1 Rad9 and Rad17 facilitate Rad26 Rad3 dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 For instance they are dispensable for DNA damage dependent activation of the Rad26 Rad3 kinase complex 18 but are required for the Rad3 dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 23 Structural predictions of Hus1 Rad1 and Rad9 have led to the proposal that all three fold similarly to the subunits of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen PCNA 24 25 26 Consistent with these predictions PCNA exists as a homotrimer 27 while Hus1 Rad1 and Rad9 all interact and possibly form a heterotrimer 25 28 In addition Rad17 has sequence similarity and physical interactions with subunits of Replication Factor C RFC 29 30 Based on the RFC PCNA paradigm the Rad17 RFC complex may load the PCNA like Rad9 Rad1 Hus1 9 1 1 complex onto genomic lesions discovered by the Rad26 Rad3 complex From this location the 9 1 1 complex may link the Rad26 Rad3 complex with Chk1 Rad3 is a member of the phosphoinositide 3 kinase related kinase PIKK family 31 These proteins are large 200 kDa and share a domain related to the catalytic domain of phosphoinositide 3 kinases PI 3 kinases However unlike PI 3 kinases PIKKs are not known to phosphorylate lipids but do possess protein kinase activity Other PIKK family members also function to orchestrate eukaryotic genotoxic stress responses including human ATM ATR and DNA dependent protein kinase DNA PKcs TEL1 and MEC1 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mei 41 of Drosophila and UVSB of Aspergillus nidulans 5 32 33 34 Rad26 is a regulatory subunit of the Rad26 Rad3 complex that is required for Rad3 kinase activity 18 Following DNA damage Rad26 undergoes Rad3 dependent phosphorylation 17 Rad26 is a 70 kDa protein containing little informative sequence information beyond a predicted coiled coil region and a basic stretch that resembles a nuclear localization signal 13 32 Functionally conserved proteins with very weak sequence similarity have been found in human ATRIP 35 S cerevisiae LCD1 aka DDC2 and PIE1 36 37 38 and A nidulans UVSD 32 Rad26 Rad3 like complexes also exist in budding yeast and human In budding yeast LCD1 Rad26physically interacts with MEC1 Rad3and is phosphorylated by MEC1 Rad3following DNA damage 36 37 Likewise human ATRIP Rad26physically interacts with ATR Rad3and also undergoes DNA damage dependent phosphorylation by ATR Rad3 35 However Rad26 is required for Rad3 kinase activity in fission yeast 18 but LCD1 Rad26is not required for MEC1 Rad3kinase activity 38 while ATRIP Rad26is required for normal ATR Rad3expression 35 Thus the role of the Rad26 related proteins can differ among organisms The checkpoint system in fission yeast also allows cells to recover from checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest 9 39 40 Together with the other Checkpoint Rad proteins the Rad26 Rad3 complex controls this genetically defined pathway that likely regulates DNA repair activities For instance rad26 T12 cells undergo checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest but lose viability upon re entry into the cell cycle 40 The rad26 T12 mutation acts by reducing the stability and activity of the Rad26 Rad3 checkpoint complex 18 suggesting that cell cycle arrest requires only a pulse of Rad26 Rad3 kinase activity while recovery may require more Therefore quantitative differences in the kinase activity of the Rad3 Rad26 complex may direct the cell cycle arrest and recovery pathways Here we investigated how the Rad26 Rad3 complex detects DNA damage Using a Rad26 GFP fusion protein we found that the nuclei of cycling cells contained on average six Rad26 GFP dots of low fluorescent intensity Combined with our observations that rad26 and rad3 cells are sensitive to a microtubule depolymerizing drug we speculate that the Rad26 Rad3 complex may associate with heterochromatin Following treatment with the DNA damaging agent Bleomycin we observed two different patterns of Rad26 GFP fluorescence Nearly all nuclei 95 contained small numerous Rad26 GFP speckles and roughly 50 of these nuclei also contained one or two very bright Rad26 GFP spots Results obtained with a Rad26 T12 GFP fusion protein suggest that the speckles are linked to repair activities and the bright spots play a role in checkpoint dependent cell cycle arrest Furthermore these Rad26 GFP localization patterns appeared normal in hus1 rad1 rad9 rad17 and rad3 backgrounds Therefore Rad26 can orchestrate early events of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway without these proteins including its catalytic partner Rad3 Results Rad26 GFP Localizes to a small number of Nuclear Dots in Cycling Cells Rad26 is a regulatory subunit of the Rad3 checkpoint kinase 18 To investigate the cellular distribution of Rad26 we used a one step PCR based gene modification method 41 to fuse GFP S65T to the C terminus of the genomic copy of rad26 The Rad26 GFP fusion protein maintained proper checkpoint function following hydroxyurea HU and Bleomycin treatments data not shown Since the background fluorescence in live cycling cells was too high to derive conclusions about Rad26 GFP localization data not shown we prepared cells using a technique previously described in a study of fission yeast chromatin binding proteins 42 An asynchronous population of cycling cells was first permeabilized using Zymolyase Seikagaku Corp Tokyo then extracted with 1 Triton X 100 and finally fixed with methanol We did not observe GFP fluorescence in negative control rad26 cells Figure 1A However rad26 GFP cells contained four to eight nuclear GFP dots six on average N 100 Figure 1B Non extracted rad26 GFP cells prepared in an otherwise identical manner retained this GFP fluorescence pattern data not shown We also obtained similar results using paraformaldehyde fixation however in this case non specific cytoplasmic background fluorescence was higher data not shown Rad26 GFP Localization in Cycling Cells does not depend on Checkpoint Rad Proteins Next we tested if Rad26 GFP localization to dots in cycling cells depended upon the Checkpoint Rad proteins The rad26 GFP allele was crossed into five checkpoint rad alleles hus1 rad1 rad9 rad17 and rad3 and Rad26 GFP localization was assayed in Triton X 100 extracted cells None of the checkpoint rad alleles affected Rad26 GFP localization in cycling cells although we did observe a slight decrease in the intensity of the fluorescence signal in these genetic backgrounds rad9 rad26 GFP cells are shown in Figure 1C hus1 rad1 rad17 and rad3 cells containing rad26 GFP are not shown Therefore the checkpoint Rad proteins are not required for proper localization of Rad26 GFP in cycling cells rad26 and rad3 Share Sensitivity to a Microtubule De polymerizing Drug Three pieces of evidence suggest that Checkpoint Rad proteins are physically associated with heterochromatin First Rad26 and Rad3 are required to maintain proper telomere structure and telomere associated gene silencing 43 Second chromatin immunoprecipitation ChIP experiments demonstrate that over expressed Rad3 HA exists at telomeres 44 Third Triton X 100 extraction shown previously to remove non chromatin bound proteins 42 failed to disrupt the Rad26 GFP dots in the nuclei of cycling cells see Figure 1 Physiological experiments can also be used to characterize heterochromatin binding proteins 45 For example absence of Swi6 in fission yeast sensitizes cells to thiabendazole TBZ a microtubule depolymerizing drug 46 Presumably this occurs because absence of Swi6 disrupts centromeric heterochromatin and as a result sensitizes cells to drugs that compromise spindle function To test whether checkpoint mutants are sensitive to microtubule depolymerization drugs we spotted serial dilutions of cultures on plates containing 20 mg ml TBZ As shown both rad26 and rad3 cells were sensitive to TBZ Figure 2 Mutations that disrupt the microtubule cytoskeleton are also known to sensitize cells to TBZ 47 However using anti tubulin immunofluorescence we did not discover any gross microtubule cytoskeletal abnormalities in rad26 and rad3 cells data not shown These data lead us to speculate that the Rad26 Rad3 complex possibly associates with centromeric heterochromatin in cycling cells We are currently testing this hypothesis Strains carrying the rad26 T12 mutation undergo cell cycle arrest following treatment with a DNA damage agent but lose viability upon re entry into the cell cycle 13 40 We found that the rad26 T12 strain is significantly less sensitive to TBZ than rad26 and rad3 Figure 2 Therefore deficiencies in the recovery activities of Rad26 are not related to this TBZ phenotype Checkpoint rad mutants do not share TBZ Sensitivity Next we tested if the four other checkpoint rad alleles hus1 rad1 rad9 and rad17 conferred TBZ sensitivity Figure 3 Interestingly rad9 and rad1 but not rad17 and hus1 shared this phenotype Since each of the checkpoint rads is an essential component of the checkpoint TBZ sensitivity can not be the indirect result of defects in the checkpoint response The kinase activity of Rad3 is essential for checkpoint signaling and is the only known biochemical function of this 220 kDa protein 48 49 The rad3 a strain has an amino acid change D2230A in the conserved kinase domain of Rad3 that eliminates cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damaging agents 48 49 Interestingly we found that the rad3 a strain is less sensitive to TBZ than the rad3 and rad26 strains Figure 4 Therefore TBZ sensitivity is caused by more than loss of Rad3 kinase activity alone Rad26 GFP Spots and Speckles Form in Response to DNA Damage To test if Rad26 GFP localization changes in response to DNA damage a culture of rad26 GFP cells was grown to mid log phase optical density 0 3 and then treated with Bleomycin a radiomimetic drug for 3 hours before fixation and DAPI staining The rad26 GFP cells underwent a normal checkpoint response following Bleomycin treatment and arrested cell cycle progression with one nucleus in a long cell Figure 5A We observed two distinct patterns of GFP fluorescence in these treated cells First nearly every cell 95 contained many small foci that we call speckles Figure 5A These speckles are different than the larger less numerous dots 6 on average that we observed in untreated cycling cells compare Figure 1Bwith Figure 5A Second approximately half of Bleomycin treated cells also contained one or two bright nuclear spots Figure 5B arrow denotes the speckles that formed in these cells We found that 2 of untreated cycling rad26 GFP cells contained one or two Rad26 GFP spots while 55 of Bleomycin treated rad26 GFP cells formed these spots Figure 6 Since we also observed these spots in live Bleomycin treated rad26 GFP cells data not shown these results were not affected by methanol fixation Furthermore both spots and speckles formed within 30 minutes of Bleomycin addition data not shown These data show that speckles and one or two bright nuclear Rad26 GFP spots form in Bleomycin treated cells These changes in Rad26 GFP localization could be a direct response to the DNA damage caused by Bleomycin treatment or an indirect consequence of G2 M cell cycle arrest that occurs after checkpoint activation The cdc25 gene encodes a positive mitotic regulator 50 that is also a target of DNA damage checkpoint signaling 51 At the restrictive temperature 37 C the temperature sensitive cdc25 22 allele causes cells to arrest at the G2 M boundary 52 To test if these Bleomycin induced patterns of Rad26 GFP fluorescence formed as an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest we crossed the cdc25 22 mutation into a rad26 GFP background A cdc25 22 rad26 GFP strain was isolated and grown to mid log phase before shifting to the restrictive temperature for 3 hours This caused the cells to arrest cell cycle progression with a single nucleus in a long cell data not shown but did not increase the formation of Rad26 GFP spots Figure 6 or speckles data not shown These data suggest that both patterns of Rad26 GFP fluorescence spots and speckles occur as a result of DNA damage as opposed to the checkpoint induced G2 M cell cycle delay that follows Bleomycin treatment Formation of Rad26 GFP Spots and Speckles after DNA Damage does not require Other Checkpoint Rad Proteins Next we tested if these patterns of Rad26 GFP fluorescence formed in other checkpoint rad cells Similar to results obtained in a wild type background we observed that between 48 and 56 of checkpoint rad cells formed one or two bright Rad26 GFP spots following Bleomycin treatment Figures 5Cand 7 We also observed that some of these cells contained Rad26 GFP speckles arrow in Figure 5C However the Rad26 GFP signal in rad cells was slightly weaker than what we observed in a rad background compare Figure 5Cwith 5A and 5B and we were unable to confidently determine the efficiency by which rad cells formed Rad26 GFP speckles following DNA damage An elevated number of untreated cycling checkpoint rad cells contained one or two bright Rad26 GFP spots While 2 of untreated rad26 GFP cells contained these spots between 3 and 7 of untreated checkpoint rad cells formed them Figure 7 The spots may form in response to spontaneous DNA damage that can arise during a typical cell cycle and the absence of Hus1 Rad1 Rad3 Rad9 or Rad17 may increase these events We also tested if Rad3 kinase activity was required for re localization of Rad26 GFP following Bleomycin treatment However neither the rad3 a nor a rad3 allele significantly affected the ability of Rad26 GFP to form the bright foci following Bleomycin treatment Figure 8 Therefore Rad26 can respond to DNA damage in the absence of Rad3 Rad26 GFP Spots are Associated with Cell Cycle Arrest and Speckles are Associated with Recovery Rad26 functions in checkpoint cell cycle arrest and recovery pathways A mutant allele rad26 T12 genetically separates these functions since rad26 T12 cells can undergo checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest but fail to recover and lose viability 13 40 To determine if spots and speckles are associated with these different Rad26 functions we tagged the C terminus of Rad26 T12 with GFP using the same primers and method that we used to tag Rad26 see Methods After confirming that the rad26 T12 GFP strain behaved similarly to a rad26 T12 strain in response to both Bleomycin and HU data not shown we investigated Rad26 T12 GFP localization following Bleomycin treatment We observed that bright spots formed in both rad26 GFP and rad26 T12 GFP cells that had been extracted with Triton X 100 prior to microscopy Figure 9 Figure 10Aand 10B We also observed speckles in rad26 GFP cells Figure 10A but did not identify these structures in Bleomycin treated rad26 T12 GFP cells Figure 10B Likewise both spots and speckles formed in paraformaldehyde fixed rad26 GFP cells while only spots formed in rad26 T12 GFP cells Figure 10C These data link the bright Rad26 GFP spots with the cell cycle arrest activities of the DNA damage checkpoint and suggest that Rad26 GFP speckles play a role in recovery Discussion Dots spots and speckles cytology of Rad26 GFP The Rad26 Rad3 complex plays a critical role in the checkpoint response to DNA damage in fission yeast Here we studied the cytological events that may be associated with these functions of the complex In normal cycling cells Rad26 GFP localized to between 4 8 dots Figure 1B After DNA damage Rad26 GFP localized to numerous smaller foci called speckles compare Figures 1Band 5A Approximately half of these damaged cells also contained one or two bright Rad26 GFP spots Figure 5B In this discussion we consider the location and function of these distinct cytological structures Dots Rad26 GFP localization in normal cycling cells For technical reasons we were unable to conclusively identify these structures Figure 1B but for a number of reasons we believe that they may be associated with sites of heterochromatin First the Rad26 GFP dots were resistant to an extraction method that was developed to specifically preserve the localization of chromatin binding proteins 42 Secondly we discovered that the rad26 strain is sensitive to TBZ a phenotype common to mutants that disrupt centromeric heterochromatin 45 Finally fission yeast has a relatively small number of heterochromatic regions 3 centromeres 6 telomeres and 1 mating type locus 53 54 and the number of Rad26 GFP dots we observe is roughly consistent with localization to these regions In addition other studies have revealed a functional role for checkpoint Rad proteins in telomere maintenance 43 44 while one has shown that an over expressed epitope tagged version of Rad3 associates with telomeric DNA 44 It will be interesting to determine if checkpoint proteins have a role in centromere function or mating type silencing both of which require intact heterochromatic structures Alternative explanations exist For example the microtubule cytoskeleton has been implicated in recombination dependent DNA repair processes in budding yeast 55 The TBZ sensitivity of DNA damage checkpoint mutants such as rad26 and rad3 may indicate that checkpoint proteins cooperate with the cytoskeleton during such repair TBZ sensitivity reveals novel aspects of checkpoint Rad protein function The TBZ sensitivity assay identifies distinct functions of checkpoint Rad proteins In particular rad1 and rad9 are also sensitive to TBZ while rad17 and hus1 are not Figure 3 Studies suggest that Hus1 Rad1 and Rad9 function together to form a PCNA like clamp complex that is loaded onto DNA by Rad17 16 This model predicts that all four proteins should show the same levels of TBZ sensitivity since deletion of any of the four proteins should prevent formation of a functional clamp The TBZ data shown here suggest that at least Rad1 and Rad9 have roles that are independent of their function in the PCNA like clamp In addition we found that rad3 a a mutation that disrupts Rad3 kinase activity confers less TBZ sensitivity than a rad3 allele Figure 4 To our knowledge this is the first study to detect physiological differences between a kinase dead allele of rad3 and a full deletion This demonstrates that Rad3 has a biochemical activity in addition to its catalytic kinase activity TBZ sensitivity may reveal a novel role for checkpoint Rad proteins that is independent of the DNA damage checkpoint response Alternatively some structure that is required to prevent TBZ sensitivity such as centromeric heterochromatin may function in checkpoint control Possibly the Rad26 Rad3 complex localizes to regions of heterochromatin centromeres telomeres and the mating type loci in undamaged cells From these vantage points the Rad26 Rad3 complex may survey the entire genome for DNA damage For example heterochromatin functions in the organization of chromatin the cohesive force existing between chromatids and the tension on chromosomes produced by the spindle apparatus 56 57 DNA damage may produce changes in these elements By localizing to heterochromatic regions the Rad26 Rad3 complex possibly monitors such elements to perceive DNA damage on a genome wide scale Spots and Speckles localization of Rad26 GFP in response to DNA damage Within thirty minutes of Bleomycin treatment the Rad26 GFP dots found in cycling cells were replaced by speckles and spots Figures 5Aand 5B Both of these Rad26 GFP patterns were absent from G2 M arrested cdc25 22 rad26 GFP cells Figure 6 so they likely resulted from Bleomycin induced DNA damage as opposed to checkpoint induced cell cycle arrest Also both types of Rad26 GFP patterns formed independently of the other checkpoint Rad proteins Figures 5Cand 7 and did not require Rad3 kinase activity or Rad3 Figure 8 Together these analyses suggest that the cytological changes of Rad26 GFP are very early steps in the process of checkpoint activation that are directed entirely by Rad26 Interestingly speckle formation was compromised in Bleomycin treated rad26 T12 GFP cells which are cell cycle arrest proficient but recovery deficient Figure 10 In contrast formation of the Rad26 T12 GFP spots occurred normally after Bleomycin treatment Figures 9and 10 These results suggest that the speckles could be associated with DNA repair and recovery activities while the spots could be associated with cell cycle arrest Following ultraviolet radiation of HeLa cells paraformaldehyde fixation and Triton X 100 extraction Cortez et al 35 found that ATRIP Rad26and ATR Rad3also re localize to a large number of intranuclear foci DNA repair activities may take place at these foci since BRCA1 has been shown to co localize with ATR in damage induced foci 58 Using elegant methods to test for direct association of DNA damage checkpoint proteins at double strand breaks in vivo other groups have shown that MEC1 Rad3 HA and LCD1 Rad26 GFP localize to sites of DNA damage 59 60 However MEC1 was required for this re localization of LCD1 GFP in vivo 60 Thus while re localization of Rad26 Rad3 related complexes to sites of DNA repair may be evolutionarily conserved the regulation of these complexes is not Unlike ATRIP and LCD1 GFP Rad26 GFP also localizes to one or two bright spots following DNA damage Figure 5 We speculate that these spots could represent control centers where various kinds of information about the status of the genome is integrated with cell cycle progression in fission yeast We tested if these spots were associated with the spindle pole body SPB given that an ultimate receiver of the checkpoint signal Cdc2 resides at the SPB prior to mitosis in fission yeast 61 However these Rad26 GFP foci did not co localize with a SPB marker Sad1 data not shown 62 Conclusion We have discovered three distinct Rad26 GFP cellular structures Since formation of these structures did not require other checkpoint proteins including Rad3 we believe that they represent very early steps in the checkpoint response to damaged DNA that may be controlled entirely by Rad26 In normal cycling cells Rad26 GFP localized to a small number of dots that may function as surveillance centers and monitor the genome for DNA damage After damage Rad26 GFP localization to speckles may correspond to the direct interaction of Rad26 with sites of damage At the bright spots Rad26 may integrate various kinds of information about the status of the genome with cell cycle regulators Further study of these structures and their regulation could provide important new information about the early steps in DNA damage detection and the checkpoint pathway Methods Strains Growth Conditions and Physiological Methods The strains used in this study Table 1 were grown at 30 C under standard conditions 63 unless noted otherwise Bleomycin Sigma St Louis MO was prepared as a 3 U ml stock solution in water and kept at 20 C To activate the DNA damage checkpoint Bleomycin was added to cultures optical density of 0 3 at a concentration of 5 mU ml for 3 hours 28 Thiabendazole Sigma was prepared in DMSO as described previously 45 and added to cooled YE5S agar prior to pouring plates We did not observe an affect of DMSO on the growth of any strains used in this study data not shown To arrest the cdc25 22 rad26 GFP strain at the G2 M boundary TE1198 was grown at 30 C in liquid complete media to O D 0 3 Next cells were collected by centrifugation and re inoculated to the same density in pre warmed 37 C liquid media They were grown for 3 hours at this temperature to cause cell cycle arrest at the G2 M boundary before fixation Microscopy To observe Rad26 GFP in live cells yeast were grown in YE5S liquid medium to an optical density of 0 5 washed three times in
