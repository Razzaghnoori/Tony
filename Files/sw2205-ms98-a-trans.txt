 well i really enjoy reading the newspaper we get the daily and Dallas Morning News and i try to look at it if i get busy i don t get a chance to pick it up like this week i noticed several copies have been untouched haven t been touched but uh well do you have time to read the paper in the morning well not in the morning but um if the well i have two son children and if they uh go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i ll you know maybe go outside and read the paper while they re playing or sit in a chair by the window or something you know a lot a lot of people don t take newspapers at all we we took the Morning News for a while and then uh well we ve been taking the Times Herald for ages and then um hum uh dog just ran off with my shoe that s off the subject went outside picked it up and ran off anyway um and then we switched the Morning News but we found we couldn t read enough of it and by the time i got home and had time to to read some but but i guess the the issue is uh beside the newspaper do you take any news magazines well we i don t take like Time or Newsweek or anything like that but i do like to watch um CNN i have several chores and things to do so it comes on at like the nine o clock PM and so i will turn that on while i m doing some work and i can hear the news not have to sit right down and listen to it did did you did you hear what Schwartzkopf had to say about uh Pete Arnett and uh the the news coverage well he didn t have too good of opinion of it no i mean yes i did hear that and so um i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you re reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor well any you know Time magazine and even the news that sometimes that that s why i like some diversity the idea that i we have Time which which we we take from time to time and we the problem is they call up and make this deal you know and well we re taking that and and we also hit the Garland uh huh Garland Daily News i guess it s it comes out sporadically like twice a week or something but i think what s interesting is that if you re that there uh this uh huh as difficult as he is or as as much as they try they put some bias i had the chance to hear Tracy Rowlett speak to a group and it was interesting that they think that they re basically impartial hum and that but and and you know people accuse them of controlling the news he says you know we don t control the news we just report it the way we the way it is and uh huh well i wouldn t think that i would really say that that s not true because um it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates yes and so um news stations always tell the story from a certain angle and that s why it s a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions you may never get the truth but you ll have a variety to choose from yes and i i thought that was particularly interesting in the the Gulf War that there were pieces of information that that were apparently uh leaked just as a as as uh a a ploy which was um i i find that fascinating that uh um hum yeah i do too do you ever listen to the radio or any i listen to KRLD and uh KLIF the news talk radio and i actually listen to CNN radio do you know it was on radio now um hum no i don t it s on eleven ninety hum i really um have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of even music and um well when i go to work i listen yeah my husband does and it s how come he usually calls me sometimes and says oh i just heard on the news that such and such happened you know if it s something really interesting and and then i ll know to yeah to keep an eye out for it but i ve got out of the habit of listening to the radio well with with your you know if you re around the home though and and and can watch TV and read the paper the problem is is that about twenty minutes of news radio or thirty minutes is and then they start repeating everything um hum and and so it s kind of a oh that s what s interesting is the CNN uh i don t think i m trying to think if it s much local i listen to a little of that and i listen to a little of ninety point one i i m i m inveterate switcher uh huh that ninety eight point seven i m i m eclectic approach do you have a particular local channel that you watch on television well i watch channel five but that has to be that s another bias that has to do with the weather reporting i m not sure that actually i think channel eight is probably but i know Dave Fox he goes to our church so um hum um well i am we re fairly new to the area and so we re still shopping for a favorite channel well the channel eight when they came here thirteen fourteen years ago Dave Fox and Tracy Rowlett came together uh from Oklahoma City and apparently channel eight was way down and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job and then um hum they ve been some people move around and uh John Chriswell is anyway the i i don t know do you do you do you seem to can you tell much difference between the local radio TV stations well i really think so i noticed on channel eight that there s all of the um anchors are seem to be like White Anglo Saxon Protestant type people and they all seem to be you know fairly similar and i kind of prefer a you know some females i don t recall that they have any female anchors and i like different i like the anchors to be different kinds of people i think that adds to the diversity i think that uh i like that uh there i know you know John Wylie Price i don t know if you kept up but he s been protesting that um hum yes i have and um i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you re more more likely to get yeah and i think he has legitimate argument i mean you can uh i i i grew up in Alabama and so i i have some prejudices um hum but i think that i think that that from a a justice standpoint because we have the option of not watching that station uh i m not sure i i m um hum totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs but i think that uh in some cases there there should be some real opportunity and and some diversity and yeah and this kind of thing and i think that Dallas it turns out though from what i understand has quite good i occasionally go to Saint Louis and uh there for a few days and watch the news and and i think Dallas really does have um hum have quite good news i think channel eight is the number one uh ABC affiliate in the US i think Tracy Rowlett was saying that he course he pumping his own oh really well we you know like all of the stations seem to be pretty good it s just we haven t found one that we ve snuggled into Houston so we had a where d you move from a favorite or i did have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news i guess because you get use to you like the anchors and you feel comfortable with them and yeah it is interesting though it becomes a little of personality in fact the the guy that was on the weatherman on channel eight worked for me oh long time ago twenty years or so even longer than that twenty one twenty three years ago or so um hum twenty four anyway long time ago and and shortly after i got we got here fourteen years ago and uh they had they had fired him uh because he was too anyway didn t he didn t have the personality and wasn t drawing the crowds and that s interesting is that s that s what the TV stations do they re trying to get ratings um hum that s true their job and i think if we remember that that they re out after the ratings that s true so that really effects how they report the news and some well it s like the the Dale Hansen on channel eight little is a sometimes a little too cutesy but i wonder if we re coming up on ten minutes have you talked have you been on the conversation when they beeped you at ten minutes with is he the sports yes i guess it is time to close now so i can run go help put the kids to bed but i have yes it s nice bye bye okay well good talking to you good night
