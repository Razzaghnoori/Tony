 Smack Happy Last week the press reprised one of its favorite stories Heroin is back The news hook was the July 12 death of Smashing Pumpkins side man Jonathan Melvoin 34 while shooting scag in a Park Avenue hotel The Washington Post Page One obit on Melvoin claimed without substantiation a resurgence in heroin use in the 90s while the New York Times asserted that the heroin vogue has been building since at least 1993 and shows no signs of ebbing Trainspotting the new movie about young Scottish junkies provided another useful occasion for noting this alleged trend Smack Is Back For the press smack is always back It never goes away but it s always returning Boarding the Nexis wayback machine we find that nearly every publication in America has sounded the heroin clarion yearly since 1989

Claims Unlikely Victims 1996 The granddaddy of the genre appeared 15 years ago in Newsweek Middle Class Junkies Aug 10 1981 with language that reads as fresh today as it did then We learn that heroin has breached its ghetto quarantine C hildren of affluence are venturing where once the poor and desperate nodded out The drug is being retailed at rock clubs at Hollywood parties and among lunch time crowds in predominately white business districts As always part of the problem is a glut of white powder S heer abundance is prompting concern about a potential epidemic spilling across demographic divides And heroin purity is increasing dramatically Purity levels as high as 90 percent have been found in seized wholesale caches with street level purities averaging up to 20 percent around six times the typical strength of the 1970 Turkish blend Having hit 90 percent 15 years ago you wouldn t think that heroin purity could keep rising But for the press it has The Washington Post s story about Melvoin reported that heroin purity has risen from as low as 4 percent in past decades to upward of 70 percent today while the Los Angeles Times piece noted that heroin had gone from 4 percent purity in 1980 to 40 percent in 1995 After Melvoin died the Associated Press reported that the heroin he shot was 60 percent to 70 percent pure Depending on where you drop the Nexis plumb line you can find references to more potent street heroin in the recent past A 1989 New York Times story pegged the potency of heroin at 45 percent In 1990 the Washington Post placed average purity at 30 percent to 40 percent A Seattle Times story from 1992 quoted a Drug Enforcement Administration source who said that in the 70s heroin was typically 25 percent to 30 percent pure but that heroin seized in the early 90s was now topping the scales at 67 percent pure A 1996 government study puts purity at 59 percent so if the DEA was right a few years ago recent purity actually has declined somewhat There is good evidence that potency isn t the most significant risk factor in overdose deaths A study of heroin overdoses in Washington D C the findings of which were published by the Journal of Forensic Sciences 1989 found no relationship between heroin purity and death by overdose or nonfatal overdose On the night that Melvoin shot that 60 to 70 percent heroin and died Pumpkins drummer Jimmy Chamberlin shot the same junk and survived The researchers attributed most overdoses to intermittent or post addiction use of heroin meaning that people who OD d tended to misjudge tolerance when returning to the drug Another risk factor that never gets enough ink in the heroin obsessed media is the danger of using heroin in combination with alcohol The mixture has an additive effect A drinker could spike himself with a lower than lethal dose and still OD What do we really know about heroin use For one thing the federal government s National Drug Control Strategy for 1996 says that the addict population is basically stable It reports that the number of casual users less than weekly of heroin came down by nearly half between 1988 and 1993 539 000 to 229 000 the most recent year measured while the number of heavy users at least weekly dipped from 601 000 to 500 000 One statistic feeding the heroin revival stories is the increasing number of emergency room visits by people who mention heroin as a reason for seeking ER treatment But the statistics which come from the government s latest Drug Abuse Warning Network DAWN survey come with a disclaimer suggesting that the explanation may be multiple visits by aging druggies who are using the ER for a variety of health problems My bet is that when the medical examiner releases his report on Jonathan Melvoin next week it will disclose that the smashed pumpkin was drinking booze while shooting a fatal error that pre 50s addicts almost never made We ll learn that Melvoin like the press was an amateur who didn t really know what he was doing with heroin What the Hell Are Flame Posies Seamus Heaney s poem The Little Canticles of Asturias which appeared in the debut issue of SLATE contains a mesmerizing image of a smouldering maw of a pile of newspapers lit long ago fanning up in the wind breaking off and away in flame posies small airborne fire ships Heaney s verse reminded me that everything even awful newspaper stories is beautiful when it burns Such was the inspiration that I embraced Flame Posies as the name for my occasional column on the press I also hope that the oxymoron will remind me to include applause as well as condemnation in my dispatches Illustrations by Robert Neubecker
