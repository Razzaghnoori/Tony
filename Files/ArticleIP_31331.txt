 What Would Buddha Do Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence My significant other is driving me berserk He changes religious beliefs like some people change clothes This might be only peculiar and therefore tolerable but he expects me to accompany him as well as get into the philosophy of the moment I really do not have time for this and to be truthful do not share his passion for religious theory I gave it a try but can no longer play along How would you recommend I deal with this And him Pulling My Hair Out in Chicago Dear Pull Your trendy friend sounds like a handful If you are interested in maintaining the relationship you need to spell out that lovers need not share every interest and that his searching for new belief systems is particularly tiring for you It would be helpful if you had a religion that you started with and said you wished to retain but failing that tell the theologian that you are making a new beginning that he has your blessings pardon the expression to pursue the religion of his choice alone If he throws it up to you that you used to go to all the various services with him tell him that was Zen this is now Prudie individually Dear Prudie My wife of eight years is starting to make me wonder if she is mature enough to even be married She spends more time with her girlfriends most of whom are from high school than she does with me We have no children I wind up doing many things alone on weekends and in the evenings because she always has plans with the girls My wish is to make this marriage work because I love my wife but I am feeling like second fiddle to a gang of girls Any ideas Stumped Dear Stump Do you know the saying We re all grown ups here Well that seems not to be the case in your life Your wife sounds immature to the max Prudie is at a disadvantage however not knowing the details and the dynamics of your marriage Just regarding the complaint about reliance on girlfriends though Prudie suggests you have a loooong and serious heart to heart with your wife outlining your disturbance with her choices Ask if she wishes to be married Ask if she has complaints about you If she is willing a couples therapist might be helpful One way or the other you have to resolve the situation Prudie amicably Dear Prudence My father was married once before my mother and has three children from his earlier marriage I am 25 and my stepbrothers are in their late 30s All three are intelligent two are lawyers one has an MBA but have never found themselves in stable situations All three have been bankrupt at one point during the past three years All three apportion a great deal of guilt to my father who did not win custody of them when they were younger Their mother was not a good one and I recognize that they have emotional scars However my father never fails to bail them out of a financial crisis While my father has done well he is by no means wealthy I know he has dipped into his retirement fund several times to help my siblings out What bothers me is that while my childhood was far more normal I demonstrate more responsibility in my financial obligations school loans etc than my elder siblings and frankly would be embarrassed to ask my father for money because I couldn t get a handle on life My father came from a poor family and I would like him to enjoy his retirement Is it appropriate for me to say anything to him regarding this matter I do love my elder sibs but feel they are exploiting my father with guilt Concerned in D C Dear Con It sounds as though you have your father s well being at heart so you might gently engage him in a conversation about your concerns Do articulate that you do not feel competitive with your half brothers and try to bring up the question of making reparations out of guilt Also mention that bailing out these boys may not be in their best interests He cannot help but be touched if you tell him of your concerns for his comfortable retirement He may be amenable to what you have to say or he may not Once you ve brought the subject up however know that you can take it no further In the end it is his money and his guilt It is admirable that you regard responsibility in a different way than the three boys you write about It is interesting too that the two lawyers and the MBA display financial incompetence Prudie recommends by the way that you not bring up this subject with your brothers That way lies fireworks Prudie gingerly Dear Prudie This is going back a bit but I was struck by the letter from As a psychology professor a previous psych major and an avocational singer I agree with your advice to Go for it but think there s yet another option that Carpe should consider before running away from home or from college Since Carpe is already enrolled in college why not take a minor in music or even double major in psychology and music Surely Mom and Dad can t object to that but more important Carpe has this wonderful opportunity to increase her musical skills develop her talent and make important connections that could lead to jobs Why not take the four years to do all that and then run away to pursue her dreams fully prepared Sincerely One Who Has Her Singing Dream and Her Psychology Job Dear One Why not indeed What you suggest is very sound advice and Prudie thanks you for being a Prudie Prudie rationally
