 Culture In France It s in the Blood Last week the French weekly L Express had a cover story entitled Cinema How To Fight Back Against America Meanwhile three French ex ministers including ex prime minister Laurent Fabius went on trial for letting thousands get transfused with AIDS infected blood in the mid 1980s These aren t unrelated stories One reason France has the highest number of transfusion borne AIDS cases in Europe is negligence Well after the 1983 discovery of the AIDS virus by French scientists incidentally but before screening was possible France continued to harvest much of its blood supply from prison populations Transfusions are also given more routinely in France than elsewhere to mothers post delivery for instance But here s the big reason Fabius is on trial For three months in the spring of 1985 his government failed to implement screening techniques readily available from Abbott Laboratories an American company At that time Abbott s rivals at the French Pasteur Institute were browbeating every politico within lobbying range to wait for the development of a French procedure which they promised was only weeks away Long weeks if you were a hemophiliac So why did the Fabius government agree to hold off Part of the blame lies with French cultural politics particularly the cultural nationalism of the first Mitterrand administration In 1981 Culture Minister Jack Lang got Mitterrand to double his ministry s budget Two things really bugged Lang The first famously was America His early days in office were marked by embarrassingly thorough diktats aimed at purging French of Anglicisms and frothy tirades against the Deauville festival of American film The second bee in Lang s bonnet was the negligible position of culture in day to day life Lang was ultimately a materialist who felt that culture wasn t real unless it was shaping politics and the economy His ministry s motto was conomie et culture m me combat So he launched what historian Marc Fumaroli in his magisterial L tat Culturel calls a strategy of opinion intoxication He had Rimbaud selections printed for distribution to government ministers His most Ozymandian efforts in this direction were gargantuan Woodstock style concerts on behalf of the state sponsored initiative SOS Racism Lang and Danielle Mitterrand and associated hangers on were always insistent that the concerts created a climate of tolerance All right then Should they therefore shoulder responsibility for the climate of medical industrial chauvinism that led the Fabius government to let people die of AIDS while awaiting a French way of testing blood In their defense France has had a fairly consistent cultural policy for the past two decades The socialist Lang trashed Rambo the conservative Jacques Toubon decreed that 40 percent of songs on the radio must be French chansons I m sympathetic to worries about being swamped by U S culture armed as it is with theater monopolies language advantages and economies of scale It s good that France remain a non Anglo Saxon exception culturelle and a certain price within reason is worth paying for it But I m afraid the answer is Yes Christopher Caldwell
