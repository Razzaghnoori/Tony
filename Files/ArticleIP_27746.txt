 That s a Wrap If the rowdy and facetious new film The Mummy suggests anything it s that we ve come to what Francis Fukuyama might call the end of horror movies The horror genre lost its life s blood when filmmakers began to worry about being laughed at by teen agers who d seen it all before and to incorporate kids imagined responses into their pictures so that you got the movie and the Mystery Science Theater 3000 burlesque of the movie at the same time Forget about the vague fear of the nameless otherwise known as dread Forget about awe too unless it s short for Awesome dude in response to some pricey special effect Bring on the ironic one liners and the slapstick ghoul bashing kung fu and let s party Postmodern jokiness can only undermine the mummy subgenre which has at its heart the most ancient of scary ideas If you presume to violate an alien culture and make off with its sacred objects you re going to be visited by a monster that s beyond the power of your own culture to combat There s a big dollop of xenophobia here old mummy pictures are full of stilted English actors pretending to be icily vengeful Egyptians but there s also a less chauvinistic implication a rebuke to our Western imperialist sense of entitlement For all its nonsensical trappings the mummy narrative is serious business because when other peoples passionately held taboos are casually flouted it is serious business Just ask Salman Rushdie The invasion of a mummy s tomb results in a fatwa made flesh or if not flesh then bandages and bones rendered really really nasty by righteous wrath Some of these ideas can be found in the new The Mummy but they have been stripped of their weight and cultural resonance In their place is a lot of sub Raiders of the Lost Ark swashbuckling plus sight gags pilfered from Sam Raimi s 1993 Army of Darkness the last of his The Evil Dead trilogy and genre deflating banter that s like an untalented sophomore s stab at Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 The juvenile script is by the director Stephen Sommers There isn t a mummy at the center of The Mummy exactly but a mutating Industrial Light and Magic Special Effect Under it supposedly is Imhotep Arnold Vosloo an ancient priest discovered in the movie s prologue in a compromising position with the Pharaoh s mistress who kills herself in an act of feminist defiance My body is no longer his temple When Imhotep goes to Hamunaptra the City of the Dead to revive her he is stopped by the Pharoah s guards shorn of his tongue then wrapped in gauze and buried alive with a swarm of scabrous beetles Legend has it that if he s ever revived he ll visit the 10 plagues of Egypt upon the world Legend has it right as it turns out but it s a long hour before roguish adventurer Brendan Fraser can transport dimwitted 1920s Pandora heroine Rachel Weisz to Hamunaptra so that she can open the Book of the Dead and start stupidly incanting It takes another hour to search for the Book of the Dead s opposite number which will theoretically send Imhotep back to the cosmic soup from which he sprang before he can transfer the heroine s soul to the embalmed remains of his lady love The Special Effect a k a the mummy reminded me of the Ghost of Christmas Future in the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged 1988 It s tall and mottled and has a wiggly mouth that can suddenly distend itself and emit a Jurassic Park style roar It has all manner of superpowers turning itself into a puff of smoke a hurricane and a swarm of ravenous locusts It can appropriate pieces of its victims anatomies in an effort to reconstitute itself an idea cribbed from Clive Barker s 1987 Hellraiser but less gorily executed for the sake of a kiddie friendly PG 13 It can also revive its mummified fellow priests and send them into battle against our heroes The Special Effect can do almost anything except look scary It s not solely the fault of Industrial Light and Magic Slapstick and horror aren t an easy mix Sam Raimi might be the only one who can pull it off when his spastic hyperkinetic ghouls come at you they seem genuinely invasive The ghouls of lesser artists just bash into one another like Keystone Korpses T he Mummy isn t as inept as last year s Godzilla it more or less hits its marks and some nonindustry people at the preview I attended claimed to have been entertained The cast is certainly game Fraser has a long rangy body and a gee whiz openness that makes him perfect for a comic book hero and the lovely Weisz whose eyes are so far apart that they re almost in different time zones brings a screwball aplomb to the dizzy distaff Egyptologist As her brother John Hannah Gwyneth Paltrow s love struck Scottish lapdog in last year s Sliding Doors is too stridently the Comic Relief in a movie in which the hero and heroine are already busy comedically relieving themselves but he s a hard chap to dislike The villain is another kettle of leeches I adored Vosloo as Lance Henriksen s black garbed femininely insinuating henchman in the John Woo Jean Claude Van Damme action picture Hard Target 1993 But Vosloo doesn t have the physiognomy for a role incarnated variously by the gaunt Boris Karloff 1932 and the totemic Christopher Lee 1959 Bald and round headed he s about as imposing as Curly of the Three Stooges T he Mummy is a debauchery but not a true defilement Mummy movies don t constitute an especially glorious cinematic legacy Only the Karloff original directed by Karl Freund qualifies as a classic with its sleek Egyptian Deco d cor and its matchlessly eerie scene of the mummy s awakening Bramwell Fletcher s hysterical laughter in the creature s wake He went for a little walk echoes in the annals of horror film history Still I have a soft spot for all those dreary Lon Chaney Jr sequels that ended with the lurching half blind golem lugging a slack blonde through the swamps while George Zucco in a turban hisses something like Faster Kharis Before the torch wielding infidels converge on the sacred tomb of Ananka I can t make a case for the dim Hammer Films remakes either although it s always fun to watch Peter Cushing get strangled by Christopher Lee No Sommers hasn t blasphemed He doesn t deserve to have his eyes and tongue sucked out his brain dashed against the side of a tomb or to be consumed by scarab beetles or flayed by locusts But he has put another nail in the horror genre s sarcophagus He should at least lose a hand In some cultures they cut off hands and even more vital body parts when they find out you re gay Steven Carter Ben Silverstone the stringy English hero of Get Real merely faces parental disapproval social ostracization and a dishy jock lover Brad Gorton who doesn t want to acknowledge him in the halls of their high school Still it s enough The strength of this agreeable comedy directed by Simon Shore from a screenplay by Patrick Wilde is that it makes even the tiniest sexual encounters seem emotionally momentous They would be anyway at this age but Steven has fewer avenues for self expression than his heterosexual peers and the pressure builds Despite its gay subject matter Get Real is rather wholesome and didactic Steven writes an essay for the yearbook called Get Real and the film climaxes with a speech about wanting to be recognized and loved for who you really are There s nothing glib about Silverstone s performance though At times he s believably stricken at others believably affectless as if every emotion has been wrapped up so tightly for fear of discovery that there s no such thing as a natural response He s in danger of becoming a true mummy
