        okay um   where do you live   in Plano   in Plano   yes where do you live   in Dallas   oh okay   uh the air pollution isnt too bad in our area so were very fortunate but   huh   i know in some areas its really it it really is bad   um i was trying to think uh something we were watching the other day and they were doing an overview of Los Angeles uh from an area that was up higher and you literally could see the band of smog that uh ive never been out there but   i havent either   it was it was quite evident  that   uhhuh   it was a real brown area and   well i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that and unfortunately i think there are a lot of areas that are that that bad particularly in the areas where there are industries uh   yeah   where they are burning a lot of coal  and oil up more up north i guess uh i think its a bigger problem with the car pollution antipollution devices i think the   yes yeah   air isnt as bad as it once was from the cars because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area   yes well i know uh thats been the concern in Europe they hadnt uh we have friends in Germany and uh have family that live near the Black Forest area and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we switched uh switched to the unleaded gas and and had the emission control advice uh devices required on the cars uh thats something that Europe didnt do right away and now theyre doing that and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country thats the only pollution thats been there its not an area that is industry but they were losing a lot of uh trees and a lot of   from acid rain   um i guess from from something that the car was um was giving   i think it gives off uh in the emissions it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere uh and form a a weak acid   yes and   it just makes the rain fall on the acid side and after a period of time i think that accumulates in uh trees because they take it up through their roots as well as it landing on the leaves on surfaces like youve seen what its done to buildings even where its really bad   yes yeah   whats interesting several years ago i took a course uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was and there wasnt from various kinds of of energy and uh at that point in time one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain and it was kind of poohpoohed you know oh youre making a mountain out of a molehill kind of thing and its turned out that thats been very true what he was forecasting about the accumulation of of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage so its kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course now a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear uh im not afraid of nuclear having had that course because of how the nuclear that uh they use is not bomb quality and were so strict with all our controls in the United States the chances of of an accident are slight and it doesnt pollute the air at all its safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants its kind of funny because people are just petrified at least some are at the thought of nuclear   yes   so i dont know in Europe theres a lot of dependency on nuclear power and they recycle the fuel and then instead of of some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because theyre afraid it could become uh bomb quality but thats the only sensible thing to do is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as im concerned where it could eventually perhaps theres some problem uh pollute the groundwater so i dont know what the answer is the best answer of course would be solar or uh  fusion or something clean  well weve got a problem on the line dont we   yes yeah i i get that sometimes um my line gets some static i dont know why   uhhuh but uh solar of course would be the clean cleanest   well and i would think in our um we did have a solar water heater when we lived in Houston and uh oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal   i cant hear you at all for all this static   oh  i dont know what to  usually its the other phone i have trouble with it must just be on the line can you hear me   now i can again   okay i dont know what uh i i dont know what the problem is but uh when we lived in Houston we had a solar water heater and we had thought this part of the country would be ideal for solar homes and solar energy and we have enough clouds that uh   uhhuh   there are other areas that would be better suited that surprised me because i think we have a tremendous amount of um sunny days and and it yes it can be used and it can help but uh that was a problem that they were still   uhhuh   working on but   oh yeah it its still got a long way to go   what   its just you know a possible solution in the future i think maybe to help in some ways it may not in all ways maybe theyll come up with fusion   yes   you know control be able to control it i dont know how long thatll take but   one of these days because thats perfectly clean   yes   its just we cant control it right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out so it isnt not at all and you cant control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field so thats not going to work at least not now but uh who knows what the future will hold uh as far as energy goes i i think with solving some of the energy future energy problems well probably solve some of the pollution problems as well   uh i hope so   i do to i like to be optimistic i dont like to be pessimistic about these things     well i do think um i mean youve already mentioned several things i think uh just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware theres a problem and more people are interested in uh   we have one earth to live on and we got to take care of it   yes yes well and and for the future generations too uh   uhhuh ive noticed students are are much more you know young young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment and protecting the earth   yes   and so if we can raise it uh you know generations with those concerns well solve a lot of our problems im afraid i know i was part of the me generation where they didnt so many of them didnt people didnt care you know its whatever you know recycle well if its a problem forget that uh not throw the trash out the car window and leave it in the car and then throw it away   yeah   how horrible  you know now ive always done those kinds of things because i just didnt like messes uh and create     yeah
