              okay   okay um what do you think about the war recently   the war you mean in terms of the economy or   uhhuh uh       the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything   oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes is that is that what youre kind of directing it oh okay okay well  um   yeah yeah thats the first thing i thought of i dont know   well i think its caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didnt agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that   right right right and   you know and support the soldiers so   i know that uh ive heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two you couldnt become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam   yeah   that was totally different you know you couldnt be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably   yeah yeah   and now if youve served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate   yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something   exactly exactly exactly   yeah it im sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income   oh torn apart oh yeah   just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and   umhum right   i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds   so it thats also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did   yeah yeah i think the biggest change that weve seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasnt gotten a raise in two years and you know   oh okay umhum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes   yeah   um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do   even dog licenses i mean yeah   is higher you know   yeah   and they just raised the minimum wage today but thats not like you know   going to effect too many   as much as they should have raised it im sure   yeah yeah   but uh   so thats the hardest thing for us and um weve been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and im trying to stay home as long as i can   uhhuh right   but you know every week it gets harder because i could go out and be making money   right right   you know so thats a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family   uhhuh yeah i dont i dont have any children or anything right now im uh i work as a news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but   oh i see   uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so   uhhuh yeah yeah well it   it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me       you know whats going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something   yeah you have an inside track or something   yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything so that was pretty interesting   yeah yeah lets see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women ive seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson   yeah exactly be everything be supermom exactly     yeah because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home   uhhuh right and   you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work   where as it would have been exactly um   so thats kind of a difference for us i think theres more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family   right the roles are changing a lot   so hes yeah hes gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up   uhhuh right   so its now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and   and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies   yeah thats true mister mom and   and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now   uhhuh yeah yeah   you know since the womens movement in the well seventies and you know weve come a long way but i think its still a still  good ways to go   thats true yeah yeah i think theres still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think theres a lot of um   so uhhuh   kind of myths that weve come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and   right   you know i think theres so much prejudice still there and its kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now   yeah exactly exactly   you know i think theres still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh were in the nineties were beyond all that you know   its just not as exactly but its i mean like i say weve come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still   yeah yeah   and i dont think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people   yeah   you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunkydory to you   but theres so many more people that are homeless and yeah   but theres so many more people exactly that you dont even and that you dont even see or know about   yeah its real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because when when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all   oh oh yeah   first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now were kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   i mean i dont even know anybody that you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know   yeah i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because im Black and so you know i lived thats where i lived   oh boy yeah yeah   and so now i i feel lucky actually because ive almost lived around everyone ive i went to UT to college and so they you know they have     oh     a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people dont get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they dont get to see   yeah yeah yeah and that they they think the whole world is like that   exactly and that   we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international coed you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students theyre graduate students from all over the world   uhhuh uhhuh   and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different   exactly it is   cultures and different backgrounds we got invited to one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm  if he was from Iran or some place i dont know where but um you know   oh my gosh well theres so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so thats great my sister was telling me   yeah yeah   she met a girl shes going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think   oh uhhuh   Barbados or Jamaica or something like that   oh   and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and   yeah yeah   you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness   oh gosh yeah yeah   you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that   yeah really that is part of the change i think that ive seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now   but   kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean   oh yeah uhhuh   people have you know think theyre kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys   they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just   oh yeah its just   yeah thats ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school     oh gosh   you know and i couldnt and i just couldnt believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car yeah   yeah me too in Chicago we didnt i didnt even date a guy that had a car until i was in college   exactly and if you had a car  there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know its just you just didnt have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldnt understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car   yeah yeah yeah oh gosh my kids are going to be hating me  i guess ill give them a bike and say heres it till you can afford to pay the insurance you know   so that was yeah yeah right really or live really close to school and have them walk     yeah no kidding   but uh yeah a lot of changes   yeah   so   well did we cover it everything   i think so   okay  i guess ill get back to my laundry   okay well its good its good talking to you okay byebye     you too good luck byebye
