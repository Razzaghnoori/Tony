 okay okay um what do you think about the war recently the war you mean in terms of the economy or uh huh uh the economy the our soldiers going over uh just everything oh i thought we were going to talk about social changes is that is that what you re kind of directing it oh okay okay well um yeah yeah that s the first thing i thought of i don t know well i think it s caused a lot of you know big difference between when people had gone to war before like compared to Vietnam because i mean i know that there was so much more support for the soldiers going over and even people that didn t agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that right right right and you know and support the soldiers so i know that uh i ve heard people say that you know when people that went to World War Two you couldn t become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war but then in Vietnam yeah that was totally different you know you couldn t be a political figure if you were in Vietnam probably yeah yeah and now if you ve served in Desert Storm you probably would be a a good candidate yeah it would be like a bonus for your image or something exactly exactly exactly yeah it i m sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income oh torn apart oh yeah just drastically altered we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they have a just had a new baby and uh they would have she would have had to go back to work and um hum right i think she said their income would have dropped by like two thirds so it that s also a good reason why it it or good that it ended as soon as it did yeah yeah i think the biggest change that we ve seen um in in my life or whatever lately is the economy and things are so tight and like my husband hasn t gotten a raise in two years and you know oh okay um hum exactly and it seems like everything is raising every everything that can be cigarette not that i smoke but cigarettes yeah um uh stamps i mean it seems like ever exactly everything single thing that we do even dog licenses i mean yeah is higher you know yeah and they just raised the minimum wage today but that s not like you know going to effect too many as much as they should have raised it i m sure yeah yeah but uh so that s the hardest thing for us and um we ve been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of meaning home we have a three year old and a two year old and i m trying to stay home as long as i can uh huh right but you know every week it gets harder because i could go out and be making money right right you know so that s a big uh stress i think you know for the social changes in our family uh huh yeah i don t i don t have any children or anything right now i m uh i work as a news reporter in Waco and so i get to see i got to see a lot of not firsthand but oh i see uh probably a good part of the war um as far as what people thought about it and a lot of things like that so uh huh yeah yeah well it it was kind of amazing people were coming to me to ask me you know what s going on you know like i knew or like i sat in on the meetings or something yeah you have an inside track or something yeah yeah so i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about you know changes in in the war and everything so that was pretty interesting yeah yeah let s see what other social changes in the past ten years oh i guess between men and women i ve seen a lot of changes in terms of women feeling like they have to have a career be mom be everything superperson yeah exactly be everything be supermom exactly yeah because i know you know i i really get pressure from because i have a career also and i get a lot of pressure from people that you know my colleagues that why am i staying home uh huh right and you know whereas before that never would have happened people would have said why are you going to work where as it would have been exactly um so that s kind of a difference for us i think there s more pressure to um not necessarily a negative thing but on my husband to be more involved with the family right the roles are changing a lot so he s yeah he s gotten a lot uh you know you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all but in terms of his amount of hours at work nothing on that has lightened up uh huh right so it s now he has the pressure too of being super dad and super career and and even you know i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of kind of play a good part in our changes because you see that they have The Three Men and a Baby type movies yeah that s true mister mom and and i think you know to yeah and then you have the women uh detectives now and you know different roles just in what we see and so we probably want to do that even more now uh huh yeah yeah you know since the women s movement in the well seventies and you know we ve come a long way but i think it s still a still good ways to go that s true yeah yeah i think there s still i i know that um i grew up in Chicago in the sixties and was part my family was real liberal and i think there s a lot of um so uh huh kind of myths that we ve come a long way just in terms of our society and race relations and things like that and right you know i think there s so much prejudice still there and it s kind of more covert now people used to be more clear and say you know well i believe in this or i believe in that and now yeah exactly exactly you know i think there s still tremendous amount of prejudice but people think oh we re in the nineties we re beyond all that you know it s just not as exactly but it s i mean like i say we ve come a long way but we have i mean twice as far to go still yeah yeah and i don t think a lot of people you know realize a lot the plight of a lot of people yeah you know and you may be in good standing and everything may look hunky dory to you but there s so many more people that are homeless and yeah but there s so many more people exactly that you don t even and that you don t even see or know about yeah it s real easy to get isolated in your own little community you know because when when i was growing up in Chicago um we were in a real ethnic neighborhood and there were people from all oh oh yeah first generation Chinese German you know all different nationalities and everything and now we re kind of like in Lewisville Miss White Little suburbia you know uh huh uh huh yeah i mean i don t even know anybody that you know from any place other than Texas hardly you know yeah i grew up in in Brooklyn New York and so i was just i was just surrounded you know by black people because i m Black and so you know i lived that s where i lived oh boy yeah yeah and so now i i feel lucky actually because i ve almost lived around everyone i ve i went to UT to college and so they you know they have oh a lot of different people go there different kinds of people and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don t get to see you know some people have lived in Lewisville all their life you know and so they don t get to see yeah yeah yeah and that they they think the whole world is like that exactly and that we lived in a dorm my husband and i met in graduate school at Indiana University and i was ours was uh international coed you know coed dorm and there were twelve hundred students they re graduate students from all over the world uh huh uh huh and once we came here it was like gosh i just miss that because it really is exciting to be around people of different exactly it is cultures and different backgrounds we got invited to one guy practically roasted a goat in his in his dorm if he was from Iran or some place i don t know where but um you know oh my gosh well there s so many people who have never you know even gotten to do that so that s great my sister was telling me yeah yeah she met a girl she s going to the University of Pennsylvania in in Philadelphia and uh she just met a girl from um i think oh uh huh Barbados or Jamaica or something like that oh and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time and everything and she got some kind of money from her government like five hundred dollars so my sister had to take her shopping and yeah yeah you know show her what to wear show her how to match up colors and i just thought that was so very exciting you know to go and and just witness oh gosh yeah yeah you know this girl just coming to America type thing you know so you know i would have loved it the opportunity to do that yeah really that is part of the change i think that i ve seen probably you know in the past twenty years or whatever is now but kids have to have so much i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids even though i buy most of the things at garage sales for their Christmas i mean oh yeah uh huh people have you know think they re kids have to have five hundred dollars worth of toys they think they have to have everything they have to have the latest cereal about you know just oh yeah it s just yeah that s ridiculous too when i first moved here i was only thirteen but everyone had a car in school oh gosh you know and i couldn t and i just couldn t believe you know i was from New York and so you know we rode the bus and if you had a car yeah yeah me too in Chicago we didn t i didn t even date a guy that had a car until i was in college exactly and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway or you know it s just you just didn t have a car but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools and i couldn t understand it you know all the kids had cars and they you know have to have a car yeah yeah yeah oh gosh my kids are going to be hating me i guess i ll give them a bike and say here s it till you can afford to pay the insurance you know so that was yeah yeah right really or live really close to school and have them walk yeah no kidding but uh yeah a lot of changes yeah so well did we cover it everything i think so okay i guess i ll get back to my laundry okay well it s good it s good talking to you okay bye bye you too good luck bye bye
