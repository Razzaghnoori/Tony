 Pennsylvania Bio By Gerald Stern posted Wednesday Nov 4 1998 To hear the poet read Pennsylvania Bio click I wore a black knit hatso I could be undistinguished in the warand carried a small bagso I could be mistaken for a doctor and once in a whorehouse while waiting for a friend of mine to finishI examined the madam on the kitchen table and I spent Sunday at either the Serbian Club or the post war Literary Club on Atwood Street above the pre war clothing store and ate hot sausage sandwiches and cold buttermilk across the street from the first Carnegie Library and made plans for the next seventy years I drove Andy Warhol to the East Liberty train station in my father s 1949 Ford Believe it or not I bought a 1949 Buick thirteen years later for fifteen dollars and drove it into a junkyard six years after My first instrument was a kind of kazoo and that led naturally to a French trombone I was loyal to my own music for fifty years though I detested snare drums and tap dancing just as I do those singers now who hold their left fists in the air while holding the microphone inside their mouths And I hate short sleeved shirts when they wear them with dark neckties skinny swine knocking on closed doors and I had a habit of counting bricks a nice obsession compared with washing hands or touching car doors it gave mefreedom with walls so I could handle bulging and sagging when I had to and one of the summers I read Steinbeck and made love in the bedroom to my aunt s cleaning woman in upstate Pennsylvania and learned to adore the small town with its rows of stores and trees on the sidewalk and only a short walk into the country in this case up a steep hill the dogs more sullen the farther up you went and Russian and Roman churches below the sunlight on the river the bridge empty the outer one half hidden I was shocked by the sudden distance and I had a Brown s Beach jacket with a reddish thorn in one of the pockets which was my toothpick for thirty five years and a vest to match and a flattened acorn I kept in the darkness and I had a pencil I used to keep my balance the edges were eaten the lead was grey the green eraser was worn down to the metal and I had a spiral notebook I kept for emotions and I folded my money
