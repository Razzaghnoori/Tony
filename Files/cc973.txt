 Introduction There is growing interest in intensive care medicine in scoring systems for measuring the severity of illness and predicting outcome in critically ill patients Since 1974 the GCS 1 has been routinely applied in intensive care units and emergency prehospital settings The GCS provides a good basis for assessing the depth of consciousness and coma This scale together with other neurological assessments 2 3 4 5 should be administered as soon as possible in emergency situations and may be repeated at intervals especially when neurological function is fluctuating 6 The GCS was developed as a means for grading patients with traumatic brain injury and for predicting their chances of neurological recovery Clinicians now use GCS as the only neurological predictor in many prognostic systems such as APACHE APACHE II APACHE III Acute Physiology Score APS and Simplified Acure Physiology Score SAPS 4 7 8 9 10 11 The MEES is a descriptive scoring system that includes the GCS assessment 12 In theory the prognostic APACHE II and the descriptive MEES scoring systems are more relevant to prediction of outcome in critically ill patients because the GCS assessment is included in these systems On the basis of other parameters arterial pressure heart rate respiratory rate oxygenation chronic health points age points the MEES descriptive and APACHE II prognostic systems should be better than the GCS at predicting outcomes The purpose of the present study was to assess the value of scoring systems in predicting outcome in nontraumatic coma patients and to evaluate the importance of mental status measurement in relation to outcome Patients and methods This prospective study was undertaken over a 2 year period and included 286 consecutive patients hospitalized for nontraumatic coma The inclusion criteria were GCS 9 and specific medical diagnoses as follows hypoxic or ischaemic injury focal cerebral injury general cerebral injury metabolic or septic encephalopathy and drug induced coma or toxic injury including drug overdose and coma persisting 24 h after discontinuation of toxic substances In the prehospital setting postintervention values before admission of the patient to hospital for the MEES and GCS scales were measured in each patient Table 1 The APACHE II score was recorded on the day of admission to hospital 7 The sensitivity specificity and predictive power of each cutoff point were calculated from the two by two table in SPSS for Windows MIcrosoft Washington USA for APACHE II MEES and GCS 14 The Youden index was also used to determine the best cutoff points the higher the index the better the prediction at the cutoff point 15 Percentages of correct predictions of mortality were obtained at these same cutoff points For each score ROC curves were obtained 16 17 The ROC curve depicts the relation between true positive results number of predicted deaths among those who actually died and false positive results number of predicted deaths among those who actually survived for each score The greater the area under ROC curve the better the scoring system The ROC curve was calculated using the Systat software Systat Inc Evanstan IL USA The outcome predictions data were analyzed using McNemar s test The compara sions of the areas under the ROC curves and the analyses of the differences of Youden index were performed using the method described by Hanley and McNeil 16 17 P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Values are expressed as mean standard error Results Of the 286 patients included in the present study 80 died in hospital The patients who died were older than those who survived 66 8 11 1 years versus 46 1 15 4 years P 0 05 and a higher proportion were males 61 The scores for all three scales were better in survivors than in those who died APACHE II 29 8 5 3 versus 20 8 2 8 P 0 05 MEES 16 2 2 5 versus 20 1 2 7 P 0 05 GCS 6 2 2 1 versus 8 1 1 2 P 0 05 The distributions of APACHE II MEES and GCS scores are given in Fig 1 Hypoxic or ischaemic injury was the cause of coma in 62 21 7 metabolic or septic coma occurred in 45 15 7 focal cerebral lesions occurred in 56 19 6 generalized cerebral lesions occurred in 22 7 7 and drug induced or toxic coma occurred in 101 35 3 Mortality data are given in Table 2 Table 3provides data for sensitivity specificity and correct predictions of outcome at the cutoff points that gave the best Youden index The three scores were also compared by drawing ROC curves in order to avoid fixing arbitrary cutoff points Fig 2 There were no statistically significant differences in the correct prediction of outcome Youden index or area under the ROC curve among APACHE II MEES and GCS for hospital mortality Discussion Subjective evaluations of clinical status by individual clinicians may differ in terminology and even in measurement of the severity of illness Hence various descriptive and prognostic evaluation scales scoring systems have been developed during the past three decades Objective evaluation of clinical status would facilitate comparison of methods staff clinical centres and studies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 13 14 The need for such evaluation scales is particularly evident in coma patients and even more so in patients with alterations in consciousness The aim of research in this area is to obtain a reliable and sensitive scale In 1974 such research resulted in the GCS 1 6 Since this scale was reported numerous studies have examined its value in assessing clinical status and prognosis Initially the scale was used in patients with head injury 6 but later it became widely used in evaluating central nervous system lesions and state of consciousness With the development of emergency medicine a need arose for evaluation scales that would provide rapid triage and objective status assessment On the other hand a prehospital evaluation scale would be optimal if apart from being descriptive it had a prognostic component and would therefore be applicable to hospital based observation of the patient Among the various scales MEES has attracted attention because of its applicability in trauma and illness 12 Cho and Wang 14 concluded that for head injured patients the GCS has good predictive value for hospital mortality in comparison with other evaluation scales The latter scale has also attracted attention because of its simplicity In view of the experience with these scales in traumatic coma we conducted a comparative study in nontraumatic coma The need for accurate prediction of mortality in non traumatic coma by GCS was identified by Plum and Levy in 1978 18 In their comparison of GCS with other neurological tests Levy et al 19 demonstrated that the GCS has good predictive value A number of studies 13 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 have emphasized the importance of aetiology which together with GCS represents a good combination for better prediction of mortality In our work we have also observed the prognostic value of individual elements of the electrocardiogram in coma following cerebrovascu lar accident and organophosphate poisoning Romera 27 demonstrated that GCS score correlates with APACHE II score in patients who have suffered a cerebrovascular accident also the former is simpler and has fewer parameters It was concluded that GCS was because of its simplicity and rapidity a better scale than the Simplified Acute Physiology Score for prediction of mortality in patients with cerebroventricular accident Kriger et al 28 identified a correlation between intracranial pressure analyses of evoked potentials and GCS score regardless of aetiology of coma Those investigators also concluded that GCS is a good prognostication tool as compared with other more complicated methods In the present study coma patients were grouped on the basis of aetiology according to the method of Sacco et al 13 No statistically significant differences in accuracy of prognosis prediction were identified for the three scales assessed For prehospital work this finding is important because it shows that GCS does not deviate significantly either from the MEES scale which has more parameters or from the APACHE II scale which is measured in hospital GCS has important advantages over other scales because it enables rapid evaluation of status and may direct necessary interventions Furthermore it is possible to observe continuously the state of consciousness and to identify eventual improvement indicating efficacy of therapy or deterioration GCS is widespread and clinicians are familiar with it This scale therefore facilitates good clinical communication between prehospital work and further hospital procedures and treatments The GCS values determined before hospitalization of the patients and the APACHE II scores determined on the first day of hospitalization enabled us to compare descriptive and prognostic scales directly We compared the prognostic value of postintervention prehospital values of GCS and hospital values of APACHE II We found that the prehospital GCS assessment was as good a predictor of mortality as was the APACHE II score as measured in the hospital The GCS is well established and its simple application before admission to hospital and during hospital treatment facilitates continuous evaluation of the patient s state and allows prognostic evaluation in non traumatic coma
