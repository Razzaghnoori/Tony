               well do you do any recycling   um we do here um see what do we recycle we they recycle they have bins   yeah   and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and um plastic bottles and i think thats all they have   oh   what about you guys   well we uh theres a lot of things that you can recycle down here although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously  is uh aluminum cans   uhhuh   but uh weve got a weve got a couple of different things uh places uh theyre like unattended aluminum can smashers  and you can go up there and and uh redeem weve got one that gives you like a penny a can   really for smashed cans   so if you yeah  well actually you have to give put them in there unsmashed   uhhuh   and uh when you do that it it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot   oh can you can you hold on for just a minute im gonna try pressing one again to make sure that i pressed it hard enough because okay just a second   sure okay       okay   oh okay well i guess   well i heard it that i heard it that time   i guess yeah okay well anyways you guys only get a penny a can well when you buy like um canned drinks and stuff like that do they charge you for the deposit   uh no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that   yeah exactly and so its like they charge you for the deposit so when you turn in the cans unsmashed youre just like reimbursed   oh okay okay no they dont charge us that extra nickel   type of thing thats sort of nice though   yeah it it really is really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the off the price if you wanna think of it that way so when we get like uh um a twelve pack then thats like twelve cents back   uhhuh yeah so you guys can actually get ahead   yeah   but uh they have sort of like uh things that you can youre not like reimbursed for or paid for like we can recycle uh clear glass brown glass green glass   yeah   um and milk jugs and um newspapers you know everyone does newspapers   yeah yeah everybody does newspapers   but that that kind of stuff   yeah   but they they said they cant be smashed or else um it doesnt fit in their little containers and theyre not reimbursed by the the people who are over them or something   well shoot maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed uh Pepsi cans and whatever up there   yeah exactly yeah send it to this address no  but um  lets see they said that how ways we can encourage recycling um   i i i tell you what what really works uh at least down here is if there is if there is some even even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it you know what i mean then people tend to do it uh   yeah thats   in other words uh taking care of the environment is is all well and good   umhum   but if its gonna cost you to take care of the environment theyre not quite as uh likely to do it as if uh as if you get something back for it   as likely to do it yeah   you know and uh so you know if there are some energy savings or if theres some significant savings anything that they can pass on to the consumer   yeah thats true   you know it kind of reminds me of using an ATM card you know to get money or doing your banking you know if its free people will use it if it costs them something then theyre not as likely to use it   uhhuh yeah yeah exactly   you know but uh i know we had a problem down here with uh oil people taking oil out of their cars   uhhuh   and just putting it down the drain you know the sewer the drain sewer   yeah   and uh all that because there was apparently a lot of people you know every time they change the oil they just dump all the rest their old oil down there now theyre starting to recycle that stuff   uhhuh oh thats good um another thing i thought of i guess to recycle would be like clothes because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other and  one way that we do it sort of in in Iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops   yeah   and that way you know you dont get near enough as as much as you bought it for but you you got the use out of it and what youre gonna basically donate to to a Goodwill or whatever anyways you can get a little bit of money for   yeah yeah   and so thats something that ive never i were were new to Iowa and so  thats something that i hadnt you know looked into before but thats one way to sort of get money and still recycle i guess   yeah i know the a lot of places they um uh
