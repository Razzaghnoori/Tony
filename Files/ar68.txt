 Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic debilitating autoimmune disease of unknown etiology Although the disease is characterized by synovitis of the joints tendon sheaths and bursae manifestations that do not involve the synovium are not infrequent 1 These articular and systemic manifestations appear to be mediated by immunologic processes 2 The hallmarks of the synovial abnormalities in rheumatoid arthritis are synovial lining cell proliferation neoangiogenesis and inflammatory cell infiltration involving the myeloid macrophage and lymphoid lineages 1 2 There has been considerable controversy regarding the relative importance of the types of cells and their products involved in the inflammatory processes of rheumatoid arthritis 3 Nevertheless it seems likely that all of these cell types participate to some degree in disease pathogenesis Evidence in support of T cell involvement in rheumatoid arthritis involves the description of restricted subsets of T cells in the blood and synovial tissue that either express or lack certain surface membrane proteins or that express a limited set of antigen receptors For example clonal amplifications of CD8 CD57 T cells are frequently found in the T cell repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients 4 Furthermore expanded clones of CD4 CD28 T cells exist in the blood and synovial compartments of such patients 5 and these T cells appear to be autoreactive 6 Finally the T cell receptors for antigen expressed by these and other T cell subsets frequently display a bias in favor of receptors utilizing certain V genes 5 7 8 9 10 11 12 In contrast to the extensive studies of the clonal distribution of T cells in rheumatoid arthritis much less is known about the level of B cell diversity in this disease Previous studies however are consistent with the interpretation that the B cell repertoire is also restricted For example flow cytometric analyses of circulating B cells 13 suggested that oligoclonality exists and cell culture experiments 14 15 16 17 demonstrated that synovial tissue explants spontaneously secrete immunoglobulins of restricted heterogeneity as defined by immunoglobulin Ig G subclass isoelectric focusing and idiotype expression More recent molecular analyses of the immunoglobulin genes expressed by B cells in the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients support these notions 18 19 20 21 22 These findings are important because they suggest that at the B and T cell levels an ongoing immune reaction is occurring that is directed at restricted sets of auto antigens The present study was designed to analyze further the level of clonal diversity in rheumatoid arthritis B cells by using the length of the third complementarity determining region CDR3 of the rearranged heavy H chain variable region V gene as a marker herein referred to as HCDR3 A modification of the immunoglobulin V H gene fingerprinting method 23 that has been used to analyze the diversity of B cells and T cells in several clinical settings 4 24 25 26 was used to address this issue The present data suggest that B cell clonal expansion is a common and characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis that it involves both resting and activated cells and that it can persist over extended periods of time These findings support the idea that a chronic auto immune reaction is operative in rheumatoid arthritis Materials and methods Patients and patient samples Heparinized venous blood synovial fluid and synovial tissue were obtained from patients who fulfilled the American

Applied Biosystems Foster City CA USA Results and discussion Identification of B cell clonal expansions using a modified immunoglobulin V Hgene fingerprinting assay During normal B cell development the processes of gene segment recombination and coding end processing yield nucleotide HCDR3 lengths that are characteristic and virtually invariant for an individual B cell clone Therefore these lengths can be used as signatures to identify members of a B cell clone The immunoglobulin V H gene fingerprinting approach 23 takes advantage of the wide range of HCDR3 lengths that can occur in human B cells approximately 5 35 amino acids to provide an estimate of clonal diversity in polyclonal populations When polyclonal B lymphocytes from adults are analyzed using this assay they display a Gaussian HCDR3 length distribution around a mean of approximately 15 amino acids The presence of an individual dominant length that differs from this Gaussian distribution can be used as an indication of a specific B cell clonal expansion Figure 1illustrates schematically the two stage immunoglobulin V H gene fingerprinting approach that we utilized Note that when cDNA prepared from normal peripheral blood B cells is used as a template for these V H family specific and C H specific assays ladders of HCDR3 lengths that differ by three nucleotides are identified These individual HCDR3 lengths are signatures of the various individual B cell clones contained within the polyclonal population The intensities of the bands in virtually all of the ladders illustrated in Figure 1are relatively uniformly distributed around the mean This indicates that there are no dominant HCDR3 lengths that skew the Gaussian distribution and therefore that there are no significant clonal expansions among the B cells that express most of these V H C H combinations Similar results are obtained using the genomic DNA based assay although these results cannot be interpreted in a C H specific manner data not shown In the V H 6 IgG combination Fig 1 however a non Gaussian distribution is noted even in this normal individual This could be a reflection of the numbers of V H genes present in the V H family being analyzed it is more likely to see a non Gaussian distribution in families with small numbers of individual genes or of the state of activation of a specific clone because activated B cells contain much higher levels of V gene messenger RNA than resting B cells We believe that in the instance illustrated in Figure 1the latter possibility is more likely because the small V H 2 and V H 5 families only two gene members per family do not exhibit the same degree of oligoclonality as that observed with the only somewhat smaller V H 6 family one gene member Distinction between clonal expansion and clonal activation using the modified immunoglobulin V Hgene fingerprinting assay Because B cell activation and differentiation result in dramatic increases in immunoglobulin V gene messenger RNA these fingerprinting assays cannot readily distinguish between clonal expansion and activation when cDNA is used as a starting template Because DNA levels are not appreciably altered by cellular activation however the use of genomic DNA as well as cDNA from the same sample of B cells helps to distinguish these two processes Thus in the setting of specific B cell clonal expansion without concomitant cellular activation the DNA based fingerprinting assay will indicate a dominant HCDR3 length whereas the cDNA based assay may not data not shown Conversely in the setting of specific B cell clonal activation without concomitant clonal expansion the cDNA based assay will indicate a dominant HCDR3 length whereas the DNA based assay may not Finally in the setting of specific B cell clonal activation with concomitant clonal expansion both the cDNA and the DNA based assays will indicate a dominant HCDR3 length These distinctions were very reproducible in the following studies There were no situations in which evidence for cellular activation either selective or accompanied by clonal expansion was present in one set of analyses and not in a subsequent set using the same starting materials B cells in the blood synovial fluid and synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients exhibit clonal expansions of activated and resting B cells We analyzed the peripheral blood synovial fluid and synovial tissue B cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients n 20 10 and 5 respectively using the genomic DNA and cDNA based fingerprinting assays to develop an understanding of the diversity of the B cells in these compartments Figures 2and 3are illustrations of representative patients for whom concomitant blood and synovial fluid or blood and synovial tissue samples were available In order to simplify the Figures only the results for two large V H families V H 1 and V H 3 and two small V H families V H 5 and V H 6 are provided although assays for each V H family and each major CH family and were performed and revealed similar findings The genomic DNA based assays in both patients indicated that clonal expansions are common in the blood of rheumatoid arthritis patients This type of result was obtained with all individuals tested It was most convincingly demonstrated by the results in Figure 3obtained from B cells expressing genes of the V H 1 and V H 3 families Because these V H families contain the largest numbers of V H genes they would be more likely to display a polyclonal pattern An even more striking level of B cell clonal dominance and expansion was seen when the genomic DNA based assay was used to analyze B cells from the synovial fluid or synovial tissue Figs 2and 3 In these analyses virtually all V H families demonstrated extensive B cell oligoclonality It should be pointed out that when an individual HCDR3 length comprises more than 50 of the radioactive counts of a V H C H ladder clonality based on DNA sequencing is very likely when an individual length comprises more than 70 of the radioactivity clonality is virtually assured data not shown Collectively these data indicate that the B cell repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients is skewed away from the typical apparently random representation of normal individuals The reason for this discrepancy is not clear although one possibility is that restricted antigenic exposure alters the composition of the repertoire in favor of B cells reactive with the putative antigen s If this is so the progressive narrowing of the repertoire from the blood to the synovial tissue is consistent with the ideas that the antigenic exposures are originating at these sites and that the synovial compartment is supporting clonal amplification Because these are true clonal expansions ie increased numbers of B cells per specific clone it is likely that the antigenic exposures are chronic and therefore are increasing the numbers of memory B cells reactive with these determinants In order to confirm that these clonally expanded B cells were receiving ongoing antigenic stimulation and not limited solely to the memory compartment we employed the cDNA based assay to distinguish clonal expansions of activated B cells from resting memory cells As illustrated in Figure 2 activated B cell clones identified by the letter A in Fig 2 expressing each of the immunoglobulin heavy chain isotypes were easily identified in all the V H families studied In some instances these activated clones were also expanded numerically as defined by the genomic DNA based assays and identified by the letter E in Fig 2 In other cases these activated clones did not appear to be numerically expanded Similar examples can be found in Figures 3and 4 but they are not identified by letters in order to simplify the Figures Thus it appears that many discrete B cell clones exist in the synovial compartment of rheumatoid arthritis patients and that these are increased in number consistent with a response to a restricted antigenic challenge s Furthermore these B cell clones appear to be of both the resting memory and the activated types suggesting that these antigenic challenges are chronic and ongoing Thus these data support and extend previous findings 18 19 20 21 22 by indicating that specific B cell clonal amplifications can occur both in previously stimulated B cells and in currently activated B cells The presence of activated B cells that are not increased in number is consistent either with recent in situ synovium specific stimulation of these B cell clones or with the influx of activated B cells that were stimulated by antigens outside of and not necessarily relevant to the synovial compartment B cell clonal expansions in the blood and synovial compartments can be restricted to one or another compartment or be common to the two Because the preceding data indicated that the B cell repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients contains expanded clones of B cells that can be resting or activated we investigated whether the same clones could be identified in both the blood and synovial compartments Figures 2and 3illustrate data that suggest that there are expanded clones that are blood restricted joint restricted or are common to both compartments Examples of blood restricted clones are highlighted on Figures 2and 3with the symbol those that are joint restricted with the symbol and those that are common to the two compartments with the symbol These findings suggest that there may be a degree of cellular trafficking between the blood and the synovial tissues In order to address this issue we studied the B cells of the blood and two synovial sites right and left hip that were obtained from the same patient within 3 h of each other Fig 4 In this patient the DNA based assay provided examples of clonal expansions that were present in only one joint eg the V H 3 J H and V H 5 J H combinations in Figure 4 and the companion cDNA based assays indicated that in some instances these expansions were either activated or resting In only rare instances however did the data suggest that a similar clone was present in two different synovial tissues DNA sequence analyses confirmed the rarity of this event data not shown Thus it appears that in most instances the clonal amplifications occur in situ and are not the result of trafficking from one anatomic site to another If so this would suggest that the antigenic challenges driving these clonal expansions may not be common to all synovial tissues but may be generated independently at each site possibly by ongoing tissue breakdown Clonal persistence in the synovial fluid compartment If the clonal expansions identified in the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients are due to an ongoing response to antigen then one would predict that at least some of the clones would persist over time To test this we studied the synovial fluid B cells from the same joints of three patients on two occasions spanning several months Most of the clonal expansions detected on the initial samples were not present in the subsequent samples In a few instances however B cell clonal persistence was found Figure 5illustrates the best example of this phenomenon in a patient who was studied over a 4 month interval The DNA based assay using V H 4 family specific primers indicated the presence of two similar clones on days 0 and 120 whereas the other V H 4 expressing clones detected at the first analysis were no longer present at the time of the second analysis DNA sequence analyses of one of these two clones confirmed their identity because each displayed the same rearranged V H DJ H gene with identical V H mutations and identical HCDR3 sequences data not shown Therefore certain clones can persist locally over time suggesting that a common and persistent antigenic stimulation was operable in the joint of this rheumatoid arthritis patient The lack of persistence of the other B cell clones suggests two possibilities First the initial set of B cell clones might have been replaced by others that recognized and responded to different antigenic epitopes on the same original immunogenic protein This type of clonal evolution to the recognition of different epitopes on the same immunogenic moiety is common in experimental situations in which repetitive immunizations with a defined antigen are delivered 29 30 31 The other possibility is that the B cells that disappeared over time were not reactive with tissue antigens These could have been stimulated by irrelevant antigens in the periphery and therefore after entering the synovial compartment could not be restimulated and hence could not enter the memory pool and take up residence in the synovial tissue Conclusion The present data indicate that clonal expansion is a common occurrence in the B cell repertoire of rheumatoid arthritis patients These expansions involve both resting memory B cells and activated B cells some of which are derived from the memory B cell compartment Because the extent of these clonal expansions increases from the blood to the synovial compartment this progressive narrowing in diversity implies that antigens located in the synovia are responsible for these antigen receptor biases In support of this hypothesis are the observations that some of these clonal expansions are joint specific Because identical clones are rarely found in two different joints however these immune reactions are probably unique to each individual joint Furthermore because it is unlikely that each joint would harbor a different foreign antigen these B cells are most likely reacting with autoantigens generated locally possibly by local tissue breakdown Recent studies 20 32 have demonstrated that the synovial tissue of rheumatoid arthritis patients can develop lymphoid aggregates that have the cellular components of an ectopic germinal center and that can sustain B cell clonal expansion and diversification It is likely that the B cells that mature in these pseudogerminal centers and those that we have identified in the present studies are responding to specific auto antigens Therefore the identification of the antigenic reactivities of these B cells and in particular those B cells within the memory compartment that have presumably traversed the pseudogerminal centers and undergone auto antigen and T cell selection and rescue may provide important clues to the role of B lymphocytes and their immunoglobulin molecules in the immunopathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis
