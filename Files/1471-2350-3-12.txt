 Background Rett syndrome OMIM 312750 http www ncbi nlm nih gov Omim is an X linked dominant disorder that occurs with a prevalance of 1 in 10 000 to 15 000 births 1 and almost exclusively in females Named after Andreas Rett who first recognized the disorder in 1966 2 the syndrome is characterized by a constellation of clinical findings that have resulted in the establishment of clinical criteria for the diagnosis 3 Common clinical features include early normal development until approximately 6 18 months of age followed by a period of developmental stagnation and subsequent regression usually by 3 years of life Characteristic findings include loss of speech and motor skills deceleration of head growth stereotypic hand movements seizures respiratory abnormalities scoliosis and growth delay Although the disorder is usually sporadic due to new mutations a few familial cases permitted exclusion mapping on the X chromosome with assignment of the responsible gene to band Xq28 4 5 6 Mutations in MECP2 the gene that encodes the DNA binding protein MeCP2 methyl CpG binding protein 2 have been found in approximately 65 77 of Rett syndrome patients 7 8 9 10 The functional consequence of MECP2 mutations resulting in Rett syndrome is loss of function Three of the four MECP2 exons encode a 486 amino acid protein that is believed to be a transcriptional repressor based on in vitro studies MeCP2 s functional structure consists of an 84 amino acid methyl binding domain MBD 11 and a 104 amino acid transcriptional repression domain TRD 12 The MBD is able to bind to 5 methyl cytosine residues of a single CpG dinucleotide 11 Under the current model MeCP2 binds to DNA then complexes with Sin3A through the TRD and recruits histone deacetylases HDAC Deacetylation of core histones then alters chromatin structure and results in transcriptional repression 13 14 While MeCP2 is a ubiquitously expressed protein its expression is highest in the brain lung and spleen and less abundant in the kidney and heart 15 16 It s cellular localization is also specific with expression in neurons but not in glia Expression levels in brain increase postnatally 16 These findings explain why the most prominent clinical features of Rett syndrome are related to central nervous system CNS dysfunction The presence of growth retardation 17 osteopenia 18 and gastrointestinal abnormalities however suggest a potentially important role for MeCP2 s function in the peripheral and autonomous nervous system and in other tissues Alternatively while MeCP2 s expression is ubiquitous other methyl CpG binding proteins that exist within complexes MBD1 and MBD2 19 or Kaiso 20 may reduce the effect of mutations in MECP2 in peripheral organ systems while the lack of such redundancy may lead to a more pronounced phenotype in the brain This theory remains speculative however since the tissue specificity and definitive identification of functional redundancy of methyl CpG binding proteins have not been established Regardless the targets of MeCP2 modulation remain unknown in the brain or elsewhere To identify potential downstream targets of MeCP2 modulation we have compared global gene expression patterns in four matched pairs of clonally derived mutant or wild type MECP2 expressing fibroblast cell strains from girls with Rett syndrome and in five wild type and four mutant MeCP2 expressing lymphoblastoid cell lines by hybridizing Affymetrix U95 A E oligonucleotide microarrays The use of clonally derived fibroblasts eliminated the mosaic X inactivation seen in tissues from most females with Rett syndrome Furthermore expression patterns in clones with the mutant MECP2 allele active were compared with those in clones with the wild type allele on the active X chromosome Because both types of clones are derived from the same individual variability introduced by differences in autosomal genetic background is eliminated by our experimental strategy The use of lymphoblastoid cell lines while not all clonally derived expanded the scope of genes to be assayed beyond those expressed in skin fibroblasts Our interrogations identified a statistically significant number of genes with differential expression patterns between wild type and mutant cell strains however the results across multiple clones from the same individual showed substantial variability questioning the significance of some of the genes identified The lymphoblasts while not analysed in a matched comparison yielded a relatively short list of genes with differential expression that includes some potentially interesting candidate genes Methods Cell culture single cell cloning and nucleic acid extraction for fibroblasts Four fibroblast strains from females with clinically diagnosed Rett syndrome were obtained from Coriell Cell Repositories MECP2 mutations were identified in our laboratory as previously reported 10 GM07982 705delG GM11270 916C T R306C GM11272 1155del32 and GM11273 316C T R106W From each of the four cultures single cell derived clonal cell strains were established To do so fibroblasts were trypsinized 0 05 GibcoBRL Life Technologies and diluted to 100 cells ml By using a 125 m Stripper Tip MidAtlantic Diagnostics Marlton NJ under direct microscopic visualization individual cells were transferred to 96 well plates Cells were grown with filtered 0 2 m conditioned medium that was prepared by culturing the primary cell strain for two days during the exponential growth phase in MEM alpha Sigma St Louis MO with 15 fetal calf serum Gemini Woodland CA penicillin 100 U ml streptomycin 100 g ml and glutamine 290 ng ml GibcoBRL Life Technologies Upon confluency of the well the cells were trypsinized and expanded Growth rates and cellular morphology were closely monitored Only clonal cell strains in the exponential growth phase with similar cell and clonal morphology were selected for further study RNA was extracted using RNA STAT 60 Tel Test Inc Friendswood TX from eight 150 mm plates of exponentially growing sub confluent cells that were at similar passage numbers DNA was extracted from two additional 150 mm plates using a standard extraction protocol to determine X chromosome inactivation status and verify monoclonality Cell culture single cell cloning and nucleic acid extraction for lymphoblasts Clonal cell lines with the mutant MECP2 allele on the active X chromosome were derived from lymphoblastoid cell lines LCLs from four females with clinically diagnosed Rett syndrome and known mutations T158M 803delG R168X 10 and 1159del28 unpublished using the technique described above Individual cells were cultured in conditioned RPMI 1640 medium with 15 fetal calf serum penicillin 100 U ml streptomycin 100 U ml and glutamine 290 ng ml Four cell lines from females with known MECP2 mutations R106W R255X and two with 803delG but completely skewed X chromosome inactivation with the wild type MECP2 allele on the active X chromosome were also cultured In addition one clonal cell line with the wild type MECP2 allele on the active X chromosome was established using the cloning technique described above RNA was extracted using RNA STAT 60 Tel Test Inc Friendswood TX DNA was extracted using a standard extraction protocol to determine X chromosome inactivation status and verify monoclonality X chromosome inactivation studies Clonality was further confirmed and X chromosome inactivation status was determined by the length of the polymorphic CAG trinucleotide repeat on the inactive androgen receptor allele 21 22 Restriction digestion of four restriction sites between the flanking primers and adjacent to the trinucleotide repeat were carried out with the methylation sensitive enzymes HpaII and HhaI Amplification of the undigested allele that included the trinucleotide repeat region was performed using the fluorescent labeled primer 5 6FAM CTGTGAAGGTTGCTGTTCCTCAT 3 and the unlabeled primer 5 TCCAGAATCTGTTCCAGAGCGTGC 3 The lengths of the amplification products were identified using the ABI 377 sequencer with the GeneScan fragment analysis software Applied Biosystems Foster City CA Undigested DNA samples from each of the original cell cultures were amplified to determine the lengths of each allele Allele specific MECP2 transcript analysis Reverse transcription of 2 g of total RNA was performed after Dnase I digestion Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN with the Superscript II RNase H Reverse Transcriptase GibcoBRL Life Technologies protocol for cDNA synthesis using 500 ng of random hexamers Absence of DNA contamination was verified by amplification of the intron containing region of the MECP2 gene between exons 3 and 4 using exon 3 based primer 5 AGCCCGTGCAGCCATCAGCC 3 and exon 4 based primer 5 CTTCCCAGGACTTTTCTCCA 3 The regions containing the mutations were amplified by PCR using primers and conditions previously described 7 and later modified 23 PCR products were treated with 1 U exonuclease and 1 U shrimp alkaline phosphatase for 15 min at 37 C The enzymes were heat inactivated at 75 C for 15 minutes Both strands of the treated PCR product were sequenced with fluorescent labelled terminator nucleotides on the ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer Cell clones expressing only the mutant MECP2 allele are called mutant clones and cell clones or skewed cell lines expressing only the normal MCP2 allele are called wild type Immunoblot analysis with MeCP2 antibody MeCP2 protein expression in fibroblast clones and lymphoblastoid cell lines was determined by immunoblot analysis Cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with RIPA buffer 1 Triton X 100 1 NaDOC 0 1 SDS 158 mM NaCl 10 mM Tris pH 7 2 5 mM NaEDTA and 1 protease inhibitors added just before use Sigma St Louis MO The homogenate was sonicated followed by centrifugation at 4 C for 30 min The supernatant was saved for immunoblot Equal quantities of protein as determined by a protein assay BioRad Hercules CA were separated by electrophoresis in a 12 SDS polyacrylamide gel The gel was then equilibrated in transfer buffer for 15 min and transferred to a polyvinylidine difluoride membrane Novex San Diego CA also equilibrated in transfer buffer for 15 min for 1 hr at 100 V The membrane was blocked overnight with 5 non fat milk in PBS at 4 C and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody 1

Tween 20 and 350 mM NaCl The membrane was washed in the same solution and then incubated with a horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody 1 5000 in the same solution for 30 min The membrane was subsequently washed again and bound antibody was detected with an ECL kit Amersham Piscataway NY Affymetrix oligonucleotide array GeneChip hybridization Messenger RNA was purified from total RNA extract using theOligotex batch protocol Qiagen Valencia CA The SuperScript Choice System was used for ds cDNA synthesis GibcoBRL Life Technologies using the T7 dT 24 primer 5 GGCCAGTGAATTGTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGAGGCGG dT 24 3 and 3 g of mRNA for each reaction Biotin labeled in vitro transcription IVT was accomplished with the Enzo BioArray High Yield transcript labeling kit Affymetrix Santa Clara CA using 4 l of ds cDNA product IVT cleanup was performed using Rneasy Columns Qiagen Valencia CA The IVT product was chemically fragmented with 40 mM Tris acetate pH 8 1 125 mM KOAc and 30 mM MgOAc at 94 C for 35 minutes The fragmented product was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U95 Set A E Affymetrix Santa Clara CA Quality control parameters were assessed throughout the experimental process to assure the quality of the starting RNA the efficiency of transcription integrity of hybridization and consistency of qualitative calls Assessment during the synthesis of the hybridization transcript was accomplished by spectrophotometric analysis of the starting RNA and cRNA and gel electrophoresis following synthesis of the cDNA cRNA and fragmentation of the cRNA A 3 5 ratio of GAPDH less than 2 was considered acceptable for efficiency of transcription Spiked control transcripts were also monitored to verify hybridization integrity Scaling factors for each sample ranged between 0 88 and 17 8 with the ratio of scaling factors between samples for a given chip ranging from 1 4 to 2 5 All quality control measures were consistent with the manufacturers recommended procedures and conformed to the recommended cut off values Microarray data analysis for fibroblast clones All GeneChips were analyzed using MicroArray Suite 3 0 MAS 3 0 with target intensities normalized to 2500 Baseline genetic expression profiles of one clonal wild type MeCP2 expressing fibroblast strain were compared to the expression profile of the matched clonal mutant MeCP2 expressing cell strain for each of four different MECP2 mutations Analyzed data were imported to MicroDB and queried using Affymetrix s Data Mining Tool DMT All four matched pair comparisons were queried for directional changes For genes ESTs with increased levels of expression defined by MAS 3 0 as marginally increased or increased wild type baseline expression levels could be present or absent For genes with decreased levels of expression defined by MAS 3 0 as marginally decreased or decreased wild type baseline expression levels were required to be present We identified genes that demonstrated the same directional change in at least three of four comparisons We computed p values for genes identified by this criterion We assumed that if a gene was not subject to a systematic change in expression level an observed directional change in a given mutant strain would occur randomly and independently with probability equal to the overall proportion of directional changes observed in that mutant strain We used one sample two sided t tests on the reported GeneChip fold changes to assess whether the log fold changes of mutant cell strains differ from zero on average We report the corresponding 95 confidence intervals CI after conversion back from the log scale Although the assumptions of the t test cannot be verified there was insufficient data to carry out alternative tests Microarray data analysis for lymphoblastoid cell lines All GeneChips were analyzed using MAS 3 0 with target intensities normalized to 2500 Only one lymphoblast cell line yielded both a clonal wild type and clonal mutant cell line 1159del28 Baseline expression profiles were derived from the clonal wild type cell line 1159del28 and the four completely skewed wild type cell line controls R106W R255X 803delG 803delG Expression profiles from the mutant clonal cell line 1159del28 and three additional clonal mutant MeCP2 expressing cell lines T158M 803delG R168X were compared to the baseline expression profiles Each mutant expression profile was compared to each wild type control profile yielding 20 comparisons Analyzed data was imported to MicroDB and queried using DMT All 20 comparisons were queried to identify genes that demonstrated similar directional changes in at least 15 of 20 unmatched pair comparisons four mutant samples compared individually to each of five wild type samples For genes with increased levels of expression defined by MAS 3 0 as marginally increased or increased wild type baseline expression levels could be present or absent For genes with decreased levels of expression defined by MAS 3 0 as marginally decreased or decreased wild type baseline expression levels were required to be present We used two sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests on the reported uncompared values for the two groups to test whether the expression profiles of mutant cell lines differ from those of wild type cell lines Real time comparative quantitative PCR Total RNA from the four matched pairs of clonal fibroblast cell strains and ten lymphoblast cell lines used on the GeneChips was used as template for RT PCR to independently assess the validity of Affymetrix GeneChip data Each RT reaction was performed with RNA from the same preparation used for the GeneChip hybridization Total RNA from eight additional clonal cell strains four mutant and four wild type with the R106W mutation and fourteen additional clonal cell strains seven mutant and seven wild type with the 1155del32 mutation were also used as template for RT PCR to assess consistency of results across different clonal fibroblast cell strains Reverse transcription of total RNA was performed after Dnase I digestion Roche Diagnostics Indianapolis IN with the Superscript II Rnase H Reverse Transcriptase GibcoBRL Life Technologies protocol for cDNA synthesis using 2 g of total RNA and 1 g of random hexamers Absence of DNA contamination was verified by amplifying the 756 bp intron containing region of the MECP2 gene between exons 3 and 4 using exon 3 based primer 5 AGCCCGTGCAGCCATCAGCC 3 and exon 4 based primer 5 CTTCCCAGGACTTTTCTCCA 3 Minus RT samples tested simultaneously with experimental samples by quantitative RT PCR with Sybr Green consistently yielded no amplification below 33 cycles using the above protocol The RT product was diluted 10 fold aliquoted and stored at 80 C Forward and reverse primers were designed using Applied Biosystem s Primer Express v1 0 software Applied Biosystems Foster City CA from consensus sequences provided by Affymetrix http www netaffx comfor each gene of interest Each 25 l PCR mix contained 7 875 l Sybr Green Master Mix 1X Sybr Green Buffer 3 mM MgCl 2 200 nM dNTP blend 0 6275 U Amplitaq Gold 0 25 U AmpErase UNG 200 400 nM forward and reverse primers and approximately 5 ng template Cycle conditions for the ABI 7700 were 50 C for 2 minutes 95 C for 10 minutes and 35 cycles of 95 C for 15 sec and 60 C for 1 minute The average of four endogenous controls GAPDH actin TATA IID and transferrin was used to normalize the amount of template for each wild type and mutant pair Each reaction was run in triplicate with the results averaged on the log base 2 scale Standard curves for each amplification product were generated from 10 fold dilutions of pooled cDNA to determine primer efficiency Data was analyzed with Microsoft Excel 2000 to generate raw expression values We performed paired t tests on the RT PCR values for the original set of fibroblast clones to test whether the average log change across cell strains differs from zero We used unpaired t tests for the second set of fibroblast clones from each of two cell strains to determine whether multiple clones from individuals undergo a systematic fold change We used unpaired Wilcoxon rank sum tests for the lymphoblast cell lines to test whether there is a systematic fold change across lines All reported 95 confidence intervals are reported in terms of fold changes but derived from t tests computed on the log scale Results Characterization of clonal cell strains Clonal mutant and wild type MECP2 expressing fibroblast cell strains were successfully established from four Rett females with different mutations one missense in the MBD one missense in the TRD and two frameshift mutations leading to premature stop codons Clonality was established by three independent methods visualization of each cell transferred for clonal culture X inactivation pattern analysis of the polymorphic androgen receptor alleles using GeneScan and identification of single allele MECP2 transcripts Fig 1 The levels of MECP2 transcripts were virtually identical by real time quantitative RT PCR analysis less than 0 27 cycle thresholds difference across all eight clones one wild type and one mutant from each individual that were used for oligonucleotide array hybridization data not shown This result is not surprising Given the fact that the premature termination codons resulting from the frameshift mutations are all located in the 3 final exon of the MECP2 gene preferential degradation of nonsense codon containing transcripts would not be expected 24 To assess MeCP2 expression at the protein level immunoblot analysis with an antibody against the C terminal region of MeCP2 was carried out on total cell lysates from all eight fibroblast clones and from some of the LCLs that were used for array hybridization Fig 2 A reacting protein band at the molecular weight of 75 kD as indicated by the company http www upstate com was seen in wild type cell lines expressing a normal sized MeCP2 protein and in cell lines with missense mutations FB R106W FB R306C and LCL T158M Cell clones expressing an allele with a truncating mutation FB 705delG FB 1155del32 LCL R168X do not produce a normal sized MECP2 protein Due to the location of the epitope the antibody would not react with putative truncated proteins The bands seen at approximately 48 and 100 kD are unidentified proteins that cross react with the MeCP2 antibody The absence of a normal sized MeCP2 protein in mutant clones with truncating mutations confirms their purity and together with the presence of MeCP2 in the wild type clones validates these matched pairs of cell cultures as a useful experimental system for the search of downstream effects of MeCP2 deficiency Oligonucleotide array hybridization data of matched fibroblast clones The percent present calls ranged from 13 chip D to 55 chip A Standard deviations for the percent present calls for a given chip were 1 3 There were no significant differences in percent present calls between MeCP2 deficient and MeCP2 positive samples A total of 252 700 comparisons four Rett females 63 175 interrogations on five GeneChips revealed 6 745 increased or marginally increased genes ESTs and 6 966 decreased or marginally decreased genes ESTs The number of genes with increased and decreased levels of expression in mutant MeCP2 over wild type expressing clones differed among the fibroblast strains studied R106W 889 3056 R306C 1700 1435 705delG 1160 1240 1155del32 2996 1235 The unadjusted p value for any one gene that was increased decreased in three out of four matched pair comparisons was 000060 000075 The p value for any gene that increased decreased in all four comparisons was 3 29 E 07 4 72 E 07 Forty six genes showed increased levels of expression in mutant cells in three out of four comparisons Three genes were increased in all four comparisons Of the 49 genes 29 had been annotated as known genes and 20 as unknown transcripts Of those 7 were found to encode known genes by searching recent database releases and the Celera database Table 1 Expression levels of two genes VSHK1 and CA12 represented twice on the chips with different accession numbers were increased in both cases Of the 47 unique genes with increased transcript levels in MeCP2 deficient cells 32 are known to be expressed in brain Table 1 Twenty one genes demonstrated decreased levels of expression in three out of four matched comparisons Of the 21 genes 13 had been annotated as known genes and 8 as unknown transcripts of which one was found to encode a known gene by searching recent database releases and the Celera database Table 2 Oligonucleotide probes for two of the genes COMP and IGFBP5 were represented twice on the chips and both genes were detected as showing differential expression Of the 19 unique genes with decreased expression in MeCP2 deficient cells 12 are known to be expressed in brain Table 2 Quantitative real time RT PCR analyses of fibroblast clones To assess the reliability of the array hybridization results transcript levels of 11 differentially expressed genes 8 with increased and 3 with decreased expression were quantified using real time quantitative RT PCR analysis with Sybr Green The same RNA samples used for making array hybridization probes were used as templates for RT PCR The Pearson correlation coefficient was 0 96 for the RT PCR values from triplicate assays The fold change data from the GeneChips and RT PCR analyses Table 3 were converted to log scale for analysis and comparison The correlation of the combined RT PCR fold change data based on average of log of the three measurements from each wild type and each mutant sample with the GeneChip log fold change data was 92 95 CI 0 86 0 96 Fig 3 To assess the consistency of differential gene expression among a larger number of independently derived cell clones from the same individual we selected five genes with large fold change values that had been identified by microarray analysis and confirmed by RT PCR Three genes with increased expression in mutant clones MTAP44 MMP3 and NTN4 and two with decreased expression CRIP1 and COMP were quantitatively tested in multiple clonal cell strains from two Rett females with MECP2 mutations 1155del32 and R106W using RT PCR Expression levels varied significantly from clone to clone and between cell strains Fig 4 Fold change values for the multiple clone comparisons were mostly inconsistent with the original GeneChip RT PCR data Furthermore the 95 confidence interval for fold change included 1 0 no change in six of the ten comparisons Fig 5 Expression of CRIP1 was significantly different between wild type and mutant clones for both Rett individuals tested p 0 004 and p 0 035 however the direction of change was different Increased expression of only one gene MTAP44 encoding the interferon inducible microtubular aggregate protein 44 remained significant in comparison of the mutant and wild type clones for both individuals tested p 0 027 and p 0 01 Fig 5 Oligonucleotide array hybridization data of lymphoblasts The global gene expression pattern in fibroblasts is limited and single cell cloning may amplify stochastic events in culture that may be responsible for the wide range of transcript levels in fibroblast clones We therefore extended the microarray analyses to lymphoblastoid cell lines LCLs and studied four clonal mutant MeCP2 T158M 803delG R168X and 1159del28 expressing and one clonal 1159del28 and four completely skewed R106W R255X 803delG 803delG wild type MeCP2 expressing LCLs The percent present calls ranged from 13 chip D to 50 chip A and as for the fibroblast data standard deviations for the percent present calls for a given chip were 1 3 and differences in percent present calls between wild type samples compared to mutant samples were not significant When the expression profile of each mutant was compared to that of each wild type LCL 16 genes were found to be differentially expressed in at least 15 of 20 comparisons Table 4 Eleven genes showed increased levels of expression and 5 showed decreased expression Of those 16 genes 12 are annotated as known genes and 9 are expressed in brain Quantitative RT PCR was performed on four genes three with increased and one with decreased expression to assess the accuracy of GeneChip results In a plot similar to that shown in Figure 3 the correlation of the combined RT PCR fold change data with the GeneChip log fold change data was 0 91 data not shown Discussion Random X inactivation patterns are characteristic for Rett syndrome that is caused by heterozygosity for mutations in the X linked locus MECP2 Our study design was intended to take advantage of the mosaic X chromosome inactivation in cell strains of Rett syndrome females From four original fibroblast samples we generated clonally derived cell strains that expressed only the mutant MeCP2 or only the wild type MECP2 allele but not both We hypothesized that the effects of MeCP2 dysfunction in the mutant clonal cell strain would be more pronounced than in the original cell strain with mosaic X chromosome inactivation Moreover we were able to establish the ideal matched control for each clonal mutant cell strain a clonal cell strain with the wild type MECP2 allele on the active X chromosome from the same individual Comparative transcription profiling of matched pairs of fibroblast clones should eliminate any noise contributed by polymorphisms or mutations of autosomal genes Although MeCP2 expression is higher in other tissues such as brain spleen and lung 16 the value gained by the matched pair comparisons of clonal skin fibroblast strains cultured under identical environmental conditions should overcome the drawbacks of evaluating a tissue with a lower level of expression Previously reported microarray studies of female Rett and unrelated control brain samples revealed expression changes that were interpreted as secondary to the disease process such as increased expression of glial specific genes and decreased expression of neuronal genes 25 Therefore when searching for the primary targets of MeCP2 modulation it might be advantageous to study a tissue that is less obviously involved in the pathologic processes of the disease To identify potential target genes of MeCP2 regulation we looked for genes with increased transcript levels in at least three out of four mutant wild type MECP2 expressing fibroblast comparisons Similarly genes with decreased expression in at least three out of four matched pair comparisons were also considered potential targets of MeCP2 regulation If the calls made did not reflect real increases or decreases we would expect expression level increases and decreases to be scattered randomly throughout the 63 175 transcripts interrogated By random chance alone we would expect to see fewer than four genes increased in three of four comparisons and fewer than one 0 03 genes increased in four of four comparisons The number of differentially regulated genes identified by these criteria 49 with increased and 21 with decreased expression is significantly higher than expected by random chance but it is much lower than one would expect if MeCP2 had a crucial role as transcriptional repressor of all genes with methylated promoters To validate the microarray expression data with an independent method we carried out real time quantitative RT PCR analyses for a sub set of 11 genes on all 8 samples that were used on the GeneChips The results were amazingly consistent for fold change and direction of change in almost all instances We therefore chose to use quantitative RT PCR alone to assess whether the increased or decreased expression patterns observed in the initial four matched pairs of clones were consistent in other clones and therefore might be biologically meaningful Much to our surprise expression levels of 5 genes in 11 additional MeCP2 deficient and 11 additional MeCP2 positive clones from two Rett individuals one with a missense and one with a truncating mutation showed tremendous variation In the multiple clone comparisons the fold change values trended away from the significant fold changes seen on the GeneChips and RT PCR of the original matched pair comparisons toward 1 0 no change CRIP1 expression generated significant p values but the direction of change differed in the two individuals tested In the truncating mutation 1155del32 expression was decreased and in the missense mutation R106W it was increased Although individual background genetic differences between the two Rett females might be responsible for these results the possibility that the opposite type changes are mutation type specific needs to be evaluated by studies of clones from additional patients Only MTAP44 encoding the interferon inducible microtubular aggregate protein 44 remained significant in comparison of the mutant and wild type clones with average increases of 3 12 and 5 58 fold for the two individuals tested The product of this gene was first identified by a monoclonal antibody against microtubular aggregates in hepatocytes of chimpanzees infected with hepatitis C virus 26 The production of p44 mRNA is markedly induced in the liver of chimpanzees infected with hepatitis C or hepatitis D virus 27 Inducibility by interferon alpha beta but not by interferon gamma is mediated by an interferon stimulated response element in the promoter region 27 The gene was independently identified in a search for novel interferon inducible genes in the mouse Dron M Meritet J F and Tovey M G unpublished GenBank AJ299405 Also known as IFI44 for Interferon inducible protein 44 the human gene is located on chromosome 1p31 1 Although predominantly expressed in uterus and other internal organs transcripts have been isolated from brain and hypothalamus cDNA libraries see dbEST The putative function of this protein in the brain is still a mystery A different design was used for the microarray study of Rett syndrome LCLs We initiated the LCL study because MeCP2 protein expression was higher in lymphoblasts than in fibroblasts and LCLs have an overlapping expression pattern that includes genes not expressed in fibroblasts Because of skewed X inactivation in the available LCLs however we were only able to obtain one matched pair of mutant versus wild type expressing clones for 1159del28 For the 20 different comparisons we included three mutant allele expressing clones T158M 803delG R168X and four completely skewed wild type MeCP2 expressing LCLs R106W R255X 803delG 803delG from different donors Nevertheless only 16 differentially expressed genes were identified with a sub set confirmed by quantitative RT PCR None of these genes were identical to any candidates found in the fibroblast study Gene expression patterns in primary fibroblasts and transformed lymphoblasts are different and or may respond differently to MeCP2 deficiency Several of the candidate targets identified in lymphoblasts that are also expressed in brain Table 4 may warrant further evaluation While our initial matched fibroblast clonal comparisons identified numerous genes with consistent results that could be targets of MeCP2 modulation verification of a small subset of these data by comparing additional clones not used on the GeneChip analysis revealed amazing inconsistency The variability of gene expression across clonal cell strains with the same genotype and the same X chromosome active was similar among clones expressing the mutant or the wild type MECP2 allele Therefore it is not likely to result from MeCP2 dysfunction and we can exclude the possibility that MECP2 mutations lead to transcript instability More likely fibroblasts in culture undergo random modification of gene expression by somatic mutations or epigenetic regulation and such rare events may be amplified in single cell derived clones In uncloned fibroblast populations RNA samples from replicate cultures revealed consistent results in comparative large scale gene expression studies 28 Cell lines i e transformed immortalized or tumor derived cell lines are well known to be heteroploid i e chromosomally unstable and any single cell derived clones of such lines are genetically heterogeneous Therefore some differences in transcript levels among such clones would not be surprising There are almost no reports in the literature however on comparative gene expression studies in clones of primary fibroblasts One of the reasons may be that it is difficult to generate such clones In 1981 Griffin et al 29 reported variation in the activity of steroid 5alpha reductase the enzyme that converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone in cloned human skin fibroblasts Activity of this enzyme is low in non genital skin but high in genital skin cells that grow in response to androgen Foreskin derived fibroblast clones varied greatly up to 200 fold in enzyme activity The range of activity for other microsomal enzymes was much lower in the same fibroblast clones These authors did not study mRNA levels but reductase activity therefore variation at the level of protein stability could also play a role Our data could be interpreted to suggest that microarray experiments should be performed on greater numbers of samples and or samples from mutant and wild type brain to generate meaningful data It is instructive however that Tudor and colleagues compared global gene expression in a large number of wild type and Mecp2 null male mice and failed to identify striking changes in gene expression in the brain 30 Conclusions Both fibroblast and lymphoblast data together agree in the most important positive result of our studies MeCP2 deficiency does not result in global deregulation of gene expression This result is novel and unexpected in light of the purported function of MeCP2 as a global transcriptional regulator that was based on in vitro biochemical studies There are several possibilities that might explain our findings First redundancy in methyl CpG binding proteins that recruit transcriptional silencing complexes may mask the effects of MeCP2 deficiency for example MBD1 MBD2 or Kaiso may complement the defect in the cell types we studied Second if the inter clonal variation we detected by the quantitative RT PCR study of 5 genes in 22 clones from two different Rett individuals were representative of a general feature of diploid fibroblast clones it could have masked any consistent biologically meaningful expression changes If our limited findings were confirmed by larger scale studies we would need to conclude that clonal fibroblast strains are not a suitable resource for genome wide expression profiling studies Third deregulation of very few genes expressed only in parts of the brain or only under certain conditions may be responsible for the neuronal abnormalities in Rett brains and this would not be detected by microarray studies Fourth MeCP2 action on chromatin as suggested by observed changes in histone acetylation 31 32 may not involve protein coding genes that are represented on microarrays but instead may affect centromeric heterochromatin or the expression of small non coding RNAs that are abundant in normal brain 33 The results presented in this paper contradict the established model of MeCP2 function and necessitate a rethinking of
