 Background The effects of the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid RA are mediated by two classes of ligand dependent transcription factors the retinoic acid receptors RAR and the retinoid X receptors RXR 1 The RARs are activated by all trans RA and 9 cis RA whereas the RXRs are activated by 9 cis RA only There are three known members of each class termed and encoded by separate genes Each gene may express several different isoforms because of alternative splicing and differential promoter usage 2 Both the RARs and RXRs contain functional domains for DNA and ligand binding dimerization with other transcription factors and transactivation of RA responsive promoters RARs and RXRs function as heterodimers that bind to response elements in the promoters of target genes to regulate RA dependent transcription RAR RXR binding to nuclear receptor corepressors such as NCoR and SMRT in the absence of ligand inhibits activation of RA responsive genes 3 4 Ligand binding displaces the repressors and recruits coactivator proteins such as CBP which have histone acetyltransferase activity 5 Histone acetylation allows for chromatin unwinding and transcriptional initiation of target gene expression 6 Previous studies have demonstrated that posttranslational modifications of RARs and RXRs are critical to the biological activity of the receptors In the RAR amino terminus a consensus mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK phosphorylation sequence was found to be a target of cyclin H and cdk7 7 RAR was shown to bind the cyclin H cdk7 complex in vitro and phosphorylation of serine 77 enhanced the transactivation function of RAR This phosphorylation was required for the RA mediated differentiation of F9 cells into parietal endoderm 8 These studies point to the importance of phosphorylation in the proper functioning of RARs Mutation of serine 77 to alanine in RAR has been shown to inhibit the basal activation function of the receptor 7 Other mutations have also been shown to decrease RAR function RAC65 cells an RA resistant clone of the pluripotent P19 embryonal carcinoma line express a truncated RAR that lacks part of the ligand binding domain 9 As a result of this mutation RAC65 cells do not differentiate when exposed to RA An RAR clone truncated after amino acid 403 was effective in repressing reporter gene activity and blocking wild type RAR function 10 11 A single amino acid change in RAR G303E impaired RA binding affinity and significantly reduced reporter gene activity from responsive promoters These studies illustrate the usefulness of dominant negative RAR mutants in elucidating mechanisms of RA signaling In the present study we show that RA by inhibiting cyclin H and cdk7 expression reduces phosphorylation of RAR We examined the role of hypophosphorylated RAR by mutating the cdk7 phosphorylation site in the receptor amino terminus S77A The S77A RAR mutant decreased proliferation of human cancer cells consistent with inhibition of the G1 S phase transition Decreased proliferation of the mutant clones was associated with inhibition of EGFR mediated AP 1 expression and ERK1 activity similar to the effects of RA This study illustrates a novel mechanism by which RA inhibits proliferation i e by decreasing RAR phosphorylation and that in the absence of ligand hypophosphorylated RAR can mimic the molecular and cellular changes associated with retinoid treatment Results The mechanisms which regulate cyclin H cdk7 phosphorylation of RAR have not been elucidated To determine if RA itself could affect the phosphorylation status of its receptor we treated SCC4 and SCC25 lines with 1 M all trans RA for 16 hours As shown in Fig 1A RA treatment decreased expression of both cyclin H and cdk7 in SCC4 and SCC25 cells by 3 fold To determine if reduced cyclin H and cdk7 expression correlated with decreased RAR phosphorylation we immunoprecipitated the receptor from vehicle and RA treated SCC4 and SCC25 cells As shown in Fig 1B relative phosphorylation levels of RAR decreased by 3 fold similar to the reduction in cyclin H and cdk7 expression Previous studies have shown that the amino terminus of the estrogen receptor is phosphorylated by MAPK proteins 12 To determine the participation of MAPKs in RAR phosphorylation we performed RAR immunoprecipitation on SCC25 cells treated with the MEK ERK inhibitor PD98059 or p38 inhibitory drug SB203580 Treatment with these drugs did not change relative RAR phosphorylation levels Fig 1B We concluded that RA repressed cyclin H cdk7 expression which correlated with reduced RAR phosphorylation levels RA is a potent inhibitor of cellular proliferation 13 To determine the effects of hypophosphorylated RAR on the growth of human cancer cells we expressed an S77A RAR expression construct in SCC25 cells The serine residue at position 77 was previously shown to be the target of cyclin H cdk7 phosphorylation 7 As shown in Fig 2 expression of the S77A mutant resulted in decreased relative phosphorylation of immunoprecipitated RAR in stable clones compared to G418 resistant control cells To confirm that this effect was due to expression of the hypophosphorylated RAR mutant we also created stable clones expressing either HA tagged RAR or the S77A mutant As shown in Fig 3 only clones expressing HA RAR and not the HA S77A mutant showed phosphorylation on serine residues These experiments indicate that the relative amount of phosphorylated RAR in SCC25 cells was decreased by the S77A mutant SCC25 cells expressing the S77A mutant RAR proliferated at markedly reduced rates compared to control clones Fig 4 The S77A RAR mutants grew at only 30 50 of the rate of G418 resistant controls in culture By comparison proliferation of clones expressing HA tagged RAR was 90 of G418 resistant control cells We concluded that decreased RAR phosphorylation produces inhibition of proliferation in SCC25 cells To determine if decreased proliferation of the mutant RAR clones correlated with inhibition of cell cycle progression we performed BrdU incorporation analysis As shown in Fig 5 less than half the percentage of S77A mutant cells incorporated BrdU compared to the G418 resistant control clones By comparison there were no significant differences in BrdU incorporation between HA tagged RAR clones and G418 resistant control cells These results indicate that the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle is inhibited in S77A mutant clones To corroborate this conclusion we examined expression of the G1 phase cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors p21 WAF1 Cip1and p27 Kip1in G418 resistant and S77A mutant clones We also determined the expression of the S phase marker cyclin A in these cells As shown in Fig 6 expression of the G1 phase markers p21 WAF1 Cip1and p27 Kip1in the mutant RAR clones was up to 3 fold higher compared to control cells In contrast expression of the S phase marker cyclin A was decreased by 3 fold in two clones RAR1 and 2 and was undetectable in 2 others RAR3 and 4 when compared to G418 resistant control cells These results indicate that the decreased proliferation observed in S77A RAR mutant clones is due to inhibition of cell cycle progression at the G1 to S phase transition The antiproliferative effects of RA have been attributed to its inhibition of AP 1 transcriptional activity 13 While the S77A RAR mutant has been shown to inhibit transactivation of RA response elements 7 its effects on AP 1 activity have not been characterized We first addressed this issue by transiently transfecting a heterologous promoter containing a consensus AP 1 site fused to the luciferase reporter gene 11 along with wild type RAR or S77A mutant expression vectors In the absence of ligand the S77A RAR mutant inhibited AP 1 activity from this construct by 50 similar to treatment with 1 M all trans RA Fig 7 The wild type receptor possessed slight anti AP 1 activity in the absence of ligand 20 reduction compared to control cells transfected with blank expression vector These results indicate that hypophosphorylated RAR can mimic the effects of RA by inhibiting AP 1 activity To determine if reductions in AP 1 protein levels could account for the observed transcriptional inhibition by the S77A mutant RAR we compared expression of fos and jun proteins in G418 resistant control clones and S77A RAR expressing cells As shown in Fig 8 Fra 1 expression was undetectable in 3 of 4 RAR mutant clones Expression of c jun was reduced by 3 to 4 fold in the S77A RAR cells compared to G418 resistant control clones JunB expression was also decreased by up to 20 fold in mutant RAR expressing cells Expression of c fos Fra 2 FosB and JunD was not detected under normal growth conditions in SCC25 cells These results indicate that decreased AP 1 protein expression correlates with AP 1 transcriptional inhibition by hypophosphorylated RAR Upstream of AP 1 transcription factors RA has been shown to inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR expression 14 To determine if hypophosphorylated RAR could inhibit EGFR expression we examined expression of the growth factor receptor by western blot in control and S77A mutant cells As shown in Fig 9 EGFR expression was undetectable in 3 of 4 mutant RAR clones and was reduced by 50 in the remaining clone RAR1 To determine if this dramatically decreased EGFR expression could inhibit downstream components of EGF signaling we also examined activation of ERK1 a terminal effector in the mitogen activated protein kinase pathway Activated ERK1 in S77A mutant cells was expressed at less than 10 of the levels found in G418 resistant control clones Overall ERK1 expression was not affected by hypophosphorylated RAR These results indicate that components of the EGFR signaling pathway upstream of AP 1 transcription factors are inhibited by hypophosphorylated RAR Activation of growth factor receptors has been shown to induce expression of AP 1 proteins 15 To determine if EGF signaling correlated with AP 1 activity in SCC25 cells we first incubated cultures in 1 depleted serum for 16 hours to inhibit AP 1 protein expression We then stimulated these cultures with 10 ng ml EGF for up to 4 hours As shown in Fig 10 EGF produced dramatic induction of AP 1 protein expression within 15 minutes after its addition c fos expression peaked at 100 fold over unstimulated levels at 2 hours following EGF addition Following a similar time course c jun expression increased by 25 fold following stimulation by EGF Induction of Fra 1 and JunB expression was also noted although the increase was of less magnitude than that observed for c fos and c jun The effects of EGF on AP 1 protein expression were completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor tyrphostin AG1478 data not shown indicating that growth factor receptor signaling directly correlates with AP 1 protein expression These data suggest that in the unliganded state hypophosphorylated RAR can mimic the effects of RA on EGFR expression ERK1 activity and AP 1 protein levels Conclusions The antiproliferative effects of RA have been recognized for many years This important chemotherapeutic property of RA has been attributed to a number of molecular mechanisms Decreased growth factor and growth factor receptor expression has been proposed as a potential growth inhibitory mechanism 14 Additionally RA mediated inhibition of AP 1 activity is believed to be important in cellular growth control by this ligand 13 AP 1 inhibition via direct interaction between RARs and AP 1 proteins has been proposed 16 RA inhibition of jun N terminal kinase was shown to prevent c jun phosphorylation resulting in decreased AP 1 activity 17 Competition between RAR and AP 1 for limiting amounts of the nuclear receptor coactivator CBP may also account for decreases in AP 1 transcriptional activity 5 In the present study we have described a new mechanism by which RA can inhibit cellular proliferation RA inhibited cyclin H and cdk7 expression which correlated with hypophosphorylation of RAR on serine 77 To separate the specific role of hypophosphorylated RAR from the pleiotropic effects of the ligand we expressed a non phosphorylatable S77A mutant protein in human cancer cells The S77A RAR mutant inhibited proliferation of SCC25 cells even in the absence of RA thereby mimicking the growth inhibitory effect of the ligand This growth inhibition correlated with a delay in G1 to S phase progression EGFR expression ERK1 activation and AP 1 activity were inhibited by the mutant RAR effects which are also achieved by RA treatment alone We determined that decreases in AP 1 protein expression observed in the RAR mutant clones were primarily due to diminished EGFR signaling Therefore while ligand bound RAR has been shown to activate a large number of RA target genes the hypophosphorylated form of the receptor created in some cells following retinoid treatment may be important in transcriptional repression In support of this hypothesis Rochette Egly et al 7 described decreased transactivation function by the S77A mutant RAR Previously we characterized another RAR mutant in which the receptor protein was truncated after amino acid 403 thereby deleting the AF 2 domain 11 This truncated receptor exhibited similar properties to the S77A mutant growth inhibition and repression of RA responsive gene expression including EGFR Repression of RA responsive gene expression was believed due to the inability of this RAR to interact with CBP via its shortened carboxyl terminus 5 By the same token this mutant receptor did not affect RA inhibition of AP 1 activity presumably due to its inability to compete for CBP 11 We observed decreased AP 1 activity in transient transfections using the RAR403 mutant likely due to decreased EGFR expression However the mechanisms by which the S77A mutant inhibits RA responsive gene expression is unknown The RAR amino terminus is not known to interact with CBP or its associated factor PCAF 5 18 Additionally RARs bind to the interaction domains of repressor proteins such as NCoR via region D of the receptor rather than the amino terminus 4 Despite the lack of obvious interaction of the RAR amino terminus with nuclear receptor cofactors the S77A mutation may alter the three dimensional structure of the receptor This altered configuration may prevent the mutant receptor from releasing repressor proteins or recruiting coactivators in the presence of ligand The S77A mutant receptor was shown to inhibit ligand dependent transactivation of RA responsive promoters 7 but the mechanism of this reduction e g competition for binding sites cofactor interaction ligand binding has not been determined In summary decreased RAR phosphorylation correlating with RA mediated inhibition of cyclin H and cdk7 expression illustrates a new mechanism by which ligand can indirectly regulate receptor activation This raises the question of how RA initially downregulates cyclin H and cdk7 expression whether by AP 1 inhibition or through negative retinoid response elements in the regulatory regions of the genes The characterization of potentially altered interactions between hypophosphorylated RAR and its cofactors will provide unique insight into how post translational modification of nuclear hormone receptors regulates repressor release coactivator recruitment histone acetylation and transcriptional activation Methods Cell culture and stable transfection The human squamous cell carcinoma lines used in this
