 okay the topic that we have Victoria again as I mentioned was what do you feel is wrong with our public school system and i guess if i were to look at with four grown children and having been through all four of them through public schools and colleges i guess the public school system i would have to say is that we probably need to pay our teachers a little bit more exactly we need to we need to probably try to get more one on one with the teachers and the and the students if we could smaller classrooms possibly and the other thing was we need to really really to tighten up our discipline in schools because they run here in New England i m not sure about the rest of the country but i know the schools are almost running rampant up here exactly and it s too bad because there are you know serious drinking problems with with real um you know young young kids i m talking kids that are nine ten eleven twelve years old drug problems go ahead i m sorry i would when i was in school um i was supposedly in one of the best school systems in the country in Fairfax county and i m i think back and i i don t feel like i i could have learned a lot more and don t feel like i learned as much i ve only been out of school high school for four years but i think i could have learned a lot more and i ve i worry about the children that are in uh huh the other school systems that aren t as good um i don t know any particular ones but you know when when they say one of the where i went to school was one of the best counties then i think yeah i lived i lived that s just outside of Washington i lived in Fairfax county that was really really a nice nice area down there and uh huh my i had the same situation here my kids were we bought them up and put them in the public schools here in Rhode Island and they were not not too too bad and this was going back like ten years i guess ten years ago they were not too too bad at that time and i was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to move from Rhode Island to Texas with with TI with my job and i worked there in the southwest for ten almost ten or eleven years and the kids got a my kids got a much better education education in Texas simply because they had the opportunity to have more one on one uh huh uh relationships with the with the uh the facility okay and and that helped like especially one of my sons he was he could learn but he really had to work at learning if if that makes sense to you uh huh and and uh again like you say there was and you are still a student and there s so much more you could have learned and but i i i don t know i think discipline i guess if i were to look at one thing we ve lost well kids used to have a respect for the teacher i guess at one time but i think we ve kind of lost that in out school system and i m not really sure how to get it back i say discipline and that might be the wrong choice of words but it uh huh i know um i know with um i think teachers need to be paid more i have a lot of friends who and myself who ve thought about going into elementary education and to teaching and then they looked and saw how much money they got and said well there s a lot of other things I can do and get a lot more money oh yeah it s so it it s so hard and and it s so hard to compete and and that s not one of the things that s gonna make the people like yourself who are just graduating from colleges you know or out across the country wanna go jumping into a an education field when the when there s you can almost double your pay in almost any other field you know for as a as a entry level uh huh exactly and i am not saying that we should give them the world either but I think we should pay them a little more money um they say a hundred and eighty days a year is all they work and i don t really believe that i think it s a lot more than that when you figure the hours and time they put into the school and stuff alright and even if is only a hundred and eighty days a year lets pay them for the hundred and eighty days a year i mean and and i mean their their day doesn t end you know when schools out no no they that s what i mean at one time we we used to able to carry that over to the kids of course i i can see the teacher s point too where at at three o clock or four o clock they want to go home and not worry about kids so but if they had probably some renumeration to help them say you know maybe i ll give this kid a little extra help or something uh huh in the long run i think it would really be worth while i mean they they uh go home and grade papers lesson plans prepare for the next day what what is your major in school that your ah super that sounds good and you re finishing up this year huh i m an interior design major yep so exactly in May well that s great i i wish you all the best in in your future in your endeavors out there in what ever you are doing and it s good to talk to a a a student rather than yeah most of the folk i ve talked to are are industrial people that like my self that have been in the work work force for a number of years and and it s ah it s refreshing to talk to ah to some of you younger folks and get your ideas and thing you know and see how you feel about things uh huh uh huh well i don t know what else we can do about this school situation Victoria and if there s anything else you d like to add i think that s about it you too you have a nice day and i m going to say good bye for now and if you re ever up Rhode Island way around TI look me up it s Ray Smith at TI in Albrough Massachusetts alrighty you too thank you bye bye have a nice one Victoria and good luck in your future bye bye
