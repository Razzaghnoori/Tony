 Background The human sodium bicarbonate cotransporters NBCs along with the inorganic anion exchangers comprise the SLC4A subfamily of proteins a part of the solute carrier SLC superfamily The coupled transport of Na and HCO 3 across the plasma membrane of epithelial cells is involved in the regulation of intracellular pH intracompartmental pH and intercompartmental pH gradients in many organ systems as suggested by expression of NBCs in the kidney pancreas heart retina skeletal muscle and other organs 1 2 3 Basolateral HCO 3 cotransport is necessary for proper buffering of digestive enzymes secreted by the pancreas 4 NBCs are also responsible for electrogenic transepithelial bicarbonate cotransport in kidney proximal tubules 4 5 Five human NBC transcripts SLC4A4 SLC4A8 have been previously cloned and mapped 1 2 3 4 6 7 8 9 Most recently NBC4 10 and SLC4A10 11 have been cloned We report the discovery and a genomic analysis of a sixth member of this family SLC4A9 a novel and alternatively spliced NBC like gene expressed at high levels in normal adult kidney We also present an in silico analysis of the genomic structure of NBC4 and evaluate conserved paralogous clustering of SLC4A genes with the members of the ankyrin epidermal growth factor EGF and fibroblast growth factor FGF gene families in the human genome Results Isolation and genomic structure of SLC4A9 As part of a positional cloning project we became interested in a region of 5q31 between D5S393 and D5S2927 We annotated all draft and finished genomic sequence from this region using SeqHelp 12 Presubmission contig h174 3 of bacterial artificial chromosome EAC clone CTC 329D1 now GenBank AC008438 included four regions of high translated sequence similarity with known mammalian NBCs GeneFinder Genie and GRAIL 1 3 predicted exons throughout the contig including but not limited to the regions of NBC homology We named the gene with the HUGO approved symbol SLC4A9 It is currently represented by ten kidney clones and one testis clone from the IMAGE consortium Unigene Hs 166669 Two expressed sequence tag EST clones IMAGE 1734773 and 1533693 were sequenced to completion yielding a 1 036 base pair bp cDNA contig The ESTs were later found to cover exons 15 18 and 20B D 1734773 and 20C E 1533693 of SLC4A9 when exons are numbered as in Figure 1 The assembled cDNA sequence matched an NBC like portion of 329D1 and additional new sequence elsewhere on the genomic contig The presumptive gap in the draft was closed by designing primers c67F and c67R from confirmed sequence and sequencing an approximately 1 8 kilobase kb PCR fragment from genomic DNA The resulting 30 161 bp contig included known sequence from two pieces of 329D1 as well as 659 bp of new sequence Putative exons on the 12 kb h174 3 contig were defined by a consensus of multiple algorithm exon predictions NBC homologies and IMAGE clone coverage Primers were designed from flanking intronic sequences Exons and adjoining splice sites were amplified by PCR from genomic DNA Snonymous coding sequence polymorphisms 111046 C T and 115744 C T and intronic single nucleotide polymorphism SNP 107724 A T were identified all 329D1 sequence coordinates refer to positions on GenBank AC008438 1 GI no 5686628 To extend the known 5 portion of the gene s coding sequence an adult human kidney library Clontech cat no HL5031t and a TriplEx2 long insert fetal brain cDNA library Clontech cat no HL5504u were probed with the two IMAGE clones The libraries were also amplified with primers 5 LDA and oi E Table 1 Figure 1illustrates the genomic structure and splicing variation of SLC4A9 SLC4A9 exon sizes vary from 56 bp exon 4 to 263 bp exon 9 Intron phase is distributed quite randomly in the 5 half of the sequence although toward the 3 end of the gene phase o introns become prevalent The SNP in exon 10A is immediately adjacent to an alternatively used 5 splice site but no correlation between the presence of exon 10B in cDNA clones and C or T at nucleotide 111 046 was observed All introns conform to the GT AG rule Cloning the 5 end of the SLC4A9transcript Two observations suggested to us that none of the known SLC4A9 mRNA isoforms is full length the open reading frames ORFs of all the isoforms start at the very first or second base at the 5 end of the clones and the complete inserts of the clones are 3 6 kb whereas the SLC4A9 transcripts on northern blots are 4 3 and 6 0 kb Figure 2 We therefore undertook a comprehensive effort to find the 5 end of SLC4A9 The lack of full length clones in the Clontech adult kidney cDNA library was not surprising because the library was dT primed and mostly contained inserts of under 3 8 kb in length manufacturer s data Therefore we used PCR based approaches to determine the sequence of the 5 end of the mRNA Nested RACE PCR rapid amplification of cDNA ends with PCR on Marathon kidney cDNA Clontech with four different primer combinations three within known exons and one within a GeneFinder predicted exon 5 of exon 1 and appropriate nested adaptor primers produced smears and multiple bands over several attempts Analysis of the RACE products by sequencing the gel extracted bands and random TA clones revealed 100 mispriming even though the gene specific RACE primers did not have any homologies to non SLC4A9 human sequence The sequenced TA clones most frequently corresponded to mitochondrial DNA sequences and to the FBN2 gene which coincidentally maps to 5q23 centromeric of SLC4A9 In addition to RACE on the Marathon cDNA we used the Advantage 2 PCR technique Clontech on undiluted aliquots of the kidney and fetal brain long insert phage libraries multiple times with all possible primer combinations of one vector primer either forward or reverse and one appropriately oriented gene specific primer All gene specific RACE primers and all internal sequencing primers used during the determination of the complete sequences of the IMAGE clones were tried one by one With the exception of the three TA clones obtained with the oi E primer all such experiments resulted in 100 mispriming This result was identical to that obtained when both gene specific and random primed reverse transcription followed by RACE with the same multiple gene specific primers as above were performed on a non Clontech sample of total RNA freshly extracted from a kidney biopsy In summary we have been unable to obtain a full length SLC4A9 transcript with current commercial RACE and RT PCR reverse transcription PCR protocols The 5 adjoining region of SLC4A9on 5q31 Despite the failure of experimental attempts to characterize the 5 end of SLC4A9 in silico analyses of the region expected to contain this portion of the gene have been informative The gene immediately centromeric to and 12 840 bp from SLC4A9 is HEGFL which encodes a heparin binding member of the EGF family Genomic DNA sequence between the 5 end of HEGFL and exon 1 of SLC4A9 provides some clues as to the structure of the 5 end of SLC4A9 A putative promoter on the SLC4A9 encoding strand was predicted by the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories LBL neural network promoter prediction algorithm 13 with a score of 1 0 at bp 129 291 129 242 of AC008438 1 This sequence has been shown to have promoter activity 14 on the strand opposite to the coding strand of SLC4A9 As HEGFL and SLC4A9 are transcribed in opposite orientations and have 5 ends facing each other the promoter may be bidirectional Four possible exons are predicted 5 of SLC4A9 by GeneFinder However neither protein homologies nor consensus Kozak sequences are seen in the region SLC4A9expression ortholog comparison and protein sequence analysis Northern blot analysis reveals that expression of SLC4A9 is extremely restricted Figure 2 Transcripts of 4 3 and 6 0 kb are seen at high levels in kidney but not in any other tissues tested This is consistent with the kidney origin of 10 of the 11 public ESTs corresponding to SLC4A9 The consistently smeary background observed regardless of the probe and hybridization stringency may be due to the presence of low levels of alternatively spliced SLC4A9 mRNA variants While this manuscript was undergoing revision the first mammalian SLC4A9 ortholog that in the rabbit was published 15 The rabbit gene encodes a sodium independent anion exchanger this underscores the importance of not assigning functions to NBC like genes in the absence of experimental evidence Similarly to human SLC4A9 the rabbit gene is alternatively spliced Both the RACE verified complete rabbit cDNA and our incomplete human cDNA are approximately 3 2 kb long In rabbit this is however consistent with the size of the major transcript on the northern blots and no transcripts over 3 8 kb are seen In human the known cDNA size is much less than the 4 3 kb and 6 0 kb signals on the northern blots In the absence of major differences in coding sequence this strongly suggests rapid evolution of species specific 5 and 3 untranslated regions UTRs which are longer in the human gene Table 2summarizes the properties of six human NBC and NBC like genes NBC4 and HNBC7 were discovered during our in silico annotation of genomic sequences NBC4 has since been described in detail 10 SLC4A9 has the most restricted expression pattern evidenced by high tissue specificity and low dbEST representation The amino acid sequence of the 990 amino acid SLC4A9 inferred from the major splice isoform was subjected to secondary structure and hydropathy analysis by TMPRED 16 Consistent with the results for NBC4 10 SLC4A9 is predicted to be a 12 transmembrane protein with a relatively long amino acids 1 265 cytoplasmic amino terminus and a shorter also cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus amino acids 929 990 NetPhos v 2 0 17 predicted several serine and threonine phosphorylation sites The relative lengths of the cytoplasmic domains and the distribution of phosphorylation sites were strikingly similar to those observed for NBC4 10 The predicted transmembrane segments and phosphorylation sites are indicated in Figure 3 The predicted SLC4A9 protein aligns both to human Figure 3 and rat data not shown NBCs SLC4A9 is most similar to SLC4A4 49 identity and SLC4A6 48 followed by NBC4 44 and SLC4A8 43 The exact extent of protein sequence similarity of HNBC7 to SLC4A9 cannot be determined since too little HNBC7 sequence can be inferred SLC4A9as a part of an ancient multiply duplicated EGF SLC4A ANK FGF gene cluster To identify gene clusters containing NBC like SLC4A genes we consolidated information from human radiation hybrid RH maps and the GSS and HTGS databases for seven SLC4A NBCs 19 FGF family members and 10 EGF family members 18 The electronic mapping strategy involved anchoring genomic sequences that matched each gene to the GB4 RH map via RH mapped sequence tagged sites STSs or gene based markers The possibility that ankyrins might also be a part of this cluster was suggested by the presence of a novel ankyrin gene ANKfc from fetal cochlea less than 100 kb distal to SLC4A9 on 5q31 We were able to determine map positions for all five SLC4A all four ANK 9 of 10 EGF and 17 of 19 FGF family members All cases where members of at least two of the four families cluster are shown in Figure 4 We used SLC4A family members to test the hypothesis that the origin and repeated duplication of the EGF FGF cluster predated the human mouse divergence Four of the seven known SLC4A genes were found near either an EGF gene or an FGF gene or both The genomic location of EGF and FGF family members on human chromosome 5q conforms to the syntenic relationship with mouse chromosome 18 19 Ten human genes belong to the EGF family 18 HEGFL on 5q31 EGF on 4q25 TGFA transforming growth factor on 2p13 and AREG amphiregulin EREG epiregulin and BTC betacellulin on 4q13 q21 are EGF paralogs TDGF1 teratocarcinoma derived growth factor approximately 20 5 megabases Mb proximal to SLC4A7 on 3p22 shares structural similarities with TGFA 20 Distance approximations are based on the sum of draft clone lengths and estimated gap sizes obtained from the Draft Human Genome Browser 21 Three neuregulin genes NRG1 3 are also in the EGF family 18 All these genes have orthologs in the mouse suggesting that multiple duplications of an ancestral EGF like gene predated the mouse human divergence Nineteen known loci encode members of the FGF family of which at least five map near EGF paralogs FGF1 on 5q31 approximately 1 5 Mb distal of HEGFL FGF2 on 4q25 approximately 14 7 Mb distal to EGF FGF8 on 10q25 cytogenetically close to NRG3 FGF17 on 8p21 approximately 11 0 Mb distal to HGL and FGF5 on 4q21 approximately 5 0 Mb from BTC Mouse genes Btc and Fgf5 are located close to each other in the region of mouse chromosome 5 syntenic to human 4q13 q21 The cluster size in the mouse is unknown because of the lack of sequence data As expected a novel NBC like gene 10 is located at 2p11 12 proximal to TGFA The distance between the two genes is approximately 4 0 Mb The protein sequence of NBC4 is similar to that of SLC4A9 see Figure 3 but the genomic structures of the two genes differ Exon boundaries are only partly conserved and NBC4 includes an intron of 20 5 kb longer than the genomic sequence containing exons 1 20 of SLC4A9 Portions of the NBC4 mRNA are completely identical to the expressed regions of two human genes on 2p13 DCTN1 dynactin a homolog of the Drosophila p150Glued gene and MTHFD2 methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase Figure 5 Specifically the 5 UTR of NBC4 matches 1 646 nucleotides of coding sequence and 87 nucleotides of the 3 UTR of DCTN1 and the 3 UTR of NBC4 matches 92 nucleotides of coding sequence and 75 nucleotides of the 3 UTR of the published MTHFD2 sequence In addition a 241 nucleotide overlap of NBC4 and MTHFD2 ESTs in the antisense orientation is inferred from annotation of GenBank AC073263 These ESTs correspond to alternate extended 3 UTR forms of the two genes which are different from the 3 UTRs of the published full length mRNAs We used public genomic resources to determine whether chromosomal locations of genes from any one of the four families EGF SLC4A ANK and FGF can be used to predict the genomic location of novel members of the remaining families Ankyrins mapped near several known EGF ligand and or FGF genes Figure 4 In particular on chromosome 4q25 ANK2 is located between EGF and FGF2 and EGF is proximal to FGF2 this gene ordering is supported both by the Human BAC Accession Map 22 and direct HTGS to GB4 RH mapping It was therefore not surprising to discover a novel ankyrin ANKfc immediately distal to SLC4A9 and thus distal to the EGF paralog HEGFL on 5q31 Searching the HTGS database with human NBC and NBC like cDNA queries yielded draft phase genomic sequences AL139426 AC018411 AC064816 similar to some but identical to none of the five HNBC genes described above Table 2 NBC homologous exons from these sequences were combined with Unigene cluster Hs 211115 to predict yet another novel sodium bicarbonate cotransporter like gene HNBC7 This gene maps to 1p31 32 where no EGF FGF cluster is currently known to exist Similarly SLC4A8 is at 12q13 where no EGF FGF cluster is yet known To test our hypothesis that the dispersed paralogous gene clusters are a product of multiple ancient duplications we conducted a phylogenetic analysis of the EGF SLC4A and FGF genes we believe to fall in the clusters along with their non human orthologs Neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods were used to construct phylogenetic trees for each of the gene families Figure 6a c This enabled us to infer the most likely history of the cluster duplications Figure 6d Two irregularities in Figure 6dare interesting from the standpoint of genomic history of duplicated genes NRG2 at 5q31 is phylogenetically closer to the 8p gene NRG1 than to any other EGF gene yet that relationship makes little sense if the duplication giving rise to clusters at 4q13 and 5q13 is far more ancient than that giving rise to the 8p and l0q clusters as the EGF and FGF data suggest The location of NRG2 at 5q31 is therefore noteworthy because only single members of the other families are present there and because NRG2 is phylogenetically very distant from the 5q EGF gene HBEGF making either multigene or single gene tandem duplications within 5q highly unlikely This product of a very recent duplication involving the 8p NRG1 gene may have been deposited at 5q31 as a random insertion of a newly duplicated gene away from its ancestral locus in a process similar to that which deposited some SLC4A genes outside of their ancestral paralogous clusters In addition the history of the 2p cluster is somewhat obscure as the 2p EGF gene is closest to the EGF gene at 4q27 whereas the 2p SLC4A gene is closest to the SLC4A at 4q13 as no SLC4A gene is currently known to exist at 4q27 With the exception of these irregularities the duplication history in Figure 6dis very well supported by the gene family trees in Figure 6a cand the full PHYLIP trees data not shown Discussion Alternative splicing of SLC4A9 The existence of multiple cDNA sequences as a result of alternative splicing is the most interesting feature of SLC4A9 Most SLC4A9 alternative splicing is accounted for by the selective inclusion or exclusion of portions of exons 8 10 11 19 and 20 In contrast to these alternatively spliced portions of the gene the use of exons 4 7 9 and 12 17 appears to be a constant feature of the various isoforms No splice variation is observed for these exons in any cDNA clones or dbEST entries examined with the exception of the fetal brain clone in which exon 12 contains extra sequence from the 5 adjoining intron All intron exon junctions of SLC4A9 feature consensus splice site sequences Therefore alternative splicing of SLC4A9 is not consistent with the hypothesis that weak or nonconsensus splice sites lead to intron retention or alternative splicing Instead yet undetermined cis acting intronic sequences may be responsible The recurrent noncoding SLC4A9 transcripts may escape the normal mechanisms of nonsense decay 23 responsible for degradation of incorrectly spliced mRNAs with disrupted ORFs Of all alternative splicing in humans only 20 occurs within coding regions 24 SLC4A9 may be a member of a class of genes characterized by highly variant and inefficient splicing a class first suggested by a comparison of ESTs to genomic sequences 25 The high degree of alternative splicing of SLC4A9 may be the result of inefficient spliceosomal processing One possible outcome of such inefficiency IMAGE clone 2130425 is not included in the 14 isoforms on Figure 1 This nonlinearly spliced clone includes unique exons dissimilar to any exons of any other SLC4A9 cDNAs A unique fragment in the exon 10 11 region is followed by a correctly spliced exon 11B and a part of exon 12 which splices backwards from a unique donor site to a unique partial version of exon 9 and continues directly to a unique fragment of exon 20 terminating at the common late polyadenylation signal The 3 UTR of SLC4A9 is fragmented into six alternatively spliced exons of which no more than two appear to be used per isoform and four harbor polyadenylation signals within expressed repetitive elements Two alternate 3 terminal untranslated exons of SLC4A9 exons 21 and 23 consist entirely of repetitive elements except for a 10 nucleotide spacer in exon 23 The two polyadenylation sites within exon 20 are used at roughly equal frequencies both in experimentally derived clones and public EST sequences corresponding to SLC4A9 Alternative polyadenylation is observed in fewer than 29 of human genes based on an analysis of 8 700 human 3 UTRs 26 The structurally invariant carboxy terminal 591 amino acids of SLC4A9 include the 12 transmembrane domains characteristic of sodium bicarbonate transporters The alternatively spliced amino terminal portion of SLC4A9 contains hydrophilic domains of unknown function It is possible that alternative splicing of these domains leads to different spatial or electrochemical specificity For example in chick cochlea different transcripts produced by alternative splicing of the SLO gene homolog of Drosophila slowpoke generate kinetically distinct calcium activated potassium channels 27 It is therefore tempting to speculate that proteins encoded by the alternative SLC4A9 transcripts might differ in stoichiometry or in the minimum voltage potential threshold required to activate cotransporter function SLC4A9 protein sequence comparison to paralogous genes Four large blocks of highly conserved amino acid sequence characterize all known HNBCs Figure 3 They correspond to SLC4A9 amino acid positions 68 210 223 352 384 578 and 629 960 At both ends of blocks 68 210 and 629 960 at the carboxy terminal end of block 384 578 and throughout block 223 352 SLC4A9 has significant sequence differences from most or all of the paralogs Non SLC4A9 proteins in the alignment have considerably greater homology between themselves in the equivalent regions than they do with SLC4A9 The exon 8 and exon 10 11 hypervariably spliced regions correspond to SLC4A9 amino acid positions 353 494 and 583 702 respectively It is intriguing that short amino terminal portions of both of these regions amino acids 353 383 and amino acids 583 631 are located in areas where the sequences of the paralogs are quite diverged Extensive alternative splicing in these areas has not been reported for the other paralogs Alternately used exon 10d contains an almost perfect 41 nucleotide polypyrimidine tract This region consists exclusively of Cs and Ts except for the A at position 110 655 of AC008438 1 It codes for FFSLLLFLTSFFF a highly hydrophobic stretch predicted by TMPRED to be within the sixth transmembrane domain of the protein Exon 10D is absent from three SLC4A9 cDNA isoforms Figure 1 whose ORFs are not disrupted except for the deletion of the 53 amino acids corresponding to this fragment TMPRED analysis suggests that absence of exon 10D abrogates the sixth transmembrane domain but does not affect the 11 remaining transmembrane segments Consequently isoforms lacking exon 10D would be predicted to have an extracellular carboxyl terminus The biological viability and function if any of such a protein cannot be known without biochemical analyses However the extracellular exposition of the normally hidden carboxyl terminus might be relevant to autoimmunity Dispersed paralogous gene clusters containing SLC4Agenes Four human SLC4A genes are each included in a conserved gene cluster Figure 4 On 5q31 SLC4A9 is located between genes encoding HEGFL and FGF1 Figure 4 The murine orthologs of HEGFL and FGF1 are in close proximity on mouse chromosome 18 suggesting that an as yet undescribed mouse ortholog of SLC4A9 may be located in the same region This putative mouse ortholog of SLC4A9 partly contained in the BAC clone RG MBAC_173P21 GenBank AC027276 has 82 96 similarity to the human gene over 1897 nucleotides Almost all exon boundaries are conserved between the coding portions of the mouse gene and SLC4A9 isoform I However exon 4 of human SLC4A9 does not appear in mouse Novel human SLC4A9 paralogs may be predicted on the basis of the genomic locations of the EGF FGF clusters The clusters in Figure 4that contain the members of at least two of the other three gene families may also contain yet uncharacterized SLC4A genes Only a deeper sequence coverage of human EST libraries and draft genomic sequences will help determine if this hypothesis is correct Ancient conserved paralogous clusters involving multiple functionally unrelated genes have been previously suggested to exist in the human genome 28 29 30 However the existence of some SLC4A genes outside conserved clusters suggests that intra cluster rearrangements may have led to the expulsion of these genes from the conserved clusters Yet other SLC4A duplication mechanisms may have complemented both the cluster duplication and the subsequent rearrangements Genomic implications of SLC4A9splicing and structure The genomic structure of SLC4A9 raises intriguing questions What properties are unique to tissue specific repeat expressing alternatively spliced genes Are introns containing repetitive elements spliced out more efficiently than introns without repeats as appears to be the case for SLC4A9 What spliceosomal properties are responsible for frequent unconventional processing in this case of four exons 8 10 11 and 20 How did the repetitive elements 3 of the coding region become incorporated into the splicing framework of the gene SLC4A9 is a case study in the complexities of splicing To identify such complexities automated computational approaches to analyzing the structures of novel genes will have to incorporate full length sequences of multiple long insert cDNA clones It is not known how many riddles similar to SLC4A9 there will be in the complete human genome sequence Their very existence suggests however that individually characterizing and understanding numerous unconventional genes will be a major challenge Materials and methods PCR based screening of cDNA libraries PCR with the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix was performed in 50 l volumes Undiluted library lysate 1 0 l to 5 0 l was used as template PCR conditions were as suggested by the manufacturer Clontech The vector specific 5 LDA or 3 LDA primers were the forward primers and the 5 directed primers oi E 6797up and 5219up see Table 1for complete primer listing designed from the 5 most known part of the cDNA were the reverse primers Because of the lack of a priori knowledge about the anticipated size of SLC4A9 PCR products if any in the product mixture TA cloning with the Original TA Cloning Kit and INVaF host Invitrogen was performed directly on fresh unpurified total PCR products Each unique TA clone defined by a combination of Unigene F R PCR product length and HinfIII restriction digest pattern was amplified with the Unigene primers and sequenced Hybridization screening of cDNA libraries A 345 bp portion in the 5 end of the insert of TA clone 3LD oiE TA 6 was amplified with primers 345F and 345R gel purified 32P labeled and used to probe first round filters of the adult kidney cDNA library in TripleX The filters were prehybridized for 1 5 h hybridized overnight at 62 5 C washed and exposed to Biomax MR film Kodak for 18 72 h at 80 C Cored plaques corresponding to positive clones were subjected to PCR as described below For clones consistently yielding a smear or multiple bands in vivo excision of the TripleX insert into a pTripleX plasmid using the Cre Lox system in a BM25 8 recombinase expressing host was conducted and plasmid minipreps Qiagen Spin Plasmid Kit were obtained for PCR and sequencing PCR on phage clones PCR with the Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix was performed in 50 l volumes using primer pairs 5 LDA 345R or 345F 3 LDA to amplify the entire insert as two overlapping products DNA sequencing All sequencing except SNP detection which is detailed below was done with the BigDye terminator sequencing kit PE Biosystems Foster City CA using LongRanger premixed gels FMC BioWhittaker on an Applied Biosystems 377 XL96 DNA sequencer SNP discovery M13 21F and M13 28R tagged primers were designed from intronic sequence to amplify every consensus exon of SLC4A9 plus at least 50 bp of the flanking introns After Sephacryl HR 500 purification amplicons were sequenced using the BigDye primer sequencing kit PE Biosystems SNPs were operationally defined as dual color peaks half the height of the surrounding peaks reproducible twice in both sequencing directions Northern blotting SLC4A9 expression was first assayed by hybridization of two gene specific probes separately to Clontech MTN blots I II and III The first probe was a mixture of the gel purified PCR amplified inserts of IMAGE clones 1533693 and 1734773 The second was the 345F 345R PCR fragment of TA clone 3LD oiE TA 6 For Figure 2 membranes were prehybridized for 1 h and hybridized for 4 h at 62 5 C in QuikHyb solution Stratagene Positive control hybridization of a human actin cDNA probe Clontech to MTN 1 and 2 Figure 2 confirmed the uniform loading of mRNA in each lane Sequence analysis WU BLAST 31 at EBI 32 and BLAST 2 0 31 at NCBI 33 were used to search public databases Other NCBI resources in particular Pairwise BLAST Entrez MapView and GeneMap 99 were used for the retrieval and analysis of sequence and map information pertaining to the genes whose structures and map positions are discussed in this report SeqHelp 1 0b 12 was used for all sequence annotation Protein feature display and alignments for Figure 3 and sequence preparation for Figures 1and 5 were performed with Vector NTI Suite 5 5 Informax Inc Phylogenetic analysis The longest complete protein sequence was retrieved from GenPept NCBI for each human gene included in the analysis The BLink feature of GenPept was then used to find nonhuman orthologs of each human EGF SLC4A and FGF gene under consideration and their longest sequences were retrieved as well Sequences were first autoaligned using the AlignX feature of Vector NTI Suite 5 5 Each alignment was manually edited to eliminate divergent amino and carboxy termini and orphan exon insertions and to maximize the number of identical and highly conserved consensus positions The manually edited alignments were exported to PHYLIP for distance calculation and tree construction Additional data files Additional data files available with the
