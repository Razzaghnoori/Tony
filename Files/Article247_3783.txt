 Nixon I Am Not an Anti Semite The National Archives latest release of Nixon White House tapes is as usual a bracing antidote to historical revisionism Whenever the academic world is tempted to adopt a more favorable view of Nixon s character new Nixon tapes always seem to appear that squelch the impulse To read Slate s David Greenberg on Nixon revisionists click here The theme of the latest release according to articles in yesterday s Washington Post and today s New York Times is Nixon s anti Semitism We already knew of course that Nixon had a pathological hatred of Jews Scroll down to the bottom of Deep Throat The Game Is Afoot to see Nixon s outrage on discovering that Mark Felt a high ranking FBI official believed by both Nixon and Chatterbox to have been Deep Throat is Jewish But even Chatterbox was taken aback at the virulence of some of Nixon s comments on the new tapes which sadly are not available either in audio or in transcript form on the Web The best Chatterbox can do is refer you to the quotations in the Post and Times stories which were based on the reporters own transcriptions Here s a fairly stunning snippet from George Lardner s Post piece Washington is full of Jews the president asserted Most Jews are disloyal He made exceptions for some of his top aides such as national security adviser Henry Kissinger his White House counsel Leonard Garment and one of his speechwriters William Safire and then added But Bob generally speaking you can t trust the bastards They turn on you Am I wrong or right Haldeman agreed wholeheartedly Their whole orientation is against you In this administration anyway And they are smart They have the ability to do what they want to do which is to hurt us And here s a similarly outrageous example from Irvin Molotsky s story in the Times The only two non Jews in the communist conspiracy Nixon said were Whittaker Chambers and Alger Hiss Many felt that Hiss was He could have been a half but he was not by religion The only two non Jews Every other one was a Jew And it raised hell with us Most stunning of all however was the Times assertion that the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda which purports to be a serious research institution issued a statement saying the President was not anti Semitic italics Chatterbox s Chatterbox always wary of paraphrase decided to take a closer look at the Nixon Library s statement which you can read by going to the Library Web site and clicking on The White House Tape Recordings February to July 1971 A Guide to the Major Themes and Personalities Actually the Nixon Library document nowhere says that Nixon was not anti Semitic The phrases anti Semite and anti Semitic don t appear in the Nixon Library document at all aside from this passage President Nixon after expressing the view that most Jewish Americans are insisting that the Administration go along with what he regards as Israeli intransigence on the Suez Canal and other Mideast peace issues while refusing to give him support on his Vietnam policy remarks If anybody who s been in this chair ever had reason to be anti Semitic italics Chatterbox s I did H R Haldeman replies That s for damn sure The President continues And I m not you know what I mean Accepted I m not pro Israel I m not going to let Israel s tail wag the dog However the overall thrust of the portion of the Nixon Library document that interprets Nixon s remarks on Jewish Americans is indeed to downplay Nixon s comic book anti Semitism As with his attitudes toward African Americans the President s words about the Jewish community on these tapes show that his basic sense of compassion and support for these communities tends to co exist with terminology from an earlier time An earlier time This was 1971 not 1917 Attitudes toward African Americans were appalling many would say they still are but attitudes toward Jews particularly in Washington were fairly benign The Nixon Library seems eager to blame Haldeman for egging Nixon on It should be noted that the President s comments regarding lack of political support for the Administration among many Jewish Americans frequently occur when Haldeman is present and that Haldeman is generally quick to note when some person who is the subject of adverse comment happens to be Jewish It should further be noted that Haldeman s eagerness to enable Nixon s Jew hating which may have stemmed from his tendency to pander to all of Nixon s worst instincts or may have reflected sincere anti Semitism of his own Chatterbox has no idea does nothing to mitigate the appalling bigotry of Nixon s comments The Nixon Library s gloss on Nixon s remarks about Jews ends by pointing out that despite Nixon s initial misgivings about appointing Herbert Stein to chair the Council on Economic Advisors Stein who prior to his recent death was a Slate contributor was also Jewish the President within months would make Stein his Chairman of the CEA just as he would give the Jewish state unequivocal life saving support in the 1973 Arab Israeli War The actions of the President as well as the substantial documentary record of the Nixon Administration should always be kept in mind when evaluating his words on the White House tapes Chatterbox won t dispute that this century has seen bigger anti Semites than Richard Nixon On the other hand Nixon s comments about Jews make say Pat Buchanan s seem comparatively benign This is not to excuse Buchanan who in the latest issue of George OK in a profile written by Chatterbox implores preposterously that if he were an anti Semite Would I have a Jewish doctor who deals with my heart Would I have a Jewish broker Chatterbox would think that part of the burden of working at the Nixon Library is conceding that Richard Nixon while no doubt misunderstood in many ways was one wicked anti Semite But a glance back at the Nixon Library s Web site reminds Chatterbox that for the Nixon Library the fundraising hence the need to downplay controversy never stops FOR YOUR NEXT SPECIAL EVENT CHOOSE THE NIXON LIBRARY reads the lettering on a faux campaign button Click it and you receive
