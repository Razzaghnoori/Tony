 Background Dimorphic sexes are the norm in animals although there are rotifer species that consist solely of parthenogenetic females 1 corals that produce long lived clones that reproduce by fragmentation 2 and some lizards and fish that spin off parthenogenetic lines that survive for multiple generations 3 Among the vast number of animal species that reproduce with males and females sexual differentiation is controlled either chromosomally or environmentally Flies and worms are among the invertebrates that determine sex by doses of X chromosomal information Within the vertebrates there are several mechanisms that account for sexually dimorphic development Because temperature controls sexual development in crocodiles many turtles and some lizards environmental sex determination ESD has been proposed to be the primordial vertebrate mechanism for sexual differentiation 4 Some reptiles and most birds and mammals have chromosomal sex determination CSD systems and these systems involve remarkably different chromosomes and genes 4 CSD strategies then may have evolved to program genetically the developmental routines that occur in response to temperature in the vertebrates that use ESD The natural history of vertebrates suggests that there were multiple solutions to the problem of CSD Nearly all mammals have the XX female and XY male system with XXY individuals being male and Xo individuals female These observations led to a search for the testis determining factor on the Y chromosome culminating in isolation of the SRY gene 5 which is sex determining in humans 6 7 and mice 8 Beyond SRY there are several autosomal genes including the SRY related SOX9 gene 9 10 MIS 11 12 SF1 13 WT1 14 and DMRT1 15 that contribute to sexual organ formation alterations of which can cause male to female sex reversal in XY males Because there are rodent species with no SRY gene and no Y chromosome 16 any of these genes or the X linked DAX1 gene 17 might be considered candidates for a sex determining gene in the XX rodents such as mole voles whose body plan is not so different from that of mice In birds males are the homogametic sex with two Z chromosomes and females the heterogametic sex with one Z and one W chromosome Z and W are not related to mammalian X or Y chromosomes and furthermore it is not known if the W chromosome confers femininity and or if doses of the Z chromosome confer masculinity 18 In mammals and invertebrates diploid animals of genotype Xo and XXY were crucial in establishing that doses of X confer femininity in invertebrates and that presence of Y confers masculinity in mammals Diploid birds with one or three sex chromosomes were last reported 70 years ago 19 but triploid birds with ZZZ and ZZW karyotypes have been observed While ZZZ triploids seemed like normal males that produced abnormal sperm ZZW animals appeared female on hatching and then developed some male gonadal and behavioral characteristics as they matured 20 These studies suggest that the dosage versus determining factor argument is a false dichotomy in birds doses of Z chromosome appear to masculinize while presence of the W appears to feminize According to theory a pair of autosomes can evolve into sex chromosomes by mutation of a control gene 4 If a control gene confers sexual development by dosage it might become lost from the alternative sex chromosome DMRT1 is a candidate dosage dependent gene for masculinity in birds and alligators on the basis of Z linkage 21 conservation and gene expression patterns 22 Alternatively if a control gene confers sexual development as a dominant determining factor it may have evolved as an allele of a gene on the opposite sex chromosome This latter mechanism is thought to relate SRY to the X linked SOX3 gene in mammals 23 Histidine triad HIT enzymes are a superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases that contain a catalytic motif related to the sequence His His His where represents a hydrophobic amino acid and act on substrates containing a nucleoside monophosphate 24 Branch 1 of the HIT superfamily includes the ubiquitous Hint enzymes 25 plus two enzymes with a more phylogenetically resstricted distribution namely Aprataxin which is lost in humans with ataxia oculomotor apraxia 26 27 and the scavenger mRNA decapping enzyme Dcps 28 29 While Dcps enzymes are specific for hydrolysis of cap structures such as 7meGpppG 28 29 prototypical Hint enzymes such as rabbit Hint and yeast Hnt1 hydrolyze adenosine 5 monophosphoramide substrates such as AMP lysine to AMP plus lysine 30 Loss of this enzymatic activity renders yeast cells temperature sensitive for growth on galactose medium and hypersensitive to mild mutations in the yeast homolog of mammalian Cdk7 that is Kin28 the kinase component of general transcription factor TFIIH 30 Loss of Hnt1 enzymatic activity also renders cells hypersensitive to mutations in the cyclin H homolog Ccl1 the MAT1 homolog Tfb3 and to Cak1 the activating kinase for Kin28 all of which lead to destabilized Kin28 complexes and a likely increase in concentration of Kin28 monomers 30 Consequently it was suggested that a Kin28 monomer is the likely target of Hint regulation potentially because it is post translationally adenylylated and is a protein substrate of the lysine deadenylylating activity of Hint 24 Indeed two dimensional electrophoretic analysis of Kin28 is consistent with Kin28 being subject to a post translational modification in addition to phosphorylation 31 32 that appears to be controlled by HNT1 genotype A Krakowiak and C B unpublished results Finally it is important to note that Hint is a dimer with two identical purine nucleoside monophosphate binding sites per dimer 25 The amino acid residues that have remained most constant throughout evolution are those that form the dimer interface and make direct contact with AMP 25 Chickens and many other orders of birds are dimorphic for HINT related genes on their sex chromosomes The chicken Z chromosome contains the locus for a typical HINT gene predicted to encode a polypeptide 83 identical to rabbit Hint 33 However on the gene poor female specific W chromosome the ASW avian sex specific W linked gene was identified 33 34 encoding a predicted Asw protein with striking similarity to Hint with the specific exception of residues involved in AMP recognition As shown in Figure 1 the degree to which the nucleotide binding site was altered is remarkable Although human biochemists can depress activity more than 10 5 fold in Fhit 35 36 and Hint 30 with a single active site His mutation hens apparently continued to peck at the sequence of Hint altering all four of the absolutely conserved His residues In all 15 of 16 normally conserved residues identified in immediate proximity to the adenine base the ribose and the 5 phosphate 25 are altered in Asw ASW is absent in the ratites emu and ostrich 34 which have indistinguishable sex chromosomes but is tandemly repeated approximately 40 times on the W chromosome of all the non ratite birds examined 33 Confirming the subtractive manner in which ASW was cloned both groups found that ASW mRNA is highly expressed in the female urogenital ridge at the stages preceding and during sexual differentiation 33 34 Additionally HINT mRNA is expressed at levels about two fold greater in males than in females in developing chicks more than in adult chickens and at a message level one seventh to one tenth the level of ASW in stage 29 females 33 ASW was cloned a third time as a message that is increased in cells lacking the splicing factor ASF SF2 37 Surprisingly ASF SF2 did not affect splicing of the ASW message but rather destabilized the mRNA 37 Involvement of ASF SF2 in the regulation of ASW mRNA is interesting because sex specific splicing of doublesex mRNA in Drosophila a sex determining gene for which the mammalian DMRT genes were named is mediated in part by ASF SF2 38 Although the initial cloning of ASW pre dated knowledge that Hint is an enzyme both groups suggested that Asw might function by a dominant negative mechanism through heterodimerization with Hint thereby inducing female development 33 34 Heterodimerization was also discussed in the review literature 18 also without awareness that Hint function depends on enzymatic activity 30 Results and discussion Genomic and expression data suggest that the purpose of Asw is titration of Hint function How might this work In the simplest case a normally dimeric enzyme with two active sites that is produced as a heterodimer with one good and one bad active site would be expected to have 50 of the specific activity of the homodimer This is not a scenario for dominant negativity and in fact such a scenario does not explain why Asw is produced at all If Asw were simply an inert dimerization partner for Hint a 50 reduction in Hint cellular specific activity could be obtained if there were no ASW genes on the W chromosome Males would have two doses of HINT and females one dose such that twice as much Hint dimer could be made in males as in females Furthermore if ASW were simply a loss of function allele given the paucity of genes on the W chromosome sex chromosome theory 4 suggests that such a gene would be lost The repeated and highly expressed nature of the gene suggests that it has evolved to be dominantly interfering the challenge is to determine the mechanism of dominance over the Z encoded HINT One might expect a Hint Asw heterodimer to have substantially less than 50 of the activity of a Hint homodimer if Hint homodimers showed cooperativity with respect to substrate binding and or hydrolysis For example if the first nucleotide substrate were to bind weakly but the presence of the first bound substrate promoted efficient binding of a second substrate then a heterodimer containing one functional and one nonfunctional active site would retain only one low affinity binding site and be severely defective This mechanism can be largely excluded however because sigmoidal substrate saturation kinetics were not observed with AMP NH 2 30 The data for both rabbit and yeast Hint enzymes indicate that the dimer s two crystallographically defined nucleotide binding sites 25 bind nucleotide independently and fit well to a single submicromolar K m for each enzyme Figure 2 30 As cooperativity is difficult to invoke in this system we consider that for Asw to titrate Hint enzyme activity by heterodimerization Asw must carry a signal for mislocalization and or proteolysis and or somehow alter the Hint active site We therefore constructed a molecular model of the proposed Hint Asw heterodimer by superimposing the chicken Hint sequence on the determined X ray structure of rabbit Hint and threading and minimizing the Asw sequence on the opposing monomer This analysis suggested first that Hint and Asw do retain sufficient sequence identity at the dimer interface to form a heterodimer second that Asw has an insertion sequence at the bottom of the dimer that could be a site of alternative localization or proteolysis and third that Gln127 a residue that Asw has substituted for Trp123 of Hint may interfere with the function of His114 in Hint across the dimer interface Although altered specificity of a putative Hint Asw heterodimer is conceivable the simplest enzymatic mechanism for dominant interference is that Gln127 from Asw depresses activity from the Hint active site The dimer interface of Hint is formed by antiparallel interactions between helix 2 and its symmetry mate and strand 4 and its symmetry mate 25 These sequences are contiguous in the primary sequence of Hint and form the region of greatest identity with Asw Figure 1 Apart from the curious substitution of 15 of 16 nucleotide proximal residues in Asw the most dissimilar region of Asw consists of a five amino acid insertion between strands 1 and 2 and substitution of Gly Ala Pro Asw for Asp Glu Ser Hint at the amino terminal end of helix 2 Both these changes are located on the bottom surface of the dimer 25 The bulky amino acids in the Asw insertion Pro Leu Trp Thr Arg which in Hint is an extremely tight turn may be a handle for altered localization or proteolysis Cellular localization of green fluorescent protein GFP fusions to Hint and Asw was investigated in male chick embryo fibroblasts 33 GFP Hint was found to be distributed in the cytoplasm and the nuclei though somewhat concentrated in the nuclei with respect to the GFP control 33 GFP Asw was found to be essentially confined to nuclei 33 Though localization of Hint in Asw overexpressing cells was not examined if Hint has extranuclear that is Cdk7 exclusive functions then excluding Hint from the cytoplasm may be an important function of Asw The crystal structure of nucleotide bound forms of rabbit Hint showed that the carboxy terminal amino acids of each Hint monomer extend across the dimer interface and are buried near the opposing nucleotide The Trp residue in the extreme carboxy terminal Trp Pro Pro Gly motif is buried near His114 the final His of the HIT motif of the opposing monomer 25 His114 corresponds to His98 of Fhit which was localized in low barrier hydrogen bonding distance to the bridging oxygen of a bound ApppA analog in co crystal structure with Fhit His96Asn 35 On the basis of mutagenesis of the conserved His residues in Fhit 39 and the location of these His residues in crystal structures of Hint and Fhit 25 35 a catalytic role was proposed for His114 24 The structures show that His51 is in the same plane as His114 with the N of His 51 positioned to accept a hydrogen bond from the N of His114 This geometry was considered critical for the enzymatic activity of Hint and Fhit As shown in Figure 1 Asw sequences contain a substitution of Gln127 for Trp123 of Hint As shown in Figure 3 Gln127 of Asw is predicted to alter the conformation of Hint His114 such that His114 is not positioned for productive hydrogen bonding dominantly depressing hydrolase activity from the Hint active site In short loss of the AMP binding site is predicted to account for negativity of Asw Gln127 and possibly insertion sequences that may have a role in stability or localization are predicted to make Asw dominant Conclusions Identification of sex linked ASW and HINT genes in birds has raised new experimental questions It will be interesting to learn whether Asw and Hint heteromultimerize and what the in vitro and in vivo stabilities of heterooligomers are with respect to the homodimers It will be interesting to determine whether Asw homodimers display any binding to Hint substrates what degree of Hint enzyme activity is retained by the putative Hint Asw heterodimer and whether Gln127 is required for depression of Hint enzymatic activity in Hint Asw heterodimers Turning to genetic analysis if ASW has a significant role in feminization of birds then viruses that increase expression of Asw may promote female development in ZZ eggs potentially in a manner that requires Gln127 If HINT is part of the Z chromosome that works by gene dosage then viruses that direct expression of Hint may promote male or intersexual development in ZW eggs as was seen with ZZW triploids 20 Finally if it is true that Hint enzyme activity is important in making ZZ chicks male or if Hint inhibition is important in making ZW chicks female then it will be interesting to learn whether Hint is involved in establishment or maintenance of sex in other animals
