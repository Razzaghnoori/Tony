title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration entitled Regulations Restricting the Sale and Distribution of Cigarettes and Smokeless Tobacco to Protect Children and Adolescents RIN 0910 AA48 We received the rule on August 26 1996 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on August 28 1996 61 Fed Reg 44395 The rule prohibits the sale of nicotine containing cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to individuals under the age of 18 requires manufacturers distributors and retailers

the advertising and labeling to which children and adolescents are exposed prohibits promotional non tobacco items such as hats and tee shirts prohibits sponsorship of GAO OGC 96 38 sporting and other events teams and entries in the brand name of tobacco products and requires manufacturers to provide intended use information on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco product labels and in cigarette advertising The rule is predicated on the Food and Drug Administration s assertion of jurisdiction under the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act over cigarettes and smokeless tobacco as delivery devices for nicotine The lengthy jurisdictional determination was published in the Federal Register on August 28 1996 as an annex to the final rule The rule will become effective 1 year from the date of publication in the Federal Register except that the prohibition regarding sale to any person younger than 18 years of age and the requirement for photographic identification to verify the age of

ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED REGULATIONS RESTRICTING THE SALE AND DISTRIBUTION OF CIGARETTES AND SMOKELESS TOBACCO TO PROTECT CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS RIN 0910 AA48 i Cost benefit analysis An analysis of the costs and benefits of the rule was conducted by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and published in the notice of proposed rulemaking on August 11 1995 and is contained in the preamble to the final rule The analysis in the final rule has been revised based on comments the FDA received and now also considers the costs and benefits associated with a rule issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration SAMHSA on January 19 1996 governing a program of State operated enforcement activities to restrict the sale or distribution of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18 FDA considers the two rules complementary and cannot separately quantify the benefits of the two programs and since both rules work collectively to reduce youth access to tobacco products the costs attributable to the SAMHSA program are included in the analysis The analysis based its benefits on achieving the Healthy People 2000 a Department program goal of reducing underage tobacco use by one half in order to prevent over 60 000 early deaths The analysis places a monetary value of these health benefits at a 3 percent discount rate at an estimated 28 to 43 billion per year including 2 6 billion in medical cost savings 900 million in productivity gains from reduced morbidity and 24 6 to 39 7 billion per year in willingness to pay values for averting premature fatalities The analysis states that if the 50 percent reduction in underage tobacco use is not reached and only 5 percent of the 1 million adolescents who become new smokers are deterred the annual benefits would be 2 8 to 4 3 billion per year FDA estimates the overall compliance costs of the rule to be from 174 million to 187 million in one time costs and 149 million to 185 million in annual operating costs These costs will be borne by manufacturers 78 to 91 million in one time costs and 2 million in annual costs retail establishments 96 million in one time costs and 78 million in annual costs FDA 3 to 5 million in enforcement costs per year and State governments 25 to 50 million per year in administering various SAMHSA enforcement programs GAO OGC 96 38 FDA recognizes that it could not quantify every regulatory cost because of significant distributional and transitional effects of the rule For example lost sales experienced by suppliers of advertising were considered distributional impacts because the dollars not spent on advertising are not lost to the economy but will be spent on other goods and services Also if State and Federal excise taxes remain at the current levels tax revenues will decrease over time because of decreased sales In conclusion the analysis finds that while compliance with the rule will bring significant health benefits to the population and also exact long term revenue losses on the tobacco industry and short term costs on various affiliated industry sectors the benefits of the rule will greatly exceed the compliance costs on the United States economy ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The FDA has concluded that the rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and an initial regulatory flexibility analysis and final regulatory flexibility analysis have been prepared and included in the notice of proposed rulemaking and the final rule notice respectively as required by sections 603 and 604 The analyses comply with the informational requirements of the sections including the classes of small entities subject to the rule and alternatives considered to reduce the burden on the small entities The final analysis discusses the FDA s decision not to exempt small entities from the rule because an exemption for small retailers would shift underage sales to those locations lessening or eliminating the effectiveness and benefits of the access restrictions However a total ban on vending machines and direct mail order sales have been deleted from the final rule because of their impact on small entities The analyses use both quantifiable and general descriptions of the effects of the rule on small entities as required by section 607 and numerous small entities participated in the rulemaking as required by section 609 by submitting comments on the proposed regulation following the inclusion in the notice of proposed rulemaking of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis which discussed the economic impact on small entities Page 2 GAO OGC 96 38 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 Based on the cost benefit analysis performed by FDA the rule will impose an unfunded mandate on the private sector of over 100 million annually and therefore the rule is subject to the requirements of the Act As required by section 205 FDA considered regulatory alternatives to the requirements of the rule but determined that the provisions of the final rule constituted the most cost effective and least burdensome alternative that would meet the objective of the rule The FDA rejected the regulatory alternative of a total ban on all tobacco advertising Also a more prescriptive requirement for manufacturers to monitor the sales and distribution of retail establishments was not imposed because it would have imposed an additional cost of 85 million per year Finally a requirement to include package inserts containing educational information in cigarette and smokeless tobacco was not chosen because the FDA was not certain the benefits would justify the compliance costs Section 204 requires that State local and tribal governments have an opportunity for input and numerous comments were received from State and local governments health departments substance abuse programs and law enforcement agencies These comments were reviewed and considered as discussed in the preamble to the final rule iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts and Executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq The FDA promulgated the rule under the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 and its own agency regulation regarding the promulgation of regulations found at section 10 40 of Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations On August 11 1995 the proposed rule was published in the Federal Register 60 Fed Reg 41314 and in the same issue a document entitled Analysis Regarding The Food And Drug Administration s Jurisdiction Over Nicotine Containing Cigarettes And Smokeless Tobacco Products was published and comments were requested 60 Fed Reg 41453 The comment period following an extension remained open for 144 days In the months that followed the publication of the proposed rule and during the comment period the FDA made available to the public over 200 000 pages of documents which were cited by the agency or considered in the promulgation of the rule Page 3 GAO OGC 96 38 The FDA received over 700 000 comments in response to the proposed rule While the FDA reports many of the comments were form letters there were over 95 000 distinct or unique comments filed with the FDA The preamble to the final rule discusses many of the comments received and the action taken by the agency in response or why the comments did not change the agency s position Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The proposed rule contained information collections which would have required the manufacturers and retailers of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco to use established names for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products establish and maintain educational programs observe certain formats and content requirements for labeling and advertising and the submission of labels labeling and advertising to the FDA The FDA solicited comments on the above information collections including among other information the necessity of the collection the accuracy of the estimated burden and ways to enhance the information collection Following the receipt and evaluation of the comments the FDA has revised certain burden estimates and has deleted the requirement for the submission of labeling to the FDA and the establishment of educational programs The information collections in the proposed rule were approved by the Office of Management and Budget under OMB No 0910 0312 Because of the above noted changes to the collections FDA has resubmitted the matter to OMB for review and approval and prior to the effective date of the rule FDA will publish a notice in the Federal Register of OMB s action on the provisions Statutory authorization for the rule The FDA has cited sections 502 510 518 519 520 701 704 and 903 of the Federal Food Drug and Cosmetic Act 21 U S C 352 360 360h 360i 360j 371 374 and 393 as authority for the rule and in particular the device provisions of the Act including the restricted device authority in section 520 e of the Act 21 U S C 360j e Executive Order No 12866 The rule was determined to be a significant regulatory action under Executive Order No 12866 requiring review by the Office of Management and Budget Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs OIRA OIRA approved the final rule on August 22 1996 as complying with the requirements of the Order based on the information supplied by FDA including a planned regulatory action document Page 4 GAO OGC 96 38 describing the reason for the rule and an assessment of the costs and budgetary impact of the rule Executive Order No 12606 Family FDA considered whether the rule would have a significant impact on family formation maintenance and general well being as required by the Order and found that the rule would not have a negative impact in these areas In the preamble to the proposed rule it was noted that the rule would help the significant majority of families that seek to discourage their children from using cigarettes and smokeless tobacco 60 Fed Reg 41356 FDA responds in the preamble to the final rule to several comments it received and maintains its conclusion that the rule does not have a negative impact Executive Order No 12612 Federalism The rule was reviewed by the FDA under the Order which requires Federal agencies to examine regulatory actions to determine if they have a significant impact on the States on the relationship between the States and the Federal government and on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government In the preamble to the final rule the FDA addresses the various issues raised by commenters in this area including the preemption of State and local laws which are different from or in addition to the requirements under the final rule whether there is an infringement on the States right to regulate tobacco and businesses within the State and protect the health of its citizens the allocation of a State s resources and the rule s possible impact on the States economies The FDA concludes that the preemptive effects of the final rule are consistent with the Order Executive Order No 12630 Property Rights The FDA reviewed the rule under the Order and concluded that the affect of the final rule would not constitute a taking of private property The preamble to the final rule discusses issues raised by various commenters in the areas of the use of self service displays vending machines restrictions on sponsorship of events except in the corporate name and loss of employment and maintains its conclusion that there would be no taking under the Order The FDA s position is that reductions in personal property s value even prohibitions on all economically viable uses and financial expenditures to comply with a regulatory requirement do not necessarily establish a taking citing various court decisions for support The FDA did not identify any other statute or executive order imposing procedural requirements relevant to the rule Page 5 GAO OGC 96 38
