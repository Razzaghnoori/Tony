 Reich Redux Granted Robert Reich s isn t the very first name that comes to mind these days when you think about political figures in trouble over twisting the truth But if there ever was a moment that showed the importance of finding the fine line between spinning the facts and dispensing with them this is it For an object lesson in the difference consider Reich redux Last year Slate reported that in parts of Locked in the Cabinet his memoir of his term as labor secretary Reich fabricated quotations and distorted events Moreover the changes appear to have been systematic rather than random crafted to create Hollywood style set pieces in which Reich was the embattled decent man who was savaged by ruthless journalists politicians lobbyists and other Beltway vermin Click here to read the original story The real people for whom nasty lines had been constructed were not amused Reich replied that his book was faithful to his experience as he remembered it that the media were unfairly attacking him yet again that the discrepancies were minor and that he would correct them in a future edition Now the new edition is here in the form of a paperback with revisions and a new introduction In this new introduction Reich again portrays his variances with reality as mere memory slips Memory is fallible he writes Where I have subsequently learned of errors or misinterpretations I have made changes in this edition In no instance however are the changes of material importance to the story I relate The book s disputed passages come in three broad types First denied quotations In his new introduction Reich says You are duly warned had you not assumed it already that most of the quotes in this book should be considered paraphrases rather than verbatim accounts as is often true of memoirs But many of the people Reich quotes have denied the substance as well as the precise wording of the quotations ascribed them Rep Martin Olav Sabo D Minn denied that he had said the following of his fellow Democrats We re owned by them Business Former House Republican leader Robert Michel denied that he had told Reich that Newt Gingrich and friends were out to destroy They ll try to destroy anything that gets in their way And so on In the new edition Reich has not changed these disputed quotations You just have to decide whom you believe The second sort of dispute involves Reich s interpretations and characterizations of events and or people Lane Kirkland the former president of the AFL CIO comes in for rough treatment in Reich s book and he wrote a bitter letter complaining about it He especially objected to an account of a dinner party at his house at which his wife Ilena according to Reich exclaims in horror and the whole table falls silent when Reich puncture s the evening s high society ambiance by mistaking mint jelly for sauce The new version makes some small but revealing changes in the party scene Some characters who Lane Kirkland said had been fabricated have been removed Ilena Kirkland still exclaims No as Reich makes for the mint jelly But she is now a solicitous hostess rather than a tactless snob She is apparently concerned that I will embarrass myself That s nicer The scene has been subjectified too In the original Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan was appalled like the rest Now I imagine he is appalled like the rest Before various people stare at me silently Now I feel as if everyone is staring at me No one can dispute that Reich felt and imagined what he says he felt and imagined But the moral is the same I might as well have farted The Star Spangled Banner Sam s right Washington sucks Again readers need to decide for themselves how likely it is that a Cabinet officer would bring a Washington dinner party to a mortified standstill by mistaking jelly for sauce The final most striking category of discrepancy involves public events where official records exist and flatly contradict Reich In one such case a presidential press conference at which reporters supposedly bombard him and President Clinton with nasty questions none of which appears in the White House transcript the actual questions were quite pedestrian he makes no changes Much more interesting however are two episodes that Reich has overhauled In one of them a congressional hearing on the minimum wage becomes an attack ad as Rep Jim Saxton R N J jumps up and down in his chair like a schoolboy and crudely berates Reich while a bread and circuses audience laughs and applauds In fact most of the spoken lines attributed to Saxton were made up the real hearing was dully decorous and as far as I could tell from the videotapes the audience was politely catatonic In the new version Reich sticks to the transcript and accurately quotes Saxton droning on at length about studies and Godfather s Pizza Saxton s statement is partisan but monotonously real and Reich s complaint is not that he was attacked but that he had no real chance of getting a hearing at this hearing He still exaggerates the hostility displayed and says that Saxton won t let me answer when in fact Reich s chief economist is later allowed to deliver a lecture length reply To compare Reich s new version with the original click But this time he gets the Washington story basically right The point of most Washington hearings for all concerned including Cabinet secretaries is not to listen and learn but to talk and score points In real hearings adversaries brandish impressive sounding studies and tell sob stories rather than making buffoonish personal attacks In the original book one of the most striking incidents involves Reich s talk before a roomful of National Association of Manufacturers executives and lobbyists allegedly all male and smoking cigars straight from central casting In the original Reich is set up by his host and then ambushed by a hostile questioner named John and when he tries to answer with an eloquent Mr Smith speech My fist is clenched Sure you and your shareholders have done fine But what about your workers he is drowned out with boos and hisses At one point the room erupts in cries of Bullshit and Go back to Harvard For anyone who knows Washington the idea that a roomful of slick corporate lobbyists would treat a sitting labor secretary this way is preposterous And they didn t of course In his revision Reich gets rid of the cigar shtick and again substitutes actual words while trying to preserve what he can of a sense of hostility John s pedantic speech is quoted accurately but characterized as a tirade and Reich s answer is given as the mumbling equivocation that it actually was John I will get back to you with all the information on it That was the information I have You have different information Instead of boos and shouts we have only I hear hisses from several locations Well we cannot dispute that he thought he heard hisses though the transcript reports and the transcriber remembers only scattered applause and laughter Here again the new scene has been spun rather than fabricated The level of hostility has been exaggerated but through it the real Washington rather than a screenwriter s fantasy is recognizable Click to compare the new and old versions In both revised scenes Washington is still a nasty place and Reich still shines as a perennially beset paragon of decency But the issues are of interpretation not falsification Locked in the Cabinet itself makes some shrewd and unflattering comments about the Washington games of spinning and posturing Reich portrays himself as an innocent who knows little of such things But in fact both as labor secretary and as memoirist he plays the game as well as the next fellow The next fellow his old boss should read this new edition attentively For the president however it may be too late to revise If you missed our link to Jonathan Rauch s original story in Slate click here And compare the old and new versions of two incidents that Reich retools the on the minimum wage and the with National Association of Manufacturers execs
