 Flesh and Bone D W Griffith raised crosscutting to an art in his racist 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation in which he jumped back and forth between renegade Negroes preparing to ravish a white maiden and Ku Klux Klanners galloping chivalrously to her aid In True Crime director Clint Eastwood demonstrates at once how far the medium has come in terms of race and how far it has backslid artistically to about 1910 As a white journalist played by Eastwood hastens to save an innocent black man Isaiah Washington from execution for the murder of a pregnant white convenience store cashier Eastwood cuts from the reporter s car careening around hairpin curves to poison bearing tubes being inserted into the black man s veins screeching car needle in vein screeching car poison descending the tube screeching car clock going tick tick tick glazed expression on the dying man s face screeech Not even Robert Altman who parodied this sort of climax in The Player was cynical enough to let his sellout filmmaker play the intravenous card Melodramas like True Crime are all pretty much hustles but the good ones are stylish enough to make you love the old song and dance This one tends toward unlovably brazen pokes and shoves yet there are moments mostly in the script when a higher sensibility can be glimpsed through all the galumphing crumminess The film s most emblematic character is a beggar who trails people outside the offices of the Oakland Tribune yelling Gimme pussy on toast or Gimme money on toast True Crime gives you sleaze on toast a heap of tabloid bathos a dusting of high mindedness a dash of gallows humor It s a bizarre concoction but it s riveting and I use that term advisedly in the sense of a hack em up serial killer riveting somebody s head to the side of a door The film presents Eastwood as Steve Everett a philandering ex alcoholic with I swear that the movie exhumes this phrase a nose for truth After a young female reporter whom Everett has plied with drink crashes her car on something called Dead Man s Curve the former New York hotshot is forced to fill in at a human interest interview with Frank Beachum Washington a mere eight hours before his scheduled San Quentin demise That s the cue for what in movies is called a conversion narrative in which a heretofore lost soul pursues a seemingly lost cause and inevitably finds redemption The script credited to Larry Gross Paul Brickman and Stephen Schiff from a potboiler by Andrew Klavan is often laughably schematic but much of what s outside its ramrod narrative is masterfully orchestrated the physical exam on Beachum that begins the film he s in perfect health to be killed the meetings between the warden and his guards on execution procedure the testing of the different colored phones one connected to the governor s office outside the lethal injection chamber The raunchy patter between Eastwood and James Woods as his editor in chief might have made for classic scenes if the former had known how to rein in the latter Woods has ballooned into such a self congratulatory grotesque that he now upstages his own blowhard characters Two funny affecting sequences exploit every father s pained awareness of his daughter s unmet needs In one the besieged Everett is obliged to take his little girl to the zoo so he stuffs her into a cart and races past the animals Speed Zoo while hollering out their names at once thrilling the child and endangering her life In the other Beachum s daughter visiting for the last time loses a green crayon she needs to draw grass and her mounting hysteria conveys her grief at the loss of her daddy more eloquently than any direct expression ever could The scene s punch line the prison guards comb the parking lot for the crayon might be the best most irrationally moving moment in the movie Unless that moment is Everett s retort to Beachum s wife Lisa Gay Hamilton who cries out angrily as if confronting a wayward savior Where were you all this time Shrugs the journalist by way of expiation It wasn t my story That the actor has condemned so many killers to death with his 44 caliber Magnum gives the liberal thrust of True Crime a certain piquancy Only Eastwood can go to San Quentin But is he plausibly cast as a journalist As the taciturn protagonist of vigilante pictures Eastwood could be a hoot and his struggle to articulate something clearly beyond his range resulted in the one true multidimensional performance of his career the aging Secret Service agent of In The Line of Fire 1993 But this is not a man who strikes me either in interviews or on the big screen as being at home with words His comic acting style is based on a gunfighter s paranoia on letting others speak and draw first the verbal forwardness of Everett sits uneasily on his 68 year old frame In any case it has become painful to listen to Eastwood talk That voice which never had much timbre has grown so raspy that you can practically see the flakes of his vocal cords swirling around his head like dandruff That s not an appetizing image but I m preparing you for Ravenous the cannibal saga I predict will elicit the most derisive reviews of any film this year I d like to recommend it but it s too silly On the plus side it s ravishingly well directed by Antonia Bird Priest 1995 who reportedly came on board two weeks after shooting had commenced and as such had little say about the thrust of the script She could not alter the coven of frontier cannibals to say lapsed Catholic priests although I bet that the idea crossed her mind Even so the first half of Ravenous is tantalizingly scary A captain Boyd Guy Pearce of L A Confidential 1997 is decorated for heroism in the Spanish American War and then exiled to an isolated fort high in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California a seemingly godforsaken place where at least in winter the only passers by are starving wagon trainers Why exile a hero It seems that he initially played dead in the heat of battle then awoke to find himself lodged under a messy corpse the blood from which was running into his mouth Invigorated la Popeye the Sailor Man he proceeded to capture the enemy regiment single handedly Not a man you d want to have hovering around your mess hall Bird and her cinematographer Anthony B Richmond create a world of blinding white peaks and deep black crevices in which demons might lodge a world of humans driven batty from fear and isolation where reaching out to other people sometimes takes the form of ingesting them The metaphor would be better if left suggestive if the strange new appetites were somehow the product of anxieties associated with American westward expansionism and Manifest Destiny But the second half of Ravenous is almost literally a dumb vampire picture in which the chief vampire woos a reluctant half vampire who has pangs of conscience about cooking and eating his fellow man Join us You know you want to etc By all means see Ravenous if your taste runs to bloody cannibal pictures I found it less of a gross out than say You ve Got Mail which would have benefited from a touch of flesh eating Although Pearce brings little to the party but his cheekbones Jeffrey Jones makes a wonderfully mordant fort commander and Robert Carlyle who pops up out of the wilderness with burning eyes and a tale of having been forced to cook and eat his horses dogs and traveling companions might turn out to be a major actor Carlyle looks like just the sort of fellow who d think it his duty to explore things that the rest of us deep down want to know about but wouldn t dream of investigating ourselves He s someone you could actually imagine taking aside and asking Er Robert tell me does it really taste like pork
