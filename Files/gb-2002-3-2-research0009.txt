 Background The pattern of genes expressed in a cell can provide important information about the cell state DNA microarray technology can measure the expression of thousands of genes in a biological sample DNA microarrays have been increasingly used in the last few years and have the potential to help advance our biological knowledge at a genomic scale 1 2 In analyzing DNA microarray gene expression data a major role has been played by various cluster analysis techniques most notably by hierarchical clustering 3 K means clustering 4 and self organizing maps 5 These clustering techniques contribute significantly to our understanding of the underlying biological phenomena A recent review of various methods is provided by Tibshirani et al 6 However many methods including the three mentioned above have some restrictions one of which is their inability to determine the number of clusters The difficulty may be related to the fact that in many methods there is no clear definition of what a cluster is in the first place Furthermore their clustering results may not be stable 7 8 An important clustering technique that improves on and or provides alternative solutions to these issues is model based clustering see for example 9 It has a clear definition that a cluster is a subpopulation with a certain distribution and several statistical methods can be applied to estimate the number of clusters Some authors have considered its application to cluster gene expression patterns 10 11 12 Here we consider the use of model based clustering in the context of detecting differentially expressed genes which is to identify all the genes with altered expression under two experimental conditions for example normal cells versus cancer cells We note that the goal here is different from that of clustering gene expression patterns as done by other researchers in using model based clustering In modeling differential expression levels of genes it is natural to assume that genes are from two subpopulations one with constant and another with changed expression levels Hence a two component mixture is a reasonable model This is the approach proposed by Lee et al 13 where it is assumed that each of the two components has a normal in the statistical sense distribution However in general each component does not necessarily have a normal distribution It is well known that many distributions can be well approximated by a finite mixture of normal distributions Hence the normal mixture model based clustering can be regarded as a more general and flexible approach along these lines and we pursue this approach here In particular we summarize a possible change of expression of a gene using a t statistic which automatically accounts for differential variations of expression levels across genes Then we apply model based clustering to these t statistics to exploit which genes have differential expression levels The methodology is illustrated with an application to a dataset containing the expression levels of 1 176 genes of normal rats and those with pneumococcal middle ear infection Results and discussion Data and preprocessing Pneumococcal otitis media is one of the most common diseases in children Almost every child in the United States experiences at least one episode of acute otitis media by the age of 5 years To understand the pathogenesis of otitis media it is important to identify genes involved in response to pneumococcal middle ear infection and to study their roles in otitis media A study was recently carried out at the University of Minnesota applying radioactively labeled cDNA microarrays 14 to the mRNA analysis of 1 176 genes in middle ear mucosa of rats with and without subacute pneumococcal middle ear infection It consisted of six experiments two cDNA microarrays were run with controls while four were run with pneumococcal middle ear infection We first take a natural logarithm transformation for all the observed gene expression levels so that they are more likely to have a normal distribution which will reduce the number of clusters found in a model based clustering The histograms of gene expression levels before and after log transformation for the first experiment are shown in Figure 1 It can be seen that the log transformation reduces the skewness of the distribution of gene expression levels After taking log transformation for each experiment we then standardize the transformed gene expression levels by subtracting their median value The above standardization is based on the assumption that most genes at least a half will not be expressed The median is used because it is more robust against outliers than is the more commonly used mean We use x ij to denote the resulting expression level of gene i from experiment j Note that the first two experiments that is j 1 and 2 were conducted using control rats whereas the last four that is j 3 4 5 6 using infected rats Some scatterplots showing comparisons between experiments are presented in Figure 2 It can be seen that in general there is a good agreement as well as some variation between the experiments under the same condition that is either within the control group or within the infected group It appears that expression of some genes are altered with pneumococcal infection On the basis of the above observation we calculate the following two sample t statistic for each gene as its measure of possible differential expression where for i 1 1176 The numerator of y i is the difference of average gene expression levels under the two conditions infected versus control whereas the denominator is the sample standard error of the numerator and serves to standardize the observed difference by penalizing those with large and thus less reliable variations Previous studies have found evidence that genes may have differential variability of expression levels 15 16 17 Note that although the t statistic is constructed we shall not conduct t tests because there is no evidence to support the questionable normality assumption required by the t test We also do not carry out permutation or other nonparametric tests 18 because of the small sample size that is 2 4 This is also related with the fact that there exists the problem of multiple comparisons if we test gene by gene 18 Our goal here is to apply model based cluster analysis to the preprocessed relative gene expression levels y i i 1 1176 and see which genes will have relative levels far away from the majority Model based clustering Finite mixtures of distributions provide a flexible as well as rigorous approach to modeling various random phenomena for example 19 For continuous data such as gene expression data the use of normal components in the mixture distribution is natural With a normal mixture model based approach to clustering it is assumed that the data to be clustered are from several subpopulations or clusters or components with distinguished normal distributions That is each data point y is taken to be a realization from a normal mixture distribution with the probability density function where y i V i denotes the normal density function with mean i and co variance matrix V i and i s are mixing proportions We use g to represent all unknown parameters i i V i i 1 g in a g component or g cluster mixture model In model based clustering first the above mixture model is fitted to the data and obtain the maximum likelihood estimate g Second the posterior probabilities of each data point belonging to each of the g normal components can be calculated Finally each data point is assigned to the component with the largest posterior probability We review the major steps in the following The mixture model is typically fitted by maximum likelihood using the expectation maximization EM algorithm 20 Given n observations y 1 y n we want to maximize the log likelihood to obtain the maximum likelihood estimate g The EM algorithm computes g by iterating the following steps Suppose that at the k th iteration the parameter estimates are i k s i k s and V i k s Then in the k 1 th iteration the estimates are updated by for i 1 g where is the posterior probability that y j belongs to the i th component of the mixture using the current parameter estimate for g for i 1 g and j 1 n At convergence we obtain g as the maximum likelihood estimate As local maxima can be found by the EM algorithm it is desirable to run the algorithm multiple times with various starting values and choose the estimate as the one resulting in the largest log likelihood One interesting but difficult problem in cluster analysis is to determine the number of components g In contrast to many other approaches that fail to accomplish this goal model based clustering provides several useful and objective selection criteria which have been used in other model selection problems The best known are the Akaike Information Criterion AIC 21 and the Bayesian Information Criterion BIC 22 where v g is the number of independent parameters in g In using the AIC or BIC one first fits series of models with various values of g then one picks up the g with the smallest AIC or BIC In many studies related to model selection it is found that AIC may select too large a model whereas BIC may select too small a model This phenomenon appears to hold in selecting g in the mixture analysis 23 Some other criteria have been studied but there does not seem to be a clear winner 23 Banfield and Raftery 24 proposed using approximate weight of evidence as an approximate Bayesian model selection criterion Some empirical studies seem to favor the use of BIC 25 We feel that a combined use of AIC and BIC is helpful at least in providing a range of reasonable values of g A different approach to selecting g is through hypothesis testing This could be done through the use of the log likelihood ratio test LRT to test for the null hypothesis H 0 g g 0 against the alternative H 1 g g 0 1 for any given positive integer g 0 The LRT statistic is 2 log L 0 1 2 log L 0 which however does not have the usual asymptotically chi squared distribution as a result of violation of required regularity conditions for example the maximum likelihood estimate may lie in the boundary of its parameter space McLachlan 26 proposed using the bootstrap to approximate the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null hypothesis On the basis of the resulting p value one can decide whether to reject H 0 Implementation McLachlan et al 27 have implemented model based clustering in a stand alone Fortran program called EMMIX which is freely available from the web 28 It supports all the functions we described above including multiple start of the EM algorithm using random partition or K mean clustering calculation of the model selection criteria AIC and BIC and the use of the bootstrap to test a given number of components g 0 We will use EMMIX to analyze the gene expression data described earlier The MCLUST software 29 implementing model based clustering is also freely available 30 It is designed to interface with the commercial statistical package S Plus For users familiar with S Plus it is convenient to take advantage of the power and flexibility of S Plus However at the same time it can have some serious restrictions on the size of the data being analyzed because of the overhead on CPU speed and memory induced by S Plus Application We fitted five mixture models with g ranging from 1 to 5 Table 1summarizes the model fitting results Using AIC or BIC we would select g 4 or g 3 respectively Also from the log likelihood values there is a dramatic change when g is increased from 1 or 2 However from g 3 log L increases very slowly Hence both g 3 and g 4 appear reasonable To determine which one is better we applied the bootstrap method also implemented in EMMIX to test H 0 g 3 versus H 1 g 4 Using 100 bootstrap resamples we were unable to reject H 0 as the resulting p value is 0 18 larger than the usual 0 05 nominal level In contrast if we test H 0 g 2 versus H 1 g 3 then we will reject H 0 with a small p value 0 01 Therefore we choose to fit a three component normal mixture model The fitted mixture model is f y 0 042 x N 6 74 77 07 0 510 N 0 88 5 56 0 448 N 0 31 1 15 More than 95 of data points fall into the two clusters with means close to 0 That means there is either no or little change in gene expression levels for most genes On the other hand 30 genes classified into the first cluster seem to have a change in gene expression levels This can be verified from Figure 3 which shows the profiles of gene expression levels across all six experiments for each cluster In addition to determining the number of clusters model based clustering has another advantage in providing posterior probabilities of observations belonging to each cluster The posterior probabilities are calculated using Equations 1 and 2 and are presented in Figure 4 Recall that a gene is classified to a cluster if its posterior probability of being in the cluster is the largest From Figure 4 it can be seen that if a gene s t statistic has a large absolute value then it will be classified into cluster 1 Specifically if a t statistic y i is smaller than 6 54 or larger than 7 39 then the corresponding gene i is judged to be from cluster 1 Hence cluster 1 consists of genes with large absolute values of t statistics implying that cluster 1 corresponds to genes with large changes of expression levels after standardization by the variation of expression levels Furthermore the posterior probability can serve as a quantitative measurement of the strength of each gene being classified into each cluster For instance among 30 genes classified into the first cluster there are respectively 17 18 20 and 21 genes with a posterior probability of being in the first cluster greater than 0 99 0 95 0 90 and 0 85 Hence those 17 or 18 genes are likely to have expression levels significantly different from those of other majority genes The posterior probability might also provide information about possible misclassifications In addition to those classified into cluster 1 there might be other observations classified into the other two clusters but nevertheless with not too small probabilities of being classified into cluster 1 The lower right panel of Figure 4shows six such observations all belonging to cluster 2 but with probabilities of being in cluster 1 ranging from 0 30 to 0 48 These six genes show somewhat differential gene expression levels but the evidence is not strong and more experiments may be needed to verify this We hope we have shown that model based clustering is a powerful method that is useful in analyzing gene expression data It is flexible as well as intuitively understandable However it does have some limitations Although it provides posterior probabilities for classification results in the context of detecting differentially expressed genes its use is more in the line of exploratory data analyses For instance in our example we treat cluster 1 as representing genes with changed expression whereas clusters 2 and 3 consist of genes without expression changes Although this treatment is reasonable it is somewhat subjective and is debatable Some new statistical approaches 31 32 33 are interesting alternatives that provide a more quantitative answer to detecting genes with altered expression but they require replicates of spots or arrays Model based clustering is less restrictive and can be applied to data without replicates and to cluster relative gene expression levels directly 13 Materials and methods Three young pathogen free Sprague Dawley rats were inoculated with pneumococcus in phosphate buffered saline PBS and served as the pneumococcus group Three other rats inoculated with PBS served as controls All animals were sacrificed on day 42 after inoculation The bullae from each of the pneumococcus or PBS inoculated groups were pooled and submitted for mRNA purification Purified mRNAs 32P dATP dNTP mix and reverse transcriptase were incubated at 50 C for 25 min for the synthesis of radioactively labeled cDNA probes The Atlas cDNA array membranes Atlas rat 1 2 array Clontech CA were hybridized with the cDNA probes and nonspecific binding washed away Specific binding of cDNA probes with the membranes was scanned into a computer and the radioactive signal intensities of specific binding were quantitated with the OptiQant software version 3 0 DeltaPackard Boston MA and presented in digitalized light unit DLU The intensity level in DLU is the observed gene expression level As described earlier the log transformation was conducted on the intensity level in DLU and the centering and scaling procedures were followed using the log transformed data The original data representing the intensity level in DLU for each gene from each of the six experiments are available from our website 34
