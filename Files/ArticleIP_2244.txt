 No Cigar No Cigar You already know what that headline refers to don t you But how do you know In Readme recently we told of how a British newspaper tried to evade Britain s absurd Official Secrets Act by inviting Slate to publish an article by a former spy making spectacular charges against the British intelligence services The idea was that once an American online publication accessible in Britain had told the tale the British press could report that we had reported it We ultimately declined this opportunity reasoning that we could not honestly maintain that publication in Britain was merely incidental since the instant worldwide accessibility of Slate was in fact the whole point The story was picked up though by a more provincial publication the New York Times which could more credibly make that claim And thus the British papers were free to tell the tale In the past week or so oddly the same process has happened in reverse A story that almost no American publication will report directly has been widely reported anyhow sort of in part in the form of reporting that the story has been reported in England The story involves President Clinton Monica Lewinsky and a cigar and allegedly is part of the special prosecutor s as yet unwritten report to Congress The current status of this story is extremely peculiar It has been Topic A in Washington There have been jokes about it on Jay Leno and passing comments on the TV yack shows The Drudge Report and the New York Post have told it in some detail The British and other foreign presses have also reported it on the Web as well as on paper Not a word though in the newspaper of record the Times And the Washington Post buried a coy discussion of the British coverage in the back half of a barely related article about columnists turning against Clinton Slate has been full of unilluminating references in The Breakfast Table Chatterbox Diary and BT again There is a real problem here which the Internet obviously makes much worse The Washington Post once got widely mocked for an editorial justifying the publication of a damaging rumor about a public official with the argument that while the rumor may not be true it is true there is a rumor But actually there s something to that argument On the one hand a publication s standards of proof and taste should not be hostage to the lesser standards of other publications On the other hand a story can spread without the help of the establishment media to the point where making no acknowledgment of its existence becomes a failure in your basic duty to reflect reality What does seem unsatisfactory is the current netherworld where serious publications refer to the story as if everyone knows it without ever telling it straight Burying the story as a way of sort of half publishing it the Washington Post approach also seems silly So if you don t know what the heck all this is about the cigar see Explainer Of course we re not saying it s true We re just saying it s true that it s a rumor Lonely and Depressed and Proud of It The lumber byproduct media have reported with glee a study out of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh purporting to show that spending time on the Internet tends to make people more lonely and depressed This contradicts the widespread view among cyberfolk including apparently the study s own disappointed authors that people staring into computer screens form a wonderful new type of electronic community The authors claim to have corrected for the possibility that lonely depressed people are more inclined to use the Internet to begin with and a cyberwag quoted in USA Today has already made the requisite joke that maybe these people are depressed by being in Pittsburgh The study is 25 pages long To minimize the risk of loneliness and depression read this nine page press release So how can we Internet apologists explain away this finding Well try this Perhaps Internet users are more depressed because they are better informed Perhaps their feelings of increased loneliness are reflections of a deepened understanding of the human condition Let s face it The world is a mess life is basically futile and other people are pretty dreadful and don t like you much anyhow And you d never acquire all this superior insight if you didn t spend many many hours on the Internet So read Slate A lot And don t forget to floss Michael Kinsley
