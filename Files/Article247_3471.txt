 Two Cheers for Cond Nast s Acquisition Normally when one of three big players in an industry buys one of its two competitors you hear rumblings about possible antitrust violations and the deleterious effects of lack of competition But we ve yet to hear any such rumblings except perhaps from advertisers about Cond Nast s 650 million acquisition of Fairchild Publications even though Cond Nast will now own every key fashion magazine in America with the exceptions of Harper s Bazaar and Elle And that s as it should be If anything increasing Cond Nast s hold on the fashion press may have beneficial spillover effects that no one is really anticipating To begin with even though after the deal closes Cond Nast will own Wd and Women s Wear Daily in addition to Vogue and Glamour and assorted other fashion y magazines it won t have a monopoly position And as the example of the auto industry suggests having two or three major players in an industry is qualitatively different from having just one As long as Harper s Bazaar and Elle remain outside the fold Cond Nast will be limited in its ability to do whatever bad things monopolists generally do Actually that s the other thing It s hard to figure out what the bad things Cond Nast might do are and it s just as hard to figure out who is hurt by this deal hard to figure out who s being hurt that we don t want to be hurt that is The pricing of magazines is difficult to decipher it often in fact seems irrational but it s unlikely that W s cover price is going to rise just because it s owned by the same company that owns Vogue And this is despite magazine consumers tendency to be somewhat price insensitive which accounts for the fact that so many magazines are sold at the newsstand even though the price of one copy there is often equal to the price of four or five copies bought by subscription So consumers won t be hurt in the pocketbook As for editorial it s possible that the Cond Nast mentality whatever that is will come to rule the Fairchild magazines but if a year from now you re able to tell the difference between the pre and post Cond Nast W s God bless you That doesn t mean of course that it won t be a new experience for the editors of W and Jane to work with James Truman and Si Newhouse but editors don t count as a valid constituency to protest antitrust violations The one group that probably will be hurt by the deal is the advertisers but this is a good thing In a business sense the deal may make all these Cond Nast magazines less beholden to any single advertiser which in turn will allow the company to drive harder bargains The flip side of this is that it will make advertisers think harder about why they advertise and where they advertise In other words the acquisition may have the unforeseen effect of making the whole industry more businesslike More important this deal may make it easier for magazines of all sorts to take more critical looks at the companies and personalities in the fashion industry It s an open secret in magazine publishing that there are some stories that just can t be done because running them would result in advertising s being pulled that magazines can t afford to be pulled But now Cond Nast will be in the position of saying to displeased subjects of tough pieces You want to pull your advertising Fine If you think you can make it without W Women s Wear Daily Vogue Glamour etc etc more power to you Shifting the balance of power away from advertisers is in that sense entirely a good thing So to take a purely hypothetical example perhaps we might actually see a serious piece on what Ron Perelman head of Revlon has done to many of the companies Marvel Entertainment Coleman Consolidated Cigar Revlon itself he s been in charge of OK probably not But isn t it pretty to think so
