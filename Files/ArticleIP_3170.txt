 This Is the End A few weeks ago on his public radio program A Prairie Home Companion Garrison Keillor spent several minutes conversing with the occasional character Larry his fictional twin brother who lives beneath the stage and harbors resentments about a show business career that slipped away Larry you can t live in the past Keillor said at one point It does no good to hold a grudge You ve got to move on Larry You ve got to find closure A Prairie Home Companion does not rely for its comedic grammar on concepts accessible mainly to an overinformed urban elite so when certain words and phrases crop up on that program you can be pretty sure the underlying meanings have been suffused through the middle range ZIP codes Such is the case with closure in the sense of bringing an emotional process to its natural conclusion The term has so rapidly evolved from restricted jargon into mainstream patois it is hardly more technical now than the words du jour after soup on a truck stop menu that A Prairie Home Companion cannot only use it safely but can even give it a knowing ironic twist Closure has familiar applications in the realm of personal relationships In the movie Heat to cite just one instance Diane Venora says to her ex husband Al Pacino I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but you ve been walking through our life dead And now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you But the word turns up in any sort of story where finis is being written Patients who served as unwitting subjects of 1950s radiation experiments described their recent settlement with the government as bringing a sense of closure using the word in its by now standard noun phrase setting Closure on its own sometimes seems too final The makers of a 450 doll that bears the features of a young Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis attributed the doll s popularity to the public s unresolved feelings about Jackie Buying a doll gives them a sense of closure In contrast the rambling valedictory press conference last fall of Notre Dame s football coach Lou Holtz was criticized by one sportswriter for its absence of any real sense of closure Closure is nowadays most often encountered in contexts involving death Newspaper and broadcast accounts routinely describe the return of a serviceman s long lost remains from the Pacific Korea or Vietnam as bringing a sense of closure Late last year the Los Angeles Times profiled a local undertaker named Roberto Garcia While the profits are nice Garcia says the most fulfilling part of his job is helping families establish a sense of closure Now that executions are once again a normal part of American life someone is executed in the United States once a week on average they too reliably bring on that clausural feeling What I m hoping is that everyone will have a sense of closure from this a police officer told a reporter after an execution was carried out last month in Arizona 18 years after the crimes had been committed Commenting on a documentary in which parents witnessed the execution of the killer of two of their children a Chicago Sun Times columnist wrote Watching him die gave them a sense of closure The relatives of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman did not witness anything so dramatic but according to the New York Times closure was what they too had sought in their recent lawsuit against O J Simpson The 33 5 million award was not the issue they told the Times Rather they were looking for closure justice some called it to the worst thing that had ever happened to them The origins of closure are hardly obscure It is derived from the Latin verb clausere meaning to close which also gives us the enclosed architectural space cloister the enclosed syntactical space clause and the fear of enclosed space altogether claustrophobia In a political sense closure now most commonly invoked in its Gallic variant cloture refers to the ending of debate in a legislative body and dates back to the late 19 th century In literary criticism closure refers to the manner in which a poem or any text achieves thematic and structural finality In the psychological jargon of Gestalt theory Gestalt being German for pattern or form closure refers to the propensity of the human mind to impose or perceive order despite gaps or asymmetry This meaning of closure helps to explain ___ most people have no ________ at all in figuring out the missing ______ in this sentence Fill in the blanks exercises have been fashioned into what are known as cloze tests which are designed to test passages for readability and readers for comprehension The Gestalt term closure has an application in the world of where it refers to the way the reader mentally imagines what has happened between panels The impulse behind the real life quest for a sense of closure the impulse that is to discern meaning to impose coherence to tie up loose ends is no doubt as timeless as sentience itself But how did it come to be so closely bound up with a specific word One factor is the psychologizing of everyday life a development that scarcely needs documentation When we require words to describe personal motivation and other interior processes the most likely source today is psychology The lexicon so derived is large and growing co dependency recovery denial self esteem self help As it has been noted there are no longer sins only syndromes Asecond factor is the news media in particular local television news which is built on abbreviated human stories with a recognizable beginning middle and end A violent crime A daring rescue A belated discovery A sudden disaster Psychotherapeutic templates are easy to apply The words a sense of closure have by now been uttered so often on camera along with the companion phrase the healing process which is what observers hope will occur after the scab of closure has formed that they have joined the off the rack vocabulary of stock phrases that ordinary Americans can pick from when a camera appears in front of them How much more deeply a sense of closure will penetrate is impossible to say but that it will go deeper is without question I won t be surprised to learn someday that wedding vows are being exchanged in which the union is set to last until a sense of closure do us part And surely A Sense of Closure will be the headline above the news analysis in the New York Times the morning before the asteroid hits At least we won t have to read The Healing Process on the editorial page the following day
