 Background Opioid receptors ORs like many other G protein coupled receptors GPCRs are capable of signalling via the family of mitogen activated protein kinases MAPKs It has been postulated that activation of these kinases allows GPCR agonists to modulate such diverse molecular events as cell proliferation differentiation and survival 1 To date all three cloned opioid receptor types and the closely related nociceptin receptor have demonstrated the ability to signal through their heterotrimeric G proteins G i or G o to at least one type of MAPK 2 3 4 Among the members of this family that are activated by opioids are the two extracellular signal regulated protein kinases p44 MAPK ERK 1 and p42 MAPK ERK 2 5 and the p38 protein kinase 3 However the precise mechanism by which OR stimulation produces an increase in MAPK activity is still unknown and under investigation While receptor cell and tissue specific differences almost certainly exist and appear to make any single mechanism of ERK activation unlikely certain generalities have begun to emerge For example ERK activation by GPCRs is predominantly a Ras dependent event one that utilizes many of the upstream protein intermediates i e Shc Gab1 Grb2 mSOS and MAPK kinase MEK 1 known to be used by single transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases RTKs like the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR for a review see 6 When ERKs are activated after EGFR stimulation an essential event is the sequential tyrosine phosphorylation of these intermediate proteins and their binding to the tyrosine phosphorylated EGFR before the GTP loading of Ras For the GPCR model the tyrosine kinase s involved and the site of this multi protein complex formation is less clear For a number of GPCRs including the lysophosphatidic acid LPAR 7 adrenergic 2 2 AR 8 and and OR receptors 9 the activation of a non receptor tyrosine kinase of the Src or focal adhesion kinase FAK 10 families are involved However the question of what plasma membrane spanning protein serves as the scaffold for Shc binding and beyond remains to be answered Two possibilities have emerged as potential sites of tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent scaffold building in response to GPCR stimulation which results in ERK activation the GPCR itself or a co expressed RTK i e the EGFR that would act as a surrogate We and others and we have reported that and opioid receptors become tyrosine phosphorylated after agonist stimulation 11 12 Tyrosine phosphorylation of a membrane bound protein is an essential step in ERK activation because it creates SH2 binding domains that allow Shc and other proteins to associate into a multi protein signalling complex The mutation of one of the tyrosines Y318F in the OR or the presence of the Src inhibitor PP1 significantly reduces tyrosine phosphorylation of this receptor and its ability to activate ERKs 11 13 However a small degree of OR agonist mediated ERK activation remained in cells expressing the Y318F mutant receptor suggesting that a second mechanism or an additional tyrosine could be involved These data suggest that the tyrosine phosphorylation of GPCRs may allow them to signal ERKs in the absence of RTK or FAK phosphorylation by acting as their own scaffolds However the majority of the published studies have focused on the hypothesis that GPCRs must work in cooperation with RTKs i e the EGFR to produce ERK activation Studies by Daub et al 7 and Luttrell et al 14 have demonstrated that stimulation of LPAR G i q coupled and 2 ARs G s coupled respectively results in the transactivation transphosphorylation of co expressed EGFRs For example both EPA and isoproterenol increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR which appears to be required for ERK activation since the presence of kinase deficient EGFR mutants or the kinase inhibitor AG1478 prevents both responses It is hypothesized that trans tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR creates protein phosphotyrosine binding sites that act as a surrogate scaffold for ERK activation 7 Since ORs share many similarities with LPAR and 2 ARs in the way they activate the ERK pathway 9 15 we chose to examine whether RTK transactivation occurs and is a necessary aspect of opioid mediated ERK activation Results DSLET and EGF induce ERK phosphorylation in OR expressing HEK 293 cells We have shown that opioids increase the phosphorylation of ERKl 2 in HEK 293 cells when the mouse wild type WT OR is stably expressed 11 13 The concentrations required to observe DSLET mediated ERK phosphorylation EC 50 10 nM Figure 1a are consistent with those reported for other OR mediated events including G protein activation and adenylyl cyclase inhibition 16 17 Moreover no change in total ERK expression was observed concomitantly with ERK phosphorylation in any of our experiments data not shown Pretreating the cells with PTX 100 ng ml or the specific OR antagonist naltrindole 10 M completely blocked the DSEET induced increase in ERK phosphorylation Figure 1b These results suggest that DSLET utilizes a G i coupled OR to stimulate ERK 1 and 2 We then took advantage of the HEK 293 cell line s endogenous expression of the EGFR to examine this receptor s ability to activate ERKs Similar to DSLET EGF 5 ng ml produces a robust activation of ERKs in OR expressing HEK 293 cells after a 5 minute treatment Figure 2a PTX did not attenuate EGF mediated ERK activation Figure 2a although this response was completely blocked by the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 1 M Figure 2a Conversely DSLET induced ERK activation was unaffected by AG1478 suggesting that different tyrosine kinases are involved in opioid and EGF dependent MAPK activity Figure 2b DSLET mediated ERK activation was significantly inhibited by the Src kinase inhibitor PP1 10 M Figure 3 PP1 also had a significant inhibitory 75 reduction effect on MAPK activation by EGF Figure 3 DSLET induced ERK activation does not produce hyper phosphorylation of the EGFR Our next experiments were designed to examine whether the EGFR becomes tyrosine phosphorylated during ERK activation by DSLET As stated in the introduction several GPCRs including the EPAR 2 AR and substance P SP R 14 18 19 20 increase EGFR phosphorylation during the course of ERK activation and it is believed that in these instances this event is an initial step in the progression of the MAPK cascade Our laboratory has previously reported 11 13 that 5 opioids induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR and it appears that this is catalyzed by the non receptor tyrosine kinase Src However transphosphorylation of the EGFR after OR activation has not been reported WT OR expressing HEK 293 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of either DSLET 1 1000 nM or EGF 0 1 100 ng ml for five minutes to induce ERK activation As stated earlier either DSLET or EGF increased the appearance of phosphorylated ERK in a time and concentration dependent manner A portion of the lysates used to measure ERK activation was used to immunoprecipitate the EGFR or OR to determine their degree of tyrosine phosphorylation After immunoprecipitation of the FLAG tagged OR or the EGFR with the appropriate antibodies we found that only DSLET induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR whereas only EGF potentiated EGFR phosphorylation Figure 4 1 M DSLET induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR was inhibited by naltrindole PP1 but not by AG1478 Figure 5 These results suggest that transactivation of the EGFR does not play a role in OR phosphorylation or ERK activation by opioids Determining whether a co expressed RTK is structurally necessary for OR mediated ERK activation EGFR down regulation does not affect DSLET mediated ERK activation in HEK 293 cells Despite the lack of direct evidence that DSLET induces the transactivation of co expressed RTKs it is possible that the EGFR in some way contributes to ERK activation by opioids It is possible that RTKs and GPCRs share important protein intermediates that are required during ERK activation Therefore we wished to determine what effects the down regulation of the EGFR would have on ERK signalling via the OR HEK 293 cells expressing the WT OR were exposed to EGF 100 ng ml for 24 hours in order to down regulate and desensitize the endogenous EGFR After chronic EGF treatment the cultures were washed with serum free media and then exposed acutely 5 minutes to either EGF 10 ng ml or DSLET 1 M to stimulate ERK phosphorylation In EGF pre treated cultures acute EGF 10 ng ml was unable to increase the expression of phospho ERKs compared to media exposed controls Figure 6 This lack of response appears to be due to the down regulation of EGFRs from these cells as confirmed by immunoblots using the anti EGFR antibody data not shown However DSLET mediated ERK activation was unaltered in identically pretreated cultures In cells pretreated with DSLET 10 M 24 hours to induce down regulation of ORs 21 DSLET 1 M was no longer able to activate the ERK cascade but the ERK response to acute EGF 10 ng ml was unchanged compared to medium treated controls Figure 6 These results indicate that a reduction in the function and density of endogenous EGFRs has little effect on opioid mediated MAPK cascades and suggests that the enzyme cascades that control OR and EGFR mediated ERK activation are separate DSLET activates ERK even in a cell line devoid of the EGFR C6 glioma cells have been used as host cells for the transfection of several GPCR types and have the advantage of expressing high levels of ERK while being devoid of the EGFR In C6 glioma cells that express the mouse OR DSLET produced a concentration dependent increase in the appearance of phospho ERK 1 and 2 DSLET mediated ERK activation in C6 OR cells was completely inhibited by either pre treatment with PTX or naltrindole data not shown In contrast EGF was unable to elicit ERK activation at any concentration tested up to 1 M Figure 7 Furthermore the EGFR antagonist AG1478 had no effect on DSLET mediated ERK activation which eliminated the possibility that these antagonists produced non specific inhibitory effects Figure 7 Potential of endogenously expressed insulin receptors IR and PDGFR to act as surrogate protein scaffolds during ERK activation by opioids However C6 glioma cells express additional RTKs including insulin IR and platelet derived growth factor PDGFR receptors It is possible that these sites can be used as surrogate scaffold proteins during ERK activation and we explored the possibility that opioids induce the transphosphorylation of these two RTKs At concentrations of 10 M neither DSLET DADLE nor DPDPE were found to increase the tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR or the PDGFR whereas insulin 100 ng ml or PDGF 50 ng ml induced significant tyrosine phosphorylation of these sites Figure 8 Moreover we pre treated C6 OR cells with the IR antagonist hydroxy 2 napthalenylmethylphosphonic acid tris acetoxymethylester HNMPA AM 3 100 M or the PDGFR antagonist tyrosphostin 9 100 M before the addition of DSLET 1 M Despite the presence of these catalytic RTK inhibitors opioid mediated ERK activation was not significantly altered in comparison to untreated cultures Figure 9 Furthermore immunoprecipitation of the OR followed by immunoblotting using anti phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed that these inhibitors did not attenuate tyrosine phosphorylation of ORs after DSLET treatment Figure 9 The results presented herein strongly suggest that transactivation of RTKs does not make a significant contribution to DSLET induced ERK activation in at least two different cell lines Discussion With the first evidence that GPCRs could signal via the MAPK cascade many investigators have looked for a common mechanism of activation that could be applied across receptor types Unlike the better understood mechanism whereby single transmembrane RTKs e g EGFR IR or PDGFR stimulate ERKs 22 23 no single sequence of events appears to hold among GPCRs even when they are expressed in the same cell line For instance studies from two laboratories reported marked differences in the way the 2 adrenergic receptor 2 AR activates ERK 1 and 2 in HEK 293 cells In one study the 2 AR activates ERK through it s coupling to a PTX sensitive G i protein and subsequent Ras activation 24 while in another ERK phosphorylation occurred in a PTX independent and a G s and cAMP dependent fashion 25 Furthermore these studies indicate that the same receptor may activate ERKs via one mechanism when it is endogenously expressed and via another when it is transfected into a cell line 25 Despite numerous reported differences it does appear that diverse GPCRs share common mechanistic themes during ERK stimulation including the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc and its complexing with Grb2 mSOS recruitment the GTP loading of Ras and Raf 1 activation leading to MEK 1 phosphorylation 1 However the progression of each of these downstream events after GPCR stimulation depends first on the tyrosine phosphorylation of a membrane bound protein that will be used as a scaffold which will bind the other proteins e g Shc Grb2 Gab1 mSOS etc 7 Moreover the exact identity of the tyrosine kinase s involved in this initial step appears to vary among receptor types with RTKs non receptor protein tyrosine kinases PTKs or FAKs being involved in particular instances 26 In this report we questioned whether the EGFR acts as a surrogate scaffold during ERK activation through the OR as it appears to do for several other GPCRs 7 To act as a surrogate binding site for complex formation the literature states that this protein must first become tyrosine phosphorylated 7 Tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGFR is apparent after agonist stimulation of the 2 AR COS 7 2 AR COS 7 insulin like growth factor IGF 1 COS 7 substance P and the lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPAR 7 In addition each of the aforementioned ligands also increases ERK phosphorylation when the proper receptor is expressed in these cell lines ERK activation and EGFR phosphorylation via each of these receptors was inhibited by prior exposure to the EGFR kinase inhibitor AG1478 However the Src inhibitor PP1 or the expression of a dominant negative Src mutant will reduce GPCR mediated transphosphorylation of the EGFR and GPCR mediated ERK activation to varying degrees partial to total suggesting that at least two different tyrosine kinases can be involved 18 Src was found to co immunoprecipitate with the phosphorylated EGFR in COS 7 cells exposed to either LPA or EGF 14 These authors reported that the autophosphorylation of Y350 in the EGFR does not occur after LPA exposure suggesting that c Src is the principal tyrosine kinase in this instance and not the EGFR s intrinsic tyrosine kinase Src has also been found to co immunoprecipitate with the agonist stimulated 2 AR during the period of ERK activation 8 Our previous work 11 13 suggested that a Src like protein tyrosine kinase was primarily responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of the OR and ERK activation induced by DTLET when the receptor was expressed in CHO or HEK 293 cells because both responses were blocked by the presence of 50 M PP1 The seemingly dominant role of Src in opioid mediated ERK stimulation is strengthened in the present report because of considerable evidence that the EGFR antagonist AG1478 was unable to reduce DSLET mediated ERK activation This suggests that the EGFR has minimal if any involvement in the opioid activated ERK cascade It is possible that the dual coupling of the LPAR to both inhibitory G i and stimulatory G 12 13 and G q G proteins is a reason for these differences In this report we have presented considerable evidence that ORs and EGFRs activate ERKs independently without the need for transphosphorylation of a co expressed RTK We used C6 glioma cells transfected to stably express the mouse OR to examine ERK activation by opioids in a line that does not express the EGFR to confirm our results obtained in the receptor down regulation experiments We observed that DSLET activated p42 mapkand p44 mapkvery robustly in this cell line C6 glioma cells do express growth factor receptors that bind PDGF and insulin However neither of these proteins has been reported to act as a surrogate scaffold during ERK activation by non opioid GPCRs 27 In the present report DSLET mediated ERK phosphorylation was unaltered by the presence of the IR or PDGFR antagonists HNMPA AM 3 and tyrosphostin 9 respectively It is probable that the OR in C6 glioma cells also acts as its own platform for the binding of Shc etc since the OR also undergoes agonist mediated tyrosine phosphorylation in this particular cell line Kramer et al unpublished observations similar to what we previously reported for the OR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary or HEK 293 cells 11 13 Thus in at least two different cell lines HEK 293 and C6 glioma we have significant evidence that transactivation of an endogenously expressed RTK is not required for ERK activation through opioid receptors While the EGFR does not appear to be phosphorylated during DSLET mediated ERK activation it is possible that the EGFR is somehow involved in this response when it is present Buist et al 27 reported that endogenously expressed LPA and endothelin 1 ET 1 receptors in SK N MC cells do not activate ERKs unless the EGFR is co expressed although each GPCR is functional as evidenced by their ability to increase intracellular Ca 2 In the presence of the EGFR ligand activation of LPA and ET 1 receptors did not increase EGFR phosphorylation even though both the LPA and ET 1 receptors stimulated ERK activity by 10 fold over basal 27 Specifically key protein intermediates may be physically associated with endogenous RTKs in HEK 293 cells and therefore down regulation of the EGFR may negatively affect ERK phosphorylation by opioids To examine this we induced significant down regulation of EGFR density and function by exposing OR HEK 293 cells to 100 ng ml EGF for 24 hours Functionally these cells are no longer capable of activating ERK 1 or 2 in response to 10 ng ml EGF Figure whereas this concentration produces a strong effect in non pretreated cells Conversely DSLET mediated ERK phosphorylation is actually greater in chronically treated EGF cultures to that observed in cells not previously exposed to high EGF concentrations This may represent a compensatory effect to counteract the loss of function of an important growth factor receptor In a similar experiment a 24 hour exposure to DSLET 10 M induced significant OR down regulation and an almost complete loss of DSLET mediated ERK phosphorylation MAP kinase activation by a 5 minute exposure to EGF was unaffected by OR down regulation These results taken together suggest that GPCRs and RTKs can act as independent regulators of MAP kinase cascades although interactions between the two receptor types may exist in certain cases In conclusion we report that the OR agonist DSLET induces significant ERK activation in the absence of any increase in phosphorylation of the co expressed EGFR in HEK 293 cells HEK 293 cells endogenously express the EGFR and EGF produces robust ERK activation concomitant with EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation Immunoprecipitation studies showed that the OR becomes tyrosine phosphorylated after exposure to DSLET but not to EGF These studies were repeated in OR transfected C6 glioma cells which do not express the EGFR In these cells DSLET was still able to induce ERK activation Additional studies showed that the two RTKs which are present in C6 glioma cells IRs and PDGFRs had no apparent role on ERK activation by a opioid agonist Furthermore inducing down regulation of either the EGFR or OR by chronic agonist treatment has little effect on ERK activation by the other receptor in HEK 293 cells suggesting that these pathways are distinct These results demonstrate that opioid mediated ERK activation occurs independently of EGFR transphosphorylation and that the tyrosine phosphorylated OR may serve as the primary scaffold Materials and Methods Drugs and compounds All chemicals used for these studies were of reagent grade and obtained from the following
