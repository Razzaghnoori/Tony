 The Pornographer Who Didn t Bark So Newt Gingrich has been having an affair with congressional aide Callista Bisek for six years since before the Republican Revolution of 1994 Why didn t Larry Flynt tell us about it when it mattered You remember Flynt the pornographer and his crack team of snoops were going to blast the lid off the hypocritical Republican Congress that was trying to impeach a president over sex etc Flynt offered up to 1 million in reward money Yet here one of Flynt s juiciest potential targets was cheating and Flynt didn t blow his cover Did Flynt fail to find out about Gingrich and Bisek No according to Allan MacDonell executive editor of Flynt s Hustler magazine MacDonell told kausfiles that we had some information on Gingrich indeed Hustler had compiled a good dossier on the speaker before he resigned his office after the Nov 1998 elections Did that dossier include the Bisek matter Yes So why didn t Flynt expose the affair We were holding back Why hold back MacDonell said that Bisek was a private citizen which caused some concern but also that Hustler wanted to see what Gingrich was going to do next as far as his career was concerned Hmmm In early 1999 while the Clinton impeachment was pending before the Senate Republicans charged that Flynt was blackmailing anti Clinton congressmen This came after Flynt s investigator Dan Moldea told the Washington Times We have a lot of these guys dead bang and the evidence is clear But they haven t been going on TV or on the floor of Congress shooting their mouths off trying to take the moral high ground against Clinton And as a consequence we re throwing it back in the river If a Republican hasn t been shooting his mouth off Moldea said we let him go And come to think of it Gingrich was kind of uncharacteristically quiet during the impeachment mess wasn t he Did Gingrich know Flynt had the goods on him We never contacted him says MacDonell though he concedes Gingrich could have known MacDonell says Hustler s concern was getting maximum publicity and sales for Hustler not necessarily making Gingrich behave We were going to wait until the disclosure would do us the most benefit If Gingrich had come out in a high profile way and denounced Clinton s sexual immorality would Flynt have dropped the bomb then That was kind of our idea What if Newt hadn t resigned after his 1998 election losses and instead had resolved to seek another term as House speaker would Flynt then have tried to bring him down Not necessarily says MacDonell We weren t that concerned with bringing down anybody We wanted to do the most for ourselves So was Gingrich effectively if not illegally blackmailed You the reader be the judge I tend to believe MacDonell s claim of pure publicity seeking self interest But that doesn t mean Gingrich s behavior wasn t affected by knowledge that Flynt or someone like him knew about Bisek and might blow the whistle Intentionally or not Flynt served Clinton well Flynt would probably agree Last spring after Clinton s impeachment trial was over and months after Gingrich resigned he finally published his long awaited and disappointing Flynt Report It did allude to the Bisek matter saying Rumors of an ongoing affair between the remarried Newt Gingrich and a female staff member of then Congressman Steve Gunderson R Wisconsin reached HUSTLER from more than one inside source Maybe this whiff of fresh scandal was the deciding factor in Newt s abrupt withdrawal from the mud fight And Flynt might have added in determining Newt s fighting style during the previous months Gingrich s press spokesman Michael Shields declined to comment on this story when contacted by kausfiles In 1993 when her romance with the speaker apparently began Bisek was an aide to Gunderson
