discover that an evening s entertainment starts and ends early Nightlife stays on a high cultural plane far removed from the nightclub scene of Europe or North America Chinese performances combine amusement with edification in a glittering package few Western impresarios could afford to mount Chinese Opera The Chinese hospitably assume that foreigners can t bear more than about ten minutes of traditional Chinese opera You might indeed find the voices shrill and the mannerisms maddening many characters seem to spend most of the time fussing with their sleeves which can unroll to the floor So you should not mind if your guide or host rushes you out of the theater into the early evening traffic But if you persevere you will begin to understand what the Chinese see in this age old art form If you fail you ve still enjoyed the splendid costumes and makeup the acrobatics that enliven some regional versions and the experience of being in a theater surrounded by local people Peking opera is the version most familiar to Westerners but other regions have their own variants If possible familiarize yourself with the plot in advance Ideologically uplifting operas were the only ones permitted during the Cultural Revolution classical stories were banned But today both classical and modern works are presented If you have an interpreter at hand you ll understand why some scenes animate the audience and others don t The words of the songs are projected onto screens alongside the proscenium arch to clarify the nuances of a tonal language set to music Apart from the set pieces most of the music is percussive and serves to support and reflect the action and mood Props are minimal and the action is subtle an actor closes an invisible door with a mime gesture and anyone walking with a riding crop must be understood to be mounted on a horse But the heroic characters couldn t ever be mistaken for the snarling villains Puppets Acrobats and Folklore Groups Popular with adults and children the Chinese shadow play a 2 000 year old art form dramatizes familiar legends The two dimensional puppets manipulated behind a silk screen can jump and fly giving the colorful silhouettes an advantage over the actors in Chinese opera The busy puppeteers give voice to their characters often in song Professional and amateur shadow play troupes also put on shows with marionettes The so called acrobatic shows staged for tourist groups are more fun than you might expect The trapeze artists of course are first class and so are the contortionists and human pyramid acts But they also throw in jugglers and magicians and even comics and you don t have to understand a word to join in the laughter Typically the Chinese folklore performances are organized especially for tourists Shows feature the costumes songs and dances of the national minority groups often as foreign to a Chinese audience as they are to visitors from abroad These evenings are usually uplifting and not very long Concerts and Ballet During the Cultural Revolution Beethoven and Tchaikovsky were banned and many musicians banished to the countryside for re education So if you go to a concert today you ll sense the drama of recovery from mad xenophobia This needn t obscure the fact that some professional musicians haven t yet reached world standards But the enthusiasm of players and audience is exciting in itself Ballet a vehicle for ideological indoctrination during the 1960s and 1970s is much less restricted today Folk legends are often a source of inspiration and classical European works are sometimes performed with elaborate costumes sets and lighting effects And a Nightcap With varying degrees of success the tourist hotels try to meet foreigners demands for a quiet place to have a drink and a chat Only the newest hotels that were built with international cooperation contain bars reminiscent of those in Europe or America The others are likely to be quaint rather than cozy
