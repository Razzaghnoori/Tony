              okay have you seen any good movies lately   uh um uh lets see yeah   what have what have you seen lately   uh Dances With Wolves we just saw that kind of late what else have i seen uh Silence of the Lambs   oh uhhuh yeah that was a good movie we saw that one too   that was that was uh  spine tingling yeah   uh in fact i cant wait to see it again it should be be in release pretty soon i think   yeap are are we being are we doing are we recording ive not done this before   oh you havent   no   yeah we are being recorded   okay   so uh lets see i guess the only ones ive seen recently have been i saw Naked Gun Two and a half   umhum how was that   that was that was pretty good that was enjoyable   yeah   i i didnt think it was quite as good as the first one   yeah my son my teenage son liked it so i wasnt quite sure how to take that whether i would whether i would like it our not   yeah it was it was pretty clever   yeah   and then we saw the one that was the kind of the spoof of Top Gun   umhum   there was they were kind of along the same lines but i i didnt enjoy that one near as much i didnt it wasnt as well done i dont think   umhum   but uh and im trying to remember weve seen some other goods ones but uh and and then Silence of the Lambs that one kept me thinking for a month   yeah that was uh almost to uh to spine tingling for me i  i liked it but it was uh   yeah   yeah it was   it was interesting because the person i thought that that really you know stole the show was Anthony Hopkins   oh yeah   and he was so good in that     yeah he definitely he definitely did i saw him in uh did you see him when he played uh Adolf Hitler   no i didnt   oh boy that was uh he also i mean he he was outstanding act too   yeah its its amazing how because i mean realistically he wasnt in that movie but you know twenty minutes   uh uhhuh   and yet you know he just captivated   yeap   it it was amazing it really was   yeah youre right uh you dont think uh he was so dominating dominating you dont think about it but he was on screen not any where near as long as   right i it know but he is the one that kept you thinking throughout the whole movie   yep yep   and uh that that was that was really a good movie i really enjoyed that one   yep how did you like Dances With Wolves did you like that one   uh we havent seen that one yet yeah i i havent mustered up enough strength to go sit through a three hour movie   oh you havent yeah   so i i i run out of patience on a movie like that i start checking my watch about an hour and half   is that right yeah   yeah  hm   well it kept me uh i it kept me uh interested the whole time yeah   really ive heard ive heard its really good i havent gone to see it probably be out on tape before long too     yeah its out yeah yeah we didnt see it at the theater we waited till it came out too   is it oh oh i see   how about Robin Hood have you seen that one me neither   no me neither   um i really want to see that one its and it about to come out in on uh   Kevin Costner yeah the Kevin Costner movie is that what you are talking about yeah um uh i really like him i have somehow that movie never grabbed me you know as one that i would like to see but uh   on huh yeah yeah uhhuh it did it uh well really interested me until the reviews started coming out and they were sort of um   did they pan it pretty bad or   no they it it um they said uh that he was um hes hes performance was only average and um and and i read i read some interviews with him that he was the production was rushed so much that he didnt he evidently he studies his uh his parts real in depth   umhum   and uh at least thats what the article said and it was rushing the production he and he he was in intention to master a British accent for it and didnt have time to do that   hm   and then they said there were some wholes in the story line too   oh   so   something i saw on Showtime or something the other night the i hadnt hadnt seen in a while was uh was The Hunt for Red October did you see that   yeah i like that one ive seen ive seen that i saw it about i saw it once and ive seen it about four times on cable   yeah me too im the same way and that thats really an intriguing movie too   yeah yeah thats a good one   there there are several like that uh another one i saw that me and my wife really talked about after it was over was uh Sex Lies and Videotape   oh yeah no ive only seen uh like uh   did you see that bits and pieces of it   yeah i was traveling and and you know it was in the hotel and i and i saw little bits and pieces of it was that was that was that any good or was it just exploit   it wasnt bad the thing was you know it was interesting the way the their lives intertwined and and and then at the end they kind of all fell apart and you know there are a lot of things to talk about after that you know because it was real interesting   umhum   the interpersonal relationship and stuff   yeah   so it it was a movie that we you know we end up when when you first leave there its like you know i dont know if i like that movie but then as we get to talk about it its like all these different things that deal with these people or whatever   umhum so it wasnt an exploitation film uh   no not not at all  if thats what is sounds like   yeah   but its not that at all uh it just it talks about it its basically only got four people in the whole movie and uh you know the whole the whole thing just revolves around them and you know uh really i mean   uhhuh
