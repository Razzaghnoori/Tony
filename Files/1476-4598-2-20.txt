 Background Malignant tumor cells frequently show deregulation and hyperactivation of signalling pathways one of which is represented by the TGF signal transduction pathway 1 TGF has been shown to potently inhibit proliferation of most epithelial endothelial and hematopoietic cells 2 However during tumor progression malignant cells may become refractory to TGF mediated cell cycle arrest In later stages of tumorigenesis TGF can act as a stimulator of invasion and metastasis 3 acting directly on the tumor cells or inducing angiogenesis and facilitating local and systemic immunosuppression respectively 4 For example TGF may stimulate the expression of proteases such as uPA MMP 3 or MMP 9 enzymes frequently overexpressed in invasive tumor cells 5 6 TGF signals through a heteromeric receptor complex of type II and type I receptor serine threonine kinases which activates the downstream Smad signal transduction pathway 7 After TGF binding to the receptor complex the TGF type II receptor kinase phosphorylates TGF type I receptor which inititates the downstream response by phosphorylating receptor regulated Smads R Smads such as Smad2 and Smad3 By forming a multimeric complex with the Co Smad Smad4 activated R Smads translocate to the nucleus and induce transcriptional modulation of target genes 8 Breast cancer cells frequently metastasize to bone causing bone destruction and hypercalcemia 9 Parathyroid hormone related protein PTHrP secreted by these cells is a major mediator of the osteolytic process 10 Osteolysis leads to the release of TGF which in turn further induces PTHrP expression 11 Other tumor relevant genes such as pai 1 or upa can also be activated by TGF Hence downregulation of TGF mediated gene expression may counteract malignancy of cancer cells In this study we investigated whether two small molecules SB 203580 and SB 202190 could be used to downmodulate TGF induced transcriptional activation of TGF target genes In the past these compounds have been widely used as specific p38 inhibitors 12 and their inhibitory action has been well documented 13 14 15 However recent results show that in a comparable concentration range they inhibit the serine threonine kinase activity of TGF type I receptor preventing phosphorylation of R Smads 16 17 18 Here we show that in the highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA MB 231 the SB 202190 and SB 203580 inhibitors negatively altered Smad3 nuclear entry upon TGF stimulation This resulted in a reduced response of TGF inducible genes to TGF The degree of inhibition varied tremendously depending on the particular gene analyzed Results SB 202190 and SB 203580 downregulate transcription from TGF responsive genes Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 PAI 1 and PTHrP are known target genes of TGF signalling We have previously demonstrated that TGF upregulates PTHrP and PAI 1 RNA levels in MDA MB 231 cells 19 TGF affected PTHrP expression primarily by increasing the level of the promoter P3 specific transcript 19 Quantitative PCR analysis using primers allowing the detection of PTHrP P3 and PAI 1 transcripts indicated that incubation of MDA MB 231 cells with SB 202190 and SB 203580 greatly inhibited TGF induced increase in PTHrP and to a lesser extent PAI 1 mRNA levels Fig 1A 1B Next we examined whether inhibitory effects of these compounds can also be seen on the PAI 1 promoter in transient transfection assays By using 3TP Luc as a reporter plasmid we observed that TGF increased the activity of 3TP Luc by approximately 3 5 fold Fig 1C 1D Preincubation with the SB inhibitors reduced this activation almost to basal levels These data suggest that SB 202190 and SB 203580 inhibit TGF stimulated gene expression at least in part by downregulating transcription SB 202190 and SB 203580 deregulate TGF induced Smad3 nuclear accumulation It has recently been shown that SB 202190 and SB 203580 are able to inhibit TGF induced phosphorylation of Smad3 by the TGF receptor I kinase ALK5 and to interfere with nuclear localization of Smad3 17 Nuclear translocation of Smad3 results directly from TGF induced Smad3 phosphorylation and is therefore a measure of the activation status of ALK5 We wanted to know to what extent SB 202190 and SB 203580 interfere with TGF dependent Smad3 nuclear import in the invasive MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line We prepared nuclear and whole cell extracts from cells treated with TGF with or without preincubation of one of the SB inhibitors and analyzed those extracts for reactivity to a Smad2 3 specific antibody by Western blot analysis This antibody primarily interacts with Smad3 but to some extent it is also able to recognize Smad2 Based on Northern blot hybridization data Smad3 but not Smad2 is expressed in MDA MB 231 cells 21 Hence the data presented in Fig 2show the abundance of Smad3 in the nuclear and in the whole cell extracts We found that preincubation of cells with either SB 202190 or SB 203580 decreased the level of nuclear Smad3 in the presence of TGF Fig 2A whereas the total Smad3 protein level as assayed in whole cell extracts was not altered Next we studied the time course of TGF induced Smad3 nuclear entry in the presence or absence of SB 203580 MDA MB 231 cells were stimulated with TGF and harvested after various time points Nuclear extracts were prepared and subjected to Western blotting analysis using an anti Smad3 antibody Stimulation of the cells with TGF led to a rapid increase in nuclear Smad3 protein within 15 minutes and this level remained constant for 2 hours Thereafter it started to decrease However pretreatment of the cells with 20 M SB 203580 perturbed Smad3 nuclear accumulation reducing the amount of Smad3 entering the nucleus and shifting the peak level of nuclear Smad3 to a later time point Other kinase inhibitors fail to inhibit TGF mediated Smad3 nuclear entry We next explored the possibility that the MEK1 2 inhibitor PD98059 and the Rho associated kinase inhibitor Y 27632 might also interfere with Smad3 nuclear entry However both agents failed to reproduce the effect of the SB inhibitors as TGF induced nuclear accumulation of Smad3 was not affected by these inhibitors Fig 2C We also used the protein kinase C PKC activator phorbol 12 myristate 13 acetate PMA Fig 2C which appeared to enhance the amount of both basal and TGF induced nuclear Smad3 a phenomenon that has been reported earlier 22 TGF target genes respond differentially to inhibition of Smad3 nuclear import The delayed TGF mediated entry of Smad3 into the nucleus in the presence of SB 203580 prompted us to examine the effect of SB 203580 on TGF induced gene expression in a time course experiment We isolated total RNA from the same cell suspension that was used to prepare nuclear extracts for time course analysis in Fig 2B cDNA was synthesized and subjected to quantitative RT PCR in order to measure the transcript levels of several TGF target genes The genes being examined were divided into two groups I known TGF target genes pai 1 smad7 c myc upa and pthrp Fig 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E and II ets family genes ets 1 ets 2 and ese 1 esx Smad7 was of particular interest as it belongs to the inhibitory Smads which can counteract TGF induced gene activation 23 The response of the smad7 gene to TGF is unusually rapid 24 which is believed to stem from the peculiar nature of the Smad7 promoter that contains a perfect Smad binding site 25 Another inhibitory Smad protein is Smad6 We have not analyzed the expression of this protein since it preferentially inhibit bone morphogenetic protein BMP induced expression 26 In addition Smad6 shows varying effects on TGF signalling 27 Nor were TGF responsive genes such as p21 studied that are involved in cell cycle regulation Such genes are important targets at early stage carcinogenesis where TGF has a tumor suppressive rather than a tumor promoting function 28 In addition e g p21 protein is not dectable in MDA MB 231 cells 29 Of group I pai 1 pthrp and upa mRNAs were induced upon TGF treatment reaching maximum activation within three hours As expected the smad7 transcript was fully upregulated much earlier after approximately 60 min The c myc gene has been reported to be unresponsive to TGF signal transduction in MDA MB 231 cells 24 We also measured the effect of TGF on c myc RNA and confirmed these results as SB 203580 or control treatment failed to significantly modulate c myc transcript levels The inhibitory effect of SB 203580 showed remarkable variation among the genes examined The rapid induction of smad7 mRNA was basically unaffected by SB 203580 this could possibly explained by a lower amout of Smad3 necessary to activate the Smad7 promoter TGF induced pai 1 mRNA was reduced to approximately 50 by the SB inhibitor whereas TGF mediated expression of PTHrP and uPA was highly sensitive to SB 203580 treatment SB 203580 downmodulated expression of the latter genes to almost basal levels Two ets genes ets1 and ets2 were also affected by TGF and SB 203580 Group II Fig 3F 3G We observed that ets1 and ets2 transcript levels were slightly upregulated when cells were incubated with TGF and that this increase was partly inhibited by SB 203580 The other ets gene that we tested was ese 1 esx a recently characterized member of the ets gene family originally identified in epithelial cells 30 Ese 1 Esx has been found to regulate the expression of TGF type II receptor 31 We could show for the first time that the level of the Ese 1 Esx transcript was strongly downregulated in the presence of TGF The negative TGF effect on Ese 1 Esx expression could not be inhibited by SB 203580 Discussion Evidence has been accumulated that TGF promotes late stage tumorigenesis by stimulating angiogenesis and invasive behaviour of tumor cells enhancing immunosuppression and supporting epithelial mesenchymal transition of cancer cells 4 Furthermore TGF is believed to be part of a vicious circle in bone metastases as it gets released from osteoclast degraded bone substance and subsequently stimulates PTHrP gene expression in nearby metastatic cancer cells which in turn leads to an activation of osteoclastic bone resorption 11 Therefore it is of great interest to understand in more detail the molecular aspects of TGF mediated gene expression in metastatic breast cancer cells and to explore ways to interfere with this tumorigenic signalling Here we report that two small molecules SB 202190 and SB 203580 diminished TGF induced expression of TGF target genes which was accompanied by a perturbation of TGF mediated Smad3 nuclear accumulation a crucial step in TGF signal transduction Using SB 203580 we found that not only was the total level of nuclear Smad3 in the presence of TGF reduced but also that the nuclear entry of Smad3 was delayed and less prolonged Interestingly treating cells with TGF for 60 min yielded a similar amount of Smad3 in the nucleus irrespective of whether SB 203580 was present or not However when the time of TGF treatment was reduced to 15 min or prolonged to 180 or 240 min SB 203580 had a tremendous effect on Smad3 translocation to the nucleus The altered kinetic of TGF dependent Smad3 nuclear entry as induced by SB 203580 coincided with the efficacy by which this agent repressed the activity of the different TGF target genes Fast TGF responder genes such as smad7 whose maximum activation by TGF was reached after 60 min was only slightly affected by SB 203580 while slow responders such as pai 1 pthrp or upa that showed peak activation after 180 240 min were very sensitive to the repressive effect of SB 203580 The strongest effect of SB 203580 was found on the TGF dependent expression of pthrp and upa In these cases the inhibitor completely eliminated responsiveness to TGF How could these differential effect of SB 203580 on TGF induced gene expression be explained It is clear that the smad7 gene expression is regulated by TGF in a Smad3 4 dependent manner 32 as it was found for the pthrp and the pai 1 gene 19 33 However the Smad3 responsive elements are different The smad7 gene contains a perfect palindromic Smad binding element GTCTAGAC while the pai 1 and the pthrp promoters harbor AGAC tandem repeats 19 33 which binds Smad proteins less efficiently 34 The upa gene contains only an AP1 binding site which resembles the Smad3 4 responsive AGAC motif 35 A weaker binding site could require Smad3 to be present at higher concentrations for efficient binding and would make TGF dependent transcription from a gene more vulnerable to reduced nuclear accumulation of the Smad3 protein TGF induced stabilization of the mRNA may also be important for the sensitivity to SB 203580 TGF has been shown also to stabilize the mRNA of the smad7 gene 25 while stabilization of RNA does not play a major role in regulation of the pthrp gene in MDA MB 231 cells 19 In addition SB 203580 also inhibits p38 activity which has been shown to play a role in TGF signalling 36 37 38 39 40 41 Hence several factors could be responsible for the differential sensitivity of TGF responsive genes to SB 203580 Members of the Ets family of transcription factors share a unique DNA binding domain the Ets domain and have been shown to activate a large number of genes 42 43 and to be involved in a number of physiological and pathophysiological processes 44 There has been accumulating evidence that Ets proteins play an important part for the invasive program of cells particularly by stimulating the expression of protease genes 45 46 Ets1 and Ets2 are overexpressed in a variety of tumors including breast carcinomas 44 and references therein Furthermore our previous work has shown that in invasive breast cancer cells Ets proteins activate the PTHrP P3 promoter in cooperation with Smad3 19 In this context it is interesting to note that TGF signalling seemed to target the ets 1 and ets 2 gene Fig 3F 3G Analysis of the human ets 1 promoter sequence revealed that it contains elements similar to TGF responsive sites in other promoters R Lindemann unpublished observation We present data showing that TGF downregulated the Ese 1 Esx transcript a novel and yet unpublished finding Ese 1 Esx is a member of the Ets transcription factor family and is expressed mainly in epithelial tissue 30 Its expression has been detected during mammary gland development and breast tumorigenesis 47 48 It is noteworthy that Ese 1 Esx is a potential transcriptional regulator of the TGF type II receptor 31 and overexpression of Ese 1 Esx in non invasive cells leads to a reduction in cell growth in the presence of TGF presumably because of an increased TGF type II receptor level 49 It is interesting that TGF dependent downregulation of Ese 1 Esx is not affected by SB 203580 It is possible that TGF does not require Smad3 4 or p38 to inhibit Ese 1 Esx expression Alternatively inhibitory Smad7 whose expression was increased by TGF but not affected by SB 203580 may be involved in this process One way by which Smad7 can inhibit TGF dependent gene expression is by blocking phosphorylation and hence nuclear import of Smad3 and Smad2 23 More recent data showing that Smad7 is able to interact with histone deacetylases suggest an additional role for Smad7 as a transcriptional co repressor 50 Thus Smad7 might interfere directly with Ese 1 Esx gene transcription However TGF downregulated Ese 1 Esx mRNA levels faster than it upregulated Smad7 expression excluding the possibility that Smad7 mediates the TGF effect on Ese 1 Esx at least at the initial phase Another candidate that could be responsible for this process is c Jun N terminal kinase JNK JNK has been described to drive TGF dependent fibronectin synthesis independent of Smad4 and p38 51 In contrast to Smad3 JNK is activated by the TGF receptor I in a way that does not require the kinase domain 52 This supports the notion that activation of Smad3 and JNK by TGF are independent events It is remarkable that a constitutively active form of JNK activator MKK and Smad7 are able to cooperatively downregulate TGF responsive promoters 53 It is quite possible that a Smad7 JNK synergistic interaction is involved in the TGF dependent downregulation of Ese 1 Esx expression where JNK alone might mediate the initiation of the TGF induced repression Conclusions We demonstrate that treatment of invasive MDA MB 231 breast cancer cells with SB 202190 and SB 203580 interferes with TGF induced Smad3 nuclear accumulation and that this is paralleled by a differential transcriptional response of TGF target genes Strikingly SB 202190 and SB 203580 suppressed TGF dependent activation of those genes that are important for the acquisition of invasive behavior while having no effect on the expression of the natural TGF inhibitor Smad7 This suggests that these compounds may be useful to interfere with malignant behavior of cancer cells Furthermore we show for the first time that in breast cancer cells the Ese 1 Esx mRNA is downregulated by TGF Methods Cell lines plasmids and chemicals MDA MB 231 breast cancer cell line
