 Background Many animals have evolved to survive seasonally recurring adverse conditions by entering a diapause stage Diapause is generally characterized by a slowing of metabolism a reduction or elimination of cell division and a cessation of morphological development evident as a resting stage 1 Diapause occurs in response to stimuli that predict adverse environmental conditions not in response to the conditions themselves Once in diapause development is not resumed even if conditions return to those amenable to growth It is this lack of responsiveness that is a distinguishing characteristic of diapause 2 In most animals diapause can occur only at a specific developmental stage be it as an embryo juvenile or adult Diapause therefore represents a discrete developmental process that should be controlled at least in part by stereotyped gene expression Until recently diapause was generally considered a physiological phenomenon and much research had concerned the conditions that induce diapause and the endocrinology of its regulation 2 3 Nevertheless diapause is also a developmental process and these previous studies did not address fundamental questions concerning development before during and after diapause More recent research has begun to focus on the molecular aspects of diapause with studies of Bombyx morii Sarcophaga crassipalis and Lymantria dispar identifying genes up and down regulated during diapause 1 4 5 6 7 In order to complete this picture however detailed descriptions of the morphological aspects of development spanning diapause are also necessary The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum Hemiptera Aphidoidea ostensibly undergoes embryonic diapause as an over wintering egg figure 1 During spring and summer aphids reproduce through viviparous parthenogenesis In the fall however low temperatures and short days result in the production of egg laying females and males to inseminate them The females produce eggs that hatch the following spring when the life cycle is repeated The total period of egg development is reported as approximately 100 days 8 In contrast parthenogenetic embryogenesis is completed in approximately 10 days It has been assumed that the order of magnitude difference in developmental rate between the two forms is due to diapause in the sexually produced embryos 8 However detailed embryological studies of sexually produced embryos has yet to be conducted so this remains an assumption Certain aspects of aphid egg development have been elucidated in other species The conditions required to induce the production of sexual males and females has been established 8 9 There has also been work on the influence of genetic background and the environment on the duration of egg development in different species and strains 10 11 The most comprehensive study of aphid egg development by Behrandt 12 suggests that it constitutes three stages i a temperature dependent period of initial development ii a temperature independent diapause followed by iii temperature dependent development Additionally development is only completed successfully if the eggs are chilled for at least a short period of time during early development The embryonic stage upon which diapause is supposed to impinge is however unclear According to Behrandt diapause occurs at the end of anatrepsis germband immersion in Aphis fabae This has been corroborated by the observation that in Sitobioum graminum the majority of embryos also pass winter at the end of anatrepsis 13 and the same may be true of Aphis pomi in Virginia USA 14 Other aphids however including German clones of Aphis pomi appear to develop constantly throughout the winter with no definite resting stage 15 A resting stage is a widely reported characteristic of diapause 1 2 16 17 18 and so the extent to which diapause occurs generally in aphids is therefore in some doubt Here we present a description of the development of sexually produced pea aphid embryos We maintained embryos under conditions that mimic those experienced naturally 0 4 C and tracked their development through sampling and dissection In aphids and most other insects however there is a strong relationship between temperature and developmental rate 19 In order therefore to determine whether any resting stage we observed at 0 4 C was truly diapause and not a consequence of low rearing temperatures we also tracked the development of embryos maintained under warmer conditions 10 C and 16 C Any putative diapause observed at 0 4 C should also be observed at higher temperatures Further to determine whether there was a cessation of cell division at any point during development we immunostained the embryos with anti Histone H3 which identifies cells undergoing mitosis Finally we tested whether putatively diapausing embryos could resume development and hatch earlier than the reported 100 days 8 by transferring embryos from 0 4 C to 16 C at day 49 and tracking their development We show that under winter like conditions development is continuous but slow and progresses in a temperature independent manner for part of the time The data indicate that A pisum undergoes a type of diapause but one that is different from the cessation of development presented as diapause in many other insects Results Embryonic development at 0 4 C The first 15 days of development at 16 C of a sexually produced A pisum embryo has been described previously by Miura et al 20 By the end of this period the embryo has completed anatrepsis and is lying immersed in the yolk The embryo is fully segmented and the limb buds are clearly defined figure 2A and is orientated such that its anterior lies at the posterior of the egg and its dorsal side faces the ventral side of the egg By day 15 the embryo is assumed to have entered diapause as subsequent chilling does not prohibit successful hatching 8 At day 16 all the embryos were transferred from a constant 16 C to one of three different temperature regimes 1 4 C in the light and 0 C in the dark 2 constant 10 C 3 constant 16 C all with a 13L 11D photoperiod Figure 3shows the changes in length of the body and third leg from day 21 to completion of development for all three temperature regimes We will discuss each treatment separately The sexually produced A pisum embryo lacked a distinct resting stage when maintained at 0 4 C Although there was no significant change in the length of the embryo from day 21 to 56 figure 3 there was continued growth of the legs and further differentiation of the organs most obviously of the gut not shown Figure 2illustrates the development of an embryo maintained at 4 C days and 0 C nights from day 15 85 Staining with anti Histone H3 revealed cell division in most but not all of the embryos collected throughout this period figures 2B 2C 2D Cell division was detected in a number of embryos from every sample indicating there was no uniform resting stage at a particular age After day 56 the embryo increased in body length and between day 63 and 77 it began to undergo katatrepsis figures 2G 2H 2I 2J the process by which the embryo re orientates in the egg By the beginning of katatrepsis day 63 the embryos had moved to the posterior of the egg such that the amnion and serosa lie in contact figure 2G Subsequent embryological movements suggest that these membranes fuse and the head of the embryo emerges from the opening to move up the ventral side of the egg as the serosa shrinks At day 70 the embryo has curled at the posterior of the egg with its heads against the ventral side of the egg figure 2H It was not possible to distinguish between the amnion and the serosa once they had fused so we will collectively refer to them as the amnioserosa By day 77 the embryo had completed katatrepsis and was positioned with its anterior lying at the anterior of the egg and its posterior lying at the posterior of the egg figures 2I 2J At this stage the embryo had a cap like structure at the front of its head which appears to be the remains of the amnioserosa Either during or after this process of embryonic reorientation the embryo underwent dorsal closure It is unclear how this was achieved but by day 84 it had been completed as the embryo had deposited an embryonic cuticle figure 2K This cuticle was shed upon hatching and possessed a serrated egg burster at the anterior end Hatching was almost immediate upon transfer to 16 C at day 98 Sixty nine percent n 62 of the transferred eggs hatched and all within 4 days of transfer mean 1 29 days S D 0 67 Embryonic development at 10 C Embryonic development at 10 C suggests that early development of the sexually produced A pisum embryo particularly before katatrepsis is temperature independent Figure 3shows the growth of aphid embryos maintained at 10 C The rate of body and leg growth in embryos prior to katatrepsis was not significantly higher in embryos maintained at 10 C than embryos

revealed cell division at all ages Late development of the sexually produced A pisum embryo particularly during and after katatrepsis appeared to be temperature dependent Embryos maintained at 10 C underwent katatrepsis earlier than embryos maintain at 0 4 C Katatrepsis commenced after day 63 at 0 4 C but after day 56 at 10 C figure 4 Because the rate of growth prior to katatrepsis was the same at both temperatures 10 C embryos that undertook early katatrepsis appeared to do so at a less developed stage that is embryos just prior to katatrepsis had significantly shorter bodies at 10 C than at 0 4 C figure 5 Nevertheless embryos that had just completed katatrepsis were the same size at 10 C as at 0 4 C figure 5 Development was completed by day 77 at 10 C in contrast to day 100 at 0 4 C Hatching success in embryos maintained at 10 C was lower than at 0 4 C Three embryos hatched after 58 days at 10 C and one more hatched a day later n 80 Upon transfer to 16 C on day 78 only 26 of the eggs hatched n 31 over a period of 8 days mean 3 6 days S D 3 6 Embryonic development at 16 C Embryonic development at 16 C again suggests that early development of the sexually produced A pisum embryo is temperature independent Figure 3shows the developmental progress of aphids maintained at 16 C Statistical analysis revealed that for those embryos that apparently developed normally the rate of growth prior to katatrepsis was not significantly higher at 16 C than at 0 4 C for both overall body length and leg length GLM body or leg length time temperature time temperature Body F time

appeared to undertake katatrepsis at a less developed stage at 16 C than at 0 4 C that is embryos just prior to katatrepsis had significantly shorter bodies at 16 C than at 0 4 C figure 5 Nevertheless embryos that had just completed katatrepsis were the same size at 16 C as at 0 4 C figure 5 Interpreting these data is however problematic as a high proportion of 16 C embryos showed moderate to severe developmental malformation making measurement of body and leg length difficult Malformed embryos were not included in the statistical analysis of growth rates Figure 6shows two embryos maintained at 16 C Typically the embryos showed accelerated development of part but not all of their morphology In particular many embryos appeared to initiate katatrepsis whilst still under developed resulting in embryos with an embryonic cuticle and egg burster but short or absent limbs The proportion of malformed embryos increased with time after egg laying By day 28 10 of sampled embryos showed some abnormality rising to 90 of embryos sampled on day 49 None of the embryos maintained at 16 C either completed development or hatched Embryonic development after transfer from 0 4 C to 16 C Transferring aphids from 0 4 C to 16 C on day 49 resulted in almost immediate katatrepsis followed by a rapid completion of development figure 7 Aphids began to hatch four days after transfer mean 6 8 days S D 1 4 with 49 of eggs hatching n 260 Discussion The data suggest that sexually produced A pisum embryos undergo a period of diapause although a diapause different to that commonly presented in the literature Diapause typically involves as a period of developmental arrest during which an insect is resistant to environmental influences on developmental progression 2 Sexually produced A pisum embryos do not demonstrate developmental arrest Whilst there is little increase in overall body size between anatrepsis and katatrepsis there is continued growth of the legs and further differentiation of body organs A pisum embryos do however show resistance to environmental influences on developmental progression Growth rate up to katatrepsis is the same at 0 4 C 10 C and 16 C This is in contrast to asexually produced embryos where growth rate approximately doubles between 5 C and 10 C and between 10 C and 16 C 19 In sexually produced embryos the period of temperature independent development or diapause ends around katatrepsis After this point development becomes temperature dependent with more rapid growth at 10 C than at 0 4 C Katatrepsis and the end of diapause however occurs earlier in embryos maintained at higher temperatures 10 C and 16 C and can be bought forward in embryos maintained at 0 4 C by transferring them to 16 C at day 49 At all the temperatures tested there was no cessation of morphological development Cell division was evident at all ages and at 0 4 C at least there was continued growth of the legs This appears to be somewhat contrary to the traditional understanding of diapause which typically involves a distinct resting stage 1 21 Much research has revealed however that even during the resting stage there are physiological changes in the diapausing insect leading to the concept of diapause development 22 23 Nevertheless such development appears to be primarily physiological rather than morphological and was defined as physiogenesis by Andrewartha 1952 It is possible that the morphological development observed in diapausing A pisum is exceptional Alternatively diapause in many other insects may also involve a slowing but not a cessation of morphological development It is difficult to test this notion with the current literature as timed dissections of diapausing embryos larvae and pupae have rarely been conducted There are however a few examples of continued morphological development during diapause Diapausing embryos of the orthopteran Austroicetes cruciata undergo slow development for the first two months of diapause before entering a resting stage 24 Similarly caterpillars of Cirphus unipunctata and Laphygma exigua continue to feed and develop during diapause albeit at a much reduced rate 25 and caterpillars of the corn stalk borer Sesamia nonagriodes undergo non stationary moults during diapause 26 These examples hint that the expression of diapause controlled dormancy may vary between species 2 Consequently diapause could be considered extreme regulation of developmental rate rather than a shutting down of morphological development The mechanisms that control diapause in A pisum may therefore be the same as those that control the rate of morphological development at other stages of development Several insects that diapause over winter are resistant to environmental conditions conducive to growth only at the beginning of winter 27 28 29 30 31 This prevents premature emergence be it from egg larvae or pupae just at the onset of the cold temperatures the insect is trying to avoid Once winter has commenced diapause ends and the insect enters post diapause quiescence relying on persistent low temperatures to maintain developmental arrest 27 This appears to be the case in A pisum The aphid clone used for the experiment would normally oviposit in mid October when the average daily temperature is 9 C with a maximum of 15 C 32 By day 28 the embryos would be exposed to average daily temperatures of 3 C Consequently whilst A pisum maintained at 0 4 C had regained temperature dependent growth by day 49 figure 7 it would not normally be exposed to warmer conditions until the following spring approximately 150 days later By this time the aphid would be fully developed and ready to hatch In embryos that remained at 0 4 C until day 98 there was no obvious difference in development rate during and after diapause and this is consistent with observations in other insects 1 27 There must however be some change in condition to move development from being temperature independent to temperature dependent 1 This change appears to be at or around katatrepsis Identifying what this change is and what if anything it has to do with katatrepsis will be key to understanding how the pea aphid controls development during diapause The finding that A pisum embryos maintained at 16 C showed considerable malformation may be a consequence of surpassing the normal thermal limits of developmental regulation The genetic pathways involved in the development of A pisum embryos must build an animal under two conditions The first is slow temperature independent development at low ambient temperatures in sexually produced embryos and the second is rapid temperature dependent development at higher ambient temperatures in asexually produced embryos Presumably the same pathways are involved in both processes it would be surprising if A pisum were to have different sets of genes for the two modes of development Diapause may therefore act to limit the speed of reactions that would otherwise occur more rapidly at higher temperatures possibly through the action of an inhibitory factor 22 33 According to this model the higher the ambient temperature the greater the required activity of the inhibitory factor 33 When temperatures are maintained at abnormally high temperatures 16 C regulation may be compromised with only some aspects of development slowed This may result in embryos displaying a mosaic of developmental stages Alternatively the malformed phenotypes seen at 16 C may result form differing levels of temperature independence for different developmental processes There would be no selection on embryos to make later developmental processes temperature independent as they normally occur during winter At unnaturally high temperatures for example 16 C these later temperature dependent processes may occur prematurely resulting in embryos displaying a mosaic of developmental stages This hypothesis suggests that the timing of some developmental processes occurs independently i e that the beginning of one developmental process is not contingent on the ending of another This appears to be the case for katatrepsis which occurs in smaller embryos at higher temperatures Premature katatrepsis did not in itself cause the malformations Embryos transferred to 16 C from 0 4 C on day 49 underwent early katatrepsis but displayed a high hatching success It is perhaps surprising that many embryos should develop abnormally at 16 C given that they would encounter temperatures as high or higher during winter in their natural environment However such high temperatures would be experienced only temporarily and it may be persistent exposure to high temperatures that caused the developmental abnormalities in our experiment Further research is therefore necessary to determine the influence of fluctuating temperatures on developmental progression both with respect to developmental abnormalities and developmental rate There has been little progress towards identifying the genetic control of diapause in insects The one system where diapause has been well elucidated dauer formation in the nematode C elegans indicates that the insulin pathway plays an important role 34 Recent work on mutant Drosophila that mimic reproductive diapause in adults also suggests a role for insulin 35 36 Insulin which regulates growth in other stages of development in Drosophila 37 38 may therefore play a similar role during A pisum diapause Work on diapause in the flesh fly Sarcophaga crassipalpis has identified a second class of genes that may be involved in diapause regulation 39 These are the heat shock proteins which are normally expressed during times of stress 40 and which provide cryptoprotection during diapause Since heat shock proteins are also involved in cell cycle arrest however they may play a more central role in the regulation of diapause 1 Heat shock proteins are also typically heat inducible and so fit with the concept of a temperature dependent inhibitory factor 33 Additionally high levels of heat shock proteins may disrupt development 41 which could help explain the developmental defects observed in embryos maintained at 16 C Further work on the expression of both insulin and heat shock proteins in A pisum embryos will clarify their respective roles Conclusion Diapause in the pea aphid involves a period of slow growth the progression of which is temperature independent There is no distinct resting stage which is characteristic of diapause in many insects Diapause in the pea aphid represents an extreme regulation of developmental rate and may be controlled by the same mechanisms that control developmental rate at other life stages Methods Egg material We produced sexually reproducing male and female aphids by exposing asexual females from a single clone LSR1 collected near Ithaca NY to autumnal conditions short day illumination 13L 11D 16 C for five weeks Sexuals were collected and placed at a ratio of two males to eight females in 16 mm diameter petri dishes holding single leaves of Medicago arborea inserted into 3 ml of 2 agar with 1gL 1of Miracle Gro The Scotts Company OH Every day we collected any eggs deposited on the leaves with a soft moist paintbrush and transferred them to dampened filter paper placed in the lid of a 16 mm diameter petri dish Each cohort of eggs therefore contained eggs laid over a 24 hour period The eggs were then kept at 16 C 13L 11D for a further 14 days On day 16 we sterilised the eggs by immersing them in 1 formaldehyde for 10 minutes and then washing them three times in double distilled water Sterilisation and washing took place in a Buchner funnel with liquids being passed through the filter paper on which the eggs rested The eggs remained on their original filter paper throughout which while still moist was transferred to a fresh sterile petri dish We then sealed the dishes with parafilm United American Can WI and placed them in incubators Model I 30BLL Percival Scientific Inc IA for storage Egg storage To determine the influence of temperature on the progression of development we stored the eggs under three temperature regimes all with the same 13L 11D photoperiod 1 4 C in the light and 0 C in the dark 2 constant 10 C 3 constant 16 C The first temperature regime most closely mimics natural conditions and has been previously used to successfully rear eggs to hatching 8 Under each temperature regime eggs were sampled for dissection every seven days starting on day 21 Preliminary experiments indicated that eggs maintained at 0 4 C hatched successfully when transferred to 16 C when approximately 100 days old Consequently eggs kept at 0 4 C were transferred to 16 C on day 98 for hatching Eggs kept at 10 C were transferred to 16 C on day 78 for hatching Additionally a subset of eggs maintained at 0 4 C were transferred to 16 C on day 49 and sampled daily from day 50 to 59 Egg fixing dissection and staining Eggs were dechorionated in 50 bleach for 2 minutes They were then transferred to a 0 5 mL eppendorf tube containing 4 paraformaldehyde in PBS heptane 1 1 and agitated for 45 minutes The paraformaldehyde was then replaced with methanol and the tube was shaken to pop the vitelline membrane The embryos were then transferred to absolute methanol and stored at 20 C until dissection Dissection began with the removal of the black serosal cutical by sticking the eggs to a microscope slide with double sided sticky tape covering with PBS piercing the serosal cuticle and pushing out the embryo and yolk with a hypodermic needle The embryos were then separated from the yolk using pulled glass needles again under PBS In order to detect cell division during putative diapause we immunostained the embryos with anti phospho S10 acetyl K14 Histone H3 anti Histone H3 rabbit immunoaffinity purified IgG Upstate Group Inc MA This anti body recognizes Histone H3 phosphorylated at serine 10 and acetylated at lysine 14 which occurs only during mitotic cell division Fixed embryos were washed for 30 minutes in 0 3 Triton X 100 in PBS PBT and then blocked for 30 minutes with 2 Normal Goat Serum NGS 0 2 Bovine Serum Albumin BSA in PBT BBT NGS Embryos were incubated for at least 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 C with the primary antibody in BBT NGS and then washed four times in BBT Embryos were blocked with BBT NGS for 30 minutes prior to incubation with the biotin conjugated secondary antibodies in BBT NGS for at least 2 hours at room temperature or overnight at 4 C Embryos were washed four times before being developed using the Vectastain ABC kit Elite Vector CA and diaminobenzidine Sigma Fast DAB The embryos were subsequently mounted in 70 glycerol in PBS and their image digitized Embryo size measurement The size of embryos was determined from their digitized image using the software IPlab Scanalytics Inc VA We measured both the total length of the embryo and the length of the third leg Where the embryo was curled the length was estimated as the sum of several linear measurements approximating the curvature of the embryo Statistical analysis To determine whether the growth rate was influenced by temperature we plotted body and leg length against age in days under each of the different temperature regimes The gradient of the line is the rate of growth We statistically tested whether temperature influenced the rate of growth using the model body or leg length a age b temperature c temperature age k We treated time as a continuous variable and rearing temperature as a categorical variable We fitted this model to the data using a generalized linear model GLM with the program JMP 4 04 SAS Institute Inc NC This analysis gives estimates of the coefficients a b c and k and tests whether they are significantly different from zero The coefficient a gives the slope of the relationship between length and age and is the rate of growth The coefficient b gives the relationship between temperature and length and indicates if embryos reared at a different temperatures are longer or shorter The coefficient c indicates whether there is an interaction between the affects of temperature and age on length If this interaction term is significantly different from zero it indicates that the slope of the relationship between length and age rate of development varies with temperature All the data were log transformed prior to analysis to uphold assumptions of normality
