 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudence Long ago I read in the Tiffany Manners for Teenagers book that a gentleman should never wipe up anything he accidentally spills in a lady s lap This suggests to me that our president IS a perfect gentleman but should this point of etiquette always be followed in cases of possibly impeachable offenses Thoughtfully Susan Easton Dear Thought Prudie believes the Tiffany Manners people would be pleased to update their book to keep up with developments however Prudie suspects that impeachable offenses would be applicable to so few teens that the lap etiquette will remain unchanged You were nice to call the president a perfect gentleman Prudie is betting that s the only compliment he s received on his manners since oh January Prudie primly Dear Prudie If only Monica had had the sense to write her Aunt Prudie perhaps none of this might have happened How d you like to be in the powder room with them when she and Linda Tripp bump into each other next time M F in Boston Dear M You are too kind about Prudie s persuasive abilities Perhaps you will be cheered to know that most people don t seek advice before they enter an affair only after In Monica s case though it is tempting to think What if Prudie thinks What if the president weren t so keen on pizza In any case something Prudie doesn t want to think about is the powder room scene you fantasize It would no doubt make the roller derby look demure Prudie modestly Dear Prudence I m often asked to contribute to various and numerous causes However I am currently limiting my donations to a select few organizations Despite the tax benefits that are available from deducting such contributions I am ambivalent about giving The reasons are 1 I do not want to wind up on donor lists and be badgered for more donations I want to give whenever and wherever I choose 2 I do not want to be put on mailing lists that are shared among other charitable groups This only compounds the first problem I ve tried to think of ways to contribute anonymously but can t think of a good way Can you Thank you in advance Wanting to stay Anonymous Anywhere USA Dear Anon With a check to the charity of your choice can go a note asking that your name not be shared or put on a list and that any donor list show your gift as having come from Anonymous You can make these requests a condition of your continued support If you want to remain really unknown your bank can issue a draft akin to a cashier s check or you can arrange a money order Prudie charitably Dear Prudence Why does everyone keep insisting this whole Clinton mess is a sex thing It isn t a sex thing It s a lying thing and we need to take it seriously A leader needs credibility and people need to be able to trust his judgment Clinton has lost that Instead every decision out of the White House will now be viewed by the world with a Wag the Dog cynicism Do we really want to be the laughingstock of the world Let s get him out so we can maintain what little credibility America has left Truthful in Torrance Dear Truth Prudie would not disagree with you and finds Mr Clinton is only an embarrassment on days ending in Y Prudie sympathetically Dear Prudence In the good old days when folks retired after 30 years in the same office it was usually a moderately festive occasion A going away gift and cards would be presented and people would say nice things Today it seems that people are often hustled out of the office in the dead of night and we learn of their departure by accident Of course many employers have legitimate concerns about security and trade secrets and the like And perhaps there is a human resources professional somewhere who says that cutting the cord quickly is best But the question remains Should a group organize and bid adieu to someone who has suddenly disappeared Your Advice Please Dear Your What with downsizing as commonplace as it is the country would be engaged in one continuous retirement party if everyone did as you suggest Good hearted of you though to want to organize a proper farewell If a special friend has been found redundant as the Brits say by all means take that person to lunch and include other interested mourners I mean co workers Prudie festively
