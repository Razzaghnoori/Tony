 all right well what do you think about women s role s in the last generation what uh what changes have you seen well i have noticed a lot uh more women s roles at work which i like in management which that s good i i guess to have a woman s viewpoints and uh in a way things are handled at work especially in personnel type jobs which i think is probably better on the hand of women for uh any kind of maternity benefits and stuff like that women probably understand that better than the men do so i think that s good well yeah yeah i would imagine women would understand maternity a lot better than men yeah we only have to get up for you know for the daytime feedings i think i think that that s a good benefit i think having women uh in in higher up positions stuff like that well i ve noticed that it seems uh some women are i guess what i call the feministus you know or you know very strong uh you know women s libbers and others that don t want to be and it s it s confusing trying to figure out which one is which yeah you don t know whether to call Ms or Mrs you know uh huh yeah right and how to treat them right right and who wants to be treated which way yeah i think they should all wear signs you know or something but uh i i i found it interesting especially uh being from a military background yeah the current fuss over whether women should go into combat or not right i thought that was really interesting in the war i figure i can t figure anybody who would voluntarily want to go right if you can stay out of it although i guess although i did notice that all the ones who were saying women should have to be in combat were too old and fat to go they couldn t do anything about it now it s kind of like when the men do you course you you used to saying used to be the old men declare the war and the young men fight it and now and now it s it s i m happy to see that the women have the same problem that the men has had because they got the old fat women yelling well yeah they ought to fight but course they don t have to go right right that s exactly right they can just watch it i always wanted to put Gloria Steinem on a set of camels and send her over to the Gulf and let her fight but i think it s uh i think if they want to do it you know if that s what interests them and they think you know they can handle it i think they ought to be able to do it well they couldn t be worse than some of the men that s right and i don t i think it all depends on mental set more than sex right that s exactly right now they re trained and everything so let them do it if they want to that s that s the way it is in a lot of jobs you know like the firemen you know for a long time they thought stuff like that you know trying to be firemen policemen and stuff like that now they get to be all that well if i think if you know regardless of sex whether you can if you can handle the job then i think you should be able to do it right but i do object to you know someone hiring a woman just because they have to meet their quota that s exactly and i feel the same exact same way i don t think that s right that s that s really just kind of discrimination no matter how any way you put it right you re uh you know it s the best person qualified i think and and that s the way it ought to be but it s as we know it s not yeah i i stutter to think that i may be flying in a seven forty seven with a woman who got on the flight program because she happened to have the right you know the right sex rather than qualifications right exactly same with a doctor in a hospital yeah that s true i hate to i hate to look up and find someone who was admitted to medical school simply because she happened to be a female that s right you know she got that scholarship or a Black woman named Rodriguez right they need to give the scholarship to a woman that s true that s true with any case i hate that but but that is true but well i think we are that society tends to overcompensate right much with whatever it s with the Black the Black problem or whatever that may be now it s yeah ethnic any ethnic problem or race or with uh anything ethnic problems uh i think society society tends to overcompensate and we go we swing we swing out to the far left and far right trying to get everybody in um hum don t want to hurt anybody s feelings and get everybody covered oh that s true oh yeah God forbid you should make some kind of sexist remark and say you know um hum hey sweetie or something um hum and now everything s his you know uh his and her and everything you have to you always have to say it like that you can never say you know his you know and that never has offended me when you know when someone s talking and they say you know his job or something like that or right a wait person that s never i mean i understand that they re talking about the job not the person in the job that s that s always that s always been strange i thought but some women like to fight it what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female but yeah she is she i i don t know i i can t say that that i i well i can t say that i did or didn t vote for her because i didn t get to vote this time but i don t know that i m i guess i m ready just hard to see a woman in such a i guess powerful position i think i m more scared of her not because she s a female but because more for her political political beliefs and what she says she s going to do i think i d be scared of anybody male or female in that position right right right although you see more and more uh more and more of the ladies that are becoming active in politics i know that s true and and you know occupying a very prominent role with the politics and in the business sector right inexperience also that s something that bothers me is uh even though she is you know the treasurer forever it bothers me that i don t know that she doesn t have that much background i guess in well it s hard to say i don t know something about it just just kind of bothers me i think her backgro und totally bothers me yeah she i mean she seems on the outside uh good and everything but but i don t know it just it just kind of bothers me and that that just may be because we re not used to having i m not used to having women in in roles like that you know as role models that could be yeah you re just always used to men i mean that s just something that men always did yeah the governor was you know the governor he did this right an d now we got the governor she s going to do that that s exactly right and wonder what they ll call if she was married and wonder if they ll refer to him as the first husband probably yeah and in Dallas you know we had the uh Annette Strauss and she s a uh first woman mayor so oh yeah Houston got a female mayor do they yeah i didn t know that she oh yeah she s a she s a staunch supporter of all the uh gay rights matter fact she lives down in the gay district oh does she really oh yeah oh Lord so i think you know i i m not sure whether she was elected because she was a female or because or because she supported the gays i really don t know because a large you know there s a large population down there of gays big combination of both she s got covered all the bases didn t she yeah yeah she seems to be interesting i i and you see more and more uh you know uh Mickey Leland s wife is yeah taking over his seat and course you know we got the like you said they elected a female mayor in Dallas one in Houston we got a female governor and there s two or three more governors in in the in the state that are females right that s really good i guess and there s quite a few if they can do the job i think more power to them you know i would i i i would dearly love to find out that you know i could i could say well i guess i was wrong about Ann Richards right yeah yeah they always they they say a lot of times that you know woman have more emotions and they can or cannot handle a job because of that so that s going to be interesting to see how that kind of stuff does play into it because a lot of times you know you do look at the men and they never seem to show any emotion they just yeah but i think we re bred that way you know i think i think it s part of the yeah exactly and that s of the of the male mystique that s that s sad to say that that that that s true though and uh so course the reason yeah i think it s going to be harder for for females in the next ten years or so to make strides in say you know the Southwest and Midwest and you down here um hum in the southern states than it will be up in the more liberal east and west coast right right this is you know i am surprised though that we do have so many that are in politics down here we don t have quite as many as they do east and west coast but this is kind of the last bastion of the you know the yeah the good ole boys with the pickup and the rifle on the back and the quart of beer down your down between your legs driving down the road yeah yeah yeah and of course that s changing too but you know i think and that came about because of the women you know Mothers Against Drunk Driving MADD that s right that was a good that was a good leadership the greatest force in America is mothers that women that s what they say that s true if you could mobilize the mothers you got them that s true well i hope yeah you know that they whatever these leaders of ours do that everything s for the good that just like like you said it s with man or a woman it should however they re going to be able to uh take care of us i don t know just depends on who s going to exploit us when yeah i do know though in our company we don t have a lot of upper upper management women i mean we rarely have any women that are upper management is that because they re just not uh you just don t have any women that are there or no one has i don t know ascended to that level yet i don t know that s really that s really well it s it s so uh i guess we re we re kind of the good old boy type atmosphere of men always did the you know the engineering and all this and the technology and men are so i m i m sure that s has a lot to do with it i ve noticed that in a lot of companies that you know everybody says well there s no women in upper management and my first question well is there anyone qualified to be there right right just because you happen to be a a female or a minority or anything else doesn t automatically mean you it shouldn t mean that you get promoted to that part that s right that s exactly right so but a lot of more women are starting their own businesses i ve noticed than yeah and that s that s pretty interesting we have several here in Austin that have uh i guess started up uh one of them matter fact runs a furniture uh place she builds library furniture oh does she that s pretty interesting and she and she s take she s taking over and it s uh it s it s a million dollar a year company and she s having a ball doing it yeah there s a lady here in uh Dallas who started a mozzarella or a cheese company can t remember the name of it and she s a multimillionaire from it and i i just think God if only it could be me yeah yeah i ve got several uh matter fact i have some friends that own machine shops and they have several
