 Introduction Alzheimer disease is the leading cause of dementia among the elderly and is characterized by accumulation of extracellular and vascular amyloid in the brain 1 Amyloid deposits are composed of the amyloid peptide A a 4 kDa peptide released during amyloidogenic proteolytic processing of the Alzheimer A precursor protein APP 2 APP can also be cleaved by the nonamyloidogenic secretases a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 ADAM 10 and ADAM 17 3 in a reaction that is believed to occur primarily on the plasma membrane 4 and is known as ectodomain shedding Secretase type ectodomain shedding divides the A domain of APP thereby generating secretase cleaved soluble APP ectodomain sAPP 4 This reaction can be stimulated by activation of protein kinase C PKC or extracellular signal regulated protein kinases ERKs 5 6 7 or by inactivation of protein phosphatase 1 or 2A 5 Reports from retrospective analyses suggest that the statin class of cholesterol lowering HMGCoA reductase inhibitors may lower the risk for Alzheimer disease by as much as 70 8 9 10 11 Studies in wild type guinea pigs and in plaque forming transgenic mice have demonstrated that chronic statin treatment can attenuate cerebral amyloidosis 12 13 suggesting that statins may exert their risk reducing effects at least in part by modulating APP metabolism In cell culture lovastatin and simvastatin decrease the release of A by rat hippocampal neurons 12 14 while activating secretase type ectodomain shedding 15 16 However the molecular mechanisms by which statins modulate ectodomain shedding remain to be elucidated 17 18 Statin effects on APP metabolism are to some extent attributable to cholesterol lowering but statin actions on APP may also involve cholesterol independent actions 19 Reduction in synthesis of mevalonate leads to decreased generation of a number of isoprenoid lipid derivatives Isoprenoids such as farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate are 15 or 20 carbon lipid moieties Through the action of farnesyl transferases and type I geranylgeranyl transferases isoprenoids are attached to the amino acid sequence Cys Ala Ala Xaa CAAX at the C terminus of the Rho family of GTPases 20 These posttranslational lipid modifications are essential for attachment of the GTPases to the cytosolic face of intracellular vesicles and or to the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane thereby specifying subcellular targets for GTPase action s Some members of the Rho GTPase family exert their actions through modulation of protein kinase activities One of the best characterized is Rho associated protein kinase 1 ROCK1 also called ROK ROCK1 is a serine threonine kinase with an apparent mass of 160 kDa that can be activated by either RhoA or RhoB 21 22 23 Structurally the ROCK1 N terminus contains the protein kinase domain while the C terminus has both a Rho binding domain and a pleckstrin homology domain either of which can modulate protein protein interactions In the inactive state the Rho binding domain and the pleckstrin homology domain form an autoinhibitory loop by binding and blocking the kinase domain at the N terminus of the molecule Activation of ROCK1 occurs when a Rho protein binds to the Rho binding domain causing a conformational change that opens the kinase domain for the phosphorylation of downstream effectors 23 Once activated ROCK1 phosphorylates several substrates including myosin light chain phosphatase LIM kinases Lin11 Isl1 and Mec3 and ezrin radixin moesin proteins 24 25 26 27 ROCK1 has recently been implicated in modifying the site of substrate cleavage by APP secretase 28 perhaps acting via ROCK1 dependent phosphorylation of a component of the secretase enzyme complex In the current study we demonstrate that activation of sAPP shedding from cultured cells by atorvastatin or simvastatin involves isoprenoid mediated protein phosphorylation Treatment of cells with a farnesyl transferase inhibitor or expression of a dominant negative DN ROCK1 molecule led to enhanced sAPP shedding supporting the notion that shedding is modulated by the isoprenoid pathway Transfection with the cDNA for a constitutively active CA ROCK1 molecule led to inhibition of statin activated sAPP shedding These results raise the possibility that the apparent beneficial effect of statins in the prevention of Alzheimer disease could be at least in part mediated by isoprenoid modulation of APP metabolism Methods Reagents The APP C terminal specific polyclonal antibody 369 29 was used to detect full length

Cholesterol Assays Cholesterol levels in cell lysates were measured using Amplex Red following the manufacturer s instructions Molecular Probes We have previously demonstrated that standard doses of either simvastatin or atorvastatin reduce cholesterol levels in N2a cells by 65 67 16 Quantification and Statistical Analysis Quantification of protein bands was performed using the UVP Bioimaging System and statistical analysis was performed on paired observations using the Student s t test Results Atorvastatin Activates sAPP Shedding at a Subcellular Site Upstream of Endocytosis from the Plasma Membrane We confirmed our previous observation 16 that atorvastatin produces an increase in sAPP shedding that is dose dependent reaching a maximum effect at 5 M The increase in sAPP shedding is accompanied by a corresponding increase in levels of the nonamyloidogenic APP C terminal fragment C83 data not shown In order to refine our localization of the subcellular target of statin action we evaluated the steady state levels of cell surface APP csAPP in the absence or presence of statins After drug treatments cells were subjected to the surface biotinylation protocol Cells and media were harvested and levels of sAPP holoAPP and csAPP were measured Treatment with atorvastatin increased csAPP by approximately 1 6 fold similar to the effect of the drug on holoAPP Figure 1 while sAPP shedding was increased by approximately 7 fold p 0 05 Since csAPP levels were only slightly raised in the same statin treated cells in which sAPP shedding was dramatically increased we interpret this disparity to indicate that the effector of statin stimulated shedding is probably intrinsic to the plasma membrane In other studies the plasma membrane has been proposed to be or to contain the statin target For example statins have been proposed to cause co localization of secretase and APP within lipid rafts 15 33 statins might also induce modification of the structure and activity of a protein in the plasma membrane secretase complex perhaps in an action similar to how statins bind and lock cell surface integrins 34 A pulse chase protocol was also used to study post transcriptional regulation of APP metabolsm by statins data not shown This protocol avoids any confound that might arise because of altered APP transcription Pulse chase studies were performed using a 10 min pulse with 35 S methionine followed by various chase times from 0 to 120 min Typical maturation and half life of mature cellular holoAPP were observed as was subsequent release of sAPP 5 29 In the presence of either atorvastatin or simvastatin the time course of maturation and release perfectly paralleled that observed in the absence of either drug except that the fractional content of cellular mature holoAPP was approximately 2 fold greater in the presence of drug i e at 15 or 75 min chase mature APP in the presence of statin was approximately 310 of the level of immature APP at t 0 versus a control vehicle treatment of 150 of the level of immature APP at t 0 also at t 30 min the relative percent values for drug versus vehicle were 380 and 200 respectively Fold increases in released sAPP in the same experiments were approximately 3 to 4 fold 2 0 arbitrary units versus 5 5 8 0 arbitrary units at 120 min for atorvastatin and simvastatin respectively Secretory maturation toxicity is one possible mechanism for elevated levels of intracellular mature holoAPP and causes retarded conversion of mature holoAPP to sAPP This pattern was not observed following statin treatment excluding maturation toxicity as a mechanism underlying the altered levels of mature cellular holoAPP Instead the pattern that we observed raises the possibility that statins presumably via isoprenoids given the reversibility with mevalonate as discussed in the next section may alter sorting of cellular holoAPP diverting holoproteins away from terminal degradation in the endosomal lysosomal pathway and into the constitutive secretory pathway that generates sAPP However the fold effect on reduced intracellular turnover in the endosomal lysosomal pathway or sorting out of the endosomal lysosomal pathway and into the constitutive secretory shedding pathway is apparently insufficient to explain the fold effect on sAPP generation 2 fold for the former vs 3 to 4 fold for the latter indicating a contribution from a downstream site in the processing pathway When these results are taken together with independent work on regulated shedding of transforming growth factor TGF 35 36 a parsimonious explanation is that an important target for activation of ectodomain shedding is probably located at the plasma membrane or downstream of APP residence at the plasma membrane The identification of the regulatory components of the ectodomain shedding machinery have been long sought in other studies employing phorbol esters to stimulate shedding of sAPP or TGF 4 35 36 37 Munc 13 has recently been implicated as a phorbol target in regulated shedding 38 In our opinion this molecule is rather unlikely to play a major role in shedding regulation given the specificity of Munc 13 effects for phorbols and the generalization of the regulated shedding phenomenon to include activation by protein phosphatase inhibitors and neurotransmitters Neither of these would be predicted to act via the phorbol binding C1 domain of Munc 13 Sisodia and colleagues 39 demonstrated that arrest of APP endocytosis from the plasma membrane by deletion of its NPXY clathrin coated vesicle targeting sequence 40 41 can dramatically stimulate sAPP shedding presumably by extending the half life of co localized secretase and APP on the plasma membrane In order to exclude the possible contribution of altered endocytosis to statin stimulated shedding we evaluated the effect of phenylarsine oxide PO an inhibitor of endocytosis on statin stimulated shedding Figure 2 Treatment with either atorvastatin simvastatin or PO alone increased sAPP shedding as expected Co treatment of cells with PO plus either atorvastatin or simvastatin caused stimulation of sAPP shedding to levels greater than the maximal levels of shedding achievable with inhibition of endocytosis using PO alone or with maximal doses of either statin alone p 0 05 The additivity of statin and PO stimulated shedding is consistent with the hypothesis that statins act at or near the plasma membrane prior to internalization of csAPP Under all circumstances stimulated sAPP shedding was completely blocked using TNF protease inhibitor 2 a standard secretase metalloproteinase inhibitor Figure 2 We interpret this as an indication that the statin induced cleavage of APP is probably mediated by one of the molecules usually associated with the phenomenon i e ADAM 10 or ADAM 17 16 Compounds that Modulate Isoprenoid Levels Activate sAPP Shedding As discussed above there is an established relationship between statins and isoprenoid modulated protein phosphorylation We therefore tested the effects of FTI 1 on statin stimulated sAPP shedding FTI 1 increased the shedding of sAPP but the combination of a statin plus FTI 1 increased sAPP shedding to levels greater than those achievable by using either compound alone Figure 3 p 0 05 In the same experiment levels of holoAPP were modestly increased but again to an extent insufficient to account for the increase in shed sAPP Figure 3 To test whether statin activated shedding might be attributable to a metabolite downstream of HMGCoA reductase cells were treated with 1 M simvastatin 5 M FTI 1 and a series of concentrations of mevalonic acid Since FTI 1 acts downstream of HMGCoA reductase the stimulatory effect of FTI 1 on sAPP shedding would not be predicted to be modified by mevalonate supplementation Low doses 1 M of mevalonic acid did not affect statin induced sAPP shedding but complete inhibition of statin activated sAPP shedding was achieved with higher doses of mevalonic acid 100 M As predicted the shedding observed following treatment with FTI 1 was not inhibited by any of the concentrations of mevalonic acid tested Figure 4 These data are consistent with a role for isoprenoids in statin control of APP metabolism in cultured cells Expression of ROCK Related Molecules Modulates sAPP Shedding in a Bidirectional Manner Since many isoprenoid mediated Rho effects converge on ROCKs we next transfected N2a cells with cDNAs encoding either green fluorescent protein GFP control CA ROCK1 or DN ROCK1 Figure 5 Simvastatin caused a typical activation of sAPP shedding from GFP transfected cells When CA ROCK1 was introduced however shedding of sAPP from both untreated and simvastatin treated cells was diminished Figure 5 p 0 05 versus GFP control Conversely DN ROCK1 alone activated shedding of sAPP Cellular levels of holoAPP were not affected by transfection Figure 5 p 0 05 versus GFP control In studies aimed at independent confirmation of the involvement of ROCK activation in sAPP shedding we treated SweAPP N2a cells with arachidonic acid an activator of ROCK As shown in Figure 6 arachidonic acid reduced the shedding of sAPP without altering levels of holoAPP Based on this series of results we concluded that both basal and activated sAPP shedding from cultured cells are controlled by ROCK activity In some experiments cells were treated with Y 27632 10 nM to 50 M a compound that can inhibit ROCKs Y 27632 showed no effect on basal sAPP release and blocked statin activated sAPP shedding data not shown This result was unexpected in light of the effects of DN ROCK1 Given the internally consistent actions of DN ROCK1 and CA ROCK1 as well as the results employing either FTI 1 or arachidonate we concluded that the Y 27632 result might be due to inhibition by Y 27632 of protein kinases other than ROCK1 23 The possibility was also considered that cytotoxicity of Y 27632 for the central vacuolar pathway might explain the disparity between the effects of DN ROCK1 and those of Y 27632 but neither impairment of intracellular APP maturation nor increased apoptosis as measured by LIVE DEAD assay were apparent following Y 27632 treatment data not shown Ultimately we were unable to document any explanation for the disparate results of Y 27632 and DN ROCK1 Discussion The isoprenoid pathway involves lipid modification of various members of the Rho family of small GTPases by the addition of either farnesyl or geranylgeranyl moieties 20 42 Isoprenylation serves to target the GTPases to the proper organelle membrane where their actions often relate to cytoskeletal dynamics and or vesicle trafficking 20 42 ROCKs are important downstream targets of Rho Figure 7 catalyzing the phosphorylation of effector phosphoprotein substrates 23 The foregoing data indicate that statin induced activation of APP shedding in cultured cells involves the Rho ROCK pathway More specifically the data indicate that ROCK1 activation blocks the effects of statins on APP ectodomain shedding while ROCK1 blockade alone can mimic the effect of statins on APP shedding By extension these data predict that application of statins to neurons might directly or indirectly inhibit ROCK1 activity Evaluation of this possibility will be the subject of future investigation The first evidence that APP might be a substrate for ectodomain shedding was provided by Weidemann et al 43 who identified sAPP in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood This aspect of APP metabolism bears resemblance to the proteolytic signal transduction pathways involved in processing pro TGF 35 36 and Notch 44 In the case of Notch the process is set in motion by the binding of a ligand to the Notch ectodomain triggering its release shedding For APP intracellular signal transduction appears to be more important 2 29 45 In early studies the existence of the shed ectodomain of APP was used to deduce the existence of the proteolytic activity designated secretase which has the unusual specificity of cleaving its substrates at a proscribed distance from the extracellular leaflet of the plasma membrane 4 39 Ultimately the integral cell surface metalloproteinases ADAM 10 and ADAM 17 TACE were found to underlie secretase type ectodomain shedding 3 46 Why is APP a substrate for ectodomain shedding To answer this question requires contemplation of the physiological function of APP APP is a type 1 integral protein that is subjected to a host of post translational processing events including N and O glycosylation tyrosyl sulfation phosphorylation and proteolysis 39 43 47 48 Most 60 80 newly synthesized APP is subjected to terminal intracellular degradation that generates no discrete fragments 5 A smaller fraction of APP molecules approximately 20 in PC12 cells under basal conditions 5 undergoes ectodomain shedding catalyzed by either the secretase nonamyloidogenic or secretase potentially amyloiodgenic pathway When PKC is activated the stoichiometry of shed sAPP rises from 2 mol shed per 10 mol synthesized to 4 mol shed per mole synthesized Most of this shedding is catalyzed by the secretase pathway but a trace amount 5 49 is catalyzed by secretase site APP cleaving enzyme 50 sAPP and sAPP differ by the inclusion in sAPP of the first 16 residues of A Unlike sAPP which is generated at the plasma membrane most sAPP is probably generated by cleavage within the trans Golgi network and endocytic pathway vesicles HoloAPP levels are likely limiting at one or more sorting steps in the late secretory pathway since activated sAPP shedding is apparently accompanied by diminished generation of sAPP 51 What is the function of shed sAPP Again from other molecules we know that shedding can serve important cellular functions by releasing diffusible ligands from their membrane bound precursors e g TGF and TNF or by terminating intercellular signaling e g Notch A popular model holds that sAPP may function as a neurotrophic and or neuroprotective factor and may promote neurite outgrowth 52 More recent evidence suggests that released APP derivatives modulate efficacy of neurotransmission at the synapse 53 Targeted deletion of APP has not revealed a striking phenotype 54 presumably because of functional redundancy supplied by APP like proteins 55 Mice with double and triple null mutations in various combinations of APP APP like protein 1 and APP like protein 2 are now being created in search of evidence for a definitive function for APP Cao and Sudhof 56 have recently discovered that the APP C terminal fragment generated by or secretase is itself cleaved to release A and an APP intracellular domain AICD that diffuses into the nucleus possibly acting there as a transcription factor The pathway leading to AICD must be initiated by ectodomain shedding holoAPP cannot directly give rise to AICD Therefore one important function for and or secretase processing of APP may be the eventual generation of AICD Our results suggest that Rho ROCK signaling provides modulation of basal and stimulated secretase activity It will now be important to dissect pathways upstream of Rho ROCK signaling in order to identify the intracellular and intercellular events that participate in Rho ROCK regulation of secretase under physiological and pathological conditions The potential role of cholesterol in secretase mediated shedding was discovered by Bodovitz and Klein 57 who used cyclodextrin to lower cellular cholesterol Kojro et al 15 confirmed this observation using not only cyclodextrin but also lovastatin to lower cellular cholesterol These investigators proposed that elevated ADAM 10 activity and protein levels contributed to these effects These basic observations dovetailed with emerging epidemiological evidence that administration of statins might lead to a diminished incidence of Alzheimer disease 8 9 10 11 Despite this however the association of statins and cholesterol levels with activated secretase mediated shedding of the APP ectodomain was unexpected and not readily explicable by existing knowledge regarding regulation of secretase activity The best characterized regulation of secretase processing typically involves protein phosphorylation via PKC 5 29 or ERKs 7 or protein dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 1 or 2A 29 We recently excluded the possibility that either PKC or ERK plays a role in statin activated shedding 16 raising the possibility that other protein phosphorylation signaling pathways might link statins and or cholesterol to secretase activation Maillet et al 58 implicated the Rho pathway in modulation of secretase activity while dissecting the activated shedding process that accompanies serotonergic signal transduction These investigators discovered that Rap1 acts through Rac to modulate secretase processing of APP Soon thereafter ROCK1 was discovered by Zhou et al 28 to modulate a downstream processing step in APP metabolism that involves presenilin secretase mediated proteolysis of APP C terminal fragments C99 and C83 These investigators discovered that activation of ROCK1 may account for how nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs specify the scissile bond within the APP transmembrane domain that is cleaved by presenilin secretase to generate the C terminus of A Based on these reports we asked whether the Rho ROCK pathway might play a role in controlling shedding of sAPP following statin application CA ROCK1 and DN ROCK1 molecules yielded direct and complementary evidence that ROCK1 was indeed a candidate for modulation of statin activated secretase action Further we were able to demonstrate that secretase activity could be modulated by molecules further upstream in the isoprenoid pathway see Figure 7 FTI 1 an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase also known as L 744 832 59 mimicked and potentiated statin activated shedding presumably by blocking transfer of isoprenoid moieties to a Rho protein by farnesyl transferase and thereby decreasing Rho activity However FTI 1 treatment can also increase the level of geranylgeranylated isoforms of certain Rho proteins e g the inhibitory geranylgeranylated RhoB protein 60 In further support of a role for isoprenoids we were able to demonstrate that supplementation of cells with mevalonate abolished statin activated shedding see Figure 4 Statins block HMGCoA reductase generation of mevalonate from 3 hydroxy methyl glutarate see Figure 7 Therefore the addition of mevalonate would be predicted to antagonize statin action via the isoprenoid pathway by relieving statin induced mevalonate deficiency As predicted by this model we observed that statin activated shedding was abolished by adding mevalonate Taken together these results suggest the existence of a reciprocal relationship between isoprenoid mediated Rho ROCK signaling and sAPP shedding i e activation of ROCK1 blocks basal and stimulated shedding while ROCK1 inhibition apparently relieves a tonic negative influence exerted on shedding by ROCK1 activity As in PKC and ERK activated shedding the ROCK1 substrate effector molecule or molecules that regulate proteolysis by ADAMs remain to be identified The cytoplasmic domains of both APP and ADAM 17 have been evaluated as candidates for important targets of protein phosphorylation during the regulated shedding process but neither substrate activation nor enzyme activation appears to explain the phenomenon i e phosphorylation of neither APP nor ADAM 17 dramatically increases the efficiency of secretion 61 62 indicating that activation is more indirect Our data using statins and PO localize the mediator of statin activated shedding to the plasma membrane upstream of endocytosis as appears to be the case for PKC activated shedding 36 63 64 65 Similar conclusions were drawn by Bosenberg and colleagues 36 who used streptolysin porated cells and N ethylmaleimide to demonstrate that reconstitution of activated shedding of TGF from CHO cells does not require membrane trafficking and apparently occurs on the plasma membrane These results suggest that a tightly membrane associated regulatory subunit of the secretase complex is likely to be the key phosphoprotein that mediates secretase activity as a function of its state of phosphorylation by PKC and perhaps also ERK and ROCK1 The molecular identity of this phosphoprotein remains unknown Secretase activation is a potential therapeutic strategy for modifying cerebral amyloidosis in Alzheimer disease 66 This proposal is supported by recent evidence that either genetic modification of ADAM 10 secretase activity 67 or administration of bryostatin a PKC activator 68 can modulate levels of brain A in plaque forming transgenic mice Secretase activation may explain how statins lower the risk for Alzheimer disease 69 since atorvastatin diminishes A burden in plaque forming transgenic mice 13 If secretase stimulation is to be truly viable as a human clinical intervention it will be essential to assess the possibility that enhanced APP ectodomain shedding might incur mechanism based toxicity analogous to the concerns currently surrounding secretase inhibitors Along this line extension of this work to other shed proteins will be important to determine the impact of enhanced shedding via ADAM proteinases on other substrates of those proteinases including Notch pro TGF pro TNF and CD44 3 Preliminary results from a pilot proof of concept using atorvastatin in a human clinical treatment trial are consistent with the proposed beneficial effects of this class of compounds 70 Since atorvastatin has low blood brain barrier permeability 71 this beneficial effect if attributable to A lowering must be due to altered A metabolism in the periphery Reduction in levels of free A in the circulation has been demonstrated to lead to diminution in brain plaque burden following active or passive immunization 72 It is conceivable that if statins lower circulating A this effect could secondarily cause diffusion of central nervous system interstitial A down its concentration gradient and into the cerebrospinal fluid and circulation from which it is cleared To date however this mechanism is not supported by data from human clinical trials where statin administration has shown no consistent effect on levels of circulating or cerebrospinal fluid A 73 The results reported here point to several areas for additional investigation As described above the key substrate or substrates linking cytoplasmic protein phosphorylation to intralumenal or cell surface protelysis remain to be identified Nonetheless secretase activation has been validated as a viable therapeutic strategy for modulating cerebral amyloidosis 67 Identification of the role of the Rho ROCK pathway in regulating secretase provides a new avenue for its therapeutic activation even though the potential relevance of atorvastatin mediated ROCK1 inhibition in neurons may not explain the apparent clinical benefits of the drug Still if the reported disease modifying effect of atorvastatin is confirmed in the National Institute on Aging s large multi center trial of simvastatin one or more compounds of this class may be among the first disease modifying compounds approved by the Food and Drug Administration for slowing the progression of Alzheimer disease Supporting Information Accession Numbers The GenBank http www ncbi nlm nih gov Genbank accession numbers for the proteins discussed in
