 Introduction Fetuses of diabetic mothers with uncontrolled blood glucose levels tend to be hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic 1 An increased incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome RDS has been observed in infants of diabetic mothers 1 RDS is caused by inadequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant due to delayed lung development 2 It has been proposed that high insulin levels can delay lung development in the fetus of the diabetic mother 3 Surfactant a lipoprotein comprised of phospholipids 80 cholesterol 10 and proteins 10 functions to reduce surface tension and prevents alveolar collapse at end expiration 4 The surfactant associated proteins SP A B C and D which are required for proper surfactant function are developmentally and hormonally regulated 4 We and others have shown that the SP A levels in the amniotic fluid of diabetic mothers are significantly decreased 1 Low SP A levels in amniotic fluid have been correlated with an increased incidence of neonatal RDS 5 Our previous studies have shown that insulin down regulates SP A mRNA and protein levels in human lung epithelial cells in a concentration and time dependent manner via an inhibition of gene transcription 6 7 Insulin transduces its cellular signal in most cell types via two signaling pathways i e the p44 42 mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase PI 3 kinase pathway 8 Insulin initially binds to the insulin receptor causing autophosphorylation of the subunit of the receptor 8 The protein kinase domain of the subunit then phosphorylates tyrosine residues in insulin receptor substrate IRS 1 IRS 2 IRS 3 or Shc which then activates the p44 42 MAPK signaling cascade 8 PD98059 is a cell permeable non competitive reversible inhibitor of MAPK extracellular signal regulated kinase kinase MEK a protein kinase upstream of p44 42 MAPK 9 Tyrosine phosphorylated IRS also activates the PI 3 kinase pathway 8 10 There are at least three well characterized inhibitors of the PI 3 kinase pathway i e wortmannin LY294002 and rapamycin 11 12 13 Wortmannin and LY294002 block the activation of PI 3 kinase itself 11 12 while rapamycin prevents the phosphorylation of a downstream effector in the pathway p70 S6 kinase 13 In the present study we used two experimental models a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCI H441 and human fetal lung explants H441 cells resemble bronchiolar epithelial Clara cells in phenotype and produce both SP A and SP B mRNA and protein 14 The hormonal regulation of SP A and SP B gene expression in H441 cells is similar to that observed in differentiated type II cells in human fetal lung explants 6 7 15 16 We treated H441 cells with the four inhibitors of signal transduction wortmannin LY294002 rapamycin and PD98059 to elucidate which signaling pathways are activated when insulin inhibits SP A gene expression To confirm these results we repeated key experiments with insulin and the signal transduction inhibitors using human fetal lung explants We then examined the levels and phosphorylation state of key enzymes in the p44 42 MAPK and PI 3 kinase signaling pathways We found that insulin probably inhibits SP A gene expression in lung epithelial cells via the rapamycin sensitive PI 3 kinase pathway Materials and methods Cell and explant cultures A human lung adenocarcinoma cell line NCI H441

pyruvate 0 037 mg ml Fisher Scientific Fair Lawn NJ USA and the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 0 057 mg ml Sigma at 22 C by measuring absorbance at 340 nm LDH activity was determined as the rate of decrease in absorbency per min using a standard curve for lactate hydrogenase 2 40 mU L lactic dehydrogenase porcine muscle Sigma LDH activity in the media samples was normalized to controls which were made equal to one Statistical analysis All experiments were repeated at least three times unless otherwise stated Student s t test or one way analysis of variance ANOVA followed by Dunnett s test was used to estimate the statistical significance of the results 18 Results Lactate dehydrogenase assay LDH activity was measured in media obtained from control H441 cells and cells treated with the various signal transduction inhibitors LDH activity was not different from controls in cells treated for 12 to 16 hours with either 200 nM wortmannin 5 M LY294002 20 nM rapamycin or 10 M PD98059 data not shown Effects of signal transduction inhibitors and insulin on SP A mRNA levels Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite that is a relatively selective inhibitor of PI 3 kinase with a half maximal inhibition IC 50 less than 5 nM 11 In the wortmannin experiments media were changed every 2 hours for a total of 12 hours in all of the conditions because wortmannin is unstable in solution at physiological pH 19 The shorter incubation time with insulin in the wortmannin experiments resulted in a decreased inhibitory effect of insulin i e an 22 inhibition of SP A mRNA levels Fig 1A versus an 40 inhibition observed after the 16 hour incubation used in the experiments with rapamycin and PD98059 Fig 1Band 1C Wortmannin added alone did not significantly alter SP A mRNA levels at any concentration tested Fig 1A However wortmannin at concentrations of 5 200 nM abolished the insulin mediated inhibition of SP A mRNA levels at all concentrations tested 5 200 nM Fig 1A To confirm the inhibitory effect of wortmannin on insulin action a structurally different PI 3 kinase inhibitor LY294002 was used LY294002 is a competitive inhibitor of the PI 3 kinase ATP binding site with an IC 50 1 4 M in vitro 12 LY294002 added alone decreased SP A mRNA levels at concentrations greater than 10 M data not shown However 2 M LY294002 abolished the inhibitory effects of insulin but did not affect basal SP A mRNA levels In the control group insulin significantly decreased SP A mRNA levels to 57 11 of control levels however in presence of 2 M LY294002 insulin only decreased SP A mRNA levels to 87 15 of control levels versus 99 3 of control levels in samples treated with LY294002 alone mean SE n 4 n indicates the number of independent experiments Rapamycin inhibits activation of p70 S6 kinase a downstream effector in the PI 3 kinase signaling pathway 13 Rapamycin forms a complex with FK506 binding protein 12 and this complex blocks the kinase activity of mTOR mammalian target of rapamycin a kinase upstream of p70 S6 kinase 20 The IC 50 for p70 S6 kinase inhibition by rapamycin is 0 04 0 4 nM 13 When added alone at concentrations of 1 100 nM rapamycin did not affect SP A mRNA levels Fig 1B However rapamycin abolished the insulin mediated inhibition of SP A gene expression in a dose dependent manner To examine whether the p44 42 MAPK pathway mediates insulin signaling in the H441 cells PD98059 an inhibitor of the p44 42 MAPK pathway was used 9 PD98059 binds to the dephosphorylated form of MEK and prevents its activation in vivo with an IC 50 of 10 M 9 PD98059 added alone significantly decreased SP A mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner Fig 1C PD98059 had no effect on the insulin inhibition of SP A mRNA levels We also treated cultured human fetal lung explants with wortmannin rapamycin or PD98059 in the presence or absence of insulin Fig 2shows that wortmannin 100 nM and rapamycin 50 nM both abolished the insulin mediated inhibition of SP A gene expression In agreement with the H441 cells results PD98059 2 5 10 M had no effect on the insulin inhibition of SP A mRNA while decreasing basal SP A mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner when added alone Transcription rate of human SP A In our previous studies we have shown that insulin inhibits the rate of SP A gene transcription after a 24 hour exposure 7 In this study we evaluated the effects of insulin on the transcription rate of the human SP A and actin genes at several time points earlier than those used in our previous studies The rate of SP A gene transcription increased in a time dependent manner Fig 3 Insulin inhibited human SP A gene transcription at every time point tested even as early as after 1 hour of insulin treatment Insulin did not decrease human actin gene transcription at any time point Phosphorylation activation of protein kinases Immunoblot analysis of control and insulin treated H441 cells using phosphospecific antibodies for p44 42 MAPK and p70 S6 kinase revealed that both kinases were in a partially activated state at the 15 min time point The phosphorylation of the protein kinases in the controls declined over time and remained at minimum levels after 30 min to 2 hours of incubation We attribute this partial activation of the signaling kinases to the media change that occurred immediately prior to insulin or vehicle addition 21 p44 42 MAPK The total amount of p44 42 MAPK was equal and remained level in control and insulin treated cells at all time points Fig 4A Insulin did not affect p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation within a 2 hour incubation time but significantly decreased phosphorylation after 16 hours Fig 4B Densitometric data of immunoreactive bands of phospho p44 42 MAPK in the presence of insulin were equal to 0 39 0 01 for the 16 hour time point when compared to the corresponding controls which were made equal to one mean SE t test p 0 05 n 3 Since it is possible that the insulin mediated stimulation of p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation had ended within a 15 min exposure to insulin we performed additional experiments in order to evaluate the possibility of a shorter time course of insulin action Serum starved cells were incubated with fresh serum free media for 1 hour at 37 C in order to return the phosphorylation levels of p44 42 MAPK to the basal state and then treated with insulin 2 5 g ml or vehicle for 5 min Insulin did not activate p44 42 MAPK within this time frame The intensity of the immunoreactive bands of phospho p44 42 MAPK from insulin treated cells was 0 92 0 10 relative to controls which were made equal to one data are the mean of two experiments performed in duplicate plus or minus the standard deviation of the mean In order to prove that p44 42 MAPK can be stimulated in H441 cells by an activator of this kinase some cells were also treated with 10 nM 12 O tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate TPA a strong stimulator of p44 42 MAPK in H441 cells for 5 min 21 TPA caused an approximately twofold increase in p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation over control levels p70 S6 kinase The total amount of p70 S6 kinase present in the cells decreased during the 16 hour incubation period however there was no difference in the amount present in control vs insulin treated cells at any time point Fig 5A Fig 5Bshows that despite increased basal p70 S6 kinase phosphorylation insulin caused an additional up regulation of p70 S6 kinase on Thr389 after incubation with insulin for 15 min to 16 hours Phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase on Thr389 is essential for the activation of the kinase 22 In the presence of insulin the intensity of the Thr389 p70 S6 kinase bands was significantly increased after 15 min exposure and reached 2 02 0 31 after 15 min and 1 36 0 17 after a 16 hour incubation period when compared to respective controls which were made equal to one mean SE t test p 0 05 n 4 Insulin also stimulated the phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase Thr421 Ser424 at the 30 min and 2 hour incubation times when compared to their respective controls Fig 5C Inhibitors of p44 42 MAPK and p70 S6 kinase PD98059 caused a dramatic decrease in the phosphorylation of p44 42 MAPK in the presence or absence of insulin Fig 6A when compared to controls Incubation of cells with rapamycin did not affect p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation in any condition Fig 6B Rapamycin completely abolished the phosphorylation of Thr389 in p70 S6 kinase in insulin treated cells and also abolished the basal phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase in control cells at both time points examined Fig 6C Rapamycin also down regulated the Thr421 Ser424 phosphorylation in p70 S6 kinase in control and insulin treated cells at both time points Fig 6E PD98059 did not affect Thr389 or Thr421 Ser424 phosphorylation in p70 S6 kinase in insulin treated cells at either time point but slightly decreased their phosphorylation when added alone Figs 6Dand 6F Discussion Nothing is known about the relationship between signaling pathways and the regulation of SP A gene expression by insulin In contrast insulin signal transduction pathways are well characterized in a wide variety of cell types 8 10 Insulin is known to primarily transduce its cellular actions via two signaling pathways the p44 42 MAPK pathway and the PI 3 kinase pathway 8 10 In the present study we investigated the signaling pathways that mediate the inhibitory effects of insulin on the expression of the SP A genes in human lung epithelial cells Two inhibitors of PI 3 kinase wortmannin and LY294002 and an inhibitor of p70 S6 kinase activation rapamycin blocked the inhibitory effect of insulin on SP A gene expression We confirmed these observations by showing that insulin increased the phosphorylation of a specific rapamycin sensitive residue threonine 389 present in the linker region of p70 S6 kinase a phosphorylation event that is known to activate this enzyme 22 In contrast PD98059 an inhibitor of p44 42 MAPK activation did not block the inhibitory effects of insulin on SP A gene expression In addition insulin had no effect on p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation during a 2 hour incubation The effects of the PI 3 kinase and the MAPK pathway inhibitors on SP A gene expression were evaluated using two experimental models a human immortalized epithelial cell line H441 cells and human fetal lung explants We also demonstrated that transcriptional inhibition of SP A gene commences within 1 hour of exposure to the hormone Together our results are suggestive that insulin activates the rapamycin sensitive PI 3 kinase pathway in lung epithelial cells and that this event leads to an inhibition of SP A gene transcription We found that wortmannin and rapamycin had no effect on basal SP A mRNA levels at any concentration tested However PD98059 added alone abolished p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation in control cells and also inhibited basal SP A mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner We hypothesize that a basal level of p44 42 MAPK activity may be required for SP A gene expression Chess and coworkers have shown that transforming growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor increase the phosphorylation of p44 p42 MAPK in H441 cells 23 Epidermal growth factor which binds to the same receptor as transforming growth factor increases SP A content in human fetal lung 24 Hepatocyte growth factor has also been shown to upregulate the synthesis of SP A in rat type II cells 25 Thus phosphorylation of p44 42 MAPK may be involved in the up regulation of SP A gene expression results consistent with our observation that inhibition of basal levels of p44 42 MAPK phosphorylation may decrease SP A gene expression In summary our studies are suggestive that in lung epithelial cells SP A gene transcription is inhibited by insulin via the rapamycin sensitive PI 3 kinase pathway but not the p44 42 MAPK pathway In cultured human muscle cells only the PI 3 kinase p70 S6 kinase pathway and not the MAPK pathway mediates insulin up regulation of p85 PI 3 kinase gene expression 26 Similarly in L6 myotubes insulin induces hexokinase II gene transcription via the rapamycin sensitive PI 3 kinase pathway but not via the MAPK pathway 27 The PI 3 kinase p70 S6 kinase pathway but not the MAPK pathway mediates insulin induction of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes 28 In H411E liver cells insulin down regulates cAMP induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription via the PI 3 kinase pathway but not via the MAPK pathway 29 Phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase has been shown to be present in the nucleus in insulin treated cells 30 Moreover it has been shown that p70 S6 kinase phosphorylates and activates members of the cAMP response element modulator family of transcription factors 31 These data raise the possibility that transcriptional regulation of SP A gene expression occurs via the PI 3 kinase p70 S6 kinase pathway Further studies will be required to elucidate the function of p70 S6 kinase in the nuclear events involved in SP A gene transcription Conclusion Our studies are suggestive that insulin inhibits SP A gene transcription via the PI 3 kinase pathway in lung epithelial cells specifically via the rapamycin sensitive activation of p70 S6 kinase Insulin does not activate p44 42 MAPK and does not inhibit SP A gene transcription via the MAPK pathway Our findings further characterize the signal transduction pathways that control surfactant protein gene expression This information could lead to the possible modification of these pathways by pharmacological agents in order to modulate the composition of pulmonary surfactant which is critical for normal respiratory function and for host defense mechanisms in the lung Abbreviations ANOVA
