 okay well i just got back from taking my little girl to her Brownie meeting and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they ve been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow uh huh um hum but they were filled with beer cans and i hated to take a big old sack i mean we re talking you know like a lawn bag full of them like i no we ll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway uh huh they get tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans and i think that s all oh oh okay and they re taking the money that they earn to plant trees oh that s a good idea yeah and they ve got those bins that just stay there and they decorated them real cute you know with a bunch of big old flowers and stuff uh huh so they re getting into it i don t know what they get for the tickets though what do you get for the tickets if you bring stuff oh the class i guess gets the most tickets gets uh gets a party oh so that s not bad yeah that d be good um i know we i already have them thanks um we re we are kind of getting into recycling now i m in college and i live in a dorm and we recycle paper um hum and i know there s a glass plant up here and they recycle glass and you know we recycle aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff so in each of the dorms you have a place for that uh huh ah that s really good um hum yeah and then when our dorm we whenever our bins are all filled up we take them and turn them in and then we get money for that so hm for the dorm and who decides what you do with it yeah we just put you know we just keep it with the dorm and what do they do with it well we buy things for the dorm whatever the dorm needs you know like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things and then we buy like cooking equipment and stuff uh huh or we play games like board games we buy board games you know it s just different things whatever you know would we vote on it and whatever the dorm would want that s what we buy well i graduated from college in nineteen seventy two um hum and we were just um not aware that this was a problem that we ever would need to recycle anything of course you just threw it away yeah uh huh so a little different and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through Target to recycle i had my school do it um hum but my principal said since we re doing this thing called Operation Desert Shield we re sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all this um hum yeah for the whole school you know it was just this big project she didn t want to get into that and i could do it in the center and i just never got around to it um hum but it s like a club you know about that um hum there was a little boy that had died of leukemia i think and he was had started this um save the environment club oh and his mother is carrying this on and you can get the information to set it up you know or join you don t have to join it as a group or anything i don t guess but you could start your own anyway get a a pamphlet uh huh oh that d be good um hum um is that what this target is what you re um hum do y all have Target stores up there no no huh uh that s a department store oh kind of like K Mart except it s a little better than what K Mart sells i think uh huh uh huh oh oh i was like what s Target what s Target no um i know there s i don t really know any other recycling that they do we so you re not picking you re not having it picked up at your houses or anything yet no we no huh uh we have to take it to a a recycling place huh now in some of the towns around us they re already picking up the newspapers um hum well they re doing that here too now that i think about it once every so many weeks and you have to pull out all the slicks and you have to wrap them up with string oh and i think that s all they re picking up but you know like in Minnesota they ve got those bins where you put your plastics and your bottles oh i didn t know that yeah because well my brother in law lives in Minnesota and they re just nice plastic bins and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash and they pick them up um oh i never heard of that so do y all have can banks um not that i know of no no it s just a big old bin and you just feed your cans slowly in through slot and your money comes out you know every once in a while for however much poundage you ve got and you keep feeding it till the light goes off oh my gosh and you get instant cash but they had one that i was putting my stuff in and i went to take some today and it was gone i don t know but i i located another one today on the way to work hm yeah uh we have places where we go and we what we do is we unload our cans it s like a conveyor belt and the belt um separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because of it has a magnet on it and then they weigh all your aluminum cans and then you get money for your aluminum cans but they don t give you for the other no but now they re going to start giving us money for the other ones too well that before they didn t but i know they re going to start now uh huh well they re certain places you know where i know you can take your leaded cans but i don t know where they are they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it um hum i don t know i m trying but i just can t recycle everything just not that dedicated yeah yeah uh huh yeah but well that s all i really know about recycling me too if they would oh i know we re saving our grocery bags now oh really yeah they re t aking those up you can take them to the stores um like Kroger s doing it and i think Skaggs do you have those up there we have Kroger but not a Skaggs and we they re taking our milk cartons and our plastic Coke bottles there too oh so huh that s pretty good isn t it you guys are getting into it more than we are it sounds like it you d think you would be um hum huh uh i ve never seen any you know places that do i know um you we reuse our grocery bags now we take them back you you know and use the ones that we have you can like if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones you mean where you sack your own groceries yeah yeah but we don t have any place that collects the grocery bags huh and i don t want to go with those canvas bags right now i m sorry i m not that European yeah but you know they do that like i went to Europe uh nineteen seventy three um hum and every you know they go all the time i mean it s like they would go almost everyday to the store and they had their little bags way back then and fill it up and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators um hum oh my that s why i mean they couldn t put anything in it hardly but hum well what are you going to be when you get out of college i m a finance major well that s why i started what i did i think i went into teaching oh here in Texas it s a real mess right now oh really oh definitely there s no what let s see we ve had the funding we ve run out of money we ve frozen the money right and they had until the fifteenth of April to come up some formula that would be more equitable to districts different districts according to finances because the poor districts were getting less money so not as good an education right um hum and now they re trying to take some money away from the richer districts like the one that i m in in Dallas and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable and if they can t come up with something by the fifteenth then the state s supposed to decide the courts what do you think the outcome will be i think they re gonna uh maybe give us a state income tax do you have one yeah we re not looking forward to it but something s got to be done yeah oh yeah we ve had one as long as i can remember i mean well it s going to hit us yeah and i don t know it didn t doesn t seem like it would work to take it away when we re using it but maybe i know we re not using it so wisely um hum we have too many administrators yeah in some of these big districts but other than that well can you think of anything else we need to talk about um hum um i can t think of anything on recycling me either anything else no what about people from uh Pennsylvania what do they think about Texans what do we think about them um hum oh i don t no i never really thought about it i have no clue what you guys think about Pennsylvanians have you thought about that um probably a lot more civilized more um refined than a lot of the people would be down here oh really i would hope so i mean you ve been together a little bit longer than we have there s some i i don t know i really don t know anyone from Texas or anything no i ve never been there hum um well i ve never let s see i think i have too been to Pennsylvania Gettysburg yeah yeah we went up there now that i think about it on one of our long trips we take off on uh huh oh well she d be big i don t know what are you saying Holly oh my little girl is in the second grade and told me to tell you that shboom means good bye in the Israeli language oh Israel is what you say it is Holly Israel in Israel see she s got this little girl from Israel in her classroom that she s befriended oh so she s into this oh well is it like a foreign exchange type student huh uh you know we ve had a lot of the Jewish uh people
