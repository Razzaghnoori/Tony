 You your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells Crick 1994 p 3 Francis Crick was an evangelical atheist He believed that scientific understanding removed the need for religious explanations of natural phenomena From James Watson s and his early work the structure of DNA explained the the origins of life This was a starting point from the elucidation of the structure of DNA there was an explosion a massive diversity of science that in part removed the need to postulate a creator or a creation myth Francis still felt that life was no less astonishing just because it was biological and natural in origin He had a consistent and completely rational world view without a need to invoke vitalism or any non material force M Crick 2004 And in the last decades of his life he applied this philosophy to the consciousness Once the structure of DNA was known the physicist George Gamow formed the RNA Tie Club with Francis and eighteen others including his close friends Leslie Orgel and Sydney Brenner 2001 it was an ingathering that sowed seeds for future molecular biologists Judson 1996 DNA had become the the beginning Bronowski 1978 not just of Francis s career but of a whole new culture of scientific life and understanding Crick 1966 Ten years later the secrets of DNA transcription and translation unmasked Francis turned to consciousness He admitted he knew little at first only that the structure of consciousness was as tough a problem as DNA s structure DNA was certainly not played out but the Ferrier Lectures in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of London by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel were just available tempting Francis with an almost physicist s view of neurons in action Hubel and Wiesel wrote of functional architectures embedded in beautiful almost crystalline structure The comprehension of mind invoked by a biological mechanism appeared ripe for the sort of thoughtful theoretical science he had applied to DNA Francis was now sixty years old and moved from Cambridge to the Salk Institute in La Jolla California Francis began with the brightest young minds he could find David Marr was a young mathematician and physiologist whose doctoral thesis on a theory of mammalian brain function at Cambridge had brought him into some contact with Brenner and Francis A professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology he began working with Tomasio Poggio of the Max Plank Institute in T bingen on a computational theory of neuroscience Following an invitation from Francis Poggio and Marr spent the month of April 1979 extending their intense examination of the core problems of visual perception They spent hours sitting at the most western end of the Salk Institute at the cafeteria or in Francis s office gazing into the Pacific Ocean with all its daily changes discussing not only architecture of visual cortex and visual perception but the ramifications of a good theory of brain function We know of these conversations as the probing of Marr by Francis is captured in the final chapter of Marr s now classic book Vision Marr 1982 Although Marr speaks of a three way conversation judging from our own experiences as Francis s younger colleagues the interlocutor simply seems to be Francis Marr had been diagnosed with acute leukemia in the winter of 1978 Marr and Vaina 1991 The one month visit to the Salk Institute was an intellectual gift for eighteen months later Marr died Francis had simultaneously lost a young friend and colleague who had brought an incisive mind and creative energy Crick 1994 p 77 and his best new ideas of a theoretical neurology to the brain Marr 1969 1970 And he saw the tragedy of Marr being cut off from solving the big problems for which he was so clearly destined During those early years Francis must have thought that consciousness was tractable if only the right way of thinking was brought to bear on it Francis s brain was capable of collecting and filing away many disparate data which he could then combine uniquely and imaginatively leading to that dramatic moment of sudden enlightenment that floods the minds when the right idea clicks into place Crick 1990 p 141 Whatever his initial thoughts about the nature of the problem Francis soon came to realize that the problem of consciousness was even tougher than he imagined that the click was not happening with consciousness In 1988 he wrote I have yet to produce any theory that is both novel and also explains many disconnected facts in a convincing way Crick 1990 p 162 Over the quarter century he was at the Salk Institute Francis did propose solutions to some smaller problems in neuroscience Sejnowski 2004 and brought consciousness into the scientific fold Rich and Stevens 2004 But something else was going on quietly and behind the scenes Francis was building an army to help him take on consciousness This was not empire building with Francis as the head of a group of directed scientists in the Cambridge or German model Francis continually encouraged and assisted young scientists to approach the hardest problems of the brain Marr and Poggio were just the first recruits he helped embolden He started his long time collaboration with Christof Koch once a post doctoral trainee with Poggio on The Problem of Consciousness Crick and Koch 1990 1992 His door was always open to graduate students postdoctoral trainees faculty who wanted to discuss those problems as many others and we can attest Francis could be found daily at tea time an ingathering of the Salk Institute computational and vision laboratories of Simon LeVay Terry Sejnowski and Thomas Albright surrounded by graduate students and post doctoral trainees with conversation ranging across science Francis listening to their stories of their explorations and encouraging them to reach beyond their horizons Francis had a love of the truth and helped others to move to the truth Watson 2004 When Francis worked on the structure of DNA he had some simple facts such as Chargaff s Laws and means to make point mutations from which it could be determined how function followed structure But not a single neuroanatomist knew how many neurons actually converged in their input to a particular single cell No one knew how to eliminate a specific cell type from a circuit to make a point mutation so to speak in the structure of consciousness His 1979 article in Scientific American Thinking about the Brain did not have much impact at the time even when it explicitly described three needed methods first a method by which all the connections to a single neuron could be stained second a method by which all neurons of just one type could be inactivated leaving the others more or less unaltered and third a means to differentially stain each cortical area so that we could see exactly how many there are how big each one is and exactly how it is connected to other areas By the mid 1980s Francis had realized that these massive holes in our understanding of the most simple brain facts were not being filled Something needed to be done Over the twenty years since the RNA Tie Club molecular biology had matured Francis actively began encouraging the inclusion of the critical tools of molecular biology in the study of neural circuits and perception in his thinking molecular biology was critical to understand how the brain worked because it provided tools He would encourage junior scientists postdoctoral trainees and faculty all those who had visited him over the years to think about using these tools He would give short homilies about the plethora of sub types of neurons in the retina would not the cortex be at least as rich in possibilities Molecular tools could unravel this knot As we reminisced after Francis s death we discovered that Francis had spoken with each of us on these molecular methods across a twenty year interval In the mid 1980s Francis spoke with Ralph pressing him to consider how he might do highly specific lesions of single neuron types in motion cortex using molecular identifiers At the time the only tools imaginable were some sort of killer antibody approach Twenty years later Ed recalls Francis continuing to encourage this cross disciplinary molecular and systems approach It was absolutely imperative to Francis s vision of the maturation of neuroscience that there would be a conjoining of molecular biology and systems neuroscience We are sure we were not unique in hearing this call with how many others had he shared his vision The science of the mind is a thinker s game It is chess against the grandest masters biological evolution and natural selection and we are just learning to move the pieces Our viewpoint is often myopic with our noses pressed against the back row of the chessboard It is hard to see the pieces let alone their arrangement or the strategies they are forming Francis may not have had the overview needed to reveal evolution s gambit but he knew the moves needed to clear the tangle of difficulties Crick 1994 p 77 that prevented an unfogged view of his opponent s pieces Francis hoped for simplicity He wrote Curiously enough in biology it is sometimes those basic problems that look impossibly difficult to solve which yield most easily The biological problems that are really difficult to unscramble are those where there is almost infinity of plausible answers and one has to painstakingly attempt to distinguish between them Crick 1990 p 157 158 Watson and Crick had picked the right pieces of information to construct their model Francis early on had had the same hopes to open the doors of consciousness to paraphrase Huxley 1963 Watson and Crick used their intuition to fill in the gaps But Francis found that there were just too many possibilities and the gaps in knowledge were still just too big for consciousness In 1999 Francis felt that gentle and informal direction was not enough Thus he convened a meeting of molecular biologists and neuroscientists at the Salk Institute to encourage them to work together He brought scientists including Tom Albright Ursula Bellugi Ed Callaway Rusty Gage Steve Heinemann Terry Sejnowski Chuck Stevens and Inder Verma into one room and said it was time to get serious He reminded them of the advantages of genetic methods for targeting specific cell types within complex neural circuits and he reiterated the need for methods that could be used to identify manipulate and observe neural circuits in action Not only were methods to be used in transgenic mice but also methods based on viral vectors were needed to study the visual system of monkeys From this a number of initiatives moved forward with studies ranging from the molecular biology of Williams syndrome to basic molecular tool building Naldini et al 1996 Blomer et al 1997 Bellugi et al 1999 Pfeifer et al 2001 Zhao et al 2001 Kaspar et al 2002a 2002b 2003 Lechner et al 2002 Lein et al 2004 Today the tools are emerging at an ever faster pace at least in part due to Francis s maneuvers behind the scenes and his encouragement of junior scientists Time is curing Francis s bout of scientific prematurity Stent 1972 Individual cell types will soon be reversibly inactivated Johns et al 1999 Lechner et al 2002 Slimko et al 2002 Ibanez Tallon et al 2004 viral methods of tracing connections will start to fill in the gaps new sensor methods for simultaneously recording from hundreds and thousands of identified neurons are coming Guerrero and Isacoff 2001 Zemelman and Miesenbock 2001 Tsien 2003 There is a new field Francis termed molecular psychology or molecular biology of systems neuroscience Albright simply calls it Neuroscience In 2001 Francis was diagnosed with colon cancer He realized that the problem of the neural correlates of consciousness might outlast him Francis was walking with a cane still not waiting for anyone nor allowing anyone to wait for him He continued to find time for new faces in the field and continued to work on consciousness While he had made many strides forward he saw the race for him was winding down He had had his hope for understanding the structure of consciousness He had laid the groundwork He decided to encapsulate his ideas in a Framework paper with Koch Crick and Koch 2003 For many of us it was clear that he was laying out where he would go had he enough time Each of the points of the Framework could form a major research initiative Perhaps they should But the central point is the approach to understanding consciousness it is both structural and functional peering forward into the future into what the shape might be It was clear to his friends and colleagues that Francis was leaving a last testament As the cancer finally caught up with Francis he focused on the role of the rarely studied claustrum Sherk 1986 He wrote internal memos brought friends and colleagues to working lunches at home with Odile his wife of fifty five years Why do this Why all this focus on another part of the brain when only months remained Indeed it turned out to be weeks Was it his way of saying goodbye of bringing his extended family close again We think not Francis wanted to make sure his plan went forward He stressed to his visitors queries about the origins of the claustrum its molecular biology its role in consciousness He was using his framework pointing out the route to understanding the of his career Francis was doing what he truly loved to his last moments He needed to be doing science perhaps more than ever to take him away from the physical pain that he surely felt He had built his army Perhaps none of us even knew we had enlisted but we had And he was setting us off on the long march forward into a time that soon would not be for him Francis died on the cusp of a new age of molecular systems neuroscience Soon we will have the tools and the data but we will not have Francis Francis had existed between the of DNA and the of consciousness And for a man who never believed in the afterlife he had indeed achieved immortality
