 Edinburgh and Its People Every day except Sunday at one o clock in the afternoon a loud boom splits the air shattering the calm of visitors yet prompting locals merely to glance at their wristwatches A twenty five pound gun set on a battery of the imposing castle above the town has fired a single shell The sound fades into the distance as the smoke from its muzzle dissipates into the clear air This is Edinburgh a city which since 1846 has marked time in its own distinctive style and to which in return time has bequeathed a rich legacy of monuments myths martyrs and memories that make it a magnet for visitors The city of Edinburgh is the capital of the nation of Scotland It sits in the east of the country 5 km 3 miles south of the estuary of the River Forth and 605 km 378 miles north of London the capital of the United Kingdom It was founded in an amazing geological area on hills created by ancient volcanic activity ideal vantage points for building strong defenses and spying an approaching enemy The allure of Edinburgh is its complexity It s like a jewel with several facets Look at it from different angles and you will discover something new each time The town became the principal burgh of the kingdom during the reign of James III 1460 1488 and in the following years it blossomed Complete districts from that time are still in place replete with multi story houses called tenements or lands churches taverns and tollhouses These are crisscrossed by numerous narrow alleys called wynds and separated by open spaces where markets were held royal decrees were heard and criminals were hanged in front of large and enthusiastic crowds Take a stroll through these wynds today especially at dusk when the pale glow of the streetlamps softens the shadows It is possible to imagine the activities of the population five centuries ago officials going about the king s business or off to the tavern children playing noisy street games or fishwives on the street corners selling shucked oysters from the town of Leith on the coast three miles away Fortunately it is less easy to conjure up the smells of that time Sewage was thrown into the streets from upstairs windows accompanied by shouts of Gardeyloo derived from the French Guarde de l eau or Beware of the water Strolling would not have been as pleasant an experience as it is today Three hundred years later in the 1760s this medieval city spawned a sibling The New Town which was planned by architect James Craig and embellished by Robert Adam became one of the most beautiful Georgian cities of the world Today it is still very much complete rivaled only in size and grandeur by Russia s St Petersburg One can easily imagine ladies in crinolines and bonnets walking along the thoroughfares with carriages riding noisily over the cobbled streets The spirit engendered by the creation of the New Town brought about the new Age of Enlightenment for Edinburgh Although it ceased to be a political capital in 1707 when Scotland joined with England to create the United Kingdom Edinburgh was at the forefront of intellectual debate The Scottish arts were in the ascendant with novelist Sir Walter Scott creating such works as Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and poet Robert Burns composing his epic poetry In modern times the handsome Georgian New Town and noble medieval Old Town live happily side by side Their very different characters offer visitors two cities for the price of one Edinburgh watches over many of Scotland s national treasures with great pride Edinburgh Castle is a treasure in itself and with more than one million visitors each year also Scotland s most popular attraction Its strong walls guard not only jewels and royal artifacts but also the memories of thousands of historic events There are three national art galleries featuring the work of masters from around the world You ll find a Royal Palace dating back to the 15th century and two Parliament buildings one left powerless in 1707 and the other newly empowered in 1999 Three major museums illustrate Edinburgh s fascinating history with one holding a collection revealing the annals of Scotland s past and the lives of her most illustrious sons and daughters Yet one of the delights of the city is that it is not simply a collection of heartless historic fa ades It is instead a living thriving community The tenements of the Old Town and Georgian buildings of the New Town are still in residential use with a range of stores restaurants pubs and theaters sustaining the population Edinburgh is compact a city where you can walk to appointments or to your evening entertainment It has few tall buildings With its proximity to the countryside only ten minutes in any direction to the seashore or unbroken green hills it comes as no surprise to learn that it has been confirmed as one of the most congenial places to live in the UK The people of Edinburgh are often accused by their fellow Scots of lacking passion and have been labeled prim and proper One reason for this could be that they have traditionally pursued such conservative respectable vocations as banking medicine law and academia But this wealth of earnest achievement doesn t mean that the people lack verve or the ability to enjoy themselves It is simply that the serious aspects of life are given their proper due before the fun can begin Edinburgh s people are some of the most friendly and welcoming you could hope to meet they are quite genuine and unaffected The city s urbane residents enjoy their galleries theaters and exhibitions as much as visitors do Their restaurants feature internationally renowned chefs who create dishes using some of the finest meat game and fish in the world People here love to socialize and they get together in hundreds of pubs each with its own character Old Town pubs hark back to the days of Burns and Scott with small smoky rooms and low lighting In the New Town chic wine bars welcome the banking and insurance set for after office rendezvous In 1947 the opera impresario Sir Rudolf Bing undertook the task of organizing the first annual arts festival which aimed to attract major names in the fields of music drama and dance By 1987 the Edinburgh International Festival had grown into the largest annual arts event in the world with hundreds of performances in numerous venues across the city during August and early September Today however the main arts festival is only part of a veritable circus of summer activities that seem to turn the city upside down Regiments of soldiers in full dress regalia march precisely to the sound of pipe and drum in the Military Tattoo and connoisseurs of the silver screen gather for an extravaganza of offerings on celluloid The Festival Fringe perhaps Dr Jekyll to the International Festival s Mr Hyde is an umbrella title given to thousands of performances ranging from the avant garde to the downright irreverent And each year at festival time Edinburgh willingly gives its streets over to stilt walkers automatons satirists and barbershop quartets along with 500 000 visitors belying its reputation for being sober and staid Another wonderful time to visit Edinburgh is at the turn of the year when the city hosts the biggest New Year s Eve party in the world called Hogmanay The whole population comes out into the streets to watch a huge display of fireworks illuminate the historic skyline Where better to sing your year end rendition of Auld Lang Syne At the start of the new millennium Edinburgh is once again wielding true political power on behalf of its fellow countrymen The Scotland Act passed in November 1998 transferred control of domestic policy from London back to the Scots for the first time since 1707 The sense of an impending new era can be discerned in the pride confidence and energy of people on the city streets It is also taking concrete form in the new Scottish Parliament building at the bottom of the Royal Mile Edinburgh is a city with firm foundations in the past but it also has designs on the future
