 quot Community quot Responses The Pepsi Generation Never have I read a more accurate commentary on high school social hierarchy than Cyrus Sanai s When I went to high school in the late 80s we used to have this program called All Star whose stated purpose was to eliminate cliques and bring the school together The program thought it could do this by a making us watch Pepsi sponsored movies featuring anti drug propaganda and shrewd product placement b reinforcing the most obnoxious cliques on campus by choosing all the All Star officers from a popular group of athletes and cheerleaders on average B and C students who drank smoked and skipped class c doing everything possible to conceal the fact that high school s purpose is education and d giving us the opportunity to buy as much All Star merchandise as our parents could afford It was insulting and embarrassing and thank God only lasted a few months Programs like All Star are colossal wastes of time that make teen agers hate school because they emphasize exactly what they attempt to eliminate I hope people who have kids in high school will realize this and will not think that that is enough to end tragedies like that at Columbine Kevin Kramer Williamsburg Va The Rodriguez We I think Cyrus Sanai missed the point of the Richard Rodriguez essay in the Los Angeles Times last Sunday see Community Kills When Rodriguez talked about community he was not talking about the need for more school spirit or collective pride in the success of high school teams And he certainly recognized the social divisions within the school as well an athlete who singled out a Jew for being different comes to mind The kind of community he means does not come from pep rallies or car washes but rather from a value system and a curriculum that teach the common bonds that we as Americans have Not celebrations of multiculturalism but a history for example that connects Thomas Jefferson and Malcolm X as Rodriguez writes Also missing as Rodriguez points out is any structured family or neighborhood in many young people s lives That is the we he is talking about of belonging to something and having that foundation laid prior to going to school and reaching adolescence Not living an anonymous life in your room or on the Internet The lack of these positive networks he argues as do others is why many inner city kids look for family in gangs The lack of strong families in too many young lives makes the public school s job poorly conceived and performed as well according to Rodriguez of teaching and bringing a sense of connection to other Americans past and present nearly impossible This is a long term problem and he knows it He is certainly not calling for more cries of Go team or Beat Northside High Mike Hollon Alexandria Va Cyrus Sanai replies I think Rodriguez is out of touch maybe quite happily with life as it is lived in the Columbine High Schools of America You can t teach common bonds of history to teens while the school and the community stress athletics as the most honored achievement In fact you can t teach them at all as an environment for educational and moral growth American public secondary education will continue to be a miserable failure so long as the values of the institution are so at odds with its ostensible mission Only the better American colleges can salvage the mess left by high school and they are only as good as they are because of the competition and diversity among them Monkeying with a curriculum to give it the correct ideological spin is fine for the careers of school administrators and educational consultants but it won t fool students They may not know much of the world but they certainly understand what the high school rewards and it ain t learning about Jefferson or Malcolm X Indeed the grand prize for doing well academically at public high school is to get you as far away as possible from it to the Ivy League and its ilk It s possible of course that in an alternate universe where American high schools were truly academic institutions the seriously disturbed Harris and Klebold might have open fire on the brains but I doubt it first of all because Harris and Klebold would have received some of the acceptance they craved on their own merits and secondly because they would not have despised the school so for favoring the intellectual achievers Among the most fierce hatreds of teens probably right after public humiliation and rejection is of hypocrisy it s why Holden Caulfield is one of the most authentic and moral voices in American literature My second set of objections to the communitarian explanation of Littleton is the way it over blames parents All of what you say about families is true yet irrelevant It s a given that strong familial relationships help keep kids on the straight path Note that the Harris and Klebold families from afar seem quite ordinary lacking the social pathologies typically blamed for deranged teen age psyches But the job of forging these relationships never easy is made all the harder by the values fostered by the public schooling system The fiercely family oriented usually devoutly Christian parents who increasingly pull their children out of the system in favor of home or religious schooling are correct to fear the corrupting influence of the Columbine Highs Such corruption is as much intellectual as moral The religious schools shifting their emphasis from athletics to learning even if a large part of it is of the Biblical variety have consistently delivered better results both in terms of educational and I would guess communal development than the public schools This is true most noticeably among minority scholarship students from weak familial backgrounds who have attended Catholic parochial schools I seem to recall Chicago having the most famous examples of these I am not advocating religious schooling as a solution but rather pointing out that educational institutions which have their community values focused on learning rather than spectator sports will be much more successful in education and will be substantially happier places for all students except of course the athletes and even they will benefit from a better education I think it s an easy and well traveled path to pin the blame for many social ills on the perceived lack of communal cohesiveness in American life and in some sectors it may be correct When it comes to suburban high schools though I can say as a survivor of the experience that it s a community almost perfectly designed to crush twist and kill the spirits of those who are different thoughtful or just have the bad luck to be on the wrong side of the school endorsed elite So when I come across intellectuals peddling more community as a solution it is necessary to let off both barrels of the sawed off rhetorical reality check Backfire I wonder if Steven Brill has given much thought to his proposal to treat guns like we treat automobiles He says in his with Margaret Carlson register them and license those who would use them But he should put a little more thought into how we treat automobiles There is no license requirement to own an automobile To drive on a public street one must have a tag on the car indicating that the driver has paid a fee to put it on the road In the state of Washington this fee is based on the value of the car My piece of junk is about 35 a year to license One must also have a license to drive a car Ostensibly this is a safety measure to ensure that only competent drivers are on the road In reality any idiot can get one and with minimal luck avoid taking a driving test ever again I ran a stop sign on my test 21 years ago and still passed Both the car tags and the driver s license entitle a person to drive in every state in the Union Under Brill s system I could pay 20 40 a year to license a used revolver take a joke of a test administered by a surly bored bureaucrat and carry a concealed weapon anywhere in the country I think most gun nuts could go along with that Clark Stooksbury Port Townsend Wash Stein Line Herbert Stein s is very interesting and to a degree valid However it would be very enlightening if he would have explained the 5 percent gap between the female workers whose productivity is the same or higher than men s in a given industry or company With regard to the law prohibiting discrimination in this area many women could have told him how this is evaded All the employer needs to do is give male and female employees a different job classification or title A most interesting variation on the above is at a church of my acquaintance where in the school the pay for women teachers is lower because only the male teachers are allowed to replace the minister in some unforeseen situation V Caley Milford Mich
