 A Starr Is Boring Everyone wants to know how Congress is going to get out of the Flytrap mess What s the exit strategy After watching Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr for eight hours today I propose an idea Put Starr on every TV channel in the nation and let him talk After five minutes when the entire country has fallen into a deep slumber the House can drop the matter When everyone wakes up we can pretend it was all just a nightmare Both Democrats and Republicans seem weirdly hopeful about today s House Judiciary Committee meeting the first and perhaps only major impeachment hearing Democrats who are still enjoying their postelection gloat know they have won the war Clinton is safe Flytrap is all but dead They see today as their chance to punish the enemy to humiliate Starr for his prosecutorial aggression and sexual obsession Hard core conservatives who dominate the Republican side of the committee and who willfully refuse to learn anything from the election still suffer from the delusion that they can beat Clinton They feel that somehow if Starr explains it just one more time the American people will come to their senses During the lunch break Rep Steve Chabot R Ohio actually tells reporters that today is important because It s finally an opportunity for Ken Starr to tell his side of the story So what was the 453 page report The 7 000 pages of documents The six months of leaks Chabot s spin is the Republican s only hope that this time will be different Starr they pray may be Flytrap s Oliver North the witness who reverses public opinion by sheer force of personality But Starr foils both sides The hearing has the kind of monstrous buzz that Flytrap hasn t seen since Monica testified in August Eight networks are here to cover it live so are a zillion print reporters Michael Moore has come with a camera crew He has special access and lurks on the dais behind Democratic committee members Moore is ostentatiously underdressed wearing a windbreaker and a green baseball cap with a big letter S for Starr And the hearing opens with the kind of vitriol everyone has anticipated As soon as Chairman Henry Hyde R Ill bangs the gavel at 10 10 a m committee Democrats start carping that they are being unfairly silenced that they and Clinton s lawyers have not been given enough time to question Starr Rep Sheila Jackson Lee a posturing Texan says that Democrats are being bound and gagged in the courtroom and compares the hearing to the Chicago Seven trial Rep Mel Watt D N C calls the hearing a railroading Members start yelling I will not yield It is all very promising and becomes even more so when the ranking Democrat Rep John Conyers of Michigan gives his opening statement Staring at the independent counsel who s seated below him at the witness table Conyers scolds Kenneth W Starr as he repeatedly calls him for writing the tawdry salacious and unnecessarily graphic report and for cross ing the line into obsession Then Starr begins his two hour presentation and he sucks the air out of the room Democrats like to say Starr is dangerous Boy they re right Starr is a terror a one man weapon of mass exhaustion Starr s strategy and I m sure it is intentional is to seem so unremarkable so unthreatening so uninteresting that his critics can t find anything to attack Oliver North he s not Starr s two hour performance if you can call it that consists of him reading a 58 page prepared statement in a monotone He reads excruciatingly slowly I count his pace 100 words a minute This is what it s like to listen to someone talking at 100 words a minute Now imagine listening to this for two hours Starr s address is not only tortoise paced it s also familiar a rehash of everything we ve read 50 times before what his duties are as independent counsel how the Lewinsky case came to him why he pursued it as he did how the president lied etc I imagine the network news directors pulling their hair out We re covering this Some pudding faced old guy reading a two hour statement at 16 rpm Get me Regis and Kathie Lee There is one small diversion in the monologue Whenever Starr quotes from President Clinton s testimony he drops his voice a register and makes it breathy The effect is creepy The attention of the committee members wanders I begin to count yawns Rep Howard Coble R N C Rep Bob Inglis R S C Rep Charles Canady R Fla I lose count Rep Robert Wexler D Fla the photogenic and aggressive Clinton defender does not succumb to this languor He glares at Starr as if he s a particularly vicious child molester During the lunch break that follows Starr s statement Democrats are gleeful Did you see that says Rep Zoe Lofgren D Calif His own guys were falling asleep Starr was putting his own guys to sleep The principal and persuasive Democratic spin The only new thing Starr said was that he has exonerated Clinton in Filegate and Travelgate But any hope that Democrats can capitalize on Starr s non North performance dissolves immediately after lunch when Democratic committee counsel Abbe Lowell questions Starr It is like hammering water Lowell tries to get Starr to admit that he should have told the attorney general about his contacts with Paula Jones lawyers and that he mistreated Monica Lewinsky by holding her for hours at the Ritz Carlton and denying her a lawyer Lowell has been given an hour to quiz the independent counsel Starr runs out the clock on him Lowell fires his questions Each time Starr looks slightly pained then says In fairness Mr Lowell then wanders off on an immensely long barely responsive answer Just when I think Starr has finished I hear and indeed if I could just add that I notice another Starr tic He uses adverbs to drag everything out He does not dispute he utterly disputes Something is not misleading it is grossly misleading The interrogation by members that follows is equally unproductive I am writing at 6 30 p m when the committee has nearly finished its questioning but the Republican counsel and Clinton s lawyers have not yet taken their turns Each member gets five minutes which after a windy introduction turns out to be time for two questions Republicans generally congratulate Starr for his fair mindedness and resilience in the face of partisan attack then toss him softballs about whether the rule of law should apply to everyone equally His surprising answer It should Democrats pursue the Lowell strategy trying to bully Starr into revealing embarrassments One member wants to know what leaks his office made another why he didn t stop Linda Tripp from helping Jones lawyers But even the toughest inquisitor Rep Barney Frank D Mass can t shake the affectless Starr who ducks questions with the grace of well Clinton As the afternoon wears on the committee room empties Frank as usual has the keenest take During an afternoon break he tells a crowd of reporters that the day is useless Hearing Ken Starr is a waste of time No matter what happens here Frank continues it won t make a difference to Flytrap s outcome Conservative Republicans are so obsessed with nailing Clinton that they will never surrender The horse is dying and the logical thing to do is shoot it But the right wing says No no we ll paint stripes on it and call it a zebra They just won t accept defeat And because they hold the committee majority They are not going to give up without voting out an article of impeachment Which brings me to the person who deserves the most sympathy in all this Henry Hyde or poor Henry as Frank calls him His committee s conservatives are pressuring Hyde to do something anything to make the scandal viable again In the last few days they have proposed subpoenaing John Huang taking over the campaign finance investigation going after Kathleen Willey going after Kathleen Willey s lawyer Hyde can t control them Nor can he rein in the Democrats who accuse him of partisanship Hyde s own reputation has been ruined by the news of his adultery his committee is in shambles there is no way out of the Flytrap mess but what can he do Still poor Henry must sit up on the dais ashen faced and preside over this sorry sorry Starr spectacle
