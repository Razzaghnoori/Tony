        ready to talk okay   i guess so  okay           uh i want to talk about um our family budget and the times that its worked and the times that it hasnt worked and give you a general description of it and you can help me out a little bit   okay yeah okay   tell me how yours work   well at the my i introduced you a little bit to it a few minutes ago when i said that we are uh were on the east coast now   umhum   my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that well we both decided we wanted to move to North Carolina   uhhuh   and so naturally we put ourselves we looked at our budget   yeah   and so what we did was draw up a budget that we thought uh was realistic and uh   umhum   so we had to make some adjustments because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do uh he wants to do thats satisfactory and weve been here seven months and hes still hasnt hit up on anything permanently   oh no that throws the budget out of whack real fast   so you see well we actually planned for about one year   oh good   uh thank God because it never occurred   really that was smart   it never occurred to us that it would take seven months   yeah   and uh what we did was just uh decide what how we had been spending our money before   umhum   and then we put that on the computer and then we took about three months and uh and adjusted where we could come down and where we didnt want to come down   oh uhhuh yeah   and we really uh lessened it uh our living expenses uh more than what we thought we would   wow thats great did you have a special program on your computer to do that or was this just your own design of   but oh just our own design uhhuh   uhhuh gosh   and uh so but weve had budgets that didnt work when our uh you know of our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked   yeah   we spent too much money until our kids children went to college so   yeah yeah   so tell me about do you all uh have a budget   well weve been married for five and a half years and we started out without kids of course and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot more  fun kinds of things that uh didnt really um you know have a real strict budget but budget but uh the the about into our when when when when we first got married we were in graduate school and we were just you know dirt poor then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided wed bank my salary so we could buy a house so we virtually did that for about two years which worked real well   wonderful   and then moved from California where we realized we could never buy a house anyway no matter how much we saved   yes   and moved to Texas and bought a house immediately you know which of course is now devalued with the housing market so i dont know if we  we did a good thing to buy a house or not but at least weve got a place to live um so now since uh we have a three year old and a two year old now um   three and a two year old bang bang   uhhuh thats that that threw our budget really out of out of whack too and we um have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids and um we just really have uh uh i dont know weve weve tried different times weve done like a survey of like taking you know the past three months of where all the money went   umhum   and we really dont spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all but it seems like theres um times when we just have to get out where well go and like get a babysitter and well go and well blow you know fifty sixty dollars in one night going out to eat going to a show or doing something you know   well i think thats important for your budget to be realistically for it to work though you have to do something   yeah thats the hard part because when we sit down to make it we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put certain amount in savings every week and then its not really that realistic because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for you know birthday for somebody or you know even we we even do things real frugally for the kids we get a lot of toys and clothes and stuff at garage sales or from friends because they dont know the difference at this age you know whether theyre Jordache new or whether theyre   of course not   you know something and theyre both boys so they just fit one year after the other into each others clothes so but um thats the hardest part for us is that its really um you know budgeting and some extra things you know for that are more you know nonessential items   well i found uh that in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned   umhum   but where maybe our friends were concerned and our relatives and parents uh we we tended to want to keep on giving lavish gifts as we had done before   yeah yeah umhum   and i really believe that if youre going to cut down on yourself you need to cut down somewhat on your friends   on your friends thats true  thats true  well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and well end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and   yes   you know a lot of things like that that really is are hard to plan for and uh   well i really do i think you have to budget those things though   yeah kind of put in a certain amount per year youre going to have on extra expenses for car and   yes exactly or know so much per month anyway   yeah yeah   and uh that really should be in your bank but if you dont spend it it should be in your bank account at the end of the month   yeah  our biggest way of saving money is then just have all these deductions um you know isnt isnt lets see now i forget which way we do it we dont list all the deductions and then we get more money back you know at the end of the year   oh no no no no you dont want the government to spend your money you want to be able   so thats not a good way of doing it thats what my husband said so this last year he changed it then of course we didnt get hardly i mean nearly as much back and it was like oh no we better find another way of saving money   well uh but i do realize that that is realistic for some people and it was for us many years for many years   yeah yeah yeah   uh and if and if thats the only way that will it will make you save and have a little nest egg at the end of the the year then doggone it thats what you should do   yeah because we dont miss it we really dont when its just taking out of the paycheck and stuff so   umhum umhum   but were trying to put a little money away for the kids because we can envision envision the uh expenses for college already you know eighteen years away or whatever   well i was just reading an article in uh a North Carolina paper paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at uh letters of applications to universities   gosh   she was oh she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty so it can be done   i guess thats fantastic   where theres a will where theres a will theres a way right   yeah     well i have enjoyed talking to you   well i enjoyed talking to you too good luck and dont spend any money this weekend   oh i know uh well have to stay home and mow the yard   oh boy  bye   byebye
