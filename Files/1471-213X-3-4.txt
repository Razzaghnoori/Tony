 Background Endochondral ossification is the process by which mesenchymal cells condense at specific sites and differentiate into chondrocytes forming the cartilage anlagen that are the model for the future bone The cells in the center of the anlagen which are initially immature undergo an ordered differentiation program 2 also called chondrocyte maturation 3 the chondrocytes proliferate become pre hypertrophic and then undergo hypertrophy and matrix calcification The calcified cartilage is then invaded by blood vessels that bring osteoblasts and osteoclasts and bone is formed Each step of cartilage maturation occurs in a precise and tightly regulated manner 4 Disruptions of this process cause abnormalities in cartilage and bone formation 5 6 Endochondral ossification occurs in embryonic skeletal formation in skeletal growth and fracture healing Homeobox genes of the Hox class are required for proper patterning of skeletal elements 7 The functional role of Hox genes in skeletal growth and development has been clearly demonstrated but how they control the differentiation of specific tissues is not well understood Hox genes encode transcription factors that regulate the expression of yet unidentified target genes 8 In order to identify such target genes and to better understand the role of Hox genes in cartilage differentiation and maturation we established in vitro culture systems for primary mouse rib chondrocytes Previously we generated transgenic mice that overexpress the homeobox transcription factor Hoxc 8 in the thoracic region where Hoxc 8 is normally expressed 1 and unpublished results The transgenic mice exhibit profound cartilage defects predominantly in ribs and vertebral column and severity of defects depends on transgene dosage The abnormal cartilage is characterized by an accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes and reduced cartilage maturation The structural rigidity of rib cartilage is greatly compromised fatally interfering with pulmonary function and vertebral cartilage is so weak that the skeleton often disassembles during skeletal preparation 1 These results suggest that Hoxc 8 continues to regulate skeletal development well beyond pattern formation in a tissue specific manner presumably by controlling the progression of cells along the chondrocyte differentiation pathway We found a similar phenotype upon overexpression of Hoxd 4 in our transgenic system Kappen manuscript in preparation whereas overexpression of the LIM homeodomain transcription factor Isl 1 did not cause abnormalities in cartilage but other developmental defects 1 9 The observation that cartilage is affected by misregulation of Hoxc 8 and Hoxd 4 but not by a divergent homeobox gene indicates that the capacity to regulate cartilage differentiation is specific to homeobox genes of the Hox subclass It also suggests that Hox genes could be involved in human chondrodysplasias and other cartilage disorders We envisioned that well defined in vitro culture systems would allow us to further characterize the cellular and molecular basis of abnormal chondrocyte differentiation in Hox transgenic mice Detailed knowledge of regulatory mechanisms in endochondral ossification will be essential for strategies to manipulate chondrocyte proliferation differentiation and maturation in skeletal growth and development osteochondrodysplasias and fracture healing The in vitro chondrocyte culture systems we utilized here consisted of high density cultures of primary rib chondrocytes from neonatal mice The micromass culture system 10 provides the three dimensional environment needed for chondrogenesis cartilage maturation and hypertrophy The system also allows the investigation of the continuous program of differentiation maturation and hypertrophy in the same culture The cellular phenotype in culture was characterized by morphology and extra cellular matrix ECM production Chondrocyte maturation was assessed on the basis of cell proliferation cellular hypertrophy alkaline phosphase activity and expression of Collagen type II and type X Apoptosis was investigated by TUNEL terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triposphate nick end labeling High density bulk cultures were used to assess the capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic mice for cell proliferation and differentiation Proliferation of chondrocytes in vivo was assayed by BrdU incorporation and gene expression was analyzed by real time quantitative PCR Results We previously reported 1 that Hoxc 8 transgenic mice exhibit profound defects in cartilage particularly in the rib cage and vertebral column The cartilage is structurally insufficient and weak contains fewer hypertrophic chondrocytes displays much reduced staining for sulfated proteoglycans and consists predominantly of immature chondrocytes with a high fraction of proliferating cells These results point to a role of Hoxc 8 in regulation of cartilage maturation and chondrocyte differentiation A similar phenotype is found in Hoxd 4 transgenic mice 1 and Kappen manuscript in preparation indicating that Hox transcription factors regulate chondrocyte development To examine this function in more detail we employed a culture system that facilitates chondrocyte maturation and cartilage formation and closely recapitulates the in vivo situation 11 The micromass system has been used extensively for studies of cartilage formation from limb mesenchyme 10 11 12 13 and also for culture of chondrocytes in high density 14 Here we have adapted the system to neonatal mouse rib chondrocytes to study the role of Hoxc 8 in chondrocyte maturation As established previously chondrocytes in micromass culture are able to progress along their differentiation pathway to hypertrophy 14 In cultures of neonatal rib chondrocytes we find essentially the same results As shown in Figure 1 histology Panels A and E and immunohistochemistry for Collagens II and X Figure 1 Panels C D and G H revealed appropriate cellular morphology as well as increase in cell size towards hypertrophy Figure 1 Panels E G H and extracellular matrix production Figure 1 Panel F BrdU incorporation identified proliferating cells early in the culture Figure 1 Panels J K while virtually no dividing cells were detected by day 15 Figure 1 Panel L The proportion of proliferating cells was lower at the beginning of the culture Figure 2 Panel A reflecting our observation that cells may need about 1 2 days to adapt to the culture conditions Maximal proliferation was found on days 3 and 4 consistent with the presence of predominantly proliferating cells in the culture compare Figure 2 Panel A and Figure 1 Panel I Manifesting their progression to hypertrophy the size of cells increased Figure 2 Panel B with the majority of cells progressed to hypertrophy by day 15 see also Figure 1 Concommittant with cartilage ECM deposition there was an increase in Alkaline Phosphotase activity Figure 2 Panel C As cells matured towards hypertrophy there was also increased cell death in our micromass cultures Figure 2 Panel D Apoptosis as assessed by TUNEL was present from day 3 on and the percentage of positive cells increased with time in culture Similar results were reported by other authors 15 16 17 These results demonstrate that the cultured rib chondrocytes behaved in a similar manner as chondrocytes in vivo Taken together primary rib chondrocytes from mouse neonates grown in micromass culture display cellular differentiation proliferation maturation and hypertrophy recapitulating the chondrocyte maturation program in vivo These results establish the utility of this in vitro system to investigate the role of Hox genes and other transcription factors in endochondral ossification Rib chondrocytes from neonatal Hoxc 8 transgenic mice were cultured in the micromass system and the cultures were examined for the same parameters described above Figure 3shows that Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes morphologically appeared normal and were able to produce Collagens II and X and sulfated proteoglycans Panels C G I D H J and B F respectively There was no discernable difference in the ability of Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes to grow or mature in this system compare to Figure 1 Panels A H These data indicate that chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic mice have the capacity to differentiate and mature normally under the culture conditions described here This finding was unexpected in light of the severe cartilage defects in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice 1 However the possibility remained that despite apparently normal maturation proliferation of chondrocytes could be affected by the Hoxc 8 overexpression Such an effect would be consistent with the accumulation of immature proliferating chondrocytes in Hoxc 8 transgenetic mice 1 We therefore characterized cell proliferation in Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes In vivo labeling with BrdU was performed to investigate the proliferative status of chondrocytes in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice Previously we 1 found that upon overexpression of Hoxc 8 the vertebral cartilages accumulate immature chondrocytes and we showed that these cells are proliferating cells by virtue of staining for Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen PCNA The accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes could be explained in four different scenarios i There is a block in differentiation that prevents cells from entering hypertrophy The proportion of hypertrophic cells was indeed reduced in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice but progression to hypertrophy was not completely inhibited ii There is increased recruitment of precursor cells into the chondrocyte cell lineage This proposition is difficult to investigate and no evidence is available at this stage iii The rate of cell division is increased Then the cell cycle duration of proliferating chondrocytes should be shorter iv The cell cycle time of proliferating chondrocytes is lengthened resulting in a greater number of cells in the steady state pool of proliferating cells To distinguish these latter two possibilities we analyzed BrdU incorporation into chondrocytes in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice in vivo Multiple sections were examined from each embryo and showed incorporation of BrdU four hours after labeling Figure 4shows representative results for the immunohistochemical detection of BrdU incorporation in cartilage structures Panels A D To directly compare cell proliferation between embryos of different genotype sections of vertebral centers were assessed for BrdU incorporation Figure 4 Panel E shows results from embryos isolated at day 15 75 post coitum The differences in cell number section of vertebral center indicate that individual embryos were more progressed in overall growth than others and thus had larger vertebral centers with more cells overall Maturation was consistent within a given litter compare samples 1 2 to 7 8 and 5 6 to 11 12 respectively The fraction of cells positive for BrdU incorporation was between 7 8 and 14 4 with a trend towards lower rates of incorporation in developmentally older embryos with higher Hoxc 8 transgene expression levels TA TA TR Figure 4 Panel F While additional measurements at later stages of development would be needed to confirm whether this is a continuous trend for cartilage development in late pregnancy in Hoxc 8 overexpressing animals these results were initially unexpected The phenotype of Hoxc 8 transgenic animals at 17 5 days approximately 2 days later than assayed here is characterized by accumulation of proliferating cells Intuitively the expectation would be that greater rates of BrdU incorporation should be found However accumulation of proliferating cells can also result from a slow down of the cell cycle in form of a lower rate of BrdU incorporation It is intriguing to note that reduced BrdU incorporation is particularly detected in developmentally older animals where the vertebral centers are made up of a larger number of cells reflecting a longer duration since commitment of the precursors to chondrocyte fate It should also be noted that both genotypes assayed here develop cartilage defects which may explain the relatively moderate differences A prediction from these data is that on subsequent days or upon longer labeling intervals even lower rates of BrdU incorporation should be detected Quantification of such findings and in vivo measurements of cell cycle duration however require pulse chase experiments 18 19 which involve large numbers of animals and are very time consuming Instead we sought to investigate the proliferative capacity of chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic mice by using in vitro assays We performed cell cycle assays on primary chondrocytes isolated from rib cages of transgenic and control neonates Chondrocytes were placed into high density bulk cultures 20 where they initially continued to proliferate and later differentiated with cartilage nodules present by 14 days after plating Figure 5shows representative cultures Figure 5 Panels A C and the growth curve for rib chondrocytes in high density bulk cultures Figure 5 Panel D From this we were able to estimate a mean doubling time of 17 19 hours This conforms well to previous published measurements for chick limb chondrocytes 21 and rat chondrocytes in vitro 22 The linear phase of growth was observed between days 3 and 4 and therefore the 72 hour time point was chosen for analysis of cell cycle kinetics of Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes in vitro First we established the Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting FACS assay using mouse embryonic fibroblasts and then we assayed rib chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic and control mice in high density bulk cultures From these cultures cells were removed at various timepoints after BrdU incorporation and subjected to Flow cytometry Figure 6 Panels A E shows a typical result for fibroblasts The same readout was used for cultures of primary rib chondrocytes Figure 6 Panels F O As cells go through the cell cycle DNA content increases and this is reflected in a concomitant increase in BrdU incorporation Upon division the signal for DNA content is reduced by half while overall BrdU incorporation increases with every subsequent cell cycle These assays allowed us to determine the fraction of cells in each stage of the cell cycle Figure 7 Panel A and established FACS analysis as a valuable tool for the analysis of chondrocyte proliferation Interestingly when primary chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic mice were assayed they showed the same cell cycle kinetics as chondrocytes from control animals Essentially similar proportions of cells in S phase were found in all cultures Figure 7 Panel B This was regardless of levels of expression of the Hoxc 8 transgene Figure 7 Panel B which increases with increasing transgene dosage 1 23 These data indicate that after appropriate time in culture transgenic chondrocytes were able to proliferate normally at least over the 24 hours duration of the assay Given our inability to distinguish Hoxc 8 transgenic cells from controls by parameters for either cell differentiation or proliferation we sought to determine which molecular differences exist in our transgenic mice associated with the documented deficiencies in cartilage maturation 1 To this end we analyzed gene expression in freshly isolated primary rib chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic animals 1 Real time quantitative PCR was performed As shown in Figure 8 Hoxc 8 expression is elevated in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice as expected 23 Differences also exist between controls and transgenics in expression levels for several genes involved in cartilage development For example Collagen II expression splice form A is increased as is Ihh mRNA and Bmp 4 and p107 expression are decreased Taken together these results establish alterations in gene expression upon overexpression of the Hoxc 8 transgene in the developing skeleton The biological corollaries of changes in gene expression profiles are noteworthy in that they may provide evidence on the molecular targets of Hox genes in cartilage as well as on the consequences of Hox gene overexpression In Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes we found increased expression of Collagen II splice form A mRNA 24 This is consistent with our earlier finding of at least 2 fold increased Collagen II mRNA expression by in situ hybridization and increased numbers of immature chondrocytes in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice 1 Sox 5 which is normally expressed in proliferating chondrocytes 25 26 is elevated in Hoxc 8 transgenic cells again consistent with accumulation of immature chondrocytes Unexpected was the elevated expression of Collagen X mRNA a marker for hypertrophic cells As fewer hypertrophic cells are present in Hoxc 8 transgenics and cartilage maturation is delayed in Hoxc 8transgenic animals 1 one would expect to see decreased Collagen X mRNA levels 27 Yet the data clearly indicate that mRNA expression is elevated in transgenic rib chondrocytes This could be either from increased Collagen X mRNA transcription within prehypertrophic and hypertrophic cells or from ectopic activation of Collagen X transcription in proliferating chondrocytes Whether either of these possibilities would also increase Collagen X expression at the protein level remains to be investigated Interestingly Collagen X expression has been shown to be induced by Bmp 2 28 which is overexpressed in our transgenic mice Bmp 2 signaling has a positive effect on chondrocyte proliferation 29 and can induce Indian hedgehog Ihh expression in responsive cells 30 We find Ihh mRNA elevated in Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes see Figure 8 Ihh can induce Bmp expression in proliferating cells further increasing positive effects on chondrocyte proliferation 31 At the same time Ihh decreases the rate of progression to hypertrophy 32 33 again consistent with an accumulation of proliferating cells in our transgenic animals Whether the elevated Ihh mRNA levels originate from increased expression in cells that make Ihh normally prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes or from ectopic activation by the Hox transcription factors in proliferating cells remains to be investigated Greater numbers of prehypertrophic cells are unlikely to account for elevated expression of prehypertrophic cell markers histological sections from Hoxc 8 transgenic animals show no increase in prehypertrophic cells 1 and PTHrP receptor mRNA levels are unchanged in cells from transgenic animals see Figure 8 These data also suggest that PTHrP signaling 34 35 36 is only moderately affected by overexpression of Hoxc 8 We found the expression of p107 mRNA and Bmp 4 mRNA to be decreased which if reflected in reduced protein levels would be consistent with the phenotype of delayed cartilage maturation in Hox transgenic animals As Bmp 4 was shown to have a positive effect on hypertrophy and inhibitory effect on proliferation 37 38 decreased Bmp 4 expression would be expected to promote chondrocyte proliferation p107 has been shown to be required for exit from the cell cycle 39 40 and reduced p107 expression is associated with deregulated proliferation Also chondrocytes without p107 expression fail to respond to inhibitory signals from FGFs 41 The relationship to elevated Fgf receptor 3 mRNA levels in Hoxc 8 transgenic cells however remains to be clarified The same caveat applies to elevated expression in Hoxc 8 transgenic cells of p130 which is also known to be linked to cell cycle exit and FGF response 39 While the profile of gene expression changes in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice is suggestive of interactions between the various gene products further studies will be required to mechanistically link the gene expression differences to the maturational delay in the Hoxc 8 transgenic cartilage In summary the gene expression profiles of primary chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic animals display notable differences in the expression of regulators of chondrocyte maturation in a pattern largely consistent with delayed chondrocyte maturation in vivo These results now allow us to investigate whether any of these molecules is directly regulated by Hox transcription factors in chondrocytes It is also remarkable as apparent from our cell culture results that cells with obvious molecular differences downstream of Hoxc 8 expression can be modulated to resemble a normal chondrocyte phenotype after a few days in culture Discussion Our studies of chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic mice reveal several interesting results in vivo chondrocytes remain relatively immature with few progressing to hypertrophy in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice Combined with the fact that some albeit fewer hypertrophic cells are present the accumulation of proliferating chondrocytes suggests that Hoxc 8 regulates the rate of progression of chondrocytes to maturity 1 In line with this interpretation the in vivo BrdU incorporation assays suggested that cell cycle progression of chondrocytes may be decreased in transgenic animals with higher Hoxc 8 transgene expression levels If fewer immature cells enter the cell cycle in a given time interval this is consistent with and would explain the increased steady state numbers of chondrocytes upon Hoxc 8 overexpression This could occur through two different mechanisms i Hoxc 8 actively recruits cells into the chondrocyte lineage and maintains them in the proliferating state or ii Hoxc 8 inhibits a specific step in chondrocyte maturation In order to distinguish between these possibilities we sought to employ cell culture assays with well established parameters for chondrocyte differentiation and maturation Interestingly chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 tansgenic animals behaved undistinguishable from control cells under all conditions tested No differences were found in capacity to differentiate in micromass see Figure 3 or in high density cultures not shown and proliferative indices are comparable see Figure 7 irrespective of transgene dosage The latter could be explained by the fact that the FACS analyses were done at the time of greatest proliferation three days after culture initiation which may allow transgenic cells to recover to a normal phenotype However we did not detect any differences in the first few days of culture by microscopy or histology Cellular differences must exist at the time the cells are taken from the animal which would be expected to die as a Hoxc 8 transgenic and indeed molecular differences exist see Figure 8 Yet the cell culture conditions either quickly reverse cellular phenotype or support normal chondrocyte maturation Alternatively it is conceivable that the Hoxc 8 transgene could be silenced as cells are isolated from the animal returning cells to their normal phenotype There is little evidence to support this possibility as Hoxc 8 is expressed normally in our chondrocyte cultures data not shown and the promoter used to drive the transgene contains a cartilage specific element Cormier and Kappen unpublished results that is active in chondrocytes Yet even if transgene expression was reduced in culture the important implication of our results is that the downstream biological effects of at least 6 days of Hoxc 8 overexpression in vivo are reversible From these results we postulate that the cartilage defect in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice is mediated by absence of factors signals that are present in the culture medium Serum free conditions and supplementation with candidate molecules would be one strategy to investigate this further An interesting albeit preliminary finding from our gene expression studies is that chondrocytes from Hoxc 8 transgenic animals display gene expression profiles that are indicative for immature chondrocytes but not totally identical This suggests that both Hox transcription factors may in addition to the delay in chondrocyte maturation induce specific changes in gene expression By extending the collection of candidate genes or screening on microarrays it may thus be possible to identify specific targets for Hox transcription factors in chondrocytes Conclusions Our results support the conclusion that factors in serum containing medium provide the environment in which Hoxc 8 transgenic chondrocytes are capable of reverting to a normal cellular phenotype Thus Hoxc 8 induced changes in chondrocytes are reversible under certain conditions This has important implications for the identification of the transcriptional targets of Hox transcription factors In our system the biological effects of Hox genes in chondrocytes can be modulated by external factors and this finding points to the importance of gene environment interactions as modulators of Hox gene function Methods Preparation of mouse rib chondrocytes The preparation of primary rib chondrocytes from neonatal mice is a modification of the method used by Lefebvre et al 20 Briefly newborn FVB mice were sacrificed and the ventral regions of rib cages were dissected in sterile conditions to release soft tissues Rib cages were transferred to phosphate buffered saline PBS and washed extensively Cells were dissociated in 50 ml tubes by enzymatic digestion with 0 25 Collagenase Worthington Biochemical Collagenase Type 2 CLS 2 and 0 25 Trypsin EDTA Invitrogen Gibco BRL for 1 hour at 37 C or until the soft tissues were floating in the solution The solution was aspirated leaving the rib cages on the bottom of the tube The ribcages were washed with PBS and fresh 0 25 Collagenase in PBS was added for 1 hour at 37 C or until the rib cages were dissociated The enzymatic reaction was stopped with an equal volume of tissue culture medium containing 10 FCS The cells were filtered through a 70 m cell strainer Becton Dickinson and pelleted by centrifugation in 50 ml conical tubes maximum volume 25 ml at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes The pellet was washed with PBS cells were counted and adjusted for desired cell density Primary chondrocyte high density bulk cultures For analysis of cell cycle parameters we kept primary chondrocytes in high density bulk cultures as this allows for recovery of cells for flow cytometry These cultures undergo chondrocyte maturation with differentiation to hypertrophy and formation of cartilage modules Briefly cells were plated on 35 mm dishes coated with 0 1 gelatin at a final concentration of 3 10 5 dish in DMEM high glucose 10 FCS and 25 g ml L ascorbic acid Removal of cells was done by trypsinization For Alcian Blue staining cells were fixed in 70 Ethanol for 30 minutes and then incubated for one hour with the Alcian Blue staining solution which consisted of 15 mg Alcian Blue 8GX Sigma in 30 ml of 95 Ethanol and 20 ml Glacial acetic acid Cells were rinsed again with 70 Ethanol and dehydrated through an Ethanol series before coverslipping on the dish Primary high density micromass cultures For micromass cultures 12 cell density was adjusted

light microscopy After that cultures were harvested washed in PBS fixed in 4 Paraformaldehyde for 45 minutes dehydrated in graded series of Ethanol and paraffin embedded for subsequent analysis We used histochemical staining with Hematoxylin and Eosin to ascertain cell morphology and Alcian Blue at pH 1 43 to detect cartilage matrix sulfated glucosaminoglycans as described before 1 The

centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 minutes at 4 C Protein concentration in the supernatant was assessed by Micro BCA assay Pierce Chemicals Alkaline phosphatase activity in the supernatant was determined spectrophotometrically at 405 nm wavelength as the amount of p nitrophenol released from the substrate p nitrophenyl phosphate ALP10 Sigma Type X Collagen deposition in extracellular matrix was analyzed by immunohistchemistry using a monoclonal antibody against mouse type X Collagen Research Diagnostics Inc and the same secondary reagents as described above Apoptosis was assessed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL In situ Cell Death Detection Kit POD Boehringer Manheim Transgenic mice The generation of Hoxc 8 transgenic mice and the characterization of their phenotype have been published 1 Briefly Hoxc 8 expressing mice are generated in a binary transgenic mouse system 44 by crossing a transactivator strain harboring a transgene in which expression of the transcriptional transactivator VP16 is under control of the Hoxc 8 promoter 45 to a transresponder strain that carries as a transgene the Hoxc 8 cDNA linked to the ICP4 immediate early gene promoter which is silent in mice in the absence of VP16 45 46 Upon combination of both transgenes the Hoxc 8 transresponder transgene is activated and Hoxc 8 becomes overexpressed 23 This system also allows the generation of transgenic mice with increased gene dosage by superimposition of transgene loci to homozygosity 23 44 For the studies reported here we used the T239 transactivator and the IE c8 254 transresponder strains All procedures involving animals were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UNMC Hoxd 4 transgenic mice were generated using the same transactivator strain crossed to the IE d4 70 transresponder strain 1 Maintenance and genotyping of transgenic mice was done as described before 1 23 Unless otherwise noted cells and samples were obtained from animals hemizygous for both transgenes All transgenes were maintained on a homogenous FVB inbred genetic background and normal FVB mice were used as controls unless mentioned otherwise In vivo BrdU incorporation To assess chondrocyte proliferation in Hoxc 8 transgenic mice we performed in vivo BrdU labeling experiments BrdU labeling

embryos from the same litter according to anatomical landmarks of other tissues on the same section Cells in skeletal structures were counted from at least 5 samples 1 2 7 8 and more than 10 all other samples consecutive slides for each animal and cell counting was done independently by two technologists without knowledge of sample genotype Data were collected from three independent experiments and were averaged to cells section to normalize for potential growth differences between litters Exponential trendlines were added by regression analysis as implemented in Microsoft Excel Assessment of

pipetting cells were collected into Falcon 2052 12 75 mm Becton Dickinson tubes Cells were pelleted at 400 g for five minutes without brakes the supernatant was decanted and the pellet was loosened by vortexing at setting 4 Cells were washed with 1 BSA PBS and repelleted During cell resuspension 1 ml ice cold 70 Ethanol was added in which cells were either stored at 20 C for up to three days or processed after 20 minute fixation by repelleting Resuspension was done in 1 ml 2 N HCl 0 5 Triton X 100 and samples were incubated for 30 minutes at room temperature with vortexing every five minutes followed by repelleting After removal of the supernatant nuclei were resuspended in 1 ml 0 1 M Na 2 B 4 O 7 pH 8 5 for two minutes at room temperature and washed with 1 ml 0 5 Tween 20 1 BSA PBS Then 20 l FITC coupled anti BrdU antibody Becton Dickinson was added followed by 30 minute incubation at room temperature in the dark After another wash with 1 ml 0 5 Tween 20 1 BSA PBS nuclei were resuspended in 0 25 ml PBS containing 5 g ml Propidium Iodide filtered through 1 2 ml Costar cluster tubes Costar 4410 or 6 ml tubes with 35 m strainer cap Falcon 2235 Becton Dickinson in case of

Mix Applied Biosystems with denaturation at 94 C for 15 seconds annealing at 55 C for one minute and extension at 60 C for one minute in a total of 40 cycles 100 nM of each primer were used and 10 ng of template cDNA Measurements were done in triplicate for each sample and for each sample the cycle number Ct was determined at which signal above threshold was detected The values were averaged and standardized to measurements for GAPDH cDNA in the same sample by subtraction Ct GENE Ct GAPDH Ct This value for each gene in transgenic samples was then normalized for the value of the same gene in the control sample by a second subtraction Ct transgenic Ct control Ct The value for fold expression relative to the control is obtained by the formula f 2 Ct The resulting data were expressed as fold change relative to the gene expression level in the control which was prepared from an FVB mouse
