 Headline Hi Katha Couldn t agree with you more about tobacco I grew up imbibing the stuff from my chain puffing mother and can t stand it But I m at a loss as to why it gets so many people steamed at a political level Liberals particularly You d think if you read Frank Rich or Doonesbury that the tobacco companies represent the supreme evil in the universe when they re just a bunch of lying avaricious executives trying to make money In my book that s legal in America and ought to be Tax em to er death say I But stop preaching about it and passing virtual bills of attainder against them And don t try to persuade me that my mother never knew the risks of smoking She did My own theory is that liberals and lefties have to find some outlet for their authoritarian moral streak They ve given up on the economy in general having lost the argument completely And they know they shouldn t be sexual puritans And the Cold War is over so demonizing the military industrial complex is pass So they hammer the smokers Or rather they hammer the Big Tobacco execs in order to save the children Save me from saving the children The most heartening news from the younger generation this year apart from the popularity of South Park is that they re smoking in ever greater numbers Take that you do gooding liberal paternalists Oh did you see in the New York Times that daddy is finally helping out with the kids Fathers are apparently spending more time with their children and on household chores than a generation ago according to a self reported survey Is this a function of feminist lawmaking or the free market and empowered money making women Just wondering More mogul porn in the Times business section Yawn But a jolly piece on how Mr Scaife spent 2 million on the American Spectator s investigative journalism into Clinton Can you imagine what we could have done with two mill at TNR or The Nation The thing about the right wing conspiracy is that like most conspiracies it s both paranoid and incompetent In some ways Clinton has been lucky to have it around I think best Andrew
