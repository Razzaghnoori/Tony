 Waco Twofer Pyrotechnic Tear Gas and Delta Force After years of denial the FBI has admitted to using pyrotechnic or incendiary tear gas in the 1993 Federal assault on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco Texas What is pyrotechnic tear gas and why is it controversial Tear gas is a basic tool of law enforcement It causes extreme disabling but usually temporary discomfort and therefore is considered a humane alternative to using guns There are three common ways to disperse tear gas Aerosol hoses work like an insecticide spray They cause the least amount of physical damage but can only be used up close Powder grenades can be thrown from a distance and send up a mist of powder Pyrotechnic devices also launch tear gas from afar in combination with a heat source The result is an explosion releasing a cloud of tear gas particles mixed with smoke Pyrotechnic tear gas has tactical advantages First the smoke cloud obscures the movement of agents as they approach a building or crowd Second because the metal casing becomes quite hot it is difficult for the device to be thrown back at police a common problem with powder grenades The disadvantage is that it can start a fire The FBI insists however that the timing and location make it impossible to blame pyrotechnic tear gas for the fire that killed 76 people at Waco A former CIA officer told the Dallas Morning News that members of the Army s Delta Force were present at the Waco standoff Military documents confirmed that three commandos observed the siege on the Branch Davidian compound The Pentagon stated that it could not discuss any aspect of the Delta Force including whether it exists What is the Delta Force The Delta Force is a counterterrorism group established in 1977 by the Carter administration following some particularly bloody attacks on Americans abroad The thinking was that a small secret specially trained cadre of soldiers would be able to respond more effectively to terrorist threats particularly those involving hostages However Delta did not stay secret for long In their best known operation Delta troops assisted in the failed attempt to free American hostages from Iran in 1980 The Delta Force one of the Army s Special Operations units is based in a remote part of Ft Bragg N C and is estimated to be as large as 2 500 troops Delta commandos are known to have participated in U S military action in Grenada Panama Iraq and Somalia Use of the Delta Force at Waco is controversial because of the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act which makes it illegal to use federal troops to enforce laws within U S territory except when a presidential waiver is granted For years this resulted in a strict division between the military and civilian law enforcement But the restrictions were amended in the 1980s to allow military involvement in the drug war The Army may train law enforcement officials and lend them equipment for use in drug raids But military troops are still forbidden to be directly involved in searches seizures and arrests even those related to drug crimes Because rumors of a Branch Davidian drug lab were floated at Waco they later turned out to be false use of Delta Force troops as advisers in the raid may be legally justifiable In fact it is already public record that other parts of the military assisted in planning the raid and providing equipment But the level of Delta Force participation remains unknown If Delta commandos are found to have played an active role in the raid their participation may have crossed the line Next question The Explainer wishes to thank the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Mike Krawczyk of International Safety Protection Inc and Terry Grisold and D M Giangreco authors of Delta America s Elite Counterterrorist Force
