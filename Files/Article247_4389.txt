 Bellow the Fertility King Saul Bellow 84 last month fathered a child born to his fifth wife age 41 As a result of this news which trickled out last week Bellow risks being remembered not as the brilliant Nobel laureate author of Herzog and The Adventures of Augie March but as a Weekly World News curiosity Eighty four is older than 77 the previous famous guy becomes dad at advanced age record set by Tony Randall Most though obviously nowhere near all men over 70 are infertile It s so old in fact that Chatterbox wondered whether Bellow was the world s oldest dad period The new Guinness World Records 2000 Millennium Edition alas doesn t say though it does serve up as the Oldest Mother Arceli Keh 63 when she gave birth with a donated egg in Los Angeles in 1996 Incidentally Chatterbox must second Luc Sante s opinion expressed in the Jan 16 New York Times Book Review that the new Guinness is so glossied up and dumbed down these days it s mainly an appendage to a Guinness World Records Primetime TV show that it can no longer serve its hallowed function as settler of ale fueled pub arguments Two whole pages are devoted to world record stats about supermodels two more about high fashion and two more about street fashion Has anyone ever argued in a pub about who the highest paid supermodel is Best arse maybe but best remunerated The latter if you must know is Claudia Schiffer The hunt for the world s oldest dad led Chatterbox to a bookmark worthy Web site called World Sexual Records maintained by someone who identifies himself as J Means and who appears to be affiliated with the University of Texas Means didn t answer Chatterbox s e mail seeking more information about his bona fides but the UT directory lists a senior in the engineering school named Jon Means with the same e mail address On the site s Conception page the world s oldest father is identified as Leslie Colley a retired Australian mineworker who sired a son named Oswald in 1992 Colley was 92 at the time his wife who had married Colley two years earlier he told her he was only 70 was 39 Colley died six years later shortly before his 100 th birthday An April 1996 article in The Independent of London not available online says that yet another nonagenarian a bricklayer in his nineties became a father in 1995 but it doesn t supply any details so it s impossible to know whether he broke Colley s record The Independent piece also points out that literal interpretation of the Bible requires the faithful to believe that Abraham begat Isaac at 100 To summarize We don t know who the oldest dad ever was but it may have been Leslie Colley It certainly wasn t Bellow This means Bellow probably will be remembered mostly if not exclusively for his literary output Caveat Bellow may still be the oldest Nobel laureate dad in history Chatterbox awaits more information from Stockholm
