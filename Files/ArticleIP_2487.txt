 Bill Clinton Father Figure Isn t he a little old to have a girlfriend That was the perplexed comment that greeted my first halting efforts to explain the Clinton scandal to my children ages 6 and 9 I promptly began quoting the profundity to my friends and reflecting indignantly along with the rest of America on what a poor role model the overgrown youth in the White House is for our youth As the days have passed though I ve had an unnerving revelation The evasive man in the White House is a great role model for us parents Parents are under siege With children who are literate but not large and omnipresent X rated news mothers and fathers have been in for a lot of lip biting brow furrowing and earnest throat clearing Willy nilly we all turn into Slick Willies At least I did Herewith the unsubpoenaed diary of an artful dodger 1 Weak Kneed Denial For the first two days after the scandal breaks I snatch up the newspaper hurriedly at breakfast When the older child makes a grab for it I say a nervous twitch in my jaw and a certain tightness in my voice There is no interesting news I go to work worrying what the kids will hear in school whether I ve been too evasive how much more I m going to have to say 2 Weaseling Out of It The question comes over the weekend I emphasize the lying part and search for the formulation that will permit me to avoid anything that directly links the president to sex a concept I am not even sure my audience is able to define Hence my choice of the term a girlfriend I readily agree that he is a little old if it s true and quickly steer the discussion in another direction That s easy since they find the friend with the secret tape recorder fascinating 3 Dramatic Denial When pressed about my own opinion a day or so later I say firmly without jaw twitching that if the president has done what he is accused of he should definitely step down That seems to satisfy them 4 Well Timed Distraction It s Tuesday and when the State of the Union message comes on at 9 00 p m I eagerly give in when the kids plead from their beds to be allowed to come out and watch a little Some wholesome boring television their president doing what grown ups are supposed to do talk and talk and talk about nothing interesting I give a little civics lesson and go on about the beauties of the House chamber Their eyes glaze over and they don t protest when they are sent back to bed 5 Hunkering Down For the rest of the week I follow a modified limited hangout strategy saying things like we ll just have to wait and see the evidence isn t in yet we just aren t in a position to explain anything more Luckily it s a classmate not one of my own kids who asks his mother at bedtime What s oral sex 6 Conspiracy Hysteria Friday evening it looks like it might be safe to turn on the television since the day s news has featured of all things reticence Information about Lewinsky has been barred in Paula Jones lawsuit and Monica doesn t seem to be offering as much dirt as hoped Quickly discovering my mistake It s OK to have sex just not all the time declares a talking head I turn off the tube My kids object I rant about nosy prosecutors and a media conspiracy to drag out this unpleasant business for much too long It s like indoor and outdoor voices I sputter Some things should not be endlessly discussed in public they re private matters I believe my own outburst I m also hoping that by irately staking out the high ground I can distract the kids from their many questions about you know what They look at me calmly and figure it s a good moment to bargain for another cookie 7 Damage Control The second weekend arrives and I conclude that it s time to deal with my audience on a less ad hoc basis I call a couple of other parents to compare notes and confer about strategy it turns out my friend fielded the dread question with the old deafness routine I want something more organized to rely on some material at the ready At my out of date public library I peruse books on the beauties of baby making At my up to date local bookstore I peruse books about how touching parts of your changing body feels so good I have no idea what to buy and suppose the best course is probably to get a little bit of everything This is an issue that is not going away I m quite sure my children know they re not getting the full version of events I have the feeling they re going to let me get away with it and I think on balance that is all for the best They are after all children
