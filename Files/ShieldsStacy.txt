 OK Have you lived in Charlotte your whole life Yes I have Is there anything you want to talk about in relate relating to Charlotte or any particular stories you would like to share Um well when I was about 15 I had to move from one part of Charlotte to another and it was a very hard experience for me because um my mother had was remarried um because my father had died a few years prior to this So um my family life was already kind of disrupted so being pulled away from all my friends um really tore part of my life up because I was leaving you know the best group of friends that I d even known and I d grown up with them from like elementary school to high school And um so I was really upset I was angry with my mom We didn t speak She sent me to like a frigging shrink to um help maybe you know sort through my emotions or whatever OK Um so uh but what but actually my move was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me oddly enough um because when I moved um I met like you know close friends that actually now I go to college with and who I was a roommate with for a year or so Um so even though it was kind of a scary experience being uprooted from everything you knew um it gave me the chance to see that change is good and that um seeing a different part of you know just different parts of the same town it s still very beneficial because it gave me the chance to realize how to adapt to different situations into a different environment relatively quickly Um because I ended up making a lot of good friends and um really loving the part of town that I moved to and really adapting to um my community there um and getting involved And actually the friends that I made there are the ones I ended up going to college with and not the ones from my first high school Right So um Do you feel it made it easier for you to adapt to college life because of the move Definitely Because I was already in one sense ready to for another change Whereas a lot of my friends had never even been in a different situation in a different group of friends from the ones they had known from elementary school They couldn t imagine being uprooted and not seeing the same faces every day Whereas I d already had this type of thing in my life so I was more I think I was quicker to adapt to a different college surroundings Uh huh Do you feel that it was hard being the new person in school I mean were people really did they I don t know how to put it They didn t like me at first cause I was the new girl and where you know most of the guys if a new girl comes in of course they re going to be friendly just because it s new blood or whatever Right But the girls did not want to have anything to do with me they re catty It was like I was you know invading their territory or whatever Um so it really took them probably I d say at least three months before I d actually consider them my friends because I d have classes with um Stephanie who is one of my good friends now but she did not talk to me for the first three months I mean and she even admitted that she didn t like me because I was new Even though I don t think it was because of anything I d done because I had hardly said two words since I didn t know anybody but um they were real coy towards me you know But it Why do you think that is Why do you thing do you think that s just girls in general Actually I think it is most girls in general It s just a natural thing if you if you have certain guy friends that you become very possessive over and you see someone whether it s their new girlfriend or their new best friend or whatever comes in and takes up some of your time I think it s just human nature to get jealous and to kind of put up a you know an offensive front to whoever the invader or the intruder is So I think I ve probably done the some time in my life so I don t have any hard feelings towards them And you feel it was a good thing overall the whole experience of moving and being the new kid and Absolutely I wouldn t trade that experience for the world because there are too many people that I know who are very sheltered from not only new experiences from like new ideas and new situations and so I think it s kind of a blessing that I had the chance to go through this in the kind of um be the new kid and see what it was like to be the outsider and to not be in the in crowd you know Because I mean I think a lot of people who have never been on the outside don t understand what it s like to be kind of the kid that s you know not Mr Popularity you know Who doesn t have all the friends and who doesn t get all the attention and so it was nice because you know in school like I had a good circle of friends I was always you know an athlete or whatever so you know I received the attention But for those few months that I was the outsider I really got to see what it was like you know to not be you know cool or whatever Uh huh Now I understand Is there anything else you d like to say or Umm other than it was a good experience that s about it Well thank you so very much for sharing your experience with us You re very welcome
