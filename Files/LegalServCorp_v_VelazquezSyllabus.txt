 SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES Syllabus LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ ET AL CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT No 99 603 Argued October 4 2000 Decided February 28 2001 The Legal Services Corporation Act authorizes petitioner Legal Services Corporation LSC to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to local grantee organizations providing free legal assistance to indigent clients in inter alia welfare benefits claims In every annual appropriations Act since 1996 Congress has prohibited LSC funding of any organization that represented clients in an effort to amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law Grantees cannot continue representation in a welfare matter even where a constitutional or statutory validity challenge becomes apparent after representation is well under way Respondents lawyers employed by LSC grantees together with others filed suit to declare inter alia the restriction invalid The District Court denied them a preliminary injunction but the Second Circuit invalidated the restriction finding it impermissible viewpoint discrimination that violated the First Amendment Held The funding restriction violates the First Amendment Pp 5 15 a LSC and the Government also a petitioner claim that Rust v Sullivan 500 U S 173 in which this Court upheld a restriction prohibiting doctors employed by federally funded family planning clinics from discussing abortion with their patients supports the restriction here However the Court has since explained that the Rust counseling activities amounted to governmental speech sustaining view Together with No 99 960 United States v Velazquez et al also on certiorari to the same court LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION v VELAZQUEZ Syllabus point based funding decisions in instances in which the government is itself the speaker see Board of Regents of Univ of Wis System v Southworth 529 U S 217 229 235 or instances like Rust in which the government uses private speakers to transmit information pertaining to its own program Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors of Univ of Va 515 U S 819 833 Although the government has the latitude to ensure that its own message is being delivered neither that latitude nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance Like the Rosenberger program the LSC program was designed to facilitate private speech not to promote a governmental message An LSC attorney speaks on behalf of a private indigent client in a welfare benefits claim while the Government s message is delivered by the attorney defending the benefits decision The attorney s advice to the client and advocacy to the courts cannot be classified as governmental speech even under a generous understanding of that concept In this vital respect this suit is distinguishable from Rust Pp 5 8 b The private nature of the instant speech and the extent of LSC s regulation of private expression are indicated further by the circumstance that the Government seeks to control an existing medium of expression in ways which distort its usual functioning Cases involving a limited forum though not controlling provide instruction for evaluating restrictions in governmental subsidies Here the program presumes that private nongovernmental speech is necessary and a substantial restriction is placed upon that speech By providing subsidies to LSC the Government seeks to facilitate suits for benefits by using the State and Federal Judiciaries and the independent bar on which they depend for the proper performance of their duties and responsibilities Restricting LSC attorneys in advising their clients and in presenting arguments and analyses to the courts distorts the legal system by altering the attorneys traditional role in much the same way broadcast systems or student publication networks were changed in the limited forum cases of Arkansas Ed Television Comm n v Forbes 523 U S 666 and Rosenberger v Rector and Visitors of Univ of Va supra The Government may not design a subsidy to effect such a serious and fundamental restriction on the advocacy of attorneys and the functioning of the judiciary An informed independent judiciary presumes an informed independent bar However the instant restriction prevents LSC attorneys from advising the courts of serious statutory validity questions It also threatens severe impairment of the judicial function by sifting out cases presenting constitutional challenges in order to insulate the Government s laws from judicial inquiry The result of this restriction would be two tiers of cases There would be lingering doubt Cite as 531 U S ____ 2001 Syllabus whether an LSC attorney s truncated representation had resulted in complete analysis of the case full advice to the client and proper presentation to the court and the courts and the public would come to question the adequacy and fairness of professional representations when the attorney avoided all reference to statutory validity and constitutional authority questions A scheme so inconsistent with accepted separation of powers principles is an insufficient basis to sustain or uphold the restriction on speech Pp 8 12 c That LSC attorneys can withdraw does not make the restrictionharmless for the statute is an attempt to draw lines around the LSC program to exclude from litigation arguments and theories Congress finds unacceptable but which by their nature are within the courts province to consider The restriction is even more problematic because in cases where the attorney withdraws the indigent client is unlikely to find other counsel There may be no alternative source of vital information on the client s constitutional or statutory rights in stark contrast to Rust where a patient could receive both governmentally subsidized counseling and consultation with independent or affiliate organizations Finally notwithstanding Congress purpose to confine and limit its program the restriction insulates current welfare laws from constitutional scrutiny and certain other legal challenges a condition implicating central First Amendment concerns There can be little doubt that the LSC Act funds constitutionally protected expression and there is no programmatic message of the kind recognized in Rust and which sufficed there to allow the Government to specify the advice deemed necessary for its legitimate objectives Pp 12 14 d The Court of Appeals concluded that the funding restriction could be severed from the statute leaving the remaining portions operative Because that determination was not contested here the Court in the exercise of its discretion and prudential judgment declines to address it Pp 14 15 164 F 3d 757 affirmed KENNEDY J delivered the opinion of the Court in which STEVENS SOUTER GINSBURG and BREYER JJ joined SCALIA J filed a dissenting opinion in which REHNQUIST C J and O CONNOR and THOMAS JJ joined
