                                 Whither the Intelligentsia                        Dear Nat            The problem with the educated elite is that nobodystays put In the past  hours The Atlantic hasbeen purchased and the wonderful Michael Kelly has been installed as editor inchief another blow to the old Protestant Establishment and another victory forthe ethnics and Chuck Lane has been deposed as editor of the New Republic and Peter Beinart has been put in I was with Beinartall yesterday at a conference in Maine He was pulled out for an urgent call atone point but he didnt say a word about how his life had been changed Somuch discretion in one so young Amazing            I will be gossiping about these maneuverings and thecurrent ridiculous smears against Gary Bauer all day but I suppose here weshould rise to a higher sphere and talk literature I wanted to take advantageof your presence here and ask you about the form of this book rather than thecontent Lemann has written his analysis of the meritocracy as a narrativeMeanwhile both of us are frustrated because the analytical or polemicalconclusion to his book is so short It seems to me this is characteristic ofbook writing these days We are in a great age of nonfiction narrative writingThere have been many great biographies written over the past couple of decadesEdmund Morris gets credit for writing one of themhis TR book and therehave been several great narrative nonfiction books Richard Ben CramersWhat It Takes comes to mind Lemann himself is anaccomplished author of narratives            But when I look back at my favorite period of Americannonfictionthe period between  and the books that leap out were notnarratives Many great and influential books were written during that timeThe Rise and Fall of Great American Cities The Organization Man  TheProtestant Establishment  Silent Spring The Feminist Mystique  TheLonely Crowd which you worked on I believe TheCultural Contradictions of Capitalism  The Machinein the Garden  The Image I could go on and on            My impression is that in the s and s therewerent as many influential popular but intellectual books of that sort Therewere a few The Rise of the Counterculture andThe Culture of Narcissism come to mind but not asmany To avoid looking like a flatterer Im leaving your stuff likeBeyond the Melting Pot out of this Then in thes a new wave of nonfiction successes hit the bestseller lists These werepolemical conservative books Losing Ground The Closing of the American Mind  Wealth and Poverty  and so on There was a time for a decade or sowhen every weeks bestseller list had at least one rightwing polemic onit            But that phase too is over Now the most notablenonfiction books are celebrity books or narratives I think some of this has todo with the declining prestige of the intellectual In the s and early sit seems to me intellectuals were confident of their social roles There werefigures like Hannah Arendt Reinhold Niebuhr and Edmund Wilson doing theirthing Journalists like Jane Jacobs and for a time Daniel Bell still followedan intellectual model when writing their books            But somehow the intelligentsia in the Russian senselost its confidence and broad vision over the next decades Academics starteddoing more professionalized stuff that people like me never read Andjournalists started doing narratives and biographies like Lemann or SamTanenhaus or J Anthony Lukas            The narratives make for better reads but I do missthose big uppermiddlebrow books like Daniel Bell and Jane Jacobs used towrite Or more properly I wish that the books that follow in that traditionwere getting more attention and more sales these days Maybe people have lessfaith in the social sciences as well and so just want to hear about stories andpersonalities            Anyway Im just conjecturing about all this but youhave been active during this whole period Is my description of the trends innonfiction accurate Do you have an explanation            All the bestDavid
