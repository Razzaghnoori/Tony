 Background In spite of advances in surgical and pharmacological treatment about half of the aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH patients die and many who survive need rehabilitation to maintain independence causing significant economic losses to medical and social care About 90 of SAH cases are caused by a ruptured IA 1 Per case mortality for ruptured IAs is about 30 to 50 and morbidity about 66 as opposed to about 2 mortality and 4 morbidity for elective surgery of unruptured IAs in asymptomatic low risk patients 2 3 Given the marked contrast between the outcomes of elective versus emergency surgery the goal has to be identification and treatment of IAs prior to rupture There is substantial debate regarding the cost benefit ratio of population screening 4 5 6 7 8 Restricting screening to those individuals at high risk both for developing IA and for rupture would improve the cost benefit ratio Characterization of environmental and genetic risk factors would allow not only reduction of risk through behavior modification but also significantly improve detection Additionally some environmental and genetic risk factors may be amenable to pharmacological intervention Simple tests for genetic risk factors would permit the identification of individuals at high risk for development and rupture of aneurysms consequently allowing diagnostic effort to be concentrated on a smaller group that is at higher risk Currently several risk factors have been identified including cigarette smoking arterial hypertension gender aging atherosclerosis and heavy alcohol consumption 9 10 11 12 Initial indications of a genetic component were based on collections of case reports that suggested that IAs are associated with some rare simple Mendelian disorders e g autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease Ehlers Danlos syndrome type IV and the Marfan syndrome 13 More recent systematic prevalence estimates indicate either absence of association or markedly reduced prevalence of IA among patients with rare simple Mendelian disorders 14 15 Also genetic analyses of genes known to cause some simple Mendelian disorders have proven negative for collections of patients with IA 16 17 The familial occurrence of IAs not associated with known simple Mendelian disorders was first noted in 1942 18 and since then nearly one hundred case reports and review articles have been published Population based studies of SAH probands show that 7 to 10 have a family history of IA a higher percentage than previously appreciated 1 19 20 These familial IA FIA families have no signs of any other simple Mendelian disorders predisposing to IA supporting the possibility that some or all IAs have a genetic component and that FIA is a genetic disease separate and apart from previously defined diseases The inheritance patterns of FIA have not been determined partly because IA is a late age at onset disease and partly because it is likely to be a multifactorial disease for which simple Mendelian models will not fit well 1 21 22 23 Methods Study subjects Eighty five families with at least two members with ruptured or unruptured IA and no family history of polycystic kidney disease were ascertained from a sampling frame of 1150 consecutive patients treated between 1977 and 1990 for aneurysmal SAH by the Department of Neurosurgery at the University Hospital of Kuopio which serves a genetically homogenous population of 870 000 in eastern Finland 1 Initially family history was assessed by a short questionnaire and all putative cases were confirmed from medical and autopsy records Due to the high mortality of IA and lack of pre rupture symptoms surviving relatives with known IA were rare We therefore used magnetic resonance angiography to screen 264 siblings over the age of 30 of the IA probands 1 Positive magnetic resonance angiography findings were then confirmed using digital subtraction angiography Upper abdominal ultrasonography was performed on all screened individuals and confirmed that none of these individuals had evidence of polycystic kidney disease In this manner we detected 30 siblings with asymptomatic IA giving a total of 49 affected sib pairs from 25 sibships 22 extended families families 10 21 and 29 had two sibships each Figure 1and Table 1 One non sib pair was detected in one of the sibships in family 21 see Statistical analyses below Figure 1 and eliminated from the analyses leaving 48 ASPs for the genome scan The ASPs were comprised of 26 males and 34 females Blood samples were obtained from affected family members unaffected siblings and parents where possible Due to the late age at onset parents were available in only a few of the families All family records were confirmed through registries kept by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Boards of both the University Hospital of Kuopio and Wayne State University Study design Whole genome scans are labor intensive and costly since each individual in the study must be genotyped for all markers Reduction of the number of samples genotyped or the number of markers or both has been shown to be efficient 24 25 26 27 28 We used a two stage design In stage 1 samples are genotyped at low density and subsequently at higher density in stage 2 thereby reducing the overall number of markers genotyped Stage 1 data were analysed using a liberal 0 05 lod 0 8 Regions exceeding the threshold were genotyped in stage 2 Power was computed assuming a two stage design 49 ASPs and a map density of 15 cM For stage I alone we had at least 96 power to detect significant linkage lod score of 3 6 29 to a locus with a locus specific relative risk to siblings of 8 and at least 90 power to detect suggestive linkage to a locus with a locus specific relative risk of 4 DNA isolation and pre amplification Blood was collected into EDTA containing tubes Genomic DNA was isolated either by an automated procedure Genepure DNA extractor Applied Biosystems Inc Foster City CA or manually Puregene DNA isolation kit Gentra Systems Inc Minneapolis MN Genotyping was performed using genomic DNA either untreated or amplified linearly using primer extension preamplification 30 31 Approximately 0 5 g genomic DNA was used for preamplification with an N 15 primer 30 31 The resulting preamplified DNA was then used as a template in marker PCRs with specific primers Genotyping Most of the initial genotyping was performed by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Mammalian Genotyping Service at the Marshfield Research Foundation using the 10 cM Weber version 8 screening set 32 Primer pairs for additional markers were obtained from Research Genetics Inc Huntsville AL For the additional genotyping PCRs were carried out with one of the primers radioactively labeled PCRs were set up using a laboratory workstation Biomek 1000 Beckman Palo Alto CA and performed in PEC 9600 thermal cyclers Perkin Elmer Cetus Foster City CA The alleles were scored visually from autoradiographs and entered into an Oracle database Oracle Corp Redwood Shores CA Population frequencies for each marker were estimated from a sample of 20 to 24 unrelated Finnish subjects Statistical analyses A Markov process based test of genetic relationship 33 using all the marker data across the genome was used on each nuclear family to confirm the sib pair relationship one non sib pair was detected in one of the sibships in family 21 Figure 1 and eliminated from the analyses The results were consequently derived from 24 sibships Figure 1 The genotype data were analyzed for genetic linkage with both single marker and multipoint model free ASP lod score analysis 34 using the computer program MAPMAKER SIBS 35 Results Genome wide linkage analysis We performed stage I of a two stage genome scan using the 48 Finnish ASPs Due to the genetic homogeneity of the Finnish population 36 37 38 39 40 the probability of identifying genetic risk factors in a complex disease such as FIA may be substantially improved 37 38 40 In the first stage a 10 cM genome scan was performed using the Weber screening set 8 32 and the data analyzed using both two point and multipoint ASP linkage analysis Seven regions on chromosomes 4 6 7p 7q 14 19 and X with multipoint lod scores exceeding 0 8 pointwise P value 0 05 were identified Table 2 Two regions had MLSs exceeding 2 0 2 58 on chromosome 19 2 08 on chromosome X Two point lod scores exceeded 1 0 for two adjacent markers in each of these regions ruling out substantial genotyping error in one marker as the cause of the high lod scores Three additional regions with multipoint lod scores exceeding 0 8 chromosomes 4 6 and 7q also had substantial two point lod scores at more than one marker For two regions 7p and 14q however only one marker had a high two point lod score In both cases the significant marker was either the first or the last marker typed on the chromosome Following conventional guidelines we considered an MLS of 3 6 or greater to be significant linkage and an MLS of 2 2 to be suggestive linkage 29 In stage 2 we genotyped additional markers in the seven regions identified in stage 1 Four additional markers flanking D7S1819 on 7p and nine additional markers flanking D14S1434 on 14q were typed and the resulting maximum MLSs were 0 28 7p and 0 80 14q indicating that the previous linkage signals were likely due to the increased statistical variability commonly seen in the multipoint signal at the most extreme markers We therefore eliminated regions 7p and 14q from further consideration Additional markers were typed in the two regions on chromosome 19 and X with maximum MLSs exceeding 2 0 A multipoint plot for the chromosome 19 is shown in Figure 2 the maximum MLS was 2 58 at D19S245 D19S246 The maximum MLS for chromosome X decreased from 2 08 at DXS987 to 1 33 at DXS1226 about 10 cM centromeric from DXS987 The MLS for the region on chromosome X decreased considerably with the addition of several new markers and consequent improvement in the accuracy of the multipoint allele sharing estimates which were clearly overestimated when only the initial scan markers were included in the analysis All the evidence for linkage in this region was due to 8 brother brother pairs the 16 sister sister pairs and the 25 brother sister pairs gave maximum MLSs close to zero in this region Discussion The relatively high prevalence of IAs and aneurysmal SAH place the disease in the group of moderately common disorders Consequently it shares some of the features that make common disorders complex with respect to genetic analysis These include low sibling relative risks due to the high population prevalence presence of multiple genetic loci each contributing a small portion of the sibling relative risk incomplete penetrance of genetic loci environmental risk factors late age at onset and phenocopies i e disease due to purely environmental factors Additional complexity for genetic analysis arises due to diagnostic uncertainty Several measures were taken to increase the probability of success We used robust model free allele sharing genetic analyses to address the complexity we studied a relatively genetically homogenous population and we verified that all putative IAs were saccular 1 20 41 42 43 It is expected that a genetically homogeneous population particularly one with a recent population bottleneck 37 38 segregates for fewer disease loci thereby allowing a smaller sample size to be informative Additionally our study design was cost effective two stage design with 48 ASPs We are collecting an additional 150 ASPs for further study The most promising locus with a maximum MLS of 2 6 was on chromosome 19 The peak is located approximately in 19q12 13 a gene rich region containing a number of loci related to cerebrovascular cardiovascular and membrane physiology and pathobiology These include urokinase type plasminogen activator receptor PLAUR MIM 173391 see Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man http www ncbi nlm nih gov omim 44 apolipoproteins E MIM 107741 CII MIM 207750 and CI MIM

MIM 141500 51 52 It is noteworthy that none of the regions in which we found some evidence for linkage either tentative or suggestive are similar to the regions detected in another recent genome wide scan for IA susceptibility genes 53 Although our study found evidence for a region with tentative linkage on chromosome 7q the region identified in this study is near the telomere and does not overlap with the region of suggestive linkage near the centromere on 7q identified in Onda et al 53 The populations that were studied are distinct Finns as compared to Japanese however both samples were small and it is therefore possible that there may yet be some overlap in genetic predisposition Conclusions We detected two regions of suggestive linkage one on chromosome 19 and the other on the X chromosome in a sample of Finnish ASPs Although we initially detected regions of tentative linkage on chromosomes 4 6 7p 7q and 14 the regions on 7p and 14 were excluded upon additional genotyping None of the regions detected in this study overlap with the regions detected in a sample of Japanese ASPs 53 Competing interests None declared Authors contributions Author 1 JMO participated in the
