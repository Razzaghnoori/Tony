 eBabe This week soft porn entrepreneur Ron Harris began auctioning the eggs of fashion models on the Internet His site ronsangels com named after the 1970s babe show Charlie s Angels invites visitors to bid on eggs from beautiful healthy and intelligent women Like Dr Richard Seed who recently declared his intention to clone human beings Harris has attracted the attention of the media and politicians who are looking into whether he can be stopped Most people agree that Harris is a creep and that his site is an outrage What they don t agree on is why Here s what the critics have to say about the auction and each other 1 Egg auctions will produce designer babies Harris cites his experience as a horse breeder and asks We bid for everything else in this society why not eggs Alarmists agreeing that Harris can put you into your own designer baby by selling eggs predict that his success will steer the future of human breeding toward genetic engineering 2 Egg auctions will fail to produce designer babies While fretting about what will happen if Harris succeeds fertility experts simultaneously debunk that scenario Not only is it ethically ludicrous but the fact is no kid s going to look like the model s picture observes ethicist George Annas The experts give four reasons First the child of an ugly man and a pretty woman is just as likely to be ugly as to be pretty Second everyone carries recessive genes which are invisible in this generation but may become visible in the next A model with a small nose can pass on genes for a big nose Third even if both parents are attractive a child can combine their features unattractively For example a girl can inherit her mother s weak nose and her father s strong brow 3 Egg auctions will promote the survival of the fittest Doomsayers predict that once beautiful eggs are available strictly to people who are willing to spend an ungodly sum for them the rich will transform themselves into a super race reminiscent of the Nazis To this Harris replies It is not our intention to suggest that we make a super society of only beautiful people This site simply mirrors our current society in that beauty usually goes to the highest bidder But this reply only fuels concern that gradually society will separate into genetic haves and have nots 4 Egg auctions will promote the survival of the unfittest Harris writes that only men with substantial financial resources are fit to give his models offspring a financially secure and stable life But skeptics wonder whether women who sell their eggs to the highest bidder and men who buy these eggs for the sole purpose of spawning good looking children may produce children just as dysfunctional as themselves As Calgary Sun columnist Sydney Sharpe put it Any woman who enters into this mephistophelian pact has a few screws loose Maybe her kid will too Not to mention the buyers who sign her up 5 Egg auctions will fail to promote the survival of the unfittest Many models if not most have had cosmetic surgery A model who is perfectly ruthless will conceal this fact when selling her eggs One of Harris angels has already been caught lying about her age How does Harris know whether his models have had collagen injections and nose jobs There s no way to know that You can ask the girl and hope she tells you the truth he says Annas concludes that since there s no way to know how much of their beauty is a product of their genes plastic surgery a makeup artist or exercise only a naive person would buy their eggs on the basis of the photographs displayed on the site You don t want to see the models he points out You want to see pictures of their parents On this theory children produced by the egg auction are likely to be the offspring of liars on one side and fools on the other 6 Beauty doesn t convey health Harris casually asserts that beauty shows healthiness and longevity On his site he writes Natural Selection is choosing genes that are healthy and beautiful Skeptics question this assumed equivalence noting that traits men find attractive in women these days thinness for example are often unhealthy When asked on the Today show how much medical screening he has given his egg donors Harris answered None 7 Beauty is less meaningful than intelligence Harris says he s not the first person to market good genes Others he notes have sold sperm and solicited eggs on the basis of the donor s intelligence Harris detractors reply that beauty is superficial and conveys a harmful preoccupation with exterior appearances over intelligence and content of character This critique is usually offered by a blow dried TV interviewer who after thanking Harris for his time urges viewers to stay tuned for the movie starlet who will join the program after a brief commercial break 8 Beauty is less useful than intelligence Harris advertises beauty not as an end but as a means to success since people who are physically desirable get more attention power and favorable treatment Having chided Harris for exalting social advantage over character critics turn around and adopt his ruthless logic While conceding that beauty is useful they argue that intelligence is a better weapon in today s meritocratic information economy and that although Harris claims his models are beautiful healthy and intelligent he offers no evidence of brains such as IQ or SAT scores London s Independent envisions Bimbo births A fertility expert shrugs If people want to spend 150 000 for the eggs of a gorgeous woman who has an IQ of 68 let them 9 The auction exploits desperate buyers Harris preaches pure capitalism saying it s unfair to put a limit on a girl s ability to make money by auctioning her eggs In turn fertility clinic operators accuse Harris of taking advantage of couples trying to conceive and exploiting desperate people susceptible to the dreams he is trying to sell USA Today laments This is about human need And human greed 10 The auction exploits desperate sellers By late Monday Harris had only a handful of bids and only one was verified as legitimate On the other hand 50 women had asked him to put their eggs up for auction Gradually the media concluded that the donors were the true victims USA Today described the models as struggling actresses reported that they were unaware of the health risks of donating eggs and quoted one as saying I d rather do this than do Playboy or Penthouse Harris sole verified bidder told the paper that selling eggs was better than prostitution Harris constantly refers to the donors as his girls and describes them like cattle We have a legitimate bid of 42 000 on one of the girls He gets a 20 percent commission on each winning bid though he takes no responsibility for executing financial transactions or medical procedures We have no control over the quality safety or legality of the items advertised the truth or accuracy of the listings the ability of sellers to sell items or the ability of buyers to buy items he stipulates His role he explains is simply to find beautiful girls take beautiful photographs of them and put them up on the Web To some critics the mystery isn t as Harris suggests how women throughout history have exploited their sexual power over men but how pimps like him have come away with the profit 11 The auction exploits voyeurs The Washington Post thinks Harris isn t targeting either buyers or sellers He s not serious about selling eggs says the Post He s just using the sex appeal of his models and the intriguing perversity of a human egg auction to drum up publicity and attract Internet traffic to his site from which he can sell advertising and subscriptions 24 95 a month to view profiles of the models hawk his forthcoming book Naked Power and direct prurient visitors to his various porn sites A spokesman for fertility doctors suspects that ronsangels com is really aimed at adolescent boys 12 The Internet facilitates monstrous purchases Technology watchdogs call the egg auction another chapter in the cultural slide marked by Jennycam a Web site featuring live video of a young woman undressing and doing other normal activities in her apartment the promised Webcast of a man and woman losing their virginity together which turned out to be a hoax and a human kidney auction that was conducted and aborted on eBay last month Ever since the Internet it seems to snowball more rapidly this depersonalization of people and selling of eggs one fertility expert complains to the New York Times USA Today says the egg auction just might force an Internet obsessed society to finally sit down and ask itself Where is the Internet taking us 13 The Internet cheats people of their monstrous purchases The only thing worse than buying human eggs on the Internet according to the critics is not getting the eggs you paid for When you have large transactions of this kind conducted over the Internet there may be fraud a computer crime expert warns USA Today Lori Andrews a reproductive technology lawyer warns CNN viewers that there s very little that you can do to prove that these eggs actually came from the donors that were expected and the Internet just adds a layer that it makes it even more difficult to scrutinize where the eggs are coming from 14 Egg buyers will reap unintended consequences Sophisticated skeptics point out that Harris application of Darwin s theories to human professional success overlooks the interaction of genetics and human psychology To begin with if a child produced by Harris auction fails to turn out as pretty as the buyer expected the buyer may shun the child or the child may grow to hate herself for disappointing her parents On the Today show Harris said of this theory That s a pretty cynical view of human nature Second if the child turns out pretty but doesn t want to be a beauty queen her parents may force her in that direction anyway thereby stifling her true talents and preventing her from becoming successful Third the child s good looks may attract too much attention of the wrong kind eventually destroying her Critics cite Elvis Presley and Marilyn Monroe as examples 15 Other people s eggs don t pass on your genes In defense of his auction Harris quotes author Helen Fisher s statement that having sex is the most important act of your life This is how we get our genes to the next generation But Harris seems to have overlooked the crucial words our genes The drive to send your own genes into tomorrow is much stronger than the drive to pick out of a sperm bank or egg site Fisher observes This consideration may not affect single men but it can be a decisive turnoff for couples On this view Harris mistake is not that he focuses too much on selfishness but that he neglects it He forgets that you don t care about reproducing unless what you re reproducing is yourself 16 The power of beauty should be transcended not exploited Harris preaches that the world rewards beauty because it s human nature to favor those who are pleasant to look at and therefore the way to have successful children is to make sure they re attractive The most ambitious response is to attack the whole prejudice in favor of beauty The standards of beauty do vary with the culture And they are social facts not really genetics facts says Hastings Center ethicist Bruce Jennings Therefore we should think about whether to accept the existing prejudices and then try to eugenically manipulate them or to transcend those prejudices This critique challenges two precepts of Harris worldview First while pretending to accept human nature as a given he violates it by peddling strangers eggs and encouraging the production of children who will probably never know their mothers Family association loyalty and love are among the best parts of human nature Slavish catering to physically attractive strangers is among the worst If we re going to challenge human nature the critics ask why not start with the latter rather than the former Second Harris assumes that the perfection parents want in their children coincides with Darwinian perfection Every organism is trying to evolve to its most perfect state he writes What he doesn t seem to understand is that human beings aren t quite like other animals just as the rest of the world isn t exactly like the modeling and soft porn industries of Southern California Humans have evolved to a stage at which our ideas about virtue perfection and success have become more than material At least most of us have
