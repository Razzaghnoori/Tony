                            Obesity in particular visceral adiposity is positively correlated with insulin        resistance and type  diabetes Although the link is well established in humans and in        rodent models the mechanisms involved in obesityrelated insulin resistance are not clear        One possibility is that hormones secreted by adipocytes compromise peripheral insulin        sensitivity and a number of candidates for such adipocyte signals have been identified        One of them resistin was discovered a few years ago by Mitchell Lazar and colleagues who        showed that the protein is expressed by mouse adipocytes and regulated by a group of        antidiabetic drugs called thiazolidinediones Several lines of evidence from functional        studies in rodents suggested that resistin could be the missing mechanistic link between        obesity and diabetes        The human homolog of resistin has subsequently been under intense investigation but        initial studies revealed more differences than similarities between the human and rodent        proteins human resistin is mostly expressed in macrophages not in adipocytes and its        serum levels do not correlate as clearly with obesity insulin resistance or diabetes        Similarly genetic association studies between allelic variants of the resistin gene and        metabolic abnormalities have so far been inconclusive These results prompted some of the        scientists in the field who had jumped on the resistin bandwagon after the initial results        in rodents to jump off again Others including the resistin discoverers continue their        quest to uncover resistins role in humans and have started to think outside the framework        defined by the mouse data        Starting with the role of macrophages in inflammation and encouraged by the fact that        obesity and insulin resistance are associated with markers of systemic inflammation Lazar        and colleagues examined the resistin response to inflammatory stimulators As they report        in this issue resistin production in macrophages and serum levels in patients are        significantly increased by these stimulators This response can be blocked by the        thiazolidinedione rosiglitazone and by aspirin two drugs that have dual antiinflammatory        and insulinsensitizing actions and antagonize the immune regulator NFkappaB The        researchers go on to show that activation of NFkappaB is sufficient to induce resistin        expression And NFkappaB is necessary for the resistin response to inflammatory        stimuli        Lazar and colleagues now view obesity as a state of chronic inflammation and speculate        that in obese individuals inflammatory cytokines lead to elevated production of resistin by        macrophages and elevated serum resistin levels which in turn contribute to insulin        resistance and diabetes This is consistent with some studies that have found higher        resistin levels in obese individuals and patients with insulin resistance andor diabetes        but not all studies have found such differences        Jeffrey Flier an obesity researcher who was not involved in the study calls the        article an excellent and timely paper that demonstrates the fact that inflammatory        pathways induce resistin expression and levels in human monocytes ex vivo and in intact        humans The work appears to provide a novel link between inflammation and insulin        resistance through monocyte derived resistin He points out however that several other        factors also appear to contribute directly to insulin resistance in inflammation eg        cytokines themselves without invoking resistin so the full biologic implications of the        high resistin levels for insulin resistance in humans cannot be determined from this        study Resistin it seems continues to resist easy interpretations
