 My Way to the eBay According to the voice on the radio we should all be worried about compulsive gamblers who spend several hours a day playing slot machines I can t figure out what the voice was thinking Nobody who spends several hours a day playing slot machines can be called a gambler Gambling is about risk and uncertainty Sit long enough in front of the slots and you ll lose your money at an entirely predictable rate That s the very opposite of gambling Here s what a gambler does He takes a large fraction of what he s got and risks it on a single spin of the wheels You don t see much of that in the casinos Instead you see folks lugging around buckets filled with quarters parceling those quarters out one at a time There s a name for that strategy It s called diversification and its purpose is to eliminate risk The more time these people spend at the slot machines the less they re gambling Now I m willing to believe this behavior can become compulsive but there are still distinctions worth maintaining These people aren t addicted to gambling They re addicted to sitting in front of slot machines Likewise I m not addicted to shopping I m addicted to eBay the hottest auction site on the Internet I know this because my bidding strategy which would appear insane to any casual but thoughtful observer makes sense only in the presence of a compulsion to spend as much time as possible monitoring my auctions Most eBay items are sold in second bid auctions which means the high bidder gets the item and pays the amount of the second highest bid I ve left out a few complications that can be ignored here Ordinarily there is only one sensible strategy in a second bid auction Bid the highest amount you d be willing to pay then sit back and wait to see if you ve won In a standard English auction where the high bidder pays his own bid bidders usually try to lowball that is to bid less than they re willing to pay in the hope of walking away with a bargain But there s no reason to lowball in a second bid auction because the amount you pay is independent of the amount you bid If the antique royal blue water pitcher is worth 300 to me I should bid 300 not 250 If you re not convinced click for a detailed explanation Moreover the same reasoning says that it makes not a shred of difference whether I bid early or late So why do I repeatedly find myself bidding furiously in the last five minutes of an auction and submitting three different bids in succession when one should suffice Either I m behaving irrationally or my analysis of bidding strategy contains an invalid assumption For that there are several candidates First I assumed that I start off knowing what I m willing to pay for the water pitcher But maybe that s wrong Maybe I learn what I m willing to pay by observing the progress of the auction eBay lets me observe the number of bidders the identity of the highest bidder so far and the amount of the second highest bid so far When 10 new bidders jump in or when a bidder I respect moves out in front of the pack I might revise my valuation and submit a new bid Of course that explanation works only if I care about the other bidders opinions say because I think they know more than I do or because I m trying to predict what kind of resale market I might face someday For me though the resale market is irrelevant I never resell anything thanks to the same obsessive traits that keep me on eBay in the first place On the other hand maybe I do care about resale prices because I like knowing that my possessions inspire envy If I can learn from other bidders then they can learn from me which is the second reason I might want to deviate from a simplistic bid and wait strategy I bid low at first to convince my competitors that the item isn t worth much Then I jump in with a higher bid at the end hoping that at least some of those competitors are away from their computers and unable to respond So bidding should be leisurely when bidders have little to learn from each other say when they re bidding on a new computer that s been widely reviewed and intense when some bidders are far more expert than others say when they re bidding on a heart defibrillator for home use That s a nice testable hypothesis Unfortunately it seems to have failed its first test When one of my colleagues used eBay to sell an outrageously expensive i e over 1 000 bottle of Bordeaux wine three bidders submitted eight different bids in the first three days Now if somebody is willing to pay 1 000 for a bottle of wine I m inclined to guess that he s well informed about its quality So why are these people revising their bids Maybe they re just addicted to bidding Maybe I am too Last week eBay listed a collectible knife with which I am entirely familiar I bid 225 which exhausted my willingness to pay But in the final five minutes I raised my bid to 250 then 275 then 300 and finally won the auction exhilarated by my victory Maybe eBay just makes me giddy As a free market aficionado I am intoxicated by the prospect of one stop shopping for houses cars Beanie Babies and underwear all at prices that adjust instantly to the demands of consumers around the globe Or maybe the behavior of eBayers can be explained only by subtler and more carefully tested theories that have not yet been devised Given the mountain of data being generated by eBay I suspect those theories will be the stuff of doctoral theses for a long time to come
