 Henry Louis Gates Jr Ever since the media first noticed Henry Louis Skip Gates Jr professor of Afro American studies at Harvard he has held their attention and affection He may now be the most famous literature professor in America and it s easy to understand why Besides being Gates is a force for good in the world Known by fellow scholars for his theories linking the Afro American literary tradition to the African vernacular and for his excavation of forgotten masterpieces of black literature he caught the public s eye in 1992 when he published several salutary and well reasoned articles criticizing the inflammatory anti Semitic rhetoric of certain black nationalists The all star department he s built at Harvard over the past seven years it includes philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah sociologist William Julius Wilson and philosopher Cornel West has helped elevate Afro Am from relative marginality to one of the most thrilling and visible disciplines around At The New Yorker where he is a staff writer he has produced several strong pieces of literary journalism on subjects as varied as Harry Belafonte and the declining importance of loyalty Gates does so many things at the same time that you have to wonder how he makes sure all of them meet the same high standard The answer is he can t In 1997 alone according to his c urriculum vitae he wrote four long pieces for The New Yorker published one book and edited two more He also supervised doctoral dissertations taught two undergraduate courses ran Harvard s W E B Du Bois Institute for Afro American Research raising funds balancing budgets recruiting professors planning conferences served as director of editorial content for a publishing imprint he co founded was a consultant on Steven Spielberg s Amistad scripted and hosted a Frontline documentary on the black bourgeoisie and developed a six part BBC PBS documentary on Africa the entire continent He continued as an editor of Transition magazine the Black Periodical Literature Project the Zora Neale Hurston Library series the 30 volume African American Women Writers 1910 1940 and the 2 million word Encyclopedia Africana Nominally at least he sat on the board of editors of 29 other journals and on 82 advisory committees for museums theaters institutes literary prizes and universities Gates works very hard Most days he starts writing at 5 a m A 9 000 word New Yorker profile that would take most journalists weeks or months flows effortlessly from his pen An incisive piece on Louis Farrakhan was reported Monday afternoon written Tuesday edited Wednesday and closed Thursday Gates drafted his 216 page memoir Colored People 1994 in six weeks though thought the final result reflected the hasty composition But hard work alone doesn t explain Gates output He also understands a fundamental maxim of capitalism Don t do yourself what you can pay others to do for you It is a time honored perquisite of senior professorship to have students act as minions fetching books from the library and doing grunt research Many scholars have figured out how to turn this somewhat feudal tradition into an industry In the 1980s for example Yale Professor Harold Bloom served as the editor of 160 anthologies of literary criticism even though it was graduate students and a few undergraduates who actually waded into the library and picked out the selections But Gates pushes the envelope He may be the only academic with a self designated chief of staff who handles day to day details and deals with reporters An assistant edits his writing Another conducts research keeping him abreast of the latest developments in hip hop and digging up quotes for New Yorker pieces Dozens of other writers and editors are hired to help produce his various projects To put together one volume The Dictionary of Global Culture for instance Gates used 32 research assistants and 32 fact checkers in addition to 27 writers For this piece I spoke with 17 current and former Gates employees The project Gates considers his most important is also his most lucrative to date the Encyclopedia Africana co edited with Appiah Originally conceived by Du Bois the Encyclopedia is intended to be the definitive guide to Africa and the African diaspora Gates says it will be the factually unassailable foundation upon which Afro American studies will grow to maturity It is designed to trounce once and for all the fictions promulgated by Afrocentrists they hold among other things that Jews ran the slave trade and that Egyptians were black To finance the Encyclopedia Gates reportedly cut a 1 million deal with Microsoft to put out a CD ROM signed a book deal with Civitas the imprint he co owns and formed a partnership with music mogul Quincy Jones A closer look at how Gates et al are putting the Encyclopedia together however raises the question of whether reference works benefit from a Gatesian pace Writers have been told to hit a 500 word a day quota Editors at times have had to groom 7 000 words a day Their pay depends on it The results are unimpressive According to some of Gates deputies on the project Microsoft execs grouched that the first 150 000 word batch of entries they received was poorly organized and badly written Gates later confessed to Microsoft that he had made an appalling discovery Nearly one third of the entries had been plagiarized wholesale from other reference books For the record This magazine is owned by Microsoft However no Microsoft employee spoke to me about Skip Gates project My information comes exclusively from current and former employees of Gates himself The Encyclopedia is due out in stores next February Gates says he has become much more involved in editing the book so as to avoid further anomalies According to some who have worked on the project however his main concern still seems to be meeting Microsoft s deadlines He has described the Encyclopedia to his colleagues in classic Microsoft terms If Version 1 0 contains bugs and glitches not to worry You let readers point out problems then try to get Version 2 0 right With an electronic encyclopedia a process of constant revision may have its advantages unless you re among the customers for Version 1 0 But print is less flexible The last large scale reference work Gates co edited also with Appiah was The Dictionary of Global Culture published last year The book was meant to be the multiculturalist rebuttal to E D Hirsch Jr s controversial The Dictionary of Cultural Literacy 1988 the idea was to highlight the accomplishments of non Western societies and their contributions to Western culture But it was too weirdly conceived and poorly edited to do all that As a response to Hirsch it is irrelevant appearing long after most had forgotten Hirsch s book It is also filled with easily dismissable As a reference work it fails because entries are shorter and less informative than most entries for the same subjects in even the Encyclopedia Britannica And it is Why would Gates allow the publication of such a book with his byline and photo on the dust jacket He had no idea it was so bad After coming up with the idea for the project and appointing an associate editor to run it he says he was only minimally involved According to those who edited the Dictionary Gates read entries only just before they were sent to press then looked closely only at items within his area of expertise such as the Harlem Renaissance and Hurston The book s introduction was drafted by Appiah Gates 29 page CV is packed with other projects to which he devotes scant energy Between 1992 and 1998 for example he contributed not a single word to 28 of the 29 magazines where he is listed as an editor He does none of the line editing of articles for Transition even though it proclaims his editorship in ads For the 40 volume Schomburg Library of Nineteenth Century Black Women Writers he edited he appointed others to put together the books and write their introductions Ten other editors helped put together The Norton Anthology of African American Literature even though it was his byline that appeared on the cover The activities cited here would not be unusual or even objectionable if Gates imposed strict quality control standards upon them Members of scholarly journals editorial boards rarely edit they are guarantors of the journals intellectual integrity which is to say they re figureheads And if Gates didn t edit the anthologies himself his name nonetheless lent credibility and therefore enhanced funding prospects to deserving projects Reference books are perforce feats of organization not individual scholarship The problem is the work that comes out of his scholarly chop shops isn t nearly as good as it should be And even if it were there is something dishonest about marketing under Gates signature work that is produced mainly by his assistants At worst he is amassing credentials fame and wealth on the basis of others uncredited labor once considered a scholarly sin At best he is severely diluting the brand name that is Henry Louis Gates Jr a brand name based in large part on This is bound to hurt both his own reputation and that of the enterprises he believes in so sincerely So why does Gates produce at such a frantic pace A profile in the April issue of Boston Magazine hinted it was for the money the magazine put Gates annual income at nearly 1 million He denies both the amount and the motive He clearly is driven by a kind of missionary zeal I think that these projects will make a difference to people and the field of Afro American studies I am a canon builder he told me Another explanation may lie in his brilliance He comes up with more ideas than he can handle and he lacks the discipline not to overextend himself By impulse I am an entrepreneur he says If I weren t in the academy I could be a CEO Quincy Jones is my hero I have a picture of Vernon Jordan on my wall right over one of John Hope Franklin It s an appealing image for a professoriate that has long been accused of being out of touch and moribund the consummate schmoozer combined with the eminent scholar One just wishes the results looked more like scholarship If you missed the links in the piece click to read a of Colored People about the in the Dictionary of Global
