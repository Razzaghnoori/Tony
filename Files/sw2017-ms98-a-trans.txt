 okay we just bought our first home after being in school and so we re just first time homeowners who ve only been living here about six months oh okay um well i ve lived in the in the Dallas and Richardson area for about uh twenty five and a half years twenty six years oh boy and we re in our second home now we ve been in it for uh about thirteen fourteen years i think now in Richardson uh huh oh so you re you re an old pro then we ve lived in the Richardson area for that you know for the full time uh um hum well what do you find having to be like out there i ve always heard that it was expensive well it s it s not really all that bad uh i think you live in Plano so uh the the Plano area and the Richardson area probably are are about the same pricewise i would think um hum oh really hm yeah so well we uh when we graduated from school in Houston uh my husband went went to school at Rice and got his PhD so that that s what brought us here and um we had um heard a lot about Richardson being a good area and the homes there being really nice and but we kind of just got the impression it was out of our price range yeah yeah well um i know i i think that there s some areas in you know in uh Richardson that may be a little bit higher priced but uh of course it like i said i ve it s been thirteen years since we ve really priced a house so um hum so i m not sure what the prices are like now uh i know that our price that the the value of our house went up you know considerably over over a you know uh oh an eight or ten year period yes um hum but then for the last several years it s pretty well stabilized uh and perhaps even dropped back some from what it was so really hm but uh we ve done uh you know in order to maintain ours we ve done some remodeling and stuff you know just to to kind of change do some some little changes occasionally so yes uh but uh i guess i m i m a little encouraged with home prices i i m a CPA and i was just talking to one of my clients uh yesterday uh or you know over the last couple of days well that makes sense and they have sold a house that was quite expensive and bought one you know that was was more reasonably priced it s uh in Dallas but it s in the Richardson School District um hum hm and the the lady is very pleased you know she says it s got everything she want s you know thinks she ll ever want in a house and it was several thousand dollars less than the one that they sold so oh that s good so i I suppose that the housing market is uh you know it is on the on the down side right now well do you have a lot of homes out there that have um foundation problems that seems to be the pretty much the rule out here well i m not really aware of those i do know that that our house uh we ve had to have the shower pan in the master bedroom replaced twice hm because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that uh huh because uh apparently the foundation shifts a little bit under that but that was a design problem because we put uh and we designed the house so it s our fault but we had them put the shower on a corner uh like our house is built in a U shape and in inside that U but on one of the corners uh is where that shower is um hum and so any shifting in the foundation of course or or you know i guess i feel that way anyway that that that shifting would cause some problems in that in that area of the house yes and of course the shower pan is a pretty fragile piece of uh of metal or plastic whichever it is anyway so so did it look cracked to you i mean that s how you knew it was broken or no it uh it started leaking through the you know out through the pan and out onto the floor and it s soaking up in the Sheetrock or in things right oh oh so that s that s how you knew well since like i say we re first time homeowners i m still scared about everything like that going wrong and how do you know it s going to happen and all yeah uh but uh yeah but i think uh you know i think so far as uh as the location Richardson Plano are probably comparable the the school districts are you know are about the same uh you know quality wise um hum we really like our school out here yeah so but we um we were scared to buy a an house in our neighborhood because all of the homes did have these foundation problems and we didn t know um you know if we were afraid we d be living there and all of a sudden the house would crack in half and split open or something um hum yeah but uh well our house and i m not sure how all of the builders you know how most of the builders do but ours is what they call uh post tensioned which means that there are iron bars you know that run through the foundation um hum hm and once they get the foundation poured then they they apply tension to that iron bar which compresses the concrete and makes it more uh stable more stable and and puts more strength into it um hum so uh you know it it uh potentially that s supposed to just mean that the foundation kind of floats when the you know when the the earth itself shifts around so well that s good well that s really good well our house is older it s like a nineteen sixty three yeah so house that we bought so i m not doesn t seem like it um i mean i know so much has changed in their technology in the last few years um hum yeah right uh is yours a is it a a slab foundation or pier and beam it s slab yeah so that s and that s what ours is our house the house we had before was over we live on the east side of Richardson now and the other one was over on the west side and it was uh a pier and beam house um hum um hum and uh i just drove by there this morning and it still looks just as good as it did when we moved out of it thirteen years ago so well that s good yeah so you know i think houses uh i think they hold up pretty well if you ve got a if you have a good builder yes my grandfather was a builder and so my parents always lived in houses that he built and then they knew they were getting a good deal so yeah well i uh appreciate that information about Richardson i know it was um it s got a really good reputation and okay yeah so well it uh you know i think it s a a good place to live uh or course if i didn t think that well we wouldn t still be living here so fourteen years that s pretty good well thank you and well um you good good luck with this program then bye bye right yeah that would okay thank you uh okay thank you you too um hum
