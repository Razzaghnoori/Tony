 The Cartoon Mayor Dear Steve I couldn t agree with you more about Mayor Giuliani and his hollow showboating regarding the Brooklyn Museum controversy While much of what passes for 20 th century modern art is absolutely horseshit painting an entire canvas red is mere laziness and claiming that it has meaning doesn t make it so Giuliani seems determined to base his whole political career on crushing the messy process that is popular culture and scapegoating people too weak to defend themselves As New Yorkers will recall he launched his career by going after homeless guys who spritz your windshield at intersections and demand a buck to finish the job OK so they were annoying but there are crack houses that have enjoyed continuous operation during the years that the mayor has been after the squeegee men Then he put all the accouterments of street life out of business newsstands hotdog stands street vendors all of which gave New York a sidewalk level buzz that separated it from your average suburban mall Last year he attacked taxi drivers with fines for speeding frankly any cabby who can speed in these choked streets gets an extra tip from yours truly and an array of nuisance regulations designed to make their lives impossible I drove a cab for years and thought it was too hard for 150 a shift these days you re lucky if you make 60 for 12 hours of backbreaking through the streets of Manhattan What kind of bully picks on guys who earn five bucks an hour More frightening he s turned Times Square and its menagerie of wonderful filth and decadence into Disney World North The porn shops are all but gone nightclubs find it nearly impossible to function after getting busted all the time and now he s stopping the rent check to the biggest cultural institution in Brooklyn What always made New York great was its anarchic brew of mayhem and energy Giuliani is determined to replace both with sterility and bourgeois consumerism OK back to comic strips After yesterday s missive a number of people e mailed me to remind me of Scott Adams Dilbert and of course it s a great strip It speaks to the cubical culture in which many Americans including me until a few years ago spend two thirds of their waking hours and does so with consistently funny gag lines Still there s quite a bit of repetition there too which I think is inevitable How can anyone draw 365 cartoons a year for 10 years or more and have each idea be original I think that s why recent giants like Watterson Calvin and Hobbes and Larson The Far Side quit after roughly a decade each you get pretty tapped out at 3 000 plus ideas and they had the class to recognize that Moreover the daily papers are constantly shrinking the space available for comic strips which means that it s impossible to stretch out artistically Ah I d forgotten all about editorial cartoonist Ranan Lurie for whom I once toiled as a graphics assistant wage 5 an hour no benefits in 1987 for two months until you retrieved my repressed memories Fortunately I don t read papers where he appears but his work is trite appallingly apolitical and graphically bereft of any character whatsoever Even worse the guy never paid me for thinking up ideas crosshatching etc yo Ranan with interest that comes to half the value of your Trump Tower apartment now I need the cash for drawing lessons man But the greatest conflict in cartooning is about which is more important Ideas or drawing It helps when a creator enjoys both a muse and a good hand as you do Steve but the vast majority of cartoonists are lucky to have one or the other Editors it seems lean more to the graphics side but I think people like Larson and James Thurber prove that you can draw great cartoons with lousy art I have yet to find a great cartoonist with bad or nonexistent ideas In my case I know that the art has always been my weak point which is why I developed a highly stylized drawing style it also helps to set it apart from the donkey and elephant crowd of editorial cartoonists and why I still take drawing lessons and study everything from old woodcuts to Cuban comics I can t understand gifted artists who intentionally draw less well than they re able to it s a form of self mutilation As for the ideas either you have them or you don t and there isn t much you can do about it either way Speaking of Peter Max I hear he s made sort of a comeback on the 70s nostalgia bandwagon he even had some show a few years back in Des Moines of all places Very truly yours Ted
