 IT S 2002 DO YOU KNOW YOUR IOLTA INTEREST RATE The Supreme Court has historically provided mandates for the deposit of client funds into attorney trust accounts Before 1980 federal law prohibited interest to be generated on checking accounts maintained by federally insured banks Therefore client funds were deposited into interest free attorney trust accounts The banks received a windfall shortterm interest free loans for their use In 1980 banking laws changed For the first time banks could offer interest on checking accounts or NOW accounts However attorneys could rarely take advantage of these interest bearing accounts for their clients The purpose of depositing funds into an attorney s trust account was either for short term deposits with immediate access to the funds or for small amounts whose interest would not exceed the costs attendant to separate accounting Therefore individualized interest bearing trust checking accounts were unwieldy and impractical Clients could rarely if ever earn a positive net interest In 1988 New Jersey joined the ranks of those states that adopted the Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts IOLTA Fund as a method of collecting and using the interest that would be earned on these deposits Rule 1 28A All 50 states now have similar IOLTA programs Pursuant to our court rules participation in the IOLTA program is mandatory The type of funds to be deposited is strictly circumscribed and the use to which that combined interest can be assigned carefully delineated As a result what might have amounted to a pittance for a client in conglomerate became a substantial fund According to information routinely gathered and analyzed by our IOLTA fund in the year 2000 the average balance of all IOLTA attorney trust accounts in New Jersey alone on any given day at any given time was 1 2 billion By the end of the third quarter Sept 30 2001 the last date for which this data is available that amount had increased to an average daily balance of 1 5 billion in roughly 120 participating New Jersey banks That is 1 5 billion that these banks can use to fund their mortgages home equity loans automobile loans and other types of loans for which they receive approximately 7 percent or more on interest they charge Have you checked the interest rate your bank pays on your IOLTA account The rates vary greatly from 0 25 percent to 2 75 percent depending on the bank you choose Although this rate variation may seem minimal if all the banks paid IOLTA interest at only 0 25 percent the annual earnings on 1 5 billion would be only 3 750 000 If every IOLTA account paid 2 75 percent a rate that even IOLTA concedes is wishful thinking the earnings would be 11 times greater or 41 250 000 While many banks continued to pay the same rates in 2001 that they paid in 2000 others reduced the rates they pay In fact the average IOLTA interest rate paid in 2000 by all of the participating banks was 1 6 percent Unfortunately the average interest rate paid through the third quarter of 2001 dropped to 1 4 percent A comparison of two of the major participating banks demonstrates the disparity in their approaches to IOLTA One bank dropped its interest rate in November 2001 to 1 percent The other bank pays the fund interest based upon tiered account levels more typical of a large commercial account As the balance in the account goes up the interest rate goes up as well to a high water mark of 1 98 percent for accounts with balances of 250 000 or more While a third major bank advertised its November money market account rates to be between 1 73 percent for accounts with 5 000 and 2 47 percent for accounts with 50 000 or more that bank pays IOLTA a flat 1 1 percent Even its advertised passbook savings accounts earned 1 49 percent Meanwhile some of the banks that have reduced interest rates to IOLTA also charge higher activity fees to IOLTA A few banks charge fees as high as 23 percent of the gross interest earned On average the IOLTA fund repays 5 percent of all its earnings to those banks that charge for these accounts These fees generally include monthly account fees and per check and per deposit charges on each transaction Yet only half of the IOLTA participating banks actually charge the fund these fees Half of the banks charge no fees whatsoever simply satisfied to have these accounts as a significant growing source of inexpensive money to use almost interest free In 2000 IOLTA collected 16 3 million to fund its very narrowly construed mission As designated by the Supreme Court the fund uses the money to provide legal aid to the poor and education and beneficial services to the public Legal Services of New Jersey receives 75 percent of the funds The New Jersey State Bar Foundation receives 12 5 percent for educational lay programs relating to law and justice and other public service programs such as the High School Mock Trial Competition and numerous publications The balance of the funds is granted to small entities that provide legal services and assistance to the indigent R 1 28A 4 For instance IOLTA grants money to several Court Appointed Special Advocate Programs CASA for children in Essex Morris Sussex Mercer and Atlantic Cape May The CASA program is a volunteer organization of people who assist and advocate for the rights of individual children in foster care IOLTA grants go to the Covenant House Youth Advocacy Program the advocate of legal rights of homeless youths who having reached the age of 18 are no longer eligible to be in foster care In 2002 2 1 million in IOLTA grants will support these and numerous other crucial programs that offer priceless services to the poor The 16 3 million raised for IOLTA is not enough Legal Services which provides civil legal services to the poor the disabled and the most vulnerable citizens of the state can only represent at best 25 percent of the people who are in need of assistance and who meet the requirements for representation In a legal triage they must select those most in immediate need The rest of their applicants must wait or give up Even the amount of the fund is not guaranteed In the pending difficult economic times when the rush to refinance has passed will these accounts maintain their 1 5 billion average daily balance If interest rates continue to decline or the daily balances decrease the IOLTA fund will be curtailed With less funding for Legal Services what will happen to those so much in need What will happen to the pro bono requirements already imposed upon attorneys in New Jersey What can we as members of the bar who control these accounts do to protect the IOLTA fund The easy answer is Ask Ask your bank what interest rate it pays to IOLTA Ask your bank what fees it charges to IOLTA Comparison shop Understand the spread between what your bank pays the IOLTA fund and what it charges your clients Yet we only can control our own accounts Better yet we call upon the New Jersey State Bar Association and each county bar association to lend a voice to IOLTA The bar associations could consult with the IOLTA directors and then contact banks to determine which ones are providing the best returns with the lowest costs to IOLTA The promise of more business or the loss thereof would have far more impact coming from an association than any single law firm Attorneys hold the purse strings Why not turn them into reins We can with little effort steer our attorney trust accounts to those banks that are willing to pay just a little more for the privilege of receiving our trust
