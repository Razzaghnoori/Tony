 Bad I Instinct I Hideous I Men I Movies Instinct Buena Vista Pictures Critics skewer this psychodrama starring Anthony Hopkins as a primatologist who clubs two park rangers to death while living in the wild with a band of gorillas and Cuba Gooding Jr as the hotshot psychologist assigned to draw out his story The plot rips off the familiar one on one mind games of The Silence of the Lambs and adds up to nothing more than a greatest hits collection of plot devices and emotional cues from such films as Gorillas in the Mist and One Flew Over the Cuckoo s Nest John Anderson the Los Angeles

empathetic Few directors are more instinctively caring or provide for more moments of grace between characters Kenneth Turan the Los Angeles Times The film set in Alaska follows two middle aged loners Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David Strathairn who engage in a tentative romance Halfway through the film the plot suddenly turns into a survivalist action adventure Several critics say this transition is rough but ultimately forgive the film If this oddly structured film feels like two short stories stuck together there is enough solid glue joining them that they resonate off one another

Little Brown Wallace s second collection of stories is roundly seen as a disappointment Hailed as one of the best writers of his generation in 1996 when he published the immense novel Infinite Jest Wallace irks the critics with this collection which is mainly a series of sketches describing extremely unpleasant and misogynistic men Though a few stories are on par with his earlier work most reviews find the collection riddled with self referential tics and self consciousness The New York Times Michiko Kakutani comes down the hardest turning in a scathing review in which she calls the book an airless tedious production that represents a sharp falling off in ambition nuance and vision from Mr Wallace s previous works of fiction Click to read Slate s recent Book Club on Brief Interviews Juneteenth by Ralph Ellison edited by John F Callahan Random House Uneven is the word used most often to describe Ellison s posthumous second novel which he had been working on for 40 years before he died Pared down to 384 pages from the sprawling unfinished thousand page manuscript by Ellison s literary executor John F Callahan the novel leaves many critics wondering about the enormous amount of material not included and whether the novel can even truly be called Ellison s book Ellison envisioned a multi voiced symphonic saga about race in America but Callahan reduced it to a single linear story with a few central characters notably omitting excerpts Ellison had published such as the story Cadillac Flamb Reviewers say that sections are on par with Invisible Man especially the set pieces dialogue and riffs but the novel as a whole doesn t match up It provides the reader with intimations of the grand vision animating Ellison s 40 year project but it also feels disappointingly provisional and incomplete Kakutani the New York Times Slate s Jacob Weisberg found the novel more satisfying than most critics Click to read his review Music Death Mel Torme 1925 1999 The jazz swing

unpleasant sound Holden the New York Times He was most famous for his scat improvisations and enjoyed a renaissance in the 1990s when after a lifetime of performing he was discovered by a younger generation interested in lounge music Never a true superstar he managed to succeed mainly because he continued to perform and his voice miraculously seemed to improve with age He was also a songwriter
