                and you say you have some strong feelings about uh the issue   uh yes i do as far as uh as far as uh as far as immigration as a whole goes   uhhuh   i think that uh we simply must start accepting everybody in the world   uhhuh   uh i there just is not gonna be room for all of us we dont have jobs now i i think uh i think when we come to a time of recession that its particularly important that we shut our doors at that time um  hope youre one of the employed right now   uhhuh   i am one of the unemployed right now i was a systems analyst and programmer for an oil company and uh i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in Dallas that they had two hundred openings but they had two thousand applications   oh   and i know that there are a lot of foreigners uh here you you know doing my line of work   uhhuh   and of course im not perfectly happy about not having a job   right   so how do you feel   well im a little bit ambivalent the problem with uh and i think one of the problems with immigration policy is like any other political problem is that people are not willing to discuss it uh in in terms of what uh really is driving it theyre not willing to tell the truth the same way with um uh issues of uh race and things like that i mean right now um i believe there are two policies that uh that the government uses to modulate immigration three actually one is at the high end uh they always wanna be able to um do some brain draining theyd always like to be able to attract the uh Einsteins or the Professor Chou or you know theyd like to be able to get the top people in any field and so they can almost always find room for someone like that   right   at the bottom end they um are always willing to um let in cheap labor  if it lowers the cost of doing business in some particular area and has strong support from the powerful people in that area those are two  things that i think are going on although they i i i dont think the politicians would tell you that   okay and i think youre right in both cases   and then the third thing  is uh the political aspect of uh uh letting steam come out from under the lid in Mexico   they cannot close off the Mexican border not because its physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in Mexico would be uh uh would spill over to this country so they keep allowing um the pressure cooker to um let off steam   and i think probably its pretty important right there how do you feel about Haitian immigration   uh  thats one of the few things i guess i found myself in agreement with Pat Buchanan   i think theyre very difficult group to integrate into uh society theyre very difficult um group to find jobs and uh and uh places for and so um um i dont deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem that uh in that theyre pretty miserable where they are but im not to sympathetic about um letting large numbers of Haitians in   actually actually i feel  that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here   yeah   and it would have nothing to do with political situations it would have to do with poverty   right but if you let them yeah if you let them in a million at a time it wouldnt make that you know it wouldnt make that big a bulge in the population but politically politically and economically   oh my gosh have you been to have you been to Southern Florida   yeah well i know about it uh i mean its it is now with Haitians the way it was with Cubans uh twenty years ago   well i mean and the two of them together i mean we can its just as well  you know its hardly America anymore   on the other hand you know it the ironic thing about this is that theres nobody more full of the entrepreneurial American spirit than a first generation immigrant so theres uh uh theres a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in   but theres some differences in the immigrants that that were getting now well in i particularly have a problem with the illegal immigration   right sure   i think probably your your a great deal of what you say is true about the legals   right   but uh the majority of the illegal immigration were getting now they do not come here to blend into America uh they they dont bother to learn our language and uh  first of all theyve theyve im sorry this i really feel strongly about this we send a lot of money to Mexico   umhum umhum
