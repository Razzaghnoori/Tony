 Personal Space Invaders Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudie As a child of the 60s and 70s I am more touchy feely than Oprah To most of my friends in my own age group this is considered normal And I guess even to most of my friends in other age groups However I am aware that one of my better friends is just too reserved for this invasion of his personal space Despite resolving not to make him feel like he s being assaulted I often forget myself when we are together and realize too late that I m either sitting too close or talking too close or worse being a hug Nazi He tolerates this though it clearly makes him nervous He is tremendously enjoyable company and I am accustomed to viewing affectionate gestures as rewarding someone for this Could you offer me some helpful suggestions for being well more prudent Affectionately Recidivist Hugger Dear Re Prudie sees from your e mail address that you are female unless of course you ve hopped on someone else s machine and believes that touching friends is mostly a feminine trait In any case this is what the situation looks like from here You have the habit of getting close and touching people you are aware that in some instances this is regarded as an invasion of someone s personal space you and the reluctant touchee are good friends you would like to bag your habit of rewarding him with physical contact but sometimes you just can t help yourself The key it seems to Prudie is that you are close friends and that he tolerates it though uncomfortably while you want to accommodate his comfort zone Why don t you annex humor and honesty to this dilemma and deal with it openly Say to your chum something like I have this lunatic habit of touching my friends and I also tend to get too close I know this is not comfortable for you so the next time you feel crowded just say Down girl down Well you get the drift The two of you should decide on a code phrase that suits you and in time Prudie predicts there will be no discomfort at all on either side Prudie spaciously Dear Prudie You display a wide range of knowledge so let me run something by you I have not seen you deal with before have you any ideas about making some serious money fast I hope you can help I m in a bind BPL in Tennessee Dear B Your question is actually the bailiwick of Prudie s aunt the first Prudence the one who started this column Alas no kind of economics is within this Prudie s purview Just from reading the financial section however as close as Prudie gets to monetary information one suggestion for you might be to get on Michael Eisner s bad side Those people seem to do really well Prudie killingly Dear Prudence Thirty years ago in college I had a brief fling with a young man who has remained a dear and close friend We never repeated our physical intimacy Now he has finally married and his wife fascinated by his long term friendship with a girl from college persistently asks if I ever slept with him I have tried every trick in the book to keep from answering her truthfully from Why in the world would you need to know that to It was the 60s how can I possibly remember But she won t give up How can I answer her without answering her How can I get her to drop the subject I d like us all to remain friends Her husband refuses to satisfy her curiosity as well I don t want to come right out and say It s none of your business what happened between your husband and me when we were 18 and I guess I am looking for a nice way to say MYOB Perplexed in Pendleton Dear Perp You tried the nice way of saying MYOB which is Ann Landers wonderful shorthand for mind your own business and it didn t work I refer to your quip about it being the 60s and how could you be expected to remember anything Prudie s first thought was to suggest that you tell the proverbial little white lie to make the subject go away Then she decided that white lies or turquoise for that matter should not be encouraged that there must be a better way than dishonesty no matter how admirable one s intent For this reason Prudie asked an attorney who is also a Harvard Divinity School graduate to be a Prudie His position was that lying is unethical therefore it is important to consider how not to answer rather than compromising one s integrity If the wife s concern is that a sexual relationship might be going on that is a present tense concern or is merely curious about the past this is a question she must ask her husband the person directly involved The proper communication is with the relevant person her spouse If this rather thick woman persists in her questioning you might say I never answer questions about the personal lives of my close friends Please do not ask me to violate my friendships by pursuing this line of inquiry This is a boundary I care about Such an approach protects the confidentiality you share with your old friend and directs the wife to the appropriate source her husband allowing you to know you have behaved in a morally ethical manner Prudie who did not attend divinity school but the school of hard knocks would like to point out that most people who are not candidates for Dutch elm disease would figure out that there might indeed have been a little experimentation of the sexual sort and quit already with the interrogation This however is an altogether different problem Good luck to you and my compliments for wishing to do the right thing Prudie privately Dear Prudence Though it is not on a par with Kosovo and Chinese spying I nevertheless have been reading about Hugh Hefner the geezer in pajamas who founded Playboy around the time my father was a young man As I understand it he is currently occupied very publicly and supposedly romantically with three women whose names are like Handy Dandy and Randy or something like that How would you categorize this behavior and what do you think it s about Really Confused Dear Real Pathetic and Viagra And Prudie thinks the opportunists I mean young women are named Randy Brande and Mandy or something like that Prudie disdainfully
