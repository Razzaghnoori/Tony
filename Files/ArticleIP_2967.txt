 Sisters Under the Mink Has anyone noticed the spooky resemblance between these two memoirs Both were written by actresses famous for playing ethereal damaged or somehow incomplete souls Both actresses chronicle restless unstable childhoods capped in each case by a quick rise to fame Both regretfully conclude that they were unprepared for this early acclaim and that missing out on the trial and error of adolescence caused them permanent damage Considering how successful these women have been each of them spends surprisingly little time talking about her work and quite a lot discussing her ill chosen romantic adventures The great love of each woman s life was a difficult genius known for his neurotic darkly comic musings on the battle of the sexes In Bloom s case it was the novelist Philip Roth In Farrow s of course it was Woody Allen In both cases the affair was a long ugly and finally public catastrophe Which leads us to another intriguing similarity between Leaving a Doll s House and What Falls Away Both have met with awkward squeamish reviews Critics have asked tough questions about the writers judgment and motives How could these women just sit by and let this happen Why should we believe either one when she says that her book is an attempt to understand what happened and not a bid for revenge In The New Yorker novelist Daphne Merkin complained that Bloom asks for more sympathy than she deserves In a pitiless review in a recent New York Times Book Review novelist Kathryn Harrison wrote that Farrow exaggerates the emotional damage wrought by an early bout with polio unfairly vilifies Allen and tries to solicit sympathy in the court of public opinion Merkin doubts Bloom s claim that she was helpless One can discern through the pious gloss Bloom puts on the events of her life the shrewd maneuverings of a stage brat Harrison accuses Farrow of exploiting her celebrity and touting her famous friends the glitterati chorus and says that the account of her battle with Allen will satisfy a Peeping Fan readership Why the discomfort One suspects in part a generational explanation Feminists today or at least feminists within the small circle of women assigned to write about women for the elite media many of them a decade or two younger than Bloom and Farrow are more upbeat than they used to be but also more arrogant and hardhearted They have a buck up attitude They want women to stop harping about men and start taking care of their own lives Most of all they think that women control what they do with their bodies As long as they consent to something they can t be victims This last idea is in fact rather weirdly prominent in the work of both Merkin and Harrison A few months before she reviewed Bloom s book Merkin wrote a long personal essay for The New Yorker about how much she likes to be spanked Harrison s review of Farrow precedes by a few weeks her much gossiped about new memoir The Kiss about her consensual love affair with her father Or maybe the reaction points to a new jaded distrust of celebrity The days when we felt sorry for the famous are over nowadays we dislike stars who plead confusion insecurity and no common sense While this sounds reasonable enough it overlooks the most gruesome similarity of all that in the case of Bloom and of Farrow both it is crippling passivity that brought them to the public eye in the first place and crippling passivity that kept them there Early on both Farrow and Bloom demonstrated a flair for acting and an eerie inertness in their relations with other human beings Bloom started appearing on stage at 15 But for all her worldly ambition she writes to become an actress as young as I did was to enter a cloister of my own making Woefully painfully ignorant of the most basic facts of life I was always ill at ease in the company of men Farrow s entry into the cloister was even less thought out She was born into it Her father was a Hollywood director another difficult genius and a violent alcoholic to boot and her mother was the Irish beauty Maureen O Sullivan Dead earnest even as a child Farrow planned to escape the narrow competitive world of acting to become a Carmelite nun or a pediatrician in Africa until her father s death forced her to start earning money Thereafter she never left the fishbowl and when she says she never enjoyed it you believe her She bounced from one famous husband Frank Sinatra who made her sit around while he drank until dawn with the Rat Pack to another Andr Previn who made her schedule her work around his Neither actress knew what she wanted and each was rewarded for her ignorance When Claire Bloom was 19 Charlie Chaplin recognized that her preposterous inexperience and eagerness to please made her the perfect actress to star opposite him in Limelight as Theresa an ideal of pre Victorian self immolation Farrow says that after Roman Polanski cast her in the career making role of the young pregnant woman in Rosemary s Baby he took advantage of her lack of an instinct for self preservation and filmed a scene of her threading dangerously through oncoming traffic There are 127 varieties of nuts he marveled approvingly Mia s 116 of them In their love lives each actress served as Miracle Gro to an especially prized kind of male creativity Roth coolly plumbed his relationship with Bloom for material At one point he even planned to name a character in his novel Deception a hideous dowdy actress and an ever spouting fountain of tears Claire She found out and made him change it Allen of course made repeated cinematic use of Farrow s skinny creepy beauty and her pained abstracted stare She accurately describes herself as eyes perched on a stalk To be fair Roth emerges as the tamer monster But here too the analogies are uncanny Each courtship begins with the great man sending charming but oddly formal notes to his beloved or having his secretary call to determine the time place and sometimes the precise length of their meeting Both Roth and Allen hold forth on the subject of their favorite artists for Roth C line and Kafka for Allen the old jazz greats Sidney Bechet and Jelly Roll Morton but are less interested in the women s recommendations Both loathe their lovers children and strive to avoid them Each acts as if everything is all right then lets loose with crushing invective Roth resents having to go to the opera having to make arrangements for Bloom s mother s funeral and less unreasonably having to deal with Bloom s nervousness in the face of illness Allen throws a tantrum when he and Farrow are walking together on the Upper East Side and Farrow points to a house and asks if it belongs to William F Buckley Her sin She was forgetting that he had pointed out Buckley s house to her the year before There were explosions too writes Farrow when I didn t know the name of a certain kind of pasta and again when I was off in my estimate of the weather by only four degrees To put up with any one of these things let alone all of them requires an almost monstrous lust for effacement a taste for masochism These women are character studies in the most terrifying sort of selflessness the kind that results from the failure to develop a self Their celebrity didn t shield them from the consequences of their passivity In fact we have watched them be passive on screen for years and we have applauded The Passive Woman has long been one of the most cherished staples of our culture high and low Who better to play her on screen Not that any of this justifies the truly rotten choices both Bloom and Farrow have made And you can t help but be glad that women these days are at least being told to take care of themselves But it is curious that these actresses should be attacked instead of encouraged in their efforts to change Or maybe it isn t so curious Philip Weiss tellingly led his attack on Farrow in the New York Observer last week with a little temper tantrum at his mom Leaving a Doll s House and What Falls Away seem less like vindictive manipulative performances than like baby steps in the right direction They re every bit as awkward as their critics accuse them of being It s unnerving to hear the muse speak at last as if a character had escaped from fiction to tell her story for the first time Her voice is unsteady and her conclusions sometimes seem canned evasive not yet complete Bloom glides over her motives Farrow is humorless and steeped in a bottomless melancholy Still better late than never The Passive Woman deserves a little more of our support It ll be a good thing for all of us if she finally gets into the habit of speaking for herself
