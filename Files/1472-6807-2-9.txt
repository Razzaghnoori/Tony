 Background The exact conformation of a tripeptide in a protein can be determined from its side chain and hydrogen bond interactions The backbone conformation is captured in the Ramachandran angles 1 The rotamer degrees of freedom fixes the entire side chain A fixed tripeptide occurring in different proteins will have different side chain interactions which in turn determine the range of angles These ranges are typically fairly wide and hence their utility in protein structure prediction is limited The use of Ramachandran angles comes about from the well known planarity of the peptide bond In this work we would like to complement this bias We expect that C locations are more directly constrained by the side chain interactions The data was therefore analyzed in terms of the C and C locations without the bias of the planarity of the peptide bond For structure prediction we need the side chain interaction statistics in terms of C and C locations The planarity of the peptide bonds can be imposed as a further constraint In theory there are 8000 tripeptides and 160 000 tetrapeptides With the dataset of about 1220 polypeptide chain structures of high resolution 2 A an analysis of tripeptide study is feasible and a tetrapeptide study will be statistically insignificant In our representative protein data set for each tripeptide R 1 R 2 R 3 Figure 1 we pick the corresponding C i C i i 1 2 3 positions and then compute distances i j i j and i j for i not equal to j These 12 distances along with the covalent bond length i i capture the entire solid structure of the tripeptide as embedded in the protein This information is sufficient to fix a unique value along with the position of the C The same R 1 R 2 R 3 is picked up from different proteins and from different locations within the same protein This data is statistically analyzed without any further physico chemical bias about the residues In this way data about various possible conformations of a tripeptide is gathered and analyzed as explained in the discussion section Attempts to understand and capture structural features were first done as inter residue contact statistics 2 3 involving long range interactions Short range pairwise residue statistics is contained in the Protein Atlas 4 In the literature 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 there have been many attempts to predict new protein or peptide structures using small amino acid subsequences or fragments of length 3 to10 In the seminal paper 5 Unger et al analyzed hexamers and identified about 100 structural building blocks in which each amino acid has a position dependent probability of occurrence Others 10 classified the 20 amino acids into 4 classes Glycine Proline hydrophobic and hydrophilic and identified structural clusters Baker et al 11 12 used fragments with definite amino acid sequences and their structural variations in different known proteins as potential templates for predicting new protein structures In all the cases they have only used the backbone structure i e C co ordinates only In contrast we have used the C and C co ordinates which then captures a significant side chain configuration Recently de novo protein design 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 22 is gaining importance and our data can also be used for this purpose Results Tripeptides have been classified into three categories rigid non rigid and intermediate based on the relative structural rigidity of various distances between C and C atoms in a tripeptide In our sample of crystallized proteins of the possible 8000 tripeptides only 7964 occurred The 36 tripeptides which do not occur in our sample however do occur in the SWISS PROT 20 sequence data The tripeptides which occurred more than 5 times in our sample were taken into consideration in our analysis We found that 1294 18 tripeptides can be classified as rigid 302 4 as non rigid and 5731 78 as intermediate We classify rigid tripeptides as those where at least one 1 3 distance has a fluctuation less than 0 4 A and non rigid tripeptides as those with all the 1 3 distance fluctuations greater than 0 7 A After accounting for rigid and non rigid all the intermediates have at least one 1 3 distance fluctuation between 0 4 to 0 7 A The entire dataset of 7964 tripeptides along with all the 12 relative average distances standard deviations and frequencies is available at the URL http www au kbc org research_areas bio projects protein tri html A profile of this large data set can be obtained by studying side chain relative abundance Table 3 and structural homology Table 4 To find correlation between the three classes of tripeptides and known secondary structure subsequences 9986 helices of sequence length 5 4541 helices of sequence length 12 9544 beta strands of length 3 and 3120 beta strands of length 7 from DSMP 21 were analyzed and the results are tabulated in Table 5 The distribution of the three classes of tripeptides in these secondary structure elements mirrors their distribution in the entire dataset occurrence being predominantly intermediate followed by rigid and non rigid It can be inferred that the rigid tripeptides have no definite correlation with secondary structure elements Table 3shows the frequency of various amino acid residues occurring in the three categories intermediate rigid and non rigid In any category we have mentioned the relative percentage of occurrence within the same tripeptide category The amino acids Methionine Proline Tryptophan and Glutamine occur predominantly in the rigid tripeptides and not as much in the other two categories suggesting that Methionine Proline Tryptophan and Glutamine can cause structural rigidity in a tripeptide Similarly it can be inferred that Serine and Threonine can cause structural non rigidity in a tripeptide The amino acid Cysteine tends to be either in the rigid or in the non rigid category but rarely in the intermediate category The sum of all the percentage numbers within a category falls a little short of 300 since the residues occur at any of the three possible positions in a tripeptide Multiple occurrences of a residue within a tripeptide are counted only once Table 3does not reflect the absolute frequency of occurrence in our dataset For example Methionine and Tryptophan actually occur rarely Therefore we looked at those tripeptides that occur with more than the average frequency which is greater than 40 in our sample This high frequency sample dataset again shows that Serine and Threonine are predominant amongst non rigids while Proline Alanine Isoleucine and Leucine occur often amongst the rigids The structural homology of most tripeptides is shown in Table 4 The fluctuating nature of tripeptides is quite often captured by 1 3 distances So we chose to classify various structural similarities by looking at the 1 3 distances alone This was done by taking the 1 3 mean distances in bins of 0 2 A range being 5 0 to 7 8 A and counting the number of tripeptides falling into each bin Table 4shows that almost all the intermediate tripeptides have an 1 3 distance of 6 0 0 7 A We take the range to be 1 4 as the allowed fluctuation in any single tripeptide is 0 7 A The tabulated results show that all intermediates are broadly similar in structure Among the rigid tripeptides where the maximum allowed fluctuation in any individual tripeptide is 0 4 A only we find that there are essentially two structural categories namely 5 8 0 4 A and 6 4 0 4 A Finally the non rigid tripeptides whose fluctuations are certainly larger than 0 7 A can be thought of having essentially one structure The frequency with which each of the tripeptides occurs in our sample set of 0 27 million tripeptides from 1220 polypeptide chains is shown in Figure 2 In the graph Figure 2 Series 1 indicates the frequency profile of all the tripeptides Series 2 is for intermediate Series 3 is for rigid and Series 4 is for non rigid About 10 of the tripeptides occur with a frequency of less than 6 All the categories except the non rigid do show that tripeptides that occur very frequently are fewer They obey Poisson like statistics Most tripeptides occur with a frequency of 15 Non rigids are rare and almost each non rigid tripeptide occurs with a different frequency We find in our sample size of 0 27 million tripeptides 12 6 fall into the rigid category 4 in non rigids and the remaining in intermediate Discussion Every tripeptide which occurs in a particular protein and in a particular position may yield one possible conformation Examining the entire crystallized data will give the other possible conformations of the tripeptide structures in proteins When this is statistically analyzed it will give a clue to the magnitude of conformational fluctuations It should be borne in mind that in every event there are particular chemical bonds or steric hindrance which makes the conformation possible The data set that we studied typically has about 0 2 A R factor uncertainty in the position of any co ordinates of the atom Consequently most of the nearest neighbour distance data show a standard deviation ranging from 0 to 0 4 A Next nearest neighbour R 1 R 3 data will typically have a standard deviation of 0 4 A to 0 7 A Let us say we start with a rigid structure in three dimensions given by mutual distances between C 1 C 1 C 2 C 2 points We have to find the C 3 and C 3 co ordinates Eight additional distances with corresponding standard deviations fluctuations are given in Table 1for each of the tripeptides Many of the distances are actually redundant Therefore the best distances are picked to achieve our goal It can be noted that the nearest neighbour distances have smaller fluctuations and to fix a point we need the distance of a said point from three other known points This translates to saying that we should know at least one next to nearest neighbour distance We can choose from amongst all the 1 3 distances the one which has the lowest fluctuation and thus fix C 3 and then C 3 or vice versa This yields the optimum procedure for fixing the three co ordinates accurately In Table 2we have boldfaced the significant range around the medians within the category This helps us in demarcating those with fewer fluctuations than the median In Table 2there are occasions where R 1 R 2 or R 2 R 3 distances show a large standard deviation greater than 0 2 A These abnormalities are artificial fluctuations in our crystallized data sample For example in certain PDB data the authors have given more than one possible coordinate information due to experimental uncertainties in data interpretation In our analysis the first choice with its uncertainties has been taken This is reflected in Table 2 These occasions are rare and therefore we have taken them as random errors causing fluctuations We discuss some possibilities for the rigidity of certain tripeptides At the outset we cannot make any strict criterion for rigidity However statistically more often than not the following observations hold Rigidity due to Proline is well understood because of the side chain interacting covalently with the backbone Consequently C is held rigidly upto trans and cis ambiguity This amounts to the fact that essentially is frozen to 60 20 22 The tripeptide therefore tends to be rigid On closer examination we find Proline in position 3 in the tripeptide makes the tripeptide rigid This is in agreement with the expectations from the covalent bond structure Methionine and Tryptophan are fairly bulky perhaps the good space filling is the cause for rigidity Rigid tripeptides with Glutamine invariably also have another polar side chain residue consequently they form a weak ionic bond within the tripeptide Usually residues with long side chains have more rotameric fluctuations 23 Occasionally we find they may bind with another residue within the tripeptide and end up being rigid Lastly non rigids tend to have Serine and Threonine residues which is consistent with their high polarity Cysteine which is well known for its tendency to form di sulfide bridge can fall into either rigid or non rigid category but rarely in the intermediate category A single tripeptide does not have a unique structure indeed it varies as the position of the tripeptide changes within a protein and across proteins This fluctuation is captured by the standard deviations in Table 1 The classification of rigid non rigid and intermediate is most often determined by 1 3 distance alone Therefore we can assess that two different tripeptides have similar structure when their 1 3 distance along with their standard deviations overlap This criterion implies that structurally homologous tripeptides have similar backbones We have also looked at various other cross co relations such as 1 3 vs 1 3 distances 1 3 vs 1 3 distances etc The structural homology conclusion as presented in the results remains unaltered Conclusions Tripeptide analysis is shown to be feasible and statistically significant results have been obtained Some regular features of side chain interactions suggest that there are essentially three classes of tripeptides rigid non rigid and intermediate These have no correlation with the secondary structures in proteins and hence are complementary to such studies This data may be used to predict plausible structures for oligopeptides and for denovo protein design Attempts are being made by us to develop useful pseudo energy functions to realize the above aims Methods A representative data set of 1220 protein structures was obtained from Protein Data Bank PDB 24 with a sequence identity ranging from 0 90 and 2 A resolution This PDB list was generated from CulledPDB R L Dunbrack Jr http www fccc edu research labs dunbrack pisces which uses an algorithm similar to the remove until done algorithm of Hobohm and Sander 25 A statistical analysis of 0 27 million tripeptides from this set was done If the distribution of tripeptides across proteins were random we would expect each of these tripeptides to occur on an average about 34 times For each of these 0 27 million tripeptides 12 distances 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 2 3 were calculated The mean and standard deviation was then computed for each of these distances The frequency of occurrence of each of the 12 distances was also calculated The objective is to find if there is a conservation of distances in these tripeptides irrespective of where they occur in a protein sequence or which protein they came from As a countercheck for the statistical reliability of our analysis another representative dataset of 0 15 million tripeptides in 700 proteins with sequence identity ranging from 0 20 and 2 A resolution was taken and similar computational analysis was done The quantitative results as reflected in Table 2remained the same in both the sets Statistical significance became better in the 0 90 sequence identity set The standard deviation obtained in the 0 90 set is therefore much more reliable In order to determine the structural homologs in the tripeptides 1 3 mean distances were taken in bins of 0 2 A in a range of 5 0 A to 7 8 A The number of tripeptides from each of the three categories rigid non rigid and intermediate which fall into these 0 2 A bins was counted The results are tabulated in Table 4 Helix and beta strand subsequences from DSMP 21 were extracted and the frequency of the three classes of tripeptides was computed The results are tabulated in Table 5
