 Dot Com Mania Is More Selective Than You Think One of the basic truisms about investing that s very easy to forget especially in the middle of the kind of bull market we re in is that it isn t a stock market but rather a market of stocks In other words even if investors are generally feeling bullish that bullishness is not uniform It does not lead them to forget about distinctions among stocks Even during the Dutch tulip mania after all there were some bulbs that seemed priceless and others that you could buy In the most general terms we all recognize this Last year for instance the clich became that everyone wanted to buy tech stocks and couldn t deal with the large cyclical or commodity companies Meanwhile aluminum producer Alcoa was up 119 percent for the year more than any other Dow stock so investors were a little more discerning than tech good no tech bad But as a broad generalization the clich was accurate enough The problem comes when the clich is taken to mean that investors are so blindly rushing after stocks of a certain kind that they re not paying any attention at all to the differences among all those stocks This is a problem because if it s true it means that the market can t be doing what it is meant to do channel capital to those companies that will use it most productively and away from those companies that will not And it s a problem because if it s false well it s just always a problem when a conclusion is false In this case that s precisely what that conclusion is Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this market is that even in a time of seeming universal buoyancy when the Nasdaq was up 80 plus percent in 1999 and you could not seem to go wrong as an investor if you were buying anything with a com at the end of its name or a B2B business to business label attached to its business model there are lots of tech stocks that are not doing especially well More to the point there are lots of tech stocks that have done really well and then been severely punished and on any given day what you re most likely to see is not a move upward or downward in which everyone s participating but a surprising mix of moves Take this morning when the Nasdaq opened up a blistering 120 points then quickly tumbled more than 200 points before rallying yet again it s currently up 15 points Even as some of the tech stalwarts like Cisco and Microsoft both of which I own were in free fall Net powerhouses like Amazon were up strong on the day And even as some of the B2B giants JDS Uniphase Foundry Redback companies you probably haven t heard of but which now sport 20 billion plus market caps were zooming others were headed in the opposite direction On a deeper level there are now a host of Internet stocks that no longer participate in com mania IVillage Marketwatch MP3 TheStreet com The Globe Koop com Wit Capital All of these companies were once darlings of the market and now see their stocks trade in very narrow ranges not much above and in some cases below the prices at which they went public You could say this is just a case of market sentiment shifting But it d be more accurate to see it as what it is a collective verdict on the long term profit possibilities of these companies Which is after all what market sentiment ultimately means Of course investors overreact in both directions And sectors do become hot and witness huge inflows of capital based mainly on trend following But that kind of indistinct investing doesn t last too long which is why the idea that investors today don t care about profits is a misreading If investors didn t care about profits they wouldn t distinguish as carefully as they ultimately do between one unprofitable company and another In the end and this is a good thing everyone doesn t win Even if those everyones have com at the ends of their names
