 Over the past year and a half several pieces have appeared in Slate that delve into the cultural and political dimensions of race in the United States In honor of Black History Month Slate is proud to present a few of these pieces most of which have only been available to subscribers Not Just Talk A five point program for better race relations By Jacob Weisberg To the growing legion of Clinton cynics the president s race relations initiative unveiled last weekend is an exercise in cheap talk Liberal and conservative pundits disagree about affirmative action and welfare reform but concur that a series of town meetings an advisory panel and an eloquent report are sorry substitutes for decisive action If they were talking about Social Security reform the critics might have a point There endless calls for more study postpone necessary but unpopular changes in policy But when it comes to race the power of words should not be so lightly dismissed If President Clinton can use his rhetorical gifts to change attitudes on both sides of the divide he will be accomplishing something of great significance It s also all he can really hope to do right now The public s current skepticism about activist government stymies new initiatives Having screwed up his first term by misjudging the public demand for reform in the far less difficult area of health care the president would be foolish to present a costly multipoint program on race But if we had the money and the will what would we do about race relations A few years of peace prosperity and balanced budgets and a deeper awareness of just how bad our race problem is may create a climate where such a program could succeed When that moment arrives Clinton or his successor should have a five point plan ready De facto segregation exists throughout society But the essence of the problem is the condition of the worst off blacks in the urban ghetto White fears of the urban underclass are distorted into broader stereotypes about blacks as a whole which poison relations between the races at all levels Next week Dateline NBC will report on the south Chicago suburb of Matteson which is tipping from an upper middle class white suburb into an upper middle class black one Matteson ought to be an integrationist s paradise but whites are fleeing because of their concerns about crime and gangs declining schools and falling home prices In reality schools safety even the property values haven t declined But fear that these things will happen is not purely irrational If the whites all leave decline may become a self fulfilling prophecy Thus subtle racism and a rational urge to self preservation are bound up together Unmaking the underclass would answer white fears while giving lower class blacks a chance they are now largely denied that of assimilating into the mainstream of an integrated society Perhaps the most important difference between people who live in the ghetto and those who live outside it is that most of the former aren t employed Breaking down the underclass will require finding new ways to draw unemployed ghetto residents into the culture of work The jury will remain out for some time on the effects of the welfare cutoff signed by Clinton last year But even with the jobs provisions included in that bill it s evident that there still aren t sufficient jobs in the inner cities especially when you consider the prospects of unemployed men who aren t eligible for welfare In his latest book When Work Disappears William Julius Wilson argues that there is a spatial mismatch between workers in the cities and jobs in the suburbs Wilson s answer is a transportation program to get blacks to where the jobs are and a big WPA style jobs program the details of which he borrows from the journalist Mickey Kaus These sub minimum wage jobs doing basic neglected work like repairing roads and bridges would constitute the missing bottom rung on an economic ladder The second step is to address the extreme isolation of the inner city poor This means a housing strategy that shifts more decisively in the direction it has been inching under Clinton Instead of trying to tame inner city housing projects with different kinds of architecture lower density and income mixing the Department of Housing and Urban Development should redefine its purpose to help its tenants escape the ghetto It should take a sledgehammer to every high rise under its control and instead provide vouchers But these vouchers can t be the kind conservatives prefer which are sharply limited in value so as to forestall real integration while directing tenants toward private sector slums Vouchers need to be worth enough to afford real avenues of escape They should also steer beneficiaries away from other beneficiaries to keep pockets of concentrated poverty from re emerging farther from the city s core An easy way to do this would be to enforce strict limits on the percentage of voucher tenants allowed in any one building A less obvious factor fostering residential segregation is the boundary between city and suburb When whites flee the central cities they take with them most of the tax revenue and leave behind a downward spiral of city services As David Rusk a former mayor of Albuquerque argues in his book Cities Without Suburbs metro wide governments where the suburbs and the city are joined tend to be more racially integrated and better off in various other ways as well Washington can t erase jurisdictional frontiers but it can encourage metropolitan government via tax incentives and cheerleading Such a policy would displease many black politicians since it stands to diminish black political representation in the short run But this is a trade off well worth making All of these measures together will not cause the ghettos to disappear Providing escape routes from the inner city may make the ghettos worse by depriving them of their most competent residents What s needed alongside an evacuation plan is a realistic program to stabilize conditions for those left behind The goal shouldn t be to make the desert bloom It should be to create zones where people can raise children in safety even if they must travel elsewhere to work To accomplish this a strategy would need to focus on crime and schools Of course neither law enforcement nor education is principally a federal responsibility But in both cases the feds can help On crime Clinton has had basically the right idea with his community policing initiative Cops walking the street create a sense of order and provide good role models for young boys This program should be expanded perhaps with incentives for police to live in the neighborhoods they patrol full time Schools are a harder nut but not an uncrackable one There are a few good schools even in Harlem which have succeeded by doing end runs around the unionized bureaucracy of the central system The federal government should do more to spur the creation of such institutions by providing resources and by helping to equalize the shameful disparity in funding between rich and poor districts generally Some of these concepts have demonstrated their success at an experimental level and are ripe for expansion Others are just promising ideas that ought to be tried All unfortunately are expensive and sure to be controversial They can t simply be foisted on a reluctant public To lay the groundwork for useful action on race relations we need exactly what President Clinton is proposing as a starting point honest talk and lots of
