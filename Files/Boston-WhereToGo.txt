 Where to Go Boston is so compact that it s perfect for walking You can stroll through Downtown in an hour and explore a number of distinct neighborhoods the cobbled lanes of Beacon Hill the jumble of streets in the financial district or the Victorian avenues of Back Bay To get your bearings start with the panoramic view from the John Hancock Observatory or take a fun trolley tour hopping on and off as you go If you have limited time you may want to stick to the Freedom Trail but otherwise get out and explore the neighborhoods Details of the main sights are given on page 41 Boston Common Beacon Hill and The Esplanade Boston Common The oldest public park in the United States the Common is Boston s historical spiritual and geographical heart First settler William Blackstone sold the 48

stocks also stood here and many were hanged on the gallows too The copper roofed Park Street Station which was built in 1897 stands at one corner of the Common and is the country s oldest subway

Boston s most desirable residential neighborhood has the air of a somnolent village insulated from the traffic and vulgarity of the 20th century It s still a preserve of the old monied who occupy the Federal Georgian Greek Revival and Victorian homes that have stoops boot scrapers and wrought iron railings In the 19th century so many leading intellectuals lived here that the city became known as The Athens of the United States On Chestnut Street alone there lived historian Francis Parkman actor Edwin Booth author Julia Ward Howe and painter John Singer Sargent Louisa May Alcott and Nathaniel

city s major architectural highlights which are great when viewed from the harbor see page 43 Park Street Church stands on a site whose nickname comes from Brimstone Corner some say for the fiery sermons delivered by such figures as Henry Ward Beecher and William Lloyd Garrison who delivered his first anti slavery speech here in 1829 others because gunpowder was kept in the basement during the

the corner of Tremont Street the Omni Parker House hotel the oldest continually operating hotel in the nation has been associated with much of the city s political and social history since it opened

as Richard Henry Dana John Greenleaf Whittier James Russell Lowell and others The Atlantic Monthly was founded here in 1857 Here too Ho Chi Minh worked in the kitchens around 1915 and Malcolm X who was born in Roxbury worked as a busboy in the 1940s At School and Washington streets the lovely red brick building with a Dutch gambrel roof was built in 1718 as an apothecary shop on the site of Anne Hutchinson s residence In the 19th century it became a literary light when Ticknor and Fields the publisher of Emerson Longfellow and Thoreau operated here from 1832 to 1865 and when the Atlantic

island in front of the Old State House marking the site of the Boston Massacre Here on March 5 1770 British soldiers taunted by colonists fired on an angry crowd killing five including Crispus Attucks the first victim who was black The massacre aided the Revolutionary cause by creating its first martyrs and the propagandists including Paul Revere who made an engraving of the event used it to their advantage The city s malls now outshine the shopping district of Downtown Crossing around the crossroads of Washington Summer and Winter streets but here you ll discover long established department stores like Macy s and Filene s It s hard to imagine the pedestrians only Washington Street joining the Old State House south to the neck of the Shawmut peninsula before the landfills were created in the 19th century A few quaint stores are hidden down side alleys as is the 19th century Locke Ober in Winter Place which has served traditional fare to well heeled businessmen for over a century Government Center and Faneuil Hall This is Boston s commercial and financial heart but it s far from being an homogeneous district It incorporates the austere Government Center and the lively Faneuil Hall Marketplace Government Center Little good can be said about Government Center It s monolithic dreary and soulless The city has attempted to enliven the complex by adding a garden with terraces pools and niches where music is performed but there s still little reason to visit except to see the enormous Steaming Kettle on the south side of the plaza above the door of the eponymous coffee shop Commissioned by the Oriental Tea Company in 1873 it is an appropriate landmark for a city so closely linked to tea Its capacity is printed on its side 227 gallons 2 quarts 1 pint 3 gills some 868 liters Faneuil Hall Marketplace Annually 14 million visitors come to Faneuil Hall the great Cradle of Liberty and marketplace It s very commercial but very alluring and one of the most successful

Fanueil Hall the three Quincy market buildings fill with crowds of locals and visitors who come to feast on chowder seafood deli sandwiches pizza and an array of ethnic cuisines They also come to shop at the stalls the flower market and the stores to watch the street entertainers and to sample the nightlife One restaurant in particular draws folks Durgin Park which offers Yankee cuisine communal dining and tough no nonsense waitresses When they were built in 1826 these buildings stood on the waterfront Older Bostonians can still recall the stench of rancid meat emanating from them on a hot summer s day and the gradual decay of the area before they were restored in the late 1970s Blackstone Block and the New England Holocaust Memorial A neon sign northeast of the plaza beckons visitors to the oldest restaurant in the United States the Union Oyster House which opened in 1826 in the Blackstone Block a tiny group of old red brick buildings separated by narrow alleys that dates to 1713

just behind Blackstone Block on Friday and Saturday The North End and Across the River to Charlestown An Italian Festa The North End with its Italian caf s and restaurants and vibrant street festivals is one of Boston s most entrancing neighborhoods Before the Revolution royal officials and other wealthy folk lived here but in the 19th century it became a crowded slum as immigrants Irish Jewish Portuguese and Italian poured into the district Two retail titans got their start here on Hanover Street Eben Jordan and R H Macy Honey Fitz father of Rose Kennedy was born on Ferry Street The Italians took hold in the 1920s and made the area the lovable close knit community it is today where ladies in aprons still feel free to loll outside in the evenings Hanover Street is the North End s commercial backbone lined with caf s and restaurants frequented by locals from the community not just tourists On weekend evenings people gather for a liqueur and gelati at the cavernous Caff Vittoria

photographed sights in the city Locals chat on the stone benches of the promenade while tourists inspect the bronze plaques on the brick walls that pay tribute to the North End s famous sons Old North

to a 19th century Greek Revival temple base in 1913 For a good look at Downtown s architecture go to the green triangle of Post Office Square Stepped sides and Art Deco style wall decorations make the New England Telephone Building on the southern edge of the square one of the most arresting The lobby s 360 degree mural celebrates the proletarian history of the telephone You can also pop in to a

Chinatowns so don t bother unless you re really interested The Waterfront and Fort Point Channel Wharves reach out into Boston Harbor from Downtown and the North End like the fingers on a hand Once this was the second busiest port in the United States with clippers jostling for space Today after a long period of decline the area has revived and the granite warehouses have been renovated into apartments restaurants offices and hotels The British sailed home from Long Wharf Today you can sail to the Harbor Islands take a cruise around the harbor or just sit and admire the craft at anchor On Central Wharf the New England Aquarium is one of the best anywhere Its centerpiece is a giant 200 000 gallon tank containing a 24 ft 7 m deep coral reef filled with sharks sea turtles and 600 fish from 100 species Five times a day scuba divers go in to feed the fish a fascinating spectacle to watch Ramps circle the tank so that you can walk around the whole thing More than 70 exhibit tanks make

two floors of exhibits plus visitor facilities opened in 1998 A large format theater will open in 2001 and the new East Wing in 2003 To the south Rowes Wharf hosts many different cruise ships and also anchors the luxurious Boston Harbor Hotel Fort Point Channel divides Downtown from South Boston confusingly to the east and here docked by one of the rusty bridges across the channel Beaver II looks anachronistic In a way it is for it s a replica of one of the three ships that the Patriots dressed as Indians boarded and from which they dumped 342 chests of tea Built in 1973 in Denmark it sailed across the Atlantic for the Bicentennial This Boston Tea Party Ship and Museum invites you to explore the decks and hold and to join the costumed characters in tossing a bale of tea over the side A museum on the small adjacent pier explains the historical background The shop does a brisk trade in kitchen towels mugs and of course packets of the precious leaves A superb museum for children stands across Fort Point Channel marked by a whimsical giant milk bottle which serves snacks and ice cream The Children s Museum is both a vast playground and a stimulating learning center The buzz words here are hands on There are strange sculptures to climb over bubbles to make and hopscotch to play in Chinese and Italian in the Kid s Bridge a reference to Boston s multiculturalism The most original part of the museum is an entire Japanese house with bathroom kitchen and tatami rooms which have authentic scents and Teen and Teen Tokyo where you can ride the subway and take up the Sumo Challenge Cruises and Looking For Leviathans On a fine day a boat trip in Boston Harbor is idyllic The rectangular circular and pyramidal shapes of the downtown rooflines are etched magnificently against the skyline The water is bobbing with yachts speedboats tugs and fishing craft while a constant stream of jets descends onto the waterside runways of one of the world s busiest airports As you reach the outer harbor the urban scenery fades and a jumble of indecipherable green lumps appear These are the 30 tiny islands that constitute The Harbor Islands Gulls hover over lobster pots or perch on rocky outcrops channel markers float on the surface and small lighthouses appear on the horizon There s not that much to do or see on the seven islands that make up Boston Harbor Islands State Park but an afternoon spent here offers gentle strolls picnics and bird watching a welcome respite from urban frenzy From May to mid October the Boston Harbor Cruise Company Tel 723 7800 operates a ferry from Long Wharf to Georges Island the core of the group Fort Warren a 19th century star shaped fortress in which Confederate prisoners were incarcerated during the Civil War occupies most of the island It s an atmospheric and spooky place with old gun emplacements lookout posts and chilly alleys You can also visit five other islands Peddocks Lovells Bumpkin Gallops and Grape on a free water shuttle service from Georges Island from July to Labor Day Lovells is the only island with a designated swimming area For details on camping see page 120 One of the most exciting experiences you can have in Boston is whale watching From April through to October literally dozens of sightseeing craft from Boston and other ports scattered along the New England coast head out to an area known as Stellwagen Bank where whales stock up on plankton and fish before migrating to warmer Caribbean climes If you sail from Gloucester and Provincetown which are closer to the Bank you will spend less time getting there and more time actually looking for whales For details of sightseeing and whale watching trips see page 111 Humpbacks are most commonly spotted but you might also spy the larger fin whales which measure up to 80 ft or 24 m in length the second biggest species after blue whales and swift 30 ft 9 m long minkes You re almost certain to glimpse a whale In fact on a good day you may see as many as forty You are more likely to see greater numbers if the weather is poor take seasickness medicine before boarding When the guide who is usually a well qualified naturalist makes a sighting everyone rushes to one side of the boat causing it to lurch suddenly The boat heads off toward the telltale sign of the spume of water and then suddenly there it is a silvery flank virtually underneath the boat A flick of a tail or fluke and it s gone If you are very lucky you may see the rare spectacle of a whale breaching heaving its entire body out of the water At times it seems as if the whales themselves are doing the watching when they approach the boats swimming underneath them and staring up at the tourists Back Bay and The Fenway In the middle of the 19th century Boston ended at Boston Common and Back Bay was just a polluted tidal flat In 30 years however an immense landfill project transformed it into the city s most fashionable residential and commercial district to which the well to do moved from Beacon Hill and the South End In contrast to the tangled maze of lanes of the old city Back Bay was meticulously planned in regimented lines inspired by the boulevards of Paris The residential district North of Boylston Street contains some of the best Victorian architecture in the country Churches and Skyscrapers From the Public Garden Boylston Street leads into the commercial section of Back Bay Follow it a short way to Copley Square a popular summer focal point for concerts and a place where kids splash in the fountain Here a feast of contrasting buildings competes for your attention Sleek blue John Hancock Tower New England s tallest building rises on one side Two sides are knife edge thin and from certain vantage points it seems as if the building virtually disappears When it was built in 1976 it was a disaster because the glass blew out so every sheet had to be replaced If the weather is fine pay a visit to the Observatory on the 60th floor There s no better way to get to grips with Boston s peculiar topography A model of the city in 1775 brings home just how much of the present land was under water at one time People feared that the tower would eclipse one of its neighbors Trinity Church but the beauty of Henry Hobson Richardson s masterpiece now reflected in the tower s glass has only been enhanced The church has been named by the AIA one of the nation s ten best buildings In 1877 when it was consecrated it cost 750 000 For that amount the commissioners purchased the great stained glass windows by John LaFarge Edward Burne Jones and William Morris in addition to the building itself The church has had some colorful preachers too from patriot Sam Parker to Phillips Brooks author of O Little Town of Bethlehem and a prodigious gourmet who also loved the track billiards and fly fishing Ironically the Hancock tower enriched the church when the church won 11 6 million in a suit against its developers for damage caused during construction On the other side of the square the Boston Public Library 1895 the oldest free municipal library in the world is well worth visiting The grand Italian Renaissance building has several decorative highlights the bronze doors by Daniel Chester French at the Dartmouth entrance the double marble staircase graced with murals by Puvis de Chavannes and Edwin Austin Abbey and on the third floor by John Singer Sargent The Johnson Building was added in 1972 and now the library holds more than six million books stored on 65 miles of shelves Copley Place on Huntington Avenue is a large shopping mall anchored by two 1 000 room hotels with a hundred plus shops A walkway connects it to the graceless 52 story Prudential Center from which the famous amphibious vehicles leave on Boston Duck Tours After touring the shops go up to the Top of The Hub bar restaurant and Skywalk open Monday Friday 10am 7pm great vantage points from which to see the Hancock Tower The Skywalk is quieter and more spacious than the neighboring observatory though the views are less impressive A little farther along Huntington Avenue the Christian Science World Headquarters may not sound enticing and indeed the austerity of the administration buildings around a vast reflecting pool makes a somber first impression Still the huge basilica of the First Church of Christ Scientist a huge Byzantine style church enveloping the original Mother Church is an amazing edifice It can hold 4 000 its tiered seating makes it more like a theater than a place of worship The organ which is the focal point of the space contains 13 595 pipes covering nine octaves Except for quotations on the walls from the New Testament and Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy there s no decoration Some stained glass windows are found in the older church which also contains founder Mary Baker Eddy s chair She only addressed the congregation twice as she wished to avoid any personal idolatry A guided tour is highly recommended you can only visit the original church by joining a tour The Christian Science publishing building adjacent to the church houses an interesting phenomenon the Mapparium a 30 ft 9m wide glass globe made of 608 stained glass panels that are lit from outside by 300 lights You can stand on the bridge in the middle of the sphere and study this dramatic object created by Chester Lindsay Churchill between 1932 and 1935 it shows the national borders as they were then The Chic and the Victorian A stroll along Newbury Street the city s most expensive real estate is the most civilized and congenial of Boston experiences This is where the chic and the conservative come to furnish their homes with art and antiques wrap their bodies in designer fashion have their hair styled in upmarket salons and wine dine and drink iced coffee al fresco in summer Image and appearance take center stage here both in the showcase windows and the personas of the people looking at them Every display whether of fine art ice cream or fashion is worth a picture Some of the galleries exhibit works by major artists Notice the architecture as well At the end of the converted carriage houses the less genteel eastern end gives way to series of alternate classic bow and flat fronted townhouses Take a detour along the way down one of the side streets alphabetically arranged from A to H starting at the Public Garden they re named after English peers In between the avenues look out for the narrow arrow straight service alleys that form the entranceway to the old servants quarters at the backs of the houses The strip which is lined with elms and runs down the spine of Commonwealth Avenue is the perfect vantage point on which to stand back and gaze at the ornate Victorian buildings built in a range of styles French Second Empire Victorian Gothic and Renaissance Revival Detour to see the mansion designed by McKim Mead White for John F Andrew at 32 Hereford Street and to the building that housed the original Fannie Farmer Cooking School at 40 Hereford Street You can get a wonderful sense of life in a Victorian Back Bay home at the Gibson House at 137 Beacon Street open for tours May October Wednesday Sunday at 1 2 and 3pm weekends the rest of the year The contents of the house imported carpets plush Turkish ottomans are the fascinating and colorful legacy of three generations of Gibsons who lived here from 1860 to 1954 Fenway Come to Fenway to enjoy the city s two superb art museums located close to the meandering tract of ponds reeds and meadows of the Back Bay Fens and to see the Red Sox in action at Fenway Park Its center Kenmore Square pinpointed from afar by a massive neon CITGO sign is a congested intersection of fast food restaurants frequented by local youth and university students from MIT and other colleges The Museum of Fine Arts or MFA contains one of the most important art collections in the country There s much too much to absorb in one visit so choose particular galleries or take a Highlights Tour leaflet and pick out just a few works For example the museum s outstanding collections of Asian works include Japanese armor Javanese statue gods Thai Buddhas and Indian elephants There are first rate Egyptian galleries with mummies and early sculptures and Nubian statues and stelae The American galleries feature a full cupboard of silver made by Paul Revere and his portrait among many others by John Singleton Copley who was probably Boston s best known artist The complete pantheon of European art is represented from the Italian Renaissance to English landscape painters The most overwhelming rooms are those exhibiting works by 19th century French artists containing dozens of Monets Millet s The Sower Renoir s Dance at Bougival and works by C zanne Toulouse Lautrec and Van Gogh There s also a great museum shop a caf and a restaurant Nothing in Boston can match the beauty of the courtyard in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum Modeled on a Venetian loggia the cloister delicate arches and salmon pink marble walls enclose a stunning atmospheric space lined with mosaic and filled with foliage and classical statuary Isabella Gardner created Fenway Court in 1903 to hold her outstanding collection of art A flamboyant New Yorker her unconventional ways scandalized the Boston Brahmins on more than one occasion Her portrait by John Singer Sargent in the Gothic Room captures her individuality and her eccentricity lives on in her will which stipulates that all of the 2 000 pieces on display in the house must be left exactly where they are This decree is qualified by the condition that were anything to change the museum s contents would be sold off with the proceeds going to Harvard University It s an extraordinary place filled with great art works which are displayed idiosyncratically in often for the time innovative ways It s more a personal home than a museum and the works are often poorly lit and cursorily labeled Each of the rooms displays art of a particular artist Titian Raphael or Veronese or style Dutch Gothic or early Italian A Night Out withthe Red Sox Leave the car behind and experience being crushed by fans in a trolley on the MBTA Green Line to Kenmore Constructed in 1912 Fenway Park is the oldest ballpark in the country The quirky irregularly shaped arena boasts real manicured grass and a towering wall that is nicknamed the Green Monster for its scale and color This is an intimate place so even those who are standing at the back will be close to the action If you re not familiar with baseball s finer points most fans in the friendly vociferous 34 000 strong crowd would love to talk you through them In a low scoring game dominated by the pitchers you might wonder what the fuss is about Feel the fever generated by a slick double play or a home run and you could be hooked For tickets see page 119 Bay Village and the South End The few blocks of tiny Bay Village lie well hidden in between the Theater District and Back Bay around Winchester Melrose and Fayette streets It feels somewhat like a toy village a miniature flat version of Beacon Hill with similar red brick and black shuttered homes lining sidewalks that are shaded by trees and lit by old fashioned street lamps These were the homes of artisans not Brahmins and are less precious devoid of cornices and fancy wrought iron When the marsh of Back Bay was filled in during the 1860s water flooded into this area forcing the streets and houses to be raised on pilings Take Tremont Street south and cross over the Massachusetts Turnpike into the South End Come if only to savor one or more of its great restaurants a clutch of chic bistros on Tremont Street around Clarendon Like so much of Boston the South End began as a landfill project but it soon lost out in desirability to Back Bay A multi ethnic mix of Hispanic Irish West Indian and Greek the community is also home to Boston s largest gay community Some districts to the south of Shawmut Avenue for example are best avoided In others though you will come across bright community murals and perhaps a reggae band playing in a local park The neighborhood boasts justifiably a fine concentration of Victorian terraced residences Bow brick houses their steep stoops or steps framed with scrolled black railings are set off by parks the finest examples being Union Park Square situated just off Tremont Street and Rutland and Concord squares both farther to the south South Boston Dorchester and Jamaica Plain Although the Boston suburbs might not claim any must see sights if you have a car and are confident about finding your way around with a good map there is a variety of intriguing places to explore South Boston referred to as Southie is in fact rather confusingly situated east of Downtown Home to such establishments as Flanagan s Supermarket and the Shannon Tavern on its main thoroughfare of East Broadway it s thoroughly and proudly Irish In fact it was the flashpoint for protests and riots during the busing controversy in the 1970s Follow the main street past its old wooden and brick houses down to Fort Independence which stands at the very mouth of Boston Inner Harbor The fort is rarely open but join the locals who settle down in the surrounding park with deck chairs and binoculars to watch the nautical and aeronautical activity Your next stop could well be Dorchester Heights a three tiered tower of marble standing on a hill From here in 1776 George Washington trained his artillery on the city and succeeded in frightening British troops into evacuating Boston see page 16 Follow the waterfront south to the extraordinary stark white building designed by I M Pei for the John F Kennedy Library and Museum Enter via the brilliantly lit atrium with glorious bayfront view See the introductory film and then look at the 25 exhibits that trace the career of John F Kennedy using rare film and television footage documents and personal

resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis the founding of the Peace Corp the launching of the space program and the support for Civil Rights The film footage of the assassination still shocks and appalls The quotation that follows A man may die nations may rise and fall but an idea lives on though reminds us of an earlier political time when visionary ideas mattered more than gossip to the media commentators see page 111 for details of boat trips from Downtown Franklin Park lies close by to the west The Zoo open winter Monday Friday 10am 4 pm 10 5pm Saturday Sunday and holidays 10am 5pm and

Spring is a wonderful time to visit when the lilacs rhododendron and magnolia are in bloom the 130 different maples put on a blazing show in the fall Before returning to Boston make a final stop in affluent Brookline actually a separate town once home to Olmsted The modest wooden house at 83 Beals Street property of the National Park Service open 10am 4 30pm mid May October is the John F Kennedy National Historic Site He was born and lived here until age four His mother Rose had it restored and furnished it with family pieces Cambridge Although it s only separated from Boston by a river and a few subway stops Cambridge is a distinct city with a distinct outlook It s dominated by two of America s leading academic establishments Harvard and MIT and although there is a community outside the universities visitors should begin by exploring life around Harvard Square Harvard Square and Harvard University Harvard Square itself is unkempt What makes it special is the people This is a place where everyone just hangs out from students conversing in sententious tones to punks in leather and professionals in well pressed suits Street performers fire jugglers puppeteers trapeze artists musicians Joni Mitchell and Tracy Chapman both performed here pull big crowds notably on weekend evenings There are numerous caf s and bookshops see page 61 in which to while away several hours Buy a newspaper from the global selection at Out of Town News in the center of the square itself the name also refers to all the surrounding streets and settle down at Au Bon Pain caf It s the place for

ground for puritan ministers and the richest and has produced numerous Nobel Prize winners From Harvard Square enter the gates into Harvard Yard the oldest part of the university Here is Hollis Hall attended by Emerson and Thoreau Massachusetts Hall attended by John and Samuel Adams H H Richardson s Sever Hall and Charles Bulfinch s Stoughton and University Halls Note the statue of John Harvard labeled as the founder and dated 1638 It s called the statue of the Three Lies because it isn t John Harvard but only a student model he wasn t the founder only the first benefactor who donated his 400 book library and the date is wrong it should be 1636 So much for Harvard s motto Veritas the Latin for Truth In the second quad the colossal pillars of the Widener Library face across the green to the Memorial Church which has an elegant white spire peeping out above the foliage The Widener houses about a third of the University s collection of 13 million volumes making it the largest

artist blacksmith Dimitri Gerakaris Past the Loeb Drama Center Brattle Street becomes more residential H H Richardson designed Stoughton House at number 90 Many of the other mansions that line the street belonged to Loyalists which is why the street was dubbed Tory Row in the 18th century One of these is the yellow clapboard Longfellow House which was commandeered by Washington as his headquarters during the siege of Boston see page 16 Henry Wadsworth Longfellow one of America s best loved poets lived here for 45 years while he served as a professor of modern languages at Harvard

Tours are given of the new facility Day Trips from Boston If you only take one trip from Boston make it to Lexington and Concord where the American Revolution began with a skirmish and the shot that was heard around the world was fired The best way to reach both towns and to tour the sites is by car half an hour or 14 miles 22 km west of Boston on Route 2 and Route 4 225 You can see the main historical sights in a day but you ll need a second visit to appreciate Concord s rich literary heritage During the summer and every year on Patriot s Day see page 91 battles are staged and the militiamen demonstrate their drill Call 978 369 3120 for further details Lexington Stop first at the Museum of Our National Heritage where the Let it Begin Here exhibit will provide the historical

the 750 acre 303 hectare National Historic Park Stop first at the Battle Road Visitor Center Here along this road on the afternoon of 19 April 1775 the patriots harried the retreating British Today you can stop at the Paul Revere Capture site and Hartwell Tavern a typical country inn In Concord head to Old North Bridge at the western end of the park to visit the spot where the embattled farmers stood by the rude bridge and fired the shot heard round the world It s bucolic today but here the colonists clashed again with the British and killed 200 Redcoats Cross the rickety bridge not the original to view the Minuteman Statue equipped with rifle and plough Follow the path up to the Visitor Center at the top of the hill where you can watch a video about the battle and buy a Bill of Rights souvenir Concord s literary heritage is rich indeed for it was the cradle of Transcendentalism and the place where Nathaniel Hawthorne Ralph Waldo Emerson Louisa May Alcott and Henry David Thoreau all wrote Today you can visit four buildings associated with their movement The Old Manse is beautifully situated in a field next door to North Bridge Reverend William Emerson who built it watched the battle from the window his grandson Ralph later lived here On the outskirts of town on or near Route 2A are Emerson House which is full of Ralph s memorabilia the enchanting Orchard House

poet and friend of Emerson lived in a cabin from 1845 to 1847 and wrote Walden Near the main parking lot is a replica of his hut containing a bed table desk three chairs and a stove Plymouth Less than an hour from Boston Plymouth doesn t let you forget its famous heritage but unless you really want to see the rock that marks where the pilgrims landed in 1620 you might prefer to head on to Cape Cod In Plymouth see Mayflower II a replica of the original that was built in England and sailed across the Atlantic in 1957 It gives you a good idea of just how cramped it was for the original 102 passengers on their 66 day voyage Wander the decks and talk to the actors who play the parts of sailors and pilgrims Nearby Plymouth Rock is not much to look at but it is regarded as a national symbol of civil and religious freedom Two miles south of town Plimouth Plantation shows life as it was in 1627 The villagers reside in wattle and daub huts and chatter away about their religious beliefs and lifestyles as they tend their cows sheep and pigs Nearby Hobbamock a Native American neighbor lives at his campsite The entrance fee is high but for those who appreciate these kinds of re creations it s worth it Note that you can buy a discounted combination ticket covering both the plantation and Mayflower II Back in town the Pilgrim Hall Museum displays possessions of the Pilgrims such as bibles and a cradle and the original compacts from King James I to the settlers Whale watches also operate from the harbor Cape Cod Fabulous beaches dramatic dunes fragile salt marshes and brilliant light have long drawn people particularly artists to Cape Cod the bare and bended arm of Massachusetts In summer it is incredibly crowded and so if you can you should avoid the Friday evening mass exodus see page 105 and visit during the week or off season when it s only an hour from Boston to Sandwich the nearest town on the Cape With so many alluring inns however why not plan to stay overnight but make sure to reserve in advance Provincetown is right at the end of the Cape and in summer can most easily be reached from Boston via the ferry operated by Bay State Cruise Company Tel 748 1428 The most alluring section of the Cape is its north shore and upper arm Beaches vary The sheltered Cape Cod Bay beaches on the north shore are transformed into mud flats when the tide is out The spectacular East Coast Atlantic beaches can have a strong undertow On a sunny summer s day parking lots at the latter fill up fast at many beaches visitors need a parking permit which can be obtained from the town hall After crossing the Sagamore Bridge turn on to Route 6A which travels from one village to another past stately clapboard homes antique stores and galleries and other appealing stores Numerous side roads lead to the Bay beaches The first town Sandwich is the Cape s oldest community It has a couple of sites worth visiting the Sandwich Glass Museum and the Heritage Plantation The first displays the brilliantly colored glass that was manufactured here in the 19th century the second is an estate owned by Charles Dexter where you can see a dazzling display of antique cars bird carvings by Elmer Crowell a beautifully restored carousel and more The gardens alone are worth visiting especially in spring when the rhododendrons bloom Several of the sea captain s homes along Brewster s main street have been turned into country inns Today this is the Cape s richest community The easiest way to reach the dramatic Cape Cod National Seashore is via the high speed ferry to Provincetown Here on the outer elbow facing the Atlantic Ocean you can listen to the pounding surf and stroll the awesome beaches that are backed by huge dunes Because the dunes are so fragile access is strictly controlled and limited to boardwalks at some points The National Seashore has two Information Centers The Salt Pond Center near Eastham on Route 6 and Province Lands Visitor Center just outside P town Both provide detailed information on the terrain natural life and activities Just outside Provincetown at Province Lands take the opportunity to climb on to the roof for a panoramic view of the dunes tenuously anchored by pitch pines and oaks There s an even better view from the top of the 253 ft 77 m Pilgrim Monument in Provincetown It s called the Pilgrim monument because this is where the Pilgrims actually landed first before moving on to Plymouth The museum at the base of the tower tells the story P Town is a fabled place Although the main street is crowded and lined with commercial tourist trinket stores it still has a magical atmosphere because it has an anything goes attitude It is the East Coast s gay mecca along with the Hamptons and Cherry Grove and the Pines on Fire Island Same sex couples walk the streets hand in hand and outrageous transvestites entertain in the cabarets Families come to browse the stores selling T shirts and scrimshaw and driftwood curios and to enjoy the beaches and the fishing and whale watch trips In the early 20th century Provincetown was a major art colony and there are still numerous art galleries particularly at the east end of town In summer the town is swamped and every guesthouse filled In winter it s quiet Many of the commercial stores close and only the residents remain a community of artists Portuguese fishermen and a handful of restaurateurs You can visit Provincetown for a day see page 110 but if you don t stay longer you ll miss half the fun For a less frenetic pace and picturesque harbor visit Wellfleet a few miles south It has its own share of galleries and leftover beatniks but is decidedly more laid back Salem and Marblehead Past the ugly northern suburbs of Boston lies a lovely rocky coastline from Marblehead to Cape Ann studded with picturesque harbors fine sandy beaches and the elegant homes of wealthy Bostonians Although commuter trains see page 117 run from Boston to Salem Manchester Gloucester and Rockport in most cases you are discharged a long way from beaches and sights so again you really need a car In summer the traffic isn t quite as appalling as on Cape Cod but that s not saying much From Boston follow Route 1A then 129 to Marblehead about 16 miles away The first people to settle here were Cornish fishermen Now you can hardly see the water for moored yachts halyards clink and large cars are parked outside exclusive sailing clubs The superb natural harbor is formed by Marblehead Neck which has a tiny park at its tip The Old Town with its narrow sloping streets and early 18th century buildings each marked with the date it was built and the names and occupations of the original owners is worth exploring A Bewitching City In Salem magic bookshops fortune tellers a witch house dungeon and museum all recall the town s witchcraft trials of 1692 but there is much more to this town than witches Start at the National Park Visitors Center at Museum Place on Essex Street where you can pick up some literature and a map of the Heritage Trail Visit the outstanding Peabody Essex Museum where the exhibits tell the story of the development of this very wealthy seaport town which produced America s first millionaire Elias Hesketh Derby Kids always love the Salem Witch Museum a diorama show that tells the story of the witch hysteria when 19 people went to the gallows Go beyond these sights to Nathaniel Hawthorne s House of the Seven Gables Hawthorne of course worked at the Custom House and was also born in one of the houses nearby The Heritage trail will return you to the lovely red brick marketplace where the trial of Bridget Bishop is re enacted with the audience judging her fate Lastly kids will enjoy the Witch Dungeon Museum where the tour after the show takes them through eerie re created cells where the guilty were imprisoned Some are no bigger than a telephone booth Cape Ann From Salem the coast road Route 127 to Cape Ann goes through Manchester which has the lovely sandy Singing Beach Just past Magnolia Hammond Castle Museum looms above the entrance to Gloucester Harbor Inventor John Hays Hammond Jr built this medieval style castle to house his early Roman medieval and Renaissance collections It also contains an 8 200 pipe organ concerts are given Gloucester 38 miles 61 km from Boston is a gritty salty town the country s oldest fishing port and also the busiest on the Massachusetts coast Rows of gulls perch on the ridges of the factory roofs that line the wooden quays and jetties while a steady stream of fishing craft and whale watch cruisers weigh and drop anchor It s also home to one of the most engaging small museums anywhere the Cape Ann Historical Association It shows the largest collection of paintings by native of Gloucester Fitz Hugh Lane 1804 1865 along with works by other artists who visited Cape Ann Winslow Homer Milton Avery and others It also has exhibits on the Gloucester fishing industry and

decorative arts arranged by this genius From Gloucester Routes 127 and 127A loop around Cape Ann to Rockport a famous art colony En route you ll pass the sandy Good Harbor Beach and Long Beach Rockport s harbor is picturesque and Motif 1 a red shack covered with brightly colored lobster floats is one of New England s most painted images hence its name Visitors swamp the port in summer particularly Bearskin Neck alongside the harbor which is lined with small gabled and flower decked huts selling tourist fare scrimshaw fudge leather pewter and typical art When you ve finished shopping ask for The Paper House a chalet and its contents entirely constructed from 100 000 newspapers
