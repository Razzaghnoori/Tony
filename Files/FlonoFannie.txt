 This is Fannie Flono and she grew up in Ag Augusta GA and she is going to talk about some stories from her childhood Ok My grandmother used to tell me a lot of different stories about her growing up years and uh especially uh she used to talk about her family and what it was like during those times She had this one story and uh we called my grandmother Granny uh because we had another grandmother we called something else but uh um Granny used to tell this story about her brother Joe And it was a fascinating story because uh it kind of told a lot about uh what it was like being a uh uh close knit black family during those those years in the South when uh you didn t have much She grew up on a farm and um uh what it was like but um like a lot of black families during that time uh uh if you had a large family uh and some of your relatives didn t have anybody in their family you would just kind of let some of the kids stay with that family And my Gran my Granny and her brother um were among I think there were six kids in her family and they had a cousin uh who lived uh on a farm you know maybe about I don t know 10 miles away not that far You know during that time people walked 10 miles and uh they needed somebody to help with some of the farm chores and all that sort of stuff and so they asked my my my Granny s parents if Joe could come and live with them And you know they were a close family and they loved each other and all that kind of stuff but it was just down the road you know so they said fine and and you you know he came back on Sundays and he was with the family at church and all that sort of thing Um but ah one day he didn t show up on Sunday uh for church and so they wondered what was going on and they went to this house ah down the road and the cousins had packed up and left They had just gone Nobody knew where they went They took Joe with them and my Granny said she said it was such a sad time in the house because you know everybody was missing Joe and they didn t know what to do And so you know eventually you know you know they kept asking people around and nobody knew where they were and eventually you know they just reconciled themselves that they just wouldn t see Joe again And uh so uh Granny grew up she was like I think she told me this was when she was about 10 years old when this happened and her brother Joe was like 16 and uh so she grew up and uh she uh got married and uh that s another story She got married when she was 16 to my grandfather who was 30 and she didn t know she had to go live with him but anyway that s another story about ignorance among people but anyway they were sitting on the porch and she was back visiting uh her mother and they were sitting on the porch and it was like this long road it was like the house was like situated at the end of this long road and you could see all the way down the road a a long way And she said it was just like one day and it was like maybe 10 years later cause she was like 20 and they were just sitting on the porch and they were and she said she said she could still remember because her mother had on you know this big straw hat that she used to have on It was like her favorite hat and this big voluminous dress that she used to have on in the summertime It was really cool and the dress kind of blew in the wind a little bit Uh huh And they were just sitting out there on rocking chairs you know just kind of enjoying the afternoon and uh they could look down the road and they could see this dust kicking up And and she said uh my Granny said she got up and she she looked up and she said You know wonder who that could be And so she sat back down and you know they were still chatting and they could still see this person and this person was walking really really fast And she said that her brother had this really distinctive walk and she said the more she looked at that person coming down that road she started thinking No that can t be that can t be And she said but you know the closer he got she said she got up and she peered down the road and she looked at her mom and she said she said Mama you know I think that s Joe And she said then her mama her mama leaned forward and she looked and she said Walks like him Got that same walk but she said It can t be So Granny got up and she kind of walked down the steps off the porch and she was walking up towards the road and she then just stood there And then he was coming she said he was coming really fast she said could still remember all that dust kicking up on the road and here he s coming down the road and she turns around and she said It s Joe He s come home And she said she started running toward him and they ran and they hugged and they hugged and she said her mama was sitting on the porch and this is a true story and her mama was sitting on the porch and she said her mama was just like dumbfounded She didn t say a word Aw She said there were just tears coming down from her eyes and she said then she said Joe came up on the porch And he said Mama I m home Where had he been He said that they had gone up North They had wound up starting out to New York to visit some relatives of this this cousin and they just stayed and he didn t know how to get back so he just stayed with them He didn t know how to get in touch with them and he said you know you know as he grew up you know he kept thinking about them and he said he wanted to come back home but he didn t have any way he didn t have any money And he said finally he know you know once he got grown and started working he saved up his money and he said he was determined to come back and find them and he didn t even know if they were going to be in the same place Wow But he said he was going to find them and he came all the way back Do you have an idea what year that would be Oh That would have to have been let s see My grandmother was born in 1910 she was a little girl No she was born in 1900 because she was 16 and so it must have been like in 1926 19 you know before before 1930 Wow Yeah yeah about that yeah So he stayed in Augusta after that Well I don t know I don t know whether he stayed in Augusta after that Cause they didn t actually live in Augusta they lived in well you know Augusta was still a city town during that time even though to people in big cities like this Augusta isn t that big But uh they lived in a little country town outside of Augusta called Evans and Evans still exists and that s where a lot of my relatives still still are too Hah So ah and um Granny she used to tell a lot of those stories I mean especially when talking about Augusta being the big city Uh my grandmother Granny her great grandfather was a white man and one of the the the things that just sticks in her craw is that and you know she she and her sister uh were lighter than some of the rest of the family Her sister could pass for white and in fact did pass for white And Granny used to tell the story about how her sister and her sister s husband decided that they were going to move to the city to Augusta and pass for white And they moved downtown So her sister s husband was light skinned too Her sister s husband was light skinned too And uh they moved downtown and there was uh and it s still like this in Augusta this big street downtown called Broad Street and it really was just this broad street in a downtown area And they found this house or this apartment building or whatever it was that they could live in and it was right on the edge of Broad Street And uh they kind of actually stopped visiting the family because they were just just determined that they were going to be white They just didn t like what it was like being black in those days and that was you know I guess that that was probably you know in the early 1930s uh when they did that And they they wanted to sever relationships with the rest of the family but the rest of the family didn t want to sever relationships with them even though they were mad at them because they had decided you know to do something they didn t think was right My my grandmother was very adamant about you know people who try to be things that they aren t and this whenever she d tell this story she d talk about people who try to be things that they aren t I mean that was the whole point That was the lesson in the story people who try to be things that they aren t That they shouldn t do that that you should accept your lot in life although you should work to improve it you know you should be who you are and not try to be something else Um but she used to visit her sister ah in in in Augusta and but she used to have to go in the back door and pretend she was the maid Granny hated that I bet She hated that and she used to tell her sister every day she said that that You are doing wrong You are doing wrong wrong wrong wrong treating your family this way And so finally somebody apparently told that these people were passing for white and Granny came to visit them at their house and they were gone because they had to get out of town really quickly And they couldn t stay in the Augusta area because people knew that they had tried to do something that was really taboo and try to pass for white Um and so they just left town and she she never did see her sister again never saw her sister again Wow So it was just really interesting And you know the one thing that my my grandmother my grandmother she was so funny about this uh she uh she treated the children I mean her her her grandchildren differently based on the color of their skin But she treated the ones like us who were darker better Huh Than the ones who were lighter And actually when we we kind of began to understand what was going on because my cousins were a little lighter well they were somewhat lighter than we were and she would not treat them well and we couldn t figure it out what what was going on you know why you know we could get anything we wanted and she was very stern with them And uh my mother eventually told us you know Well she has this thing uh and you know just really and part of it has to do with her family and the fact that people you know uh when her sister tried to you know pass for white and thought she was better than everybody else and she kind of she thinks people who tried to pass for white think they re better than everybody else and light people think they re better than everybody else And the fact is she was light And that was the thing that was the thing that was so funny She was a light skinned black person And it was like she was rejecting who she was in some ways by you know the way she treated you know the other grandchildren Um but you know there were just a lot of mixed feelings involved and she had to deal with her feelings in her own but when I got older when I got to be an adult I actually talked to her about it I told her Granny you know you are so sweet to us but you are wrong about this you shouldn t be treating people differently because of that What did she say And she said at first Did she really kind of know she was doing it Yes she did Um and she said she said she said Baby she said You don t understand about life the way I understand about life But as she got older um she never acknowledged that she was wrong but she did change her behavior So Now this was the one who married at 16 and didn t Yeah yeah married my grandfather who who she was light and he was dark and I don t know whether that was the reason she married him although it was kind of like one of those arranged marriages Ah Where he was a he was a minister s son so he had they had property and stuff and they were very well connected in the community and very held in high esteem His father was like uh the guy who had been pastor of this big church for a long period of time and and and so I think her family the Tates really wanted to connect with the Keenes for that reason and so they just really just told her she was going to be marrying him And she didn t really understand She didn t even understand the marriage ceremony she didn t even know that she had gotten married really Wow And so when they told her she had to go home with this guy she said Go home with him He s old enough to be my daddy Well he was almost old enough to be her daddy Oh no And he was my grandfather was not a nice man He was nice enough to us My sister keeps telling me she says Sometimes you re just like Granny you treat people wrong for the wrong reasons And I did because I thought he treated I thought he treated uh my mother and some of the siblings not well in the family because he had pets and that all sort of thing not based on color of skin or anything but just based on I don t know on whatever anyway My my mother wound up not being one of his favorites early on and ah so she was relegated to working in the fields whereas some of the other kids didn t work in the fields I mean they only had like they had five children one of them died But they were divided about like who were the field hands and who were the house kids it was kind of Really Yeah it was almost like a plantation system That s interesting Yeah it was operating within the family He would have been born He was born in 1880 something like 188 I think it was 1889 I think it was when he was born No it was no he was older than that because my grandmother was born in 1900 and he was born 16 years earlier 1884 1884 yeah Hum But he was you know in a lot of ways just like a plantation owner s son because he was the son of this guy who owned a lot of property He had property And it was he never really had to do anything for himself And he was a philanderer an d oh yeah he was like out there And ah so you know I didn t like him but anyway those are my stories That s interesting There are many stories in the naked city You d be surprised All right Thank you You re very welcome
