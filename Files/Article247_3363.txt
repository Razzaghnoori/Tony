 The Final Word on Deep Throat So Far Today is the 25th anniversary of Richard Nixon s resignation speech To watch Nixon saying Therefore I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow click here You can hear it over and over by clicking repeatedly Chatterbox decided to celebrate Nixon Resignation Day by phoning W Mark Felt the former FBI official whom Richard Nixon and Nora Ephron and various other people believe to have been Deep Throat Chatterbox strongly influenced by a 1992 James Mann piece in the Atlantic Monthly which is finally online click here to read it has himself been fairly pro Felt lately and subscribes to Mann s thesis that if it wasn t Felt it was someone else at the FBI See Deep Throat The Game Is Afoot Another Bulletin From the Deep Throat Desk Deep Throat Revealed One Last Time and Deep Throat Revealed Again Earlier today when Chatterbox first attempted to phone Felt now an octogenarian living in California with his daughter Joan he got an answering machine If you d like to leave a message for Joan Rob Nick or Deep Throat it said you may do so after the beep Naturally Chatterbox got a little excited when he heard this But when Chatterbox phoned back a little later Joan Felt said it was a gag message that she had put on her phone last night after having a bottle of wine with some friends and that this morning she d thought better of it and taken it off Joan said she really has no idea whether her father is Deep Throat but that he s told her he isn t He hasn t revealed it to anybody if it s true she said Hmm Chatterbox thought A non denial denial from the daughter Then Mark Felt came on the line Chatterbox schmoozed Felt a bit Does he get asked a lot by reporters whether he s Deep Throat Yes A couple of times so far this week Are you Deep Throat The answer to that is yes and no I m the person that they re talking about Chatterbox was initially tantalized by this but quickly realized Felt meant I m the Mark Felt who worked at the FBI in 1972 I was involved very deeply in all that went on But I m not guilty of disclosure leaking it to the press or anything like that Did Felt arrange to leak to Woodward through an intermediary No Does Felt agree with Mann that the leaker was someone from the FBI Felt hasn t read the Mann piece but I don t think so It s just not logical The nature of the information that the paper was printing would have to have come from more than one source Chatterbox trying not to plead asked Felt if there were any other reason aside from Felt s actually not being Deep Throat that might impel him to deny he was Deep Throat No Felt said There wasn t The conversation seemed to be winding down Chatterbox asked Felt whether it was annoying to be asked over and over again by various people whether he was Deep Throat It gets to be very provoking he said Does he find it irritating Yes Chatterbox switched to the general topic of tension between the FBI and the White House at the time of J Edgar Hoover s death which occurred one month before the Watergate break in and according to Mann is why the FBI helped Woodward nail Nixon I don t think there was any serious tension Felt said Did he want the top job I certainly wouldn t have objected to getting the No 1 position Felt said Was he disappointed when he didn t get it I can t say that I was Didn t the White House interfere with the FBI investigation of Watergate I don t have any recollection of any specifics like that he said perhaps displaying an old man s poor memory the White House interference is now a matter of public record or perhaps displaying a George Smiley like implacability Felt is after all a former member of the G man elite Well what about Nixon s assertions on the White House tapes that Felt was leaking What about Nixon s anti Semitic comments about Felt Felt said he wasn t aware of either Chatterbox read Felt the exchange in which Nixon and H R Haldeman his chief of staff discussed their belief that Felt was leaking and in which Nixon said regarding Felt s high position at the FBI Christ put a Jew in there Click here and scroll down to the boldface type to read it Chatterbox asked Felt whether he d like to comment No Felt indicated he was starting to lose his patience with Chatterbox In talking with you and in talking with various people on the press and so forth it s really very annoying Let s just say you were Deep Throat Would that really be so terrible It would be terrible This would completely undermine the reputation that you might have as a loyal logical employee of the FBI It just wouldn t fit at all But a lot of people think Deep Throat is a hero for getting the truth out about Nixon and Watergate That s not my view at all It would be contrary to my responsibility as a loyal employee of the FBI to leak information In other words there is a potential reason other than not being Deep Throat that might impel Felt to say he wasn t Deep Throat the perceived dishonor such a revelation might bring Felt as a loyal employee of the FBI A Postscript On Nov 1 1980 Richard Nixon after avoiding testifying in twenty other courtrooms over the last six years writes Robert Sam Anson in Exile The Unquiet Oblivion of Richard M Nixon was on the stand in a criminal case The defendants were W Mark Felt and Edward S Miller former chief of the FBI s intelligence division accused of conspiring to violate the civil rights of members of the Weather Underground when they authorized warrantless break ins of the radicals homes the Weatherfolk were suspected of planting bombs in public buildings in 1972 and 1973 Nixon thought Felt was Deep Throat But Nixon was extremely eager to testify on Felt and Miller s behalf even though he hadn t been subpoenaed Having successfully and rather strenuously dodged prosecution himself Nixon had volunteered to walk into a courtroom and testify to help someone he believed had triggered his own downfall Felt and Miller s lawyers had turned Nixon down because they d worried that Nixon s reputation would only hurt Felt and Miller with the largely black jury The prosecution however had been delighted to have him Anson writes So Nixon appeared as a prosecution witness While Nixon took the oath Black Panthers and former antiwar activists shouted Thief and Liar called him a war criminal and were expelled by federal marshals from the courtroom This according to the third volume of Stephen Ambrose s Nixon biography Nixon Ruin and Recovery On the stand Nixon said that he thought the warrantless break ins were perfectly legal Although he wasn t asked under oath whether he d known of or approved them he d said earlier that he hadn t The president Nixon said had power to authorize such break ins and so did the FBI which was an arm of the executive branch Nixon said there had been hard evidence linking the Weather Underground to foreign governments Nixon said he himself had approved similar break ins under the 1970 Houston Plan which he said was also legal Nixon gave an impromptu lecture about a president s heavy burden during wartime I hope that neither President Carter or Governor Reagan if he should be president has to do what I had to do what Franklin Roosevelt had to do here the judge interrupted and told the prosecutor to ask his next question but Nixon went on what President Truman had to do that is write letters to people whose sons have been killed in war Possibly in part because of the jury s distaste for Nixon Felt and Miller were found guilty and sentenced to pay 5 000 and 3 500 respectively After Ronald Reagan who was elected president a few days later assumed the presidency he pardoned the two men It is almost too irresistible to wonder Did Nixon serve up his sympathetic testimony because he knew it would alienate the jury and give Deep Throat what he Nixon deemed his just deserts We know that Nixon was a revenge buff who was capable of extraordinarily Machiavellian behavior We also know that Nixon sincerely believed that warrantless break ins of the sort that Felt and Miller and under different circumstances Nixon himself had authorized were a necessary line of defense against radicals and troublemakers many of whom did indeed prove to be violent Which Nixon testified at Felt s trial the Nixon wanting to give Deep Throat a little payback or the Nixon who wanted to stand firm against The Punks Perhaps both
