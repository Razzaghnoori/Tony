 Book Behind the Oval Office Winning the Presidency in the Nineties by Dick Morris Random House To hear the critics bash him the former White House political adviser s entire life has been a dalliance with prostitution As a professional he was an amoral whore as a husband and a public figure he was done in by the thing itself then there s Behind the Oval Office The book is priced at 25 one eighth of prostitute Sherry Rowlands hourly fee and will give the author a chance to peddle his wares notes Jennifer Harper in the Washington Times Ad hominems are the order of the day Dick Morris s problems began early Like the day he was born says the Washington Post s Charlotte Hays The book is said to have its uses however It is a revealing book says the Weekly Standard s Andrew Ferguson though only unintentionally Morris descriptions of Clinton s temper tantrums says Ferguson make them sound like the kind normally associated with autistic children except in the president s case they are overlaid with self righteousness and megalomania The New York Times Richard Bernstein is just about the book s only fan We owe it to Mr Morris whose book is lively readable and anecdotally rich for his insider s account of the way the game is played Jacob Weisberg skewers the book in Slate Also check out the Random House page for the book which includes an excerpt Movie The Whole Wide World Sony Pictures Classics Critics see this biopic about Robert E Howard the author of the Conan the Barbarian stories as an occasion to wax confessional particularly on the subject of the writing life It s rare to see the basic conditions of a writer s existence the solitude the panic the neediness the unhealthy self absorption portrayed so starkly says The New Yorker s Terrence Rafferty The film touches on things of the mind and of the heart writing cultural hunger in rural America the roots of violence in art the mystery of personality says the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern Not everyone is charmed The Village Voice s Gary Dauphin complains that the film is mired in sentimental cutesiness I can dig the urge to know the man behind Conan s bulging biceps but I don t know if Wide World s annoying nutjob cum romantic misfit take on the subject was what I Howard or the world really needed Event The Inauguration of William Jefferson Clinton Washington D C Expectations were low second inaugurals are not supposed to top the first but reviews are negative nonetheless Rhetorically the speech is deemed to have been unsuccessful Presidential historian William Leuchtenburg was quoted by Todd Purdum in the New York Times as saying that it was the most banal address by an American President I have ever heard The problem says Purdum was that the president spent too much time pouring over past Presidential speeches and anthologies of poetry The upside was the speech s uncharacteristic brevity 22 minutes according to NBC s Tom Brokaw Reviews of inaugural pomp appearances by celebrities Jessye Norman Antonio Banderas and Hootie and the Blowfish as well as a parade range from outrage at the unseemly excess the Washington Post s Tom Shales to boredom though Norman s rendition of Amazing Grace was praised in the Post as stirring Television coverage struggled to make something out of nothing says Shales Directors of live historical events appear to think they are making documentaries about the events rather than transmitting them into American homes For more reactions to the inaugural see the Dispatches from Jacob Weisberg and Karenna Gore Book One World Ready or Not The Manic Logic of Global Capitalism by William B Greider Simon Schuster The latest manifesto from the Rolling Stone editor Who Will Tell the People condemns the globalization of markets and leads reviewers to reconsider their own enthusiasm for free trade Greider brings the global economic beast to life in all its splendor and horror Matthew Miller in the New York Times The passion of his polemic recalls Rousseau and Martin Luther Walter Russell Mead Foreign Affairs But few are persuaded by Greider s conclusions Critics have three main complaints 1 his shoddy economics see Paul Krugman in the Washington Post and in Slate 2 his tired prescriptions regulation taxation and protectionism 3 his continued bashing of the Federal Reserve Board a repetition of the theme of his 799 page Secrets of the Temple This is a book that graduate students and coffeehouse dissidents everywhere will enjoy says Mead Also see John Judis favorable review in Slate CD Idomeneo by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart performed by Placido Domingo and the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra and Chorus conducted by James Levine Deutsche Grammophon Placido Domingo s appearance on the package compellingly photographed in costume as the ancient King of Crete Anthony Tommasini the New York Times is the main selling point for this new recording of one of Mozart s more obscure operas a fact that does not make critics happy Mr Domingo is no Mozartean writes Tommasini He misses some of the lightness and agility demanded by florid passages But reviewers agree that the recording succeeds in spite of Domingo and in spite of James Levine s overblown conducting Alan Blyth the Daily Telegraph mainly because of the cast which includes soprano Cecilia Bartoli and Thomas Hampson F rom the moment Cecilia Bartoli s vibrant Idamante arrives on stage the performance takes wing her luscious tight vibrato perfectly capturing the adolescent trauma of the young prince says the Independent s Mark Pappenheim Movie Albino Alligator Miramax Has the post Tarrantino crime flick lost its charm Reviews of the latest one suggest the answer is yes Critics are unimpressed with first time director and Academy Award winner Kevin Spacey s attempts at stylishness particularly the relentless allusions to film noir The movie reeks of film student overkill Susan Wloszczyna USA Today It would only be allowed to ooz e out of Miramax s storeroom in the otherwise fallow month of January says the Village Voice s Amy Taubin I ts devices are too shopworn to allow for a personal or original point of view The New York Times Janet Maslin says the film works precisely because it is derivative its stars Matt Dillon and Gary Sinise emulate the characters in The Usual Suspects which gives them extraordinary opportunities to preen Miramax s site for Albino Alligator has video and stills Television The Naked Truth NBC ABC canceled this sitcom last year but NBC revived it and put it in the slot after Seinfeld and before ER Critics wonder whether the show can live up to its scheduling Will its star Tea Leoni Flirting With Disaster blossom into this generation s Lucille Ball David Bianculli the New York Daily News Are her comic skills on a par with her sex appeal W hen she does a wobbly fall in a tight skirt and heels it s like the moment in Bambi when the little deer fumbles and skitters across a patch of ice says Ken Tucker in Entertainment Weekly Or is the show dreary and clich ridden The New York Times Caryn James calls the first episode dangerously lame Shales in the Washington Post says NBC has recycled garbage and gotten only new garbage in return He suggests another title The Ugly Truth NBC plugs the show at its site Updates In the New York Review of Books Oxford Professor of Poetry James Fenton attacks The New Yorker s Adam Gopnik for attacking John Richardson s biography of Picasso and for attacking Picasso himself The man in the long skirt with the cloche hat doling out these white feathers to artists of the past and hitting them over the head with his parasol is Adam Gopnik As so often with Gopnik the bad style leads the sense by the nose In The New Yorker Gary Wills a classicist by training praises Robert Fagles translation of The Odyssey Fagles is the best living translator of ancient Greek drama lyric poetry and epic into modern English and The Odyssey is his finest work so far He attributes its success to feminism or more specifically to its entry into the psychological subtlety with which Homer presents women The Weekly Standard s Philip Terzian on Walter Cronkite s memoirs Anyone tempted to romanticize the American people should be reminded that for nearly twenty years the most trusted man in America was a TV news reader with a mustache and
