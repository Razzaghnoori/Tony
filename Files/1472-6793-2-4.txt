 Background Tetraethylammonium is known as a pore occluding blocker of voltage gated potassium channels 1 but it also blocks other cationic channels such as calcium dependent K channels 2 3 and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor 4 TEA at 0 1 to 10 mM also inhibits osmotic water flux through human AQP1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes decreasing the net swelling rate in hypotonic saline by 30 40 as compared to AQP1 expressing oocytes not treated with TEA 5 This blocking effect on osmotic water flux was demonstrated to involve AQP1 channels specifically by using site directed mutagenesis tyrosine 186 to phenylalanine to generate a Y186F AQP1 channel that is insensitive to block by TEA but retains sensitivity to block by mercury The blocking effect of mercury in AQP1 channels is dependent on a neighboring residue cysteine 189 6 TEA offers attractive advantages over mercury as a reversible and less toxic blocker for AQP1 channels in experimental analyses of water channel function however the relevance of TEA as a blocker for AQP1 channels outside the Xenopus expression system has not been examined previously Differences in properties including pharmacological sensitivities have been observed for ion channels expressed in oocytes as compared to those in native tissues For example the Torpedo acetylcholine receptor and the Shaker K channel protein differ in the fractions of protein glycosylated the composition of the oligosaccharide chains and the degree of protein maturation when expressed in Xenopus oocytes as compared with channels in native tissue or other expression systems 7 8 Differences in glycosylation patterns can influence the binding of external blocking agents The presence of tissue specific targeting signals not recognized in Xenopus oocytes may lead to protein degradation 9 These discrepancies raised the question of whether AQP1 channels in native tissues are sensitive to TEA as they are in Xenopus oocytes Data presented here show that TEA is effective as a blocker of AQP1 channels expressed in a mammalian renal cell line and in native renal epithelial membrane AQP1 channels are complex solute conductors They are constitutively permeable to water and also function as regulated non selective cation channels 10 when gated by intracellular cyclic GMP 11 12 Even though only a small proportion of the AQP1 channels that are present in the membrane appear to be available for cGMP activation of the ionic conductance 1 56 000 model based calculations nonetheless suggest that this contribution could be meaningful in a physiological setting 13 Unlike transporters which move substantial amounts of substrate by design ion channels function to change membrane potential by the net movement of relatively tiny amounts of charge 10 picomoles per cm 2membrane to generate a change of 100 mV 14 hence the low proportion of active AQP1 ion channels is consistent with a functional goal of gated ionic signaling that is distinct from that of massive constitutive osmotic water permeability The role of the AQP1 channel in mediating both water and ion fluxes raises interesting questions about whether the pathways are shared or structurally distinct Expression of AQP1 channels in bilayers has shown that the water permeability but not the ionic conductance is blocked by p chloromethylbenzenesulfonate indicating that the two fluxes may involve distinct pathways 12 Work presented here provides an additional line of evidence that the pathways for water and ions in AQP1 can be distinguished pharmacologically using the blocker TEA as a probe In combination with data from three dimensional imaging analyses 15 these results support the suggestion that the AQP1 channel may contain separate parallel pathways for ion and water fluxes These findings have potential significance in understanding the complex role for AQP1 in processes of salt and water movement across cell membranes Results and Discussion TEA inhibition of water flux in AQP1 expressing MDCK cells TEA inhibited significantly the osmotically driven net movement of water across monolayers of Madin Darby Canine Kidney MDCK cells expressing human AQP1 as compared to AQP1 infected MDCK cells without TEA treatment Figure 1 MDCK cells were induced to express AQP1 by infection with replication deficient adenovirus see Materials and Methods These cells showed a high rate of water flux ranging from 4 to 10 l cm 2 hour and a significant block by 1 mM TEA ranging from 32 to 45 in 6 sets of replicate experiments The TEA block of AQP1 mediated water flux for all data combined was 34 2 In control MDCK cells infected with empty virus the water flux was significantly lower approximately 10 fold ranging from 0 2 to 1 4 l cm 2 hour In these control cells the net flux rates with and without treatment were not significantly different Therefore the enhanced water permeability and concomitant sensitivity to block by TEA were dependent on the expression of AQP1 channels MDCK cells transfected with empty virus showed no augmentation of transepithelial water movement confirming previous work that showed water does not flow across tight junctions in MDCK confluent layers 16 Cells transfected with empty virus also showed no effect of TEA treatment The magnitude of block of AQP1 mediated water permeability by TEA is consistent with that reported previously for AQP1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes 5 TEA inhibition of water flux in renal tubule Preparations of pure descending thin limbs and pure ascending thin limbs from the inner medulla were segregated by morphological features Descending thin limbs with their cells with nuclei protruding into the lumen differ markedly in appearance from ascending thin limbs with their large round flat nuclei when viewed with DIC optics 17 18 The differential expression of AQP1 in the two different types of segments abundant in the descending thin limb and absent in the ascending thin limb visualized by immunocytochemistry confirmed the accuracy of the morphological identification Figure 2 AQP1 provides the predominant pathway for water transport in the descending thin limb 19 20 In preparations of isolated perfused descending thin limbs net osmotic water absorption rates J v and water permeability P f were significantly lower in the presence of 10 mM TEA than in the absence of TEA Figure 3 This sensitivity to TEA correlates with the expression of AQP1 channels in this region The overall effect of TEA in descending thin limb was to cause a 49 block of J V and a 50 block of P f The pairwise comparison of individual tubule preparations before and after TEA showed a significant percent change of 52 6 mean SEM n 10 in descending thin limb In contrast preparations of ascending thin limbs that lack AQP1 channels showed essentially no net water flux and no effect of TEA under osmotic gradient conditions For data from ascending thin limbs the pairwise comparison of individual tubule preparations before and after TEA showed a non significant percent change of 17 35 n 9 These data show that the blocking effect of TEA on water permeability originally observed in AQP1 expressing oocytes can be reproduced in a physiologically relevant condition TEA blocks water permeability in a tissue that has abundant native expression of AQP1 channels whereas it has no effect in tissue lacking AQP1 expression Lack of TEA block of ion channel conductance Heterologous expression of human AQP1 in Xenopus oocytes a system that has been well characterized for electrophysiological assays was used for two electrode voltage clamp studies to evaluate the effects of TEA on ionic currents External TEA 10 mM failed to block the cGMP dependent ionic current in AQP1 expressing oocytes Figure 4 Current responses were assessed with voltage steps from 40 to 70 mV from a holding potential of 0 mV Fig 4A The initial response shows the current voltage relationship recorded by two electrode voltage clamp in an AQP1 expressing oocyte in isotonic 100 mM Na saline see Methods The activated response was measured in the same oocyte at 3 5 minutes after addition of 4 mM sodium nitroprusside SNP which elevates endogenous cGMP levels The effect of 10 mM TEA with 90 mM NaCl was assessed by perfusing the recording chamber with TEA saline containing SNP No appreciable change was observed For the representative example shown in Figure 4 the conductance measured as the linear slope of the current voltage relationship between 50 and 30 mV Fig 4B for the initial condition was 3 0 nA mV After channel activation the conductance was 58 nA mV in Na saline and 57 nA mV in 10 mM TEA saline The reversal potential of the current Fig 4B shifted from approximately 24 mV in the initial state to about 4 mV in the activated state consistent with the activation of a non selective cationic conductance permeable to both Na and K Similar results were observed for other SNP activated oocytes n 5 as well as for AQP1 expressing oocytes activated by prior incubation in 10 mM 8Br cGMP as described in 11 In AQP1 expressing oocytes the conductance induced by 8Br cGMP in control Na saline did not change significantly 11 6 6 2 mean SD n 7 after perfusion with 10 mM TEA saline thus confirming the absence of a blocking effect of TEA on the ion conductance by AQP1 channels The activated AQP1 ion channel is less permeant to TEA than to Na or K 10 however because of the high extracellular Na concentration 90 mM in the TEA bath saline in the present study the measured reversal potential of the activated current was not appreciably different with and without 10 mM TEA Results presented here show that TEA serves as an effective though partial blocker of the osmotic water permeability mediated by human AQP1 channels expressed in a heterologous mammalian cell line and by native AQP1 channels in isolated rat renal descending thin limbs of Henle s loops Before the characterization of TEA mercurial compounds were among the only known blockers of AQP1 affecting both the constitutive water flux and the regulated ion conductance 6 10 For AQP1 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes the block of osmotic water flux is 5 in 0 01 mM TEA 21 in 1 mM TEA and 36 in 10 mM TEA as referenced to the osmotic water flux in control AQP1 expressing oocytes 5 Data presented here show that the level of block by TEA is comparable or greater for AQP1 channels expressed in mammalian cells 1 mM TEA produces a 34 block of osmotic water flux in MDCK cells and 10 mM TEA produces a 50 block in renal descending thin limbs The effect of TEA on water permeability in cells and tissues that express high levels of AQP1 channels is likely to be significant given the substantial amount of water that can be moved across AQP1 expressing epithelia for example see data on descending thin limbs in Fig 3 The idea that TEA might be a candidate for a lead compound for the development of drugs with possible clinical applications 5 is supported by the present data that show the effectiveness of TEA in two different mammalian models of AQP1 mediated osmotic water permeability While the usefulness of TEA in vivo as a research tool may be limited by toxicity and effects on other channels at higher concentrations it offers a degree of reversibility and selectivity not seen with mercury an agent which acts by covalent modification of all exposed cysteine residues 21 22 The regulated ion channel function of AQP1 is not blocked by external TEA An intriguing question remains regarding the location of the permeation pathway for cations in AQP1 channels Analysis of the crystal structure of GlpF suggests that potential ion binding sites may be located in the central pore at the four fold axis of symmetry in the tetrameric association of subunits that form the channel 15 Interestingly this arrangement of a tetramer of subunits to form a central ion pore is a hallmark of the family of voltage gated ion channels 23 which rely on a tetrameric organization to create a central pore for ions that is lined by sequences contributed from all four subunits In contrast the four individual pores for water or glycerol located within each subunit of AQP1 or GlpF appear to be lined with hydrophobic residues expected to preclude ion permeability 15 24 25 Importantly TEA distinguishes between the two pathways in AQP1 supporting the idea that the ion and water pores are physically distinct although they co exist in the same channel complex The AQP1 mediated ion conductance may contribute measurably to the function of tissues in which AQP1 is abundantly expressed such as in the mammalian renal proximal tubule 13 Further work is needed to assess the additional levels of regulatory control that may constrain the availability of the AQP1 proteins to serve as ion channels gated by cGMP within a background of constitutive water channel activity The maintenance of an ionic pore as well as a conserved cGMP binding domain in the AQP1 carboxy tail for regulating activation 11 suggests that the ion channel function is likely to be essential for physiological regulatory processes that have yet to be fully appreciated Materials and Methods MDCK cells Cell culture Madin Darby Canine Kidney MDCK cells were obtained as a gift from

for use in our laboratory 17 32 33 The perfusion rate was about 15 20 nl min The temperature of the bathing chamber was maintained at 37 C during perfusion and the bath was covered with a layer of light paraffin oil To check for leaks and to measure net fluid movement across the epithelium with an imposed osmotic gradient 14C dextran MW 70 000 was added to the perfusate Determination of net water movement and water permeability of thin limbs perfused in vitro There is no net transepithelial water movement with solutions of identical osmolalities in the bath and lumen For this study however we determined the occurrence of net water absorption and water permeability when we imposed an osmotic gradient from bath to lumen see below Net water absorption J v nl min 1mm tubule length 1 was determined in each collection period with 14C dextran in the perfusate using the following relationship J v V i V o L In this equation V i initial perfusion rate nl min is calculated by dividing the cpm of 14C in the collected fluid by the cpm nl of 14C in the initial perfusate and by the time of the collection period V o collection rate nl min is measured directly from the collection and L mm is the length of the tubule perfused measured with an ocular micrometer For purposes of determining the water permeability of DTL and ATL we imposed a 100 mOsmol kg H 2 O osmotic gradient from bath to lumen with sucrose and determined J v as just described Water permeability P f m s 1 was then determined from the equation P f J v A s V w C osmol where A s luminal surface area DL V w partial
