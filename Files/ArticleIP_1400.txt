ignored the brain transplant story Scientists point out that transplanting animal tissue into human embryos is far more imminent than human cloning Researchers in Boston are already implanting fetal pig cells in the brains of Parkinson s disease patients The Associated Press raised the specter of people with socially unacceptable behavior being forced to undergo brain surgery 3 7 Rebels holding hostages at a diplomat s house in Peru broke off talks with the government They claim that police are preparing to storm the building by digging a tunnel under the house Peruvian officials say that

House soliciting donations The report prompted further calls for an independent counsel on the grounds that a high government official Gore had violated the law by making political calls from a federal building Editorialists derided Gore s response that the law doesn t apply to him Gore and Clinton suggested that their end getting re elected and thereby helping the United States justified their means using the White House to raise money Democrats also released records showing that Vice President Dan Quayle had used his official residence for a reception for high dollar Republican donors in 1990 Pundits are bewailing the shattering of their faith that Gore was the One Honest Man in the administration The betting now is that he s in for a stiff primary challenge in 2000 3 5 New disclosures in the scandal 1 The New York Times reported that Webster Hubbell was paid far more money in the months after his resignation than had been previously thought much of it from Clinton s friends and donors and that the administration endorsed a project in China that was financially important to the Riady family just after a Riady controlled company put Hubbell on its payroll Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr has subpoenaed White House records evidently to find out whether the Riady controlled Lippo Group paid hush money to Hubbell to prevent him from cooperating with the Whitewater probe 2 Hillary Rodham Clinton s chief of staff accepted a 50 000 check to the Democratic National Committee in the White House from an alleged hustler deeply embroiled

illegal activities not soft money 2 Attorney General Janet Reno concluded that laws prohibiting political fund raising in federal buildings apply only to direct campaign contributions not to soft

Administration officials confirmed that Clinton was deliberately 1 rolling out the carpet to enhance Arafat s prestige and 2 sending Israel a warning not to screw up the peace process by provoking

player in the peace process 3 5 The balanced budget constitutional amendment failed as expected The Senate voted 66 34 in favor of it one vote shy of the two thirds majority needed 3 5 The Dallas

now confirmed that the defense team s private eye told him of the fake confession a year ago The executive editor of the Morning News dismissed the fabrication theory as ad hoc damage control 3 5 The Immigration and Naturalization Service pressured by the White House rushed immigrants through naturalization last year and ended up granting citizenship to hundreds if not thousands of people who

Gore s office and was driven in part by hopes of registering new Democratic voters 3 5 Scientists have identified another obesity gene The gene creates UCP2 a protein that determines whether an animal
