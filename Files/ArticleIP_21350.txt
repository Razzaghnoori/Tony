 Larry Levis Visits Easton Pa During a November Freeze Click here to visit Poet Laureate Robert Pinsky s Favorite Poem Project To hear Gerald Stern read this poem click I said Dear Larry as I put down his book Elegy across the street from the Home Energy Center and its two embellished secular Christmas trees and its two red wreaths over red ribbon crosses enshrining a thirty inch stove in one of its windows and a fifty gallon water heater in the other knowing how wise he would have been with the parking lot and the tree that refused against all odds and all sane agreements and codicils to let its dead leaves for God s sake fall in some kind of trivial decency and how he would have stopped with me always beside him to watch a girl in a white fur parka and boots build the first snowball on Northampton Street she collected from the hood of a Ford Fairlane underneath that tree and throw it she thought at a small speed limit sign although it landed with a fluff just shy of the twin painted center lines inducing the three of us her lover Larry and I to make our own snowballs from the hoods and fenders of our own Fairlanes although she threw like none of us and to add to it she was left handed so bless her may she have a good job and children and always be free of cancer and may the two of us scrape some roofs before the rain relieves us and may we find gloves for our labor
