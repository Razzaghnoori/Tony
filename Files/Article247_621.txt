 Rocks and Hard Places USA Today and the Washington Post lead with a federal appeals court ruling that Secret Service agents are not relieved from testifying before Kenneth Starr s grand jury by any so called protective function privilege The story is also the New York Times s off lead The USAT headline Secret Service Staff Must Testify couldn t be straighter The NYT s adds mention of the Lewinsky case And the Post s highlights the political angle Starr Wins An Appeal on Privilege The Los Angeles Times in its front page story on the decision high up and succinctly describes the significance moving Starr one step closer to obtaining testimony from perhaps the last impartial and credible witnesses in his investigation The NYT goes with the death after suddenly taking ill while meeting with U S envoys of Nigeria s most prominent political prisoner Moshood Abiola The Nigerian government has promised a full and prompt autopsy The story is the WP s off lead The LAT leads with the conviction of a 19 year old Ukrainian immigrant gangbanger for the murder of Bill Cosby s son The Cosby story also grabs the talker slot on the USAT top front and runs above the NYT fold The WP puts it inside The LAT runs the Cosby story big including a front page picture of defendant Mikail Markhasev looking back at the Cosby family members who were in court Bill Cosby wasn t there as his fate was announced The story also has the most details from the trial evidence such as running quotes from Markhasev s jailhouse letters to another inmate in which he says that he went to kill a drug dealer who wasn t home and then came upon Ennis Cosby fixing a flat tire and details about how the informant who turned Markhasev in to get a 100 000 National Enquirer reward testified that the defendant told him he d killed Cosby The NYT says the informant testified that Markhasev had said he shot a black man while the WP says the testimony was I killed a racial epithet The LAT renders the confession thus I shot the n The Wall Street Journal reports that the new 217 billion federal highway program may have a problem with the construction trades already stretched tight new workers to carry it out may be hard to find Another problem noted by USAT in its front page cover story is that new highway construction is apt to raise to epidemic proportions an already high accident rate among rock quarry workers This could be avoided the paper notes by a few hours of training for new hires But there s a catch federal law prohibits enforcing safety training rules at quarries This brute fact is reminiscent of the paper s recent story about how you can t sue your HMO The provision has been kept in place says the story by a stone industry that gives millions to congressional campaigns The WSJ flags its Motorola earnings story with Motorola Surprises Analysts Posting Slim Operating Profit while the WP goes the other way with Motorola Reports Earnings Plunge 2nd Quarter Operating Profit Negligible Today s Papers is sentencing itself to the Dept of Corrections for two recent infractions 1 Yesterday s column asserted that since running a story about a Pakistani claiming to have inside knowledge of his country s nuclear war plans against India USAT has not revisited the story even though both the NYT and WP have reported that the man is likely a fraud In fact the paper has run two stories reporting on the erosion of the man s credibility The stories ran inside but during a visit to the USAT newsroom Today s Papers was assured that if and when the paper issues a full retraction it will appear as per USAT policy on the front page where the original story ran 2 Last week TP stated that Bill and Hillary have never owned a home Several real estate oriented readers have pointed out that this is not true for a few years in the early 80s they did Yesterday the NYT editorialized that it was inconceivable that Roy Rogers and John Wayne ever appear in the same movie Today the paper admits it is conceivable because it s actual the two starred together in Dark Command
