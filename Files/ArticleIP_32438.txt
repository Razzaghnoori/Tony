 Go to Hell In his current Slate column David Greenberg compares George W Bush and John Quincy Adams John Q as he was not known is the only president s son so far to become president himself Historian Greenberg finds many parallels but some differences For example Q suffered a lifelong case of clinical depression whereas W has come to believe that all Jews are bound for hell While the parallel is unclear these are certainly two different things As someone who has based on circumstantial evidence such as his bar mitzvah I found this latter datum especially interesting And of course it is remarkable to learn that George W has actual opinions on any subject let alone strong and controversial ones Unless you re a political junkie or live in Texas you may have missed this story The press have reported it but not with the neurotic intensity you might expect Why not Conservative press critics often complain that the media ignore the importance of religion This may be a case in point though not one those critics are likely to complain about Second there is the inoculation phenomenon Once a story has been done editors and producers don t want to do it again So getting it done small is protection against finding it done big Finally there may be a feeling among journalists that the whole thing s a bum rap Which it is and it isn t There s no evidence that George W is an anti Semite After college he was even engaged briefly to a half Jewish woman Some have suggested that Bush may have dumped her because her father was Jewish but there s no reason to think he didn t know that all along if he cared so the episode weighs in against the anti Semitism charge not for it Bush has had many Jewish business partners and friends If he believes they re all going to hell he hasn t held it against them in this life So what does he believe Like the Gospel tales themselves the story of Bush s views on Jews has several variants In 1993 discussing his decision around age 40 to accept Christ as his personal savior Bush told a Houston Post reporter that as the reporter paraphrased it heaven is open only to those who accept Jesus Christ So at worst Bush never condemned Jews specifically to hell specifically but rather condemned most of humanity anyone who doesn t accept Christ to what may be depending on your point of view a wider geographical area anywhere outside heaven I m not sure if that s better or worse Here s where the gospels differ According to Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard Bush says his mother then called Billy Graham to straighten him out Graham advised him to never play God by ruling on who gets into heaven But according to Sam Howe Verhovek of the New York Times Bush says Graham s intervention occurred earlier during an informal theological discussion at the Bush Sr White House And according to Ken Herman of the Austin American Statesman Bush actually made his 1993 comment in the course of recounting the Graham episode In this version the evangelist s advice was slightly different Graham generally agreed with the theory but cautioned against spending much time worrying about it Bush said So where does this leave us If Billy Graham actually convinced Bush long beforehand that we don t know who gets into heaven then the Houston Post report of 1993 was flat out wrong and Bush didn t believe Jews were shut out of heaven even at the time But Bush has never denied the accuracy of the reporter s paraphrase Nor needless to say has he adopted Version 2 of Graham s advice by declaring that Jews won t get into heaven but he s too busy to care Bush now answers all questions on the subject of heaven and its admission requirements with this catechistic formulation It is not the governor s role to decide who goes to heaven I believe that God decides who goes to heaven not George W Bush This won t do I m afraid It was good enough to get him a kosher certification from the Anti Defamation League but it makes no sense No one is asking Bush to decide or rule on who gets into heaven We can stipulate that God decides Some people most Jews for example believe in God but not in heaven Few if any people believe in heaven but not in God The issue is whether God has an admissions policy that excludes Jews and whether George W has an opinion about what that policy might be Surely he does My faith tells me that acceptance of Jesus Christ as my savior is my salvation and I believe that Bush says Does he think that this principle only applies to him Does he think that it s possible for others to achieve salvation without accepting Christ Even nonrecruiting religions such as Judaism claim to be more than just a personal taste or preference Born again Christianity claims to be the right answer to the most fundamental questions So how can Jews possibly get into heaven without converting Only two ways that I can see One is if God allows exemptions But to avoid offending any religious or nonreligious group the exception would have to be that anyone who does not accept Christ need not accept Christ which would destroy the rule The other way out would be if the entire belief system permits doubt about itself for example if it s only 50 50 that accepting Christ is mandatory for salvation for anybody including George W himself Neither of these conditions applies to George W s faith as he describes it And so what Why should anyone care whether he or she will achieve salvation by the terms of someone else s religion What difference does it make if you can t get into a heaven you don t believe in As a nonbeliever I find the conventions of ecumenism baffling I don t want to tell you people how to run your religions And obviously we want to avoid an outbreak of religious war or even lesser forms of intolerance if possible But why does tolerance require people to pretend they don t believe what they do Wouldn t tolerance be easier if it only required agreement to disagree peacefully rather than demanding actual sharing of religious doctrines at some level of abstraction After all if Bush really believes that accepting Jesus is the only path to salvation he is pulling a pretty dirty trick on Jews by telling them otherwise Putting votes before souls Talk about political expediency George W is lying either when he professes his faith or when he denies its implications Or he hasn t really thought it through which itself would cast doubt on the depth of his faith But I doubt this particular dishonesty will keep him out of heaven since it is imposed on every politician and even every clergyman with ambitions To be sure there is a certain joy in watching a pol caught in pandering gridlock Bush plays up his born again faith to the religious right He uses it even more than bona fide Christian right pols do as Fred Barnes points out in order to allay suspicions that he may be moderate or indifferent on social issues Then he has to fudge his faith so that people who don t share it won t take it seriously And if he gets this balancing act wrong he must pander even more furiously to make it up Going for a twofer a couple of years ago Bush confided to Washington political columnist Andrew Glass that he enjoys hanging out with country music singer can you guess well obviously Kinky Friedman who wrote uh oh They Ain t Making Jews Like Jesus Anymore Does W agree with this sentiment Does he have some problem with the quality of Jews being produced in America today
