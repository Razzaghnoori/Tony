 Background The cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p27 Kip1plays an important role in regulating cell cycle progression by inhibiting the cyclin Cdk complexes responsible for promoting the transition from G1 phase to S phase 1 2 In normal cells p27 Kip1levels are high in GO and decrease rapidly in late G1 allowing entry into S phase 3 4 p27 Kip1has also been implicated as playing a role in tumor formation and progression p27 Kip1knockout mice display internal organ hyperplasia and are highly prone to pituitary adenomas 5 6 7 In human cancers such as breast 8 prostate 9 colorectal 10 and others low levels of p27 Kip1expression correlate with decreased survival rates Since mutations of the p27 Kip1gene are rare in cancer cells 11 loss of p27 Kip1must involve changes in the mechanisms that control its expression Changes in the levels of cellular p27 Kip1are regulated by multiple mechanisms In general transcriptional control of the p27 Kip1gene is believed to play a minor role in regulating p27 Kip1expression However recent reports indicate that transcription of the p27 Kip1gene can be activated by neuronal differentiation 12 treatment with vitamin D3 13 14 interferon and cytokines 15 16 17 and exposure to hypoxic conditions 18 or xenobiotics 19 Transcription of the p27 Kip1gene can be negatively regulated by growth factors 20 and by c Myc 21 Some of the growth factor and cytokine effects on p27 Kip1transcription may be mediated by the forkhead family of transcription factors that appear to be regulated downstream of the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase signaling pathway 22 23 24 25 The use of alternative promoters leading to multiple transcription start sites as reported here suggests an additional type of transcriptional control Post transcriptional controls appear to be the major regulatory mechanisms that determine the levels of p27 Kip1in the cell 26 These include ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation 27 and sequestration and mislocalization 28 of the p27 Kip1protein In addition changes in the rate of p27 Kip1mRNA translation have been shown to be important in regulating cellular p27 Kip1levels The rate of p27 Kip1mRNA translation is higher in quiescent cells than in growth factor stimulated cells 3 p27 Kip1translation is also enhanced during differentiation of HL60 cells 29 Recent studies have shown that elements within the 5 untranslated region 5 UTR of the p27 Kip1mRNA are able to enhance translational efficiency 30 31 and several proteins that bind to the 5 UTR have been identified 31 The mouse p27 Kip15 UTR has recently been shown to be able to mediate cap independent initiation of translation 30 In addition a U rich element within the p27 Kip15 UTR may be involved in regulating p27 Kip1mRNA stability 32 Together these findings clearly demonstrate the importance of the 5 UTR in controlling cellular p27 Kip1levels However from the work published to date it is not clear what sequences constitute the full p27 Kip15 UTR in either human or mouse The 5 end of the UTR is determined by the site of transcription initiation and several papers have reported putative p27 Kip1transcription initiation sites In mouse Kwon et al 33 reported a major transcription start site 200 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon They also reported a second transcription initiation site 253 nucleotides upstream of the start codon In contrast Zhang and Lin 34 reported that the mouse p27 Kip1transcription start site is 500 nucleotides upstream of the start codon They found no evidence for the downstream initiation sites reported by Kwon et al 33 The gene sequences upstream of the p27 Kip1start codon including the putative promoter regions are highly conserved between mouse and human However it has been reported that the p27 Kip1transcription start site in human cells is only 153 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon 31 35 In contrast to these findings Ito et al 36 reported multiple start sites in the region from 403 to 479 nucleotides upstream of the AUG as well as minor sites 280 and 273 nucleotides upstream of the AUG Thus for both mouse and human p27 Kip1genes there are discrepancies between the reported transcription start sites In addition despite the high level of conservation in p27 Kip1gene sequences the reports in the literature show no correlation between mouse and human initiation sites which would result in very different 5 UTRs in the final p27 Kip1mRNAs Given the importance of the 5 UTR in governing p27 Kip1levels and the disparity among the reports described above we felt it necessary to further investigate the p27 Kip1gene transcription initiation sites We have used a method that accurately identifies the capped 5 end of mRNAs together with RNase protection assays Our data indicate that the major transcription start site is at exactly the same sequence in mouse and human cells and that transcription initiation from this site produces a p27 Kip15 UTR of 502 nucleotides in mouse and 472 nucleotides in human These findings represent important sequence information relevant to studies being done on both transcriptional and post transcriptional control of p27 Kip1levels Results Determination of transcription initiation sites using RNA ligase mediated rapid amplification of 5 cDNA ends 5 RLM RACE To identify transcription initiation sites RLM RACE was performed This method has a major advantage over other methods of mapping transcription start sites such as primer extension nuclease protection assays or traditional 5 RACE in that only authentic capped 5 ends of mRNAs are detected The first step in RLM RACE is treatment of the RNA sample with phosphatase This removes the 5 phosphate from incomplete mRNA fragments and from non mRNAs eliminating their ability to participate in subsequent ligation reactions In the second step of the procedure the 7 methylguanosine cap of mRNAs is removed using a pyrophosphatase that leaves a 5 phosphate group These full length decapped mRNAs are thus the only RNA molecules that can be ligated to an RNA oligonucleotide adapter in the next step of the procedure Finally the RNAs are reverse transcribed followed by PCR amplification using a gene specific primer and a primer homologous to the RNA oligonucleotide adapter This procedure was carried out using total RNA from the mouse NIH 3T3 cell line the non transformed human MRC5 cell line and the human breast cancer line MCF7 The initial PCR was performed using a primer complimentary to the p27 Kip1mRNA sequence just upstream of the AUG start codon see Figs 1Band 2C together with the adapter primer Nested PCR was then performed using the first PCR product as a template and the gene specific primers indicated in Figs 1Band 2C The nested PCR products were then cloned and sequenced In mouse three bands were obtained after the 5 RACE nested PCR reaction Fig 1A with estimated sizes of 200 250 and 500 base pairs with the 500 base pair band being the most intense Cloning and sequencing of these PCR products revealed three different DNA sequences each preceded by a sequence corresponding to the RNA oligonucleotide adapter and thus representing authentic cap sites These sites map to 200 253 and 502 nucleotides upstream of the ATG translation start codon in the mouse p27 Kip1gene Fig 1B When the RLM RACE procedure was performed using RNA from the non transformed human MRC5 cell line a single major band of approximately 480 base pairs was observed after the initial PCR reaction Fig 2A With the human MCF7 breast cancer cell line two bands of approximately 480 and 400 base pairs were observed Fig 2A Nested PCR confirmed these bands and revealed several faint bands of various sizes Fig 2B Direct cloning of the RLM RACE products followed by sequencing demonstrated that the major mRNA cap site in MRC5 cells is 472 nucleotides upstream of the AUG Fig 2C For MCF7 cap sites were observed at 472 and 403 nucleotides upstream of the AUG start codon By gel purifying DNA fragments from the faint bands obtained after the nested PCR reactions and then reamplifying it was possible to obtain additional clones These presumably correspond to minor start sites that map to 677 316 and 289 nucleotides upstream of the p27 Kip1start codon in MCF7 cells Using this procedure for MRC5 cells we were able to detect a minor cap site 403 nucleotides upstream of the AUG Determination of transcription initiation sites using ribonuclease protection The RLM RACE procedure identifies authentic transcription start sites but does not provide a quantitative measure of the efficiency at which the various sites are used To verify the results of the RLM RACE and to provide a measure of transcription start site usage an RNase protection assay was employed Labeled antisense RNA probes were made by in vitro transcription using the cDNA sequence of the most abundant longer transcripts identified by 5 RLM RACE as a template The human probe was 535 nucleotides in length consisting of p27 Kip1sequences from 17 to 472 nucleotides upstream of the AUG with the remaining 79 nucleotides derived from non p27 Kip1sequences The mouse probe was 565 nucleotides in length and included p27 Kip1sequences from 17 to 502 nucleotides upstream of the AUG The labeled probes were hybridized with total RNA from various sources followed by digestion with RNase and analysis of the protected RNAs on denaturing acrylamide gels Using either NIH 3T3 Fig 3A or mouse liver Fig 3B RNA for the RNase protection assay resulted in a single predominant band with an estimated size of 480 nucleotides Figs 3Aand 3B arrows This corresponds to the distal cap site detected by RLM RACE 502 nucleotides upstream of the AUG Very faint bands of approximately 190 and 230 nucleotides Figs 3Aand 3B brackets were also detected and these correspond to the other two cap sites mapped by RLM RACE Using NIH 3T3 RNA an additional faint band of approximately 350 nucleotides Fig 3A arrowhead was detected This band does not correspond to any known transcription start site The various protected fragments were quantified by densitometry After correction for length the major band at 480 nucleotides represents 50 6 of p27 Kip1mRNAs in NIH3T3 cells and 81 25 in mouse liver The other protected bands represent approximately equal proportions of the remaining p27 Kip1mRNA population RNase protection assays were performed using RNA from three separate human cell lines MRC5 MCF7 and BT20 For all three lines a single band of approximately 450 nucleotides was observed Fig 4 arrow This corresponds to the major transcription initiation site 472 nucleotides upstream of the ATG as identified by RLM RACE Conclusions In mouse it was previously reported that the major transcription initiation site for p27 Kip1is 200 nucleotides upstream of the start codon with a minor start site 253 nucleotides upstream of the ATG 33 We also detected transcription start sites 200 and 253 nucleotides upstream of the ATG but have shown that these are only rarely used The RLM RACE and RNase protection assays described here show that the overwhelming majority of mouse p27 Kip1transcripts are initiated at a position 502 nucleotides upstream of the ATG This is true for both mouse liver and NIH 3T3 cells Zhang and Lin 34 using nuclease protection assays estimated the mouse p27 Kip1start site to be 495 nucleotides upstream of the ATG start codon Our results agree with these investigators but precisely position the start site 502 nucleotides upstream of the AUG In human cell lines the major transcription initiation site is 472 nucleotides upstream of the ATG Both RNase protection assays and RLM RACE Figs 2and 4 demonstrate this This site exactly equates to the major transcription start site in mouse Fig 5 Using RLM RACE we were also able to detect minor cap sites in human cells An initiation site 403 nucleotides upstream of the ATG was easily identified in MCF7 human breast cancer cells Fig 2 and a significant portion of the initial clones were derived from RNAs capped at this site In contrast 100 of the initial clones from the RLM RACE procedure using the non transformed human MRC5 cell line were from products capped 472 nucleotides upstream of the AUG By gel purification and reamplification we were able to detect additional cap sites 677 316 and 289 nucleotides upstream of the AUG However these can only be very minor start sites since they were rarely observed by RLM RACE and were not detected by RNase protection assays Using an RLM RACE procedure similar to that used for this study Ito et al 36 mapped a cluster of transcription start sites surrounding nucleotide 472 upstream of the ATG However their data did not demonstrate which site within this cluster served as the major initiation site In another study the transcription initiation site for the human p27 Kip1gene was reported to be 153 nucleotides upstream of the ATG 31 35 The experiments reported here do not support these findings Using RLM RACE a faint band of approximately 150 base pairs could be observed after nested PCR Fig 2A but we were unable to clone an authentic RACE product equating to a start site 153 nucleotides upstream of the AUG In addition no bands corresponding to a start site at this position were detected by RNase protection assays indicating that if there is a transcriptional start site at 153 it is extremely rarely used in any of the cell lines that we tested The p27 Kip15 UTR is predicted to have extensive secondary structure 31 It is possible that this could interfere with primer extension analysis which was used by Minami et al 35 to map the putative transcription initiation site in human cells It is also possible that differences exist between the cell types used here and those used in previous reports However this is unlikely since we observed exactly the same results with three separate human cell lines Both the mouse and human p27 Kip1promoter regions have previously been characterized using reporter gene constructs All of the constructs that have significant levels of promoter activity contain the major transcriptional start sites identified in this study 33 34 35 36 Mouse p27 Kip1reporter constructs containing 500 base pairs upstream of the ATG start codon had virtually no activity 33 34 Similarly a human p27 Kip1reporter construct containing 435 base pairs upstream of the ATG was inactive 35 Our data indicate that this is because these constructs did not carry the major transcription initiation sites or the promoter sequences necessary to position the transcription complex In this regard it is noteworthy that the major transcription start site for both mouse and human is positioned 30 base pairs downstream of an AT rich element that may serve as a TATA box This element in the p27 Kip1gene TTTAAT matches the consensus TATA box sequence TATAA TAA T at 6 out of 7 positions It has been shown that expression of p27 Kip1is controlled at the translational level 3 26 29 and that the p27 Kip15 UTR is able to mediate enhanced translation rates 31 In addition it was recently reported that the p27 Kip15 UTR has an internal ribosome entry site that allows cap independent initiation of translation 30 However none of these reports have utilized the full 5 UTR that results from transcription initiation at the major start site The longest fragments of the p27 Kip15 UTR that have been analyzed include only the first 153 nucleotides upstream of the AUG for human 31 and 217 nucleotides for mouse 30 It is very likely that the additional 300 nucleotides at the 5 end of the major p27 Kip1transcript as reported here will play an important role in regulating p27 Kip1expression It will therefore be necessary to re examine translational control of p27 Kip1in the context of its full 5 UTR The data presented here show that although there is a single major site there are also alternative transcription initiation sites for both mouse and human p27 Kip1 This adds a new dimension to studies on p27 Kip1expression One interesting possibility is that different start sites may be used at different points in the cell cycle or during cellular differentiation It is known that p27 Kip1mRNA levels stay relatively steady throughout the cell cycle However usage of various transcription start sites could be regulated differently This might affect the length of the 5 UTR and thus translation of the p27 Kip1mRNA Additional studies will need to be done to determine if and when different transcription start sites are used The region of the p27 Kip1gene upstream of the ATG start codon is highly conserved in mouse and human Fig 5 This includes the region encoding the 5 UTR and the promoter region The high conservation between the mouse and human genes extends at least an additional 300 nucleotides upstream of the sequences shown in Fig 5 35 Our data indicate that the major transcription start site is at exactly the same sequence in both human and mouse Fig 5 large arrows Based on these new results we propose usage of the gene numbering system shown in Fig 5 For mouse 1 is 502 nucleotides upstream of the ATG and for human 1 is 472 nucleotides upstream of the ATG This information should be useful in designing experiments to analyze both transcriptional and translation control of p27 Kip1expression Materials and Methods Cell culture and RNA extraction Human breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and BT20 human fetal lung cell line MRC5 and the mouse NIH 3T3 cell line were maintained in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium with 10 fetal bovine serum Total RNA was extracted using TRI Reagent Molecular Research Cincinnati OH and stored in ethanol at 70 C 5 RLM RACE 5 RLM RACE 37 38 39 was performed using the GeneRacer kit Invitrogen Carlsbad CA In short the total RNA was dephosphorylated using calf intestinal phosphatase then decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase to target full length messenger RNAs An RNA oligonucleotide was then ligated to the full length decapped mRNAs and reverse transcription was performed using random primers PCR was done to amplify the resultant cDNAs using the GeneRacer 5 primer and a primer consisting of bases immediately upstream of the translation start site of the p27 Kip1gene CTTTCTCCCGGGTCTGCACGACCG for human and CTTCCTCCTCGGGCGGGTGT for mouse Nested PCR was then done to eliminate the possibility of artifacts using the GeneRacer 5 nested primer and p27 Kip1primers CACGACCGCCTCTCTCGCACTCTC for human and GGACCACCGCCTCGCCTCTC for mouse see Figs 1and 2 Cloning and sequencing The RACE nested PCR products were cloned into the pCR4Blunt TOPO vector using a TOPO cloning kit Invitrogen DNA obtained from the resultant colonies was sequenced with the USB Sequenase version 2 0 DNA Sequencing kit Amersham Cleveland OH using T3 and T7 primers Ribonuclease protection assay For the ribonuclease protection assays probes were made using the MAXIscript kit Ambion Austin TX 32P CTP and T7 RNA polymerase DNA from the RACE nested PCR clone containing the human p27 Kip1sequence from 472 to 17 or the mouse p27 Kip1sequence from 502 to 17 was linearized with Pme I and used as a template for probe synthesis Numbering of these DNA sequences was assigned using 1 as the translation start site After gel purification of the probe the assay was carried out using the HybSpeed RPA kit Ambion Total RNA was co precipitated with the labeled probe followed by denaturation and hybridization Following digestion with RNase A T1 the protected RNAs were precipitated and run on a 4 denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography
