 uh being a former drug user whoa i uh i d i guess i have to say at this point that i do approve of it uh huh uh because i know that uh in using drugs i was not a good employee uh huh and so i can see from the company s standpoint that there uh whenever you are an employee of the company you are using it s assets and uh and but you re also under their liability under the Workmen s Comp uh huh uh on my job we had a lot of Workmen s Comp cases and where do you work uh i work for a tire company Modern Tire and uh it s also a retreading plant and that s where most of our uh injuries occur oh uh huh and what we do is we ll have a drug test if if an if a a boy or a man uh has an accident then he s automatically uh given a drug trest right do they do it like you know within hours of the accident or is it yes when he goes to the doctor the first time yeah and so that kind of uh i don t know if it s been a deterrent or not because we have uh just started using it oh for the past year or so uh huh yeah now we ve let some people go uh that well it was found that drugs were used in their system now i don t know how TEC would handle it they haven t pursued it you know uh huh uh if there s some uh problem i know there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines and he went to a a separate drug testing firm and they showed it negative yeah so i think the tests themselves are not really that cut and dried you know huh yeah yeah i think that s probably true too that s that s that s sort of scary uh huh really and then i also had a friend who was uh just around some people that were smoking cocaine and he tested positive on cocaine now then you always wonder well is he just saying that you know yeah yeah yeah really really yeah yeah that s that s a bad situation i think that probably i think most companies now as far as entry you know exams require that i think they should um hum yeah uh huh i m a TI employee and and and uh i m i m really gung ho for it in fact uh huh i you know some of the places now um like IBM don t allow even smoking you know in the in the plant we we have designated smoking areas uh huh right yeah but um i work in sort of a building that s that s not really it well it s on the campus of the TI facility but it s a little bit you know separated we lease the building and it s mainly it s a factory environment uh huh and uh they they have designated smoking but it s just wide open it s not ventilated properly and i think that s bad but as far as the drugs you know being in the factory kind of environment that way yeah uh huh uh huh i think it s a it s a definite i think it s essential yeah because you re endangering everybody s lives if you ve if it s something like that yeah in fact we ve had the policy on just the random testing now for a couple years and uh uh huh i i was giving my boss a hard time because i kept waiting for my name to came come up you know they never they never called me they never you know then finally the day we declared war was my time you re kidding no and so and and my boss has has gone for about like three times i think and i told him he s obviously in a high risk group the executives right right right and of course you know they they did specifically single them out when we started you know that they were going to do all them first the executives but uh huh yeah wouldn t that be awful if you were which i thought was interesting if you were using and and oh lose your job and everything oh man yeah ooh yeah i can t believe i d was so brazen before i m like i say i m a former drug user but uh i i uh huh well uh i accepted Christ as my Lord and Savior and so i don t use drugs any more what kind of drugs did you use if you don t mind uh marijuana cocaine and amphetamines wow um yes uh huh and all on the job too you know it had gotten that bad really well it s really lucky that you got away from that cause that s really it s it s life is so much more enjoyable really downward spiral uh huh and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job you know yeah yeah that s that s it i mean you know there s all kinds of drawbacks much less the drug testing yeah just life in general uh huh that s right yeah well i m well i m definitely for it yeah plus you know you you want to think that that you re working with people who are not only putting out their fair share that s right but that are not endangering your life in some cases like uh my husband uh several years back worked for Motorola uh huh uh huh uh huh and they had you know i mean it was a chemical handling type oh goodness yeah i mean and they have they have some serious chemicals out there you know like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water you know that kind of thing yeah yeah and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals oh my gosh and that s really that s really frightening so i think some place you know places like that it should be like mandatory like you know yeah uh huh on on a on a greater frequency than maybe just you know the paper pushers like like i am right well i would think they would be well you well you d think so but uh but they weren t i don t know if they do it until yet isn t that awful because when he was at course now it s been years now because it was before it was even before they had the the designated smoking type stuff you know at TI i forgot what i guess it was like eighty four uh huh uh huh eighty five something like that and they at that time they had no testing whatsoever yeah huh so that s scary yeah that s reminds me of uh i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living and she said oh he s the supervisor of this chemical land fill you know where they go and dump all this toxic stuff oh Lord oh and i just you know went oh where yeah should we move let me move as far away as possible ooh yeah that s awful but i m proud though that that um you know i grew up in the sixties and back then it was popular you know but people have really wisened you know become wise about drugs and uh huh yeah yeah they really have a good campaign for the young people you know they know it s not smart so uh huh yeah so i guess it was just a generational thing yeah peer group is the other way now instead of um hum that s right and that s good that s the best way to stop it uh huh that s yeah that it really is yeah well i think we did it okay well i enjoyed tack talking to you Cathy bye bye it s good talking to you yeah bye bye
