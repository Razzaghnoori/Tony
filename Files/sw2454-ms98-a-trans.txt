          im not sure i even know where to begin on this mess   oh it it is a mess   i do believe though a lot of speculative speculative buying and investment on speculation uh too many large deals with too much risk uh   uhhuh oh definitely umhum bad deals with friends   and and associates of friends and on it goes over a long period of time and i think   yes uhhuh umhum   it i think its a a type of situation where okay the first investment didnt work but if we throw a little bit more money in on it maybe this one may you know and try to get our money back   yeah throw good money after bad you mean   exactly exactly   those you said its just not doesnt work   thats that is that is some of what some of what i had read is thats part of cause of it now as to the question of what to do about it   yeah oh heavens  i would   uh it has to be government regulation   oh yeah it but you know it its its i dont know  its not something i know a whole lot about but uh its such its such a big huge complicated mess   i dont either but the other thing this Dickson that they convicted he only got five years   oh uhhuh i know i couldnt believe it   so thats going to leave a message to other people that yeah   he can be out in twenty months they said   well yes but hes in very poor health so you know twenty months may mean a lot longer for him but still   yeah but yeah but still i i health and health and everything i mean if yeah   its our money its our taxes that have to pay for this mess   oh that well there are too i think theres too many savings and loans period theres you know you you drive down the street and theres one on every corner   this is true this is very true   and and it it i think its too easy to to uh form one that you know because i mean look look in Dallas theyre everywhere they were everywhere and then then they started being taken over by bigger bigger ones and then they just the bigger ones took on the little ones debt and then it it just snowballed   and thats probably another cause of the problem we are looking at right now   yeah its it it theres just it just seemed like everybody and their brother had a savings and loan   this is a very true thing i didnt think about that part of it   you know because you know i have never im uh were originally from Missouri and there are you know mostly banks and maybe a couple of savings and loans in the area i mean i have never seen so many as there are down here   uhhuh oh really thats interesting   theyre theyre theyre just everywhere and and you know set up in trailers  i seen one on Preston Road that was set up in a trailer for a while before they built the little building   oh yes yes this is true oh how funny   and then uh and then uh it went out uh i mean i just wonder   how much that cost us   yeah and how many people lost money on that lost money in that thing but who but uh who knows its   that is scary i didnt think about that   well they need to prosecute the people who are taking the millions and millions a lot a lot better than they are have been Dickson is the only one i even heard of i mean there may be more that they are prosecuting but Dickson is the only one i even heard of   they must be getting some on the national level i think ive read various things but i just no names come to mind   because if he only stole six stole six hundred thousand dollars thats just a drop in the bucket compared to some of them that were were skimming millions   yeah because thats a drop in the bucket to the taxes were going to have to pay to to make up for this   yeah yeah because there are bigger fish i know i mean otherwise it wouldnt be in such a mess that the the stealing because uh stealing and leaving the country probably they cant they probably cant find them what the deal is  oh   you know youve got a good point there   but uh eventually you know the the tax money is getting extremely low on the FSLIC i mean theyre in theyre getting theyre getting so low it its almost in trouble and and wheres wheres that going to come from   and the and the other thing is they said the insurance the uh insurance agents the insurance industry is beginning to resemble the savings and loan industry so they they say the next big crisis could well be our insurance   oh yeah oh yeah  thats and thats frightening that is frightening because   as another uh my car insurance is frightening right now i cannot believe how much money i pay   oh oh our car insurance i cant either for for uh for nothing for almost nothing   well and i just carry the absolute minimum required by law   right   and im paying i mean every quarter im paying like five hundred dollars a year and that   oh well you dont pay we we keep full coverage down here on everything because well its not its not that bad but thats getting off the subject  uh   oh my   but uh but the you think that they that they could come up with a better system of regulating these these little bitty uh savings and loans that uh   well i you know the problem is who is they and you get they is the government   the government yeah thats what i meant Congress   but you get you get into when you start getting them to do things you get into a lot of special interest groups again   yes exactly exactly and lobbying oh you know theres a big   and you know and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people   yeah thats true thats true   thats what scares me when you get into that type of situation you know if you are going to change it watch out for the person thats changing it they may put another loophole in that   umhum yeah makes it even worse   wasnt even there to begin with   yeah and and and people like us never hear about about whats really going on and what they what theyre really doing   and i think reading the newspaper for that type of thing is a waste of time because theyre there to sell newspapers thats the problem with the news both the on television and the paper   yeah yeah television is worse television is worse   well all theyre there to sell you know or to entertain even worse and uh not to transmit information   yeah uhhuh yeah thats yeah oh exactly what makes   so what we get is so garbled that who knows if we even have the ability to decide anything   yeah yeah  we got these people up in Washington deciding all this stuff for us and we dont even know what theyre deciding so it its   and whose best interests they represent us or someone else   and how many of them were invested in just how many of them have invested in a savings and loan   in in a savings and loan  or own a or has a brother that owns yeah   yeah oh yeah   its really a scary scary thing   yeah but im its one of those one of those things that i just dont know where the answer lies its just its just its going to uh it it doesnt seem like its going as badly as it did in the past few years its kind of slow because the closings has kind of slowed a little bit   well now there was an article in the paper this morning in the business section how tough it was to get a loan approved anymore   oh really   yeah when when you know when youre trying to buy a house how incredibly hard it is to get get a loan approved simply because theyre they are tightening down so much   uhhuh huh well i can see why i can see why i can see why because they were loan they were loaning money to everybody and anybody that i mean they didnt check up on people they were loaning people ungodly amounts of money that were that that that couldnt pay for it and you wonder how in the world these people got their loans why look at look at the i thirty condos i know somebody at TI that bought one of them things uh back when they first  opened   uhhuh oh yes   you know that big scam and they just they just left town they just they just packed up and left town   smart move   and i mean i mean they left well yes but no because they uh they left their loan hanging yes they they just   oh did they oh thats not   and that happened that happened a lot in this area people just packing up and leaving their houses and leaving the the banks and the savings and loans out to dry on the loans on the car on house loans   well but they are hurting their own credit that way   hey i know people that it does they dont care it wouldnt i am extremely touchy picky picky picky about my credit rating but but i know people that just dont care what they done bankruptcy means nothing to these people and it hurts all of us it when they declare bankruptcy its you and me that have to pay for it and these people dont care   oh absolutely yeah because they can you know they write all that and people that write things off as bad debt   umhum   that lowers their threshold of income of what they have to pay taxes on which automatically automatically makes our taxes go up because there is so much that has to be paid   umhum oh yeah uhhuh oh of course   and if this guy is exempt from paying it we have to pay more thats exactly right so its just   we got to take up slack and so its its its a lot of people just run running out on loans that they couldnt pay for in this area i mean you just cant imagine how many houses people just run have run out on   yeah that is really sad   i i know it i know it i dont think its its as bad now as it was a couple of years ago when everything just kind of fell apart you know everything just kind of fizzled what because when we moved down here in eighty three i mean there was buildings going up on every corner every week and   yes and and the unoccupied
