 Brit Noir Martin Amis has long evinced his fascination with American culture so it should come as no surprise that he has brought out an American novel Or anyway a simulacrum of an American novel The work is of course an hommage to the police procedural genre for which Americans are principally known overseas This is true of most entries in the fiction wing of the body of American culture simulacra produced by aliens Like most items in the music department of the same phenomenon it is a riff Some might glance at the book and decide that it is meant to be Amis Elmore Leonard moment recalling his praise for that master of fibrous plots and low key sociology But Night Train is light on plot and nearly Martian in its sociology so it might better be seen as Amis Mark Knopfler moment Like the lead guitarist of the erstwhile Dire Straits Amis is a stolid middle class New Briton blessed with considerable chops torn between worldly cynicism and a certain nostalgie de la boue whose wish to get down and dirty is undertaken professionally but stops a bit short of conviction They are both smart enough to notice you noticing this and their answers are identical more sixteenth notes In Amis case what this entails is cascades and arabesques of language Night Train is a monologue delivered by one Detective Mike Hoolihan a physically intimidating seen it all tough but tender veteran of every rotten assignment in the police precincts of Anytown USA Hoolihan is also a woman as she reminds the reader no more than once per paragraph Police salaries being what they are she lives in a comically tilted slum flat down by the railroad tracks where deep in the night the titular conveyance roars by and sets the coffee cups a rattling She shares the dump with her latest in a series of hulking morons or so she alleges She only alludes to Tobe failing to introduce him to the reader who is tempted to conclude that Tobe belongs to the race of 6 foot tall rabbits On this day Mike has got her worst job yet She has to notify next of kin in a suicide and not just any suicide The corpus delicti was once Jennifer Rockwell who was both bodacious gorgeousness personified and the essence of braininess an astrophysicist in her day job Mike has known Jennifer since the latter was a tyke Jennifer was a sprout of the local cop dynasty the only one not to wear the blue herself All her brothers are cops and her dad is such an overwhelming cop of a cop they made him a colonel Colonel Tom as he is called throughout has taken Mike under his capacious wing and seen her through detox and depression and all the rest of it as if she were another daughter of his So Mike s heart is heavy but she is still a police as she likes to put it She takes a quick look at the situation and her analytical mind snaps to In addition to beauty and brains the deceased had charm wealth and a fulfilling love machine relationship with a fellow double dome Professor Trader Faulkner a roguish but loyal wearer of tweed jackets with leather patches on the elbows Does that sound like a recipe for self offing Not to our Mike who starts investigating pronto although the field of potential murderers is as thin as the motive directory At length her researches lead her into terrain that is nearly spiritual or something Could Jennifer who apparently managed to put three bullets into her lovely brain have killed herself because of the absurdity of the simultaneously expanding and contracting universe Don t count on finding out Amis game is sixteenth notes or in this case a run through the candy store of American slang Like the blues as played by suburban virtuosos the story itself is little more than a structural excuse for a show of wizard dexterousness Mike is the only character Background noise is supplied by other members of her department but they are cut and pasted from a vague memory of Barney Miller After Faulkner s cameo he presumably returned to the Folgers Crystals commercial from which he was borrowed Most others like Tobe and Col Tom are flickering wraiths The MacGuffin Jennifer Rockwell might occupy center stage as a corpse but the reader doesn t believe in her previous existence for a minute She joins the parade of other scarily perfect not remotely credible woman objects in Amis fiction such as Nicola Six who plots her own murder in London Fields Is Night Train intended to be the record of Mike Hoolihan s dt induced hallucinations You tell me What is certain is that it represents Amis tabulation of his own verbal pink elephants He would experience them in this form anyway since here as elsewhere in his oeuvre he appears curiously absent of any visual sense He wallows in Americaness especially cop talk He likes the idea of hollow cant being delivered in clipped cadences by a broad especially one under emotional strain Sometimes you don t know whether he did his research by letting himself be washed by television for endless stretches or whether he went so deep he knows expressions you ve never heard or haven t heard since fifth grade Do cops ever refer to a perp as a hoody He savors verbal dandruff state of the art parameters and jargon the verbs to badge and to be rigored but mostly he likes the rhythm the tattoo of fuck s and shit s and excuse me s This doesn t prevent him from dishing out the fine writing though he has Mike get pretty fancy to the point of spouting Latin Anyway the language business is the only conceivable motive for this book Perhaps foreigners will thrill to the exotica as a sort of high lit gloss on Jerry Springer territory Otherwise it goes nowhere for no reason has no friction and no ending A pint of the fortified wine that shares the book s name would make a better investment
