 uh books yes mainly i read the Bible these days that s very good i do too good that s great to hear uh and Christian literature uh i ve kind of i used to read a lot of uh novels uh huh but it seems as though if you really want to set a time side time to read the Bible and you work and and whatever uh that pretty well takes up your time for reading uh huh yeah it does it and i i been praying that God would put a desire to read the Bible in my heart and he really has it s getting to where a just really want to read it that s good that s good it it it s uh it s hard for me to find time also to read uh a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that for for you know because i don t have a lot of time but when i do get to sit down and and read i like to read the Bible and i like to read i read to my daughter a lot too do you and uh i like to read you know Bible i have Bible storybooks so i like reading those to her and she really enjoys those uh huh uh huh so that s good and it and it s kind of short because we don t woe don t have a lot of time uh huh to read so it s real enjoyable yeah for both of us have you ever read any of Frank E Peretti s Frank E no i guess i haven t uh This Present Darkness and uh uh i forget the title the other well he uh he s also written a lot of children how old is your daughter five five okay he s written some children s books as well and

uh children s books just just to read them well that s good yeah oh they re good they re great and it s uh like uh uh usually about a family of um that s good archeologists and the spiritual fights that they get into like uh uh digging in old ruins and running across like uh the old gods uh huh oh yeah oh that sounds pretty neat yeah it is it s real exciting oh i ll have to look for those and it also teaches them spiritual warfare you know so right well that s neat well i i have a my daughter has Precious Moments collection and i like that because it s a it s real easy to uh huh uh follow for her you know uh gosh if if i read straight out of the Bible to her she d never understand any of it well it s hard for me that s right it is it is real hard to to follow and understand and uh huh uh i ve got a Bible that uh has a little bit of a uh a glossary in the back and it helps explain who people are that s that s about the hardest thing is who s related to who i know it and especially it s hard to keep your interest in those begats yeah yes yes it sure is but but it is good reading and it s good for us and and everything i really do enjoy it uh huh that s right but uh i also but then on the other extreme i like to read uh i guess horror i don t know horror Steven King type books uh huh yeah i ve read a lot of his too the and i i like that that s good fun reading yeah can t put them down no you can t you really can t they are good and ooh they just they re just so suspenseful uh huh yeah i really do enjoy his uh there s another guy oh what can what is his name oh durn you would

seems like but they re real it s all the did you ever read the uh uh oh it s one of his first books The Stand yes that oh that long thing i know it and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that i mean yeah they do kind of follow or you know that are similar uh huh i love that book though i thought it was great yeah it really was and i loved The Shining ooh yes that was that was my favorite oh those hedges when they started moving whenever they they made that into a movie i was thinking oh my gosh if they show that i ll just die for some reason that scared me more than anything yeah yeah yeah yeah that is he just brings stuff alive you know you could just visualize everything that s yeah and that was a pretty scary movie too yeah i think they did a pretty good job but they didn t follow it exactly but they did give it you know do it justice yeah uh huh that s right but uh most of the time they don t with when follow books very well when they ma ke them into movies yeah that s true i liked it as well yeah yeah uh i did too that s another big fat one yeah yeah that was good i liked uh i also liked uh Cujo did you read that one yeah and except it broke my heart i m a dog lover yeah me too and then uh Night Stand is that Night no it was uh Dead Dead Zone that s one i liked what Dead Zone oh yeah i ve read that one too that was a that was a real good one he s written a lot of books boy he just sits down eight hours a day just like any other job i know it right and then he has some under uh another name that s right that one about the gypsies or that hunger or something uh that he s written yeah yeah uh i think his name was Bachman he wrote under the name of Bachman yeah Richard Bachman yeah he is really interesting yeah he s so prolific yeah ooh i wish i could do that oh i know it and i have gone back and after i i graduated i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through and have found that i enjoy them quite a bit too uh uh huh i do too i love old good old once you can get into the language you know the language uh yeah but it s like it s English but it s not the same English they speak today right so it s kind of hard to keep you know at it but their worthwhile that s true but i that s that was one of my favorite subjects in school was uh literature literature yeah me too i used to love those old good good old books uh huh i didn t mind doing that at all Nathaniel Hawthorne is pretty scary himself yeah yeah i liked uh oh gosh why can t i think of their names uh shoot the one that wrote uh Wuthering Heights
