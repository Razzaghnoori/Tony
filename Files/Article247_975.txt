 Twelve steps in the web Hi Katha Glad you re back I missed my morning bouts of dyspepsia I was fascinated by the story in this morning s New York Times of the Internet support group murder confession The combination of the web and twelve step meetings horrifies and intrigues me Each forum appeals I think because it creates a space where you re free to be completely frank and anonymous while still actually being yourself And thanks to this peculiar brand of invisible visibility we re led to believe that both are spaces free of traditional moral consequences So in AA you only have a first name just as on the web you only have a screen name And no one checks whether it s your real one And in AA you can confess to anything and all that fundamentally matters is whether you have lapsed from your obligation to sobriety not what the consequences to others were And on the web you can live out any sort of fantasy in real time with limited accountability On the web you give up all your responsibility to the invisible hand of the net see Matt Drudge In AA you hand over all your problems to a non denominational omnipotent God Put the two together and it s no wonder people think they can confess to child murder and still get away with it But are these responsibility free no holds barred forums new in any way I wonder Or are they simply updates of the confessional and the shrink the cult and the Freemasons Is our confession prone no responsibility president part of the trend And have you read Conversations With God best Andrew
