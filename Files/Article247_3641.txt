 Thus Spake Groucho and Gertrude Do you remember the first time you ever heard the expression There s no there there I do I practically remember where I was sitting when I first read it Of course it s Gertrude Stein speaking of the place she grew up which I m pretty sure was Oakland Cal This is the sort of thing I could check if I weren t in Los Angeles So forgive me if it s Berkeley Anyway what a great line What a great great line I mean when I first came across it I just stopped reading for a few minutes and rolled that line around in my brain and thought I would kill to say something that amazing There s no there there No there there It s right up there with Everyone will be famous for 15 minutes which is definitely another of the other top 10 lines of the last l00 years Anyway you are right about Bush and Clinton and just about everyone no there there Bush I find dangerous precisely because he will win according to my criteria and yours and he knows absolutely nothing Also call me crazy but I hate Republicans Could never vote for one Just couldn t It s as close as I get to being a practicing Jew I mean God would strike me dead if I voted Republican If I believed in God And those horrible Supreme Court justices Republicans nominate really matter Although it s surprising and fascinating to see what s happened to Sandra Day O Connor and of all people David Souter as they ve carved out a middle of the road pragmatism no one could ever have predicted One of the things I always find interesting about L A where I grew up waiting desperately for the moment I could get out is how it found its there kind of the way Miami did Fred Allen Los Angeles is great if you re an orange Another of the top 10 don t you think And Groucho Marx I wouldn t join any club that would have me as a member Probably not quite accurately quoted but as I say there s no Bartlett s in my hotel room I ve been told that all sorts of people have worked with Bradley I think Sydney Pollack tried to help although I could be wrong Bradley s TV Q has definitely improved He was great on Meet the Press a few weeks ago as relaxed as he d been the day I saw him in person But I ve also been told that people have worked with Al Gore and it seems to be truly useless I mean if you just tied the man s hands together and lashed them down it would be an improvement If I were trying to help him I would tell him to never ever read from a speech that just makes the performance even more deadly He should always work from index cards with no more than a word or two written on them Well so should anyone who gives a speech I wanted to die when Gore got up after the Littleton shootings and stood there holding a sheet of paper with a speech on it that he dutifully read from On the other hand if Gore runs against Bush and Ventura we will both be voting for him I guarantee it More children shot with guns last night Another thing I like about Bradley is his position on guns In the L A Times today there s an article that says that the LAPD has asked Charlton Heston to be its guest speaker at a fund raiser next week This is the LAPD whose chief is anti NRA and this is the Charlton Heston who refuses to take a position against cop killer bullets The man who booked Heston for the speech has this to say I was unaware until after he accepted that he was the head of the NRA Well I am off to work And so this is the end of our days together I feel relieved because frankly my entire life has ground to a halt for the last four days while I feverishly tried to think of things to say But I also feel sad Next week there s American Beauty to talk about and while I m sure we ll both see it over the weekend and maybe we ll even e mail each other about it now that we know each other s addresses no one will be listening xoxoxox
