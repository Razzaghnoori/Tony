 Two Liars Two Liars Of the two Bill Clinton is the bigger liar we suppose but Ken Starr may be the more brazen Clinton s that woman lie at least was a sincere attempt to keep us in the dark Starr by contrast seems to think he can mislead us about truths that are right in front of our eyes And maybe he can Wednesday s New York Times for example carried excerpts from Starr s letter to Clinton s lawyer David Kendall explaining why he would not give Kendall an advance peek at Starr s report to Congress As you doubtless know Starr wrote this Office steadily has maintained the position that it would not be appropriate to comment on the possibility that it would provide a report to Congress Naturally it is impossible to let Kendall see the report in advance if you have a steadily maintained position that you don t even concede the possibility that such a report exists That was on Page A18 of the national edition Meanwhile on Page A1 Report by Starr Against Clinton Expected Soon of the same paper the possibility of a report from Starr was getting very different treatment Starr plans to deliver a report quite soon and he intends to alert Speaker Newt Gingrich that very day that the report contains credible grounds for impeachment The report is expected to outline will almost certainly say is likely to include and so on Says who Say allies of Mr Starr and lawyers familiar with Mr Starr s plans and so forth Despite the coy labeling this information could come from only one of two places someone s imagination or Starr s office And since the info has proved to be accurate the first option defies probability Starr has said he disapproves of leaks but leaks have gushered out of his office before and since and no one has been caught and fired So it s obvious that his Office did not have a steadily maintained position of not commenting on its then forthcoming report It was commenting every day and still is Starr s letter to Kendall was in short a lie The same Wednesday Times contained its usual daily editorial calling for more flamboyant abjection from Clinton adding that Starr correctly rejected his lawyer s request to see the report in advance It failed to note that Starr s reason for rejecting the request was transparently false How to Avoid Flytrap E mail continues to pour in complaining about too much Slate coverage of the presidential scandal For Slate readers who agree with this sentiment we have created a special page listing and linking to all the Flytrap stories in Slate they may wish to avoid They may wish to make an exception for our two unique versions of the Starr report One supplied to us early in the week by free lance writer Art Levine has turned out to be wildly inaccurate In hindsight probably we should have suspected that Judge Starr would not use the phrase fiery loins Oh well At this writing the actual report is not yet out on the Web As soon as it is though we plan to run it through a feature of Microsoft Word 7 0 called AutoSummarize AutoSummarize reduces the bulk of any piece of prose by up to 90 percent while attempting to retain the original essence We ll also of course have links to various locations where you can read the whole thing Michael Kinsley
