                    Introduction        The evidence that adolescent diet may affect the risk of        breast cancer derives from several lines of evidence            Rates of breast cancer among Asian immigrants to the        United States do not approach those of US white women until        the second or third generation suggesting that exposures        during childhood and adolescence are important in        establishing a higher risk of breast cancer             Norwegian women who were adolescents during World War II        when average caloric intake decreased by  have a        reduced incidence of breast cancer suggesting that energy        restriction might affect risk     Similarly in animal        models energy restriction in the peripubertal period        inhibits mammary tissue proliferation and reduces the        subsequent risk of mammary tumors      Exposure of        rats to carcinogens before first pregnancy increases the        incidence of mammary tumors compared with exposure after        first pregnancy     After differentiation of the        mammary gland at the time of first fullterm pregnancy of        the rat the rate of cell division decreases and length of        the cell cycle increases allowing more time for DNA repair            This biologic phenomenon might explain the apparent        vulnerability of the adolescent breast tissue to        carcinogenic exposures Among atomic bomb survivors and        women exposed to ionizing radiation as part of their        treatment for Hodgkins disease the risk of breast cancer        increases with younger age at exposure            Although this analysis was principally an exploratory        analysis to guide prospective studies the authors had        previously proposed that certain elements of adolescent        diet might be protective against future risk of breast        cancer     For instance we and others have proposed        that fiber might be protective by lowering endogenous        estrogen levels and that folate might be protective owing        to its role in DNA methylation                    Methods                  Study population          This study was conducted among the participants of the          Nurses Health Study a prospective cohort of           women who have completed biennial questionnaires on          medical events and lifestyle factors since the initiation          of the study in  when the women were  years of          age     The study has been approved by the          institutional review board at the Brigham and Womens          Hospital Boston                          High school foodfrequency questionnaire          In  when participants were  years of age          they completed a item foodfrequency questionnaire          FFQ about diet between the ages of  and  years The          FFQ was designed to include foods that account for major          sources of fat antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids          For each food item on the FFQ a unit or portion size was          specified Subjects were asked how often on average          they had consumed the specified amount of each item Nine          possible responses were provided ranging from never to          six or more per day          Nutrient intakes were computed for each subject by          assigning a weight proportional to the frequency of use          of each food multiplying this weighting by the nutrient          value for the specified portion size and summing the          contributions of all foods The nutrient database used in          this study was derived from the US Department of          Agricultures handbook    with additional information          from McCance and Widdowson    and also from data          obtained from food manufacturers The database          incorporates research on the historical trends in the          enrichment of the food supply such as the addition of          vitamin D to milk beginning in about  and vitamin A          to margarine in about  For vitamin A women born          before  were assigned unenriched values women born          after  were assigned enriched values The          questionnaire has been shown to be highly reproducible          and not significantly correlated with current diet as an          adult            r                Participants who had completed the high school diet          assessment section of the  followup questionnaire          and who also had reported current diet in  were          eligible for the study Incident cases of breast cancer          confirmed by medical record review diagnosed after the          report of current diet in  and before the return of          the  questionnaire on which high school diet was          reported were eligible for inclusion in the study            n   The analysis included          both           in situ and invasive cases of          breast cancer One hundred and thirtysix cases died          before the mailing of the  questionnaire  cases          did not return the  questionnaire and  cases did          not fill out the high school diet section of the           questionnaire Cases were excluded from the analysis if          the total calories reported on high school diet were          implausible ie less than  or greater than             n   if the reported age at          menarche was greater than  years            n   or if they had previously          been diagnosed with cancer other than breast cancer            n   The final case pool            n   included  of the cases          diagnosed between  and  Included cases had a          later age at menarche were more likely to be          premenopausal and were more likely to report a family          history of breast cancer than cases excluded from the          analysis data not shown Controls were matched to cases          by month and year of birth in a  ratio The exclusion          criteria for controls were the same as for cases                          Statistical analysis          Controls were assigned the date of diagnosis of their          matched case The risk factor status of both cases and          controls was updated from the questionnaire most recently          completed before date of diagnosis controls were          assigned the date of diagnosis of their matched case          Risk factors that were updated included menopausal          status family history diagnosis of benign breast          disease and postmenopausal hormone use All tests of          significance were twosided Differences in risk factor          status between cases and controls were tested with  or           t tests          Foods were analyzed as continuous variables based on          the number of servings per day Nutrients were analyzed          using quintiles of nutrient intake according to the          distribution in the control population Multiple logistic          regression was used to estimate relative risks as odds          ratios and  confidence intervals CIs while          controlling simultaneously for potentially confounding          variables Trends across quintiles were tested with the          use of the logistic model Relative risks were estimated          as odds ratios and  CIs while controlling          simultaneously for potentially confounding variables          Trends across quintiles were tested with the use of the          logistic model Relative risks RR were calculated by          comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of nutrient          intake Q            versus Q             Multivariate models included age          at diagnosis family history of breast cancer in mother          or sister diagnosis of benign breast disease BBD age          at menarche in quintiles body mass index at age  in          deciles adult height in quartiles reproductive          history categorical and vitamin A intake continuous          in      Current vitamin A intake was included in          the model because we have previously shown in this cohort          of women that lower intake of vitamin A is positively          associated with an increased risk of breast cancer          Reproductive history was represented by dummy variables          indicating whether the subject had children and if so          the number of children one two or more than two          children and the age at which the first child was born          before age  between ages  and  inclusive or age           or older                            Results        Breast cancer cases had later age at first birth lower        parity increased adult height and higher incidence of        BBD and were more likely than controls to have a family        history of breast cancer Cases also reported lower vitamin        A intake and higher alcohol intake in  than did        controls data not shown        Increased consumption of eggs was associated with        decreased risk of breast cancer RR   per increase of        one serving per day  CI  Table         Consumption of butter was positively associated with        increased risk of breast cancer RR    CI         RR values for individual foods were generally        similar for premenopausal and postmenopausal women Foods        were grouped according to type fruits vegetables dairy        red meat chicken fish but none of the groupings was        significantly related to risk of breast cancer        Nutrient analysis controlling for other established        risk factors showed that greater consumption of vegetable        fat RR Q                     P trend   and dietary fiber        RR Q                     P trend   were related to a        reduced risk of breast cancer Table  No other        associations between nutrient intake and risk of breast        cancer were observed Inclusion versus exclusion of adult        height which might be on the causal pathway between        adolescent diet and adult health did not substantially        alter the results reported                    Discussion        In this nested casecontrol study the relation of        adolescent diet to risk of breast cancer was evaluated        among participants in the Nurses Health Study who had        completed a item FFQ about diet during high school        Increased consumption of eggs was inversely associated with        risk of breast cancer Eggs are rich sources of essential        amino acids minerals and vitamins For instance one egg        contains  of the recommended daily allowance for        folate and  of that for vitamin D     Conversely        increased consumption of butter was associated with a        slight increase in risk Neither animal fat total fat nor        unsaturated fat was associated with increased risk on        nutrient analysis however another nutrient in butter        might confer increased risk or the consumption of butter        might be a proxy for another risk factor        When specific nutrients were examined increased        consumption of both vegetable fat and dietary fiber was        associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer Fiber        might affect the risk of breast cancer by decreasing        estrogen levels fiber binds estrogen excreted into the        gastrointestinal tract and reduces enterohepatic        circulation      In addition higher dietary fiber        intake has been associated with higher plasma levels of        sexhormonebinding globulin which can reduce the        bioavailability of estrogens     The potential        mechanism of a protective effect of vegetable fat is more        speculative vegetable fat is a composite of multiple forms        of fatty acids some of which have been proposed to        increase risk such as C          n whereas other specific fatty        acids have been proposed to decrease risk such as C           the primary fatty acid in olive        oil     More detail on the type and composition of        the vegetable oil used is necessary to pursue this relation        with greater precision        Several limitations to the study exist First the        validity of diet data recalled from  to  years in the        past is unknown Although we have shown that this recall is        reproducible and is not highly correlated with current diet            we can only infer validity Potischman         et al    have shown that there        is a strong degree of concordance between the report of        mother and the report of daughter about foods consumed        during this age period although others have shown that        recall of diet from the distant past is imprecise            However in the absence of dietary data actually collected        during adolescence recall of high school diet provides the        best estimate of possible relationships between diet during        adolescence and the risk of breast cancer        Second the item FFQ is too short for complete        assessment of total energy intake or specific nutrients        For instance the intake of folate calculated from high        school FFQ is much lower than the range seen in adult women            median intake group in the top quintile of intake        during high school was only  g per day Given the        restricted list of foods from which the nutrients were        derived more emphasis should be placed on the analysis of        foods than of nutrients when interpreting these data        A third limitation of the current study is the        possibility of recall bias because high school diet history        was obtained after diagnosis of breast cancer The most        prevalent although apparently incorrect dietary        hypothesis among the general population in  was the        notion that increased fat consumption significantly        increased risk Nevertheless in this study the lack of        association of fat intake suggests that recall bias was        probably not a major factor However the brevity of this        questionnaire might not have permitted complete recording        of all sources of fat        A further limitation is the possibility of survivor        bias Only cases alive in  who had completed the high        school diet portion of the questionnaire were included in        the analysis If adolescent diet in any way increases the        risk of mortality from breast cancer women with these        adverse dietary patterns would not be included in analysis        and the relation would be distorted Finally there remains        the possibility of residual confounding by unmeasured        factors for instance socioeconomic status during childhood        and its impact on dietary composition        Four other studies of the relation between childhood        diet and breast cancer have been reported previously Pryor                et al    conducted a        casecontrol study of adolescent diet and breast cancer in        Utah Recall of diet was assessed by a modification of the        Block questionnaire selecting for foods higher in fat and        fiber No data were presented on the foods themselves only        possible relations between fat and fiber stratified by        menopausal status were reported Higher intake of fat from        dairy sources was associated with a decreased risk of        breast cancer for both premenopausal and postmenopausal        women This conclusion contrasts with the finding of our        study in which a higher intake of butter was associated        with a small increase in risk A higher intake of fiber        decreased risk in premenopausal women whereas a higher        intake of fiber was associated with an increased risk of        breast cancer in postmenopausal women analogous to a        finding of the present study        Hislop         et al    conducted a        casecontrol study in British Columbia among  incident        cases of breast cancer between  and  Women were        asked to recall their dietary intake of  foods during        early childhood up to age  years In premenopausal        women consumption of meat with visible fat during        childhood was associated with an increased risk of breast        cancer RR three or more times per week compared with        less than once per month    CI         Consumption of vegetable oils was associated with a reduced        risk in premenopausal women RR    CI         We also observed an inverse relationship between the intake        of vegetable fat and the risk of breast cancer        Potischman         et al    conducted a        casecontrol study among  cases who had been diagnosed        with breast cancer at less than  years of age        Participants were asked during a telephone interview to        quantify their intake of  foods at ages  years The        mothers of the participants were also asked to recall their        daughters intake of foods at ages  years The        response of each mother was highly correlated with the        daughters report The authors reported that increased        consumption of highfat meats was associated with an        increased risk of breast cancer whereas increased        consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with a        nonsignificant but consistent decrease in risk of breast        cancer                    Conclusion        The present study revealed that increased consumption of        eggs was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer        whereas increased consumption of butter was associated with        a slight increase in risk In addition increased intake of        vegetable oils and dietary fiber seemed to be inversely        related to risk of breast cancer Future studies of the        relation between adolescent diet and risk of breast cancer        are warranted and should include a more complete assessment        of diet
