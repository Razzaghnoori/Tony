 Japan and Its People Its famous bullet trains zip through the country at up to 300 km 186 miles per hour Its factories feature the latest generation of industrial robots that don t eat don t sleep and never strike Its high tech consumer electronics companies have placed affordable and notoriously reliable electronic products in households around the world But peel back a layer and a different picture starts to emerge In many ways Japan is not yet a truly modern country Its social roots still lie deeply in its past as a feudal society of countless closely knit agricultural communities dominated by a small political elite Japan is still trying to define its place in a world in which it is constantly accused of being an economic whale but a political minnow just one of the pieces of the puzzle that is modern Japan Truly any examination of political economic and social issues invariably raises more questions that it answers One pattern that quickly arises is an apparently never ending series of contradictions Where lies the real Japan Simply put it is all around you For Japan is truly a kaleidoscope of lifestyles and images local cultures and beliefs the rice farmers in rural heartlands and the subway millions of teeming Tokyo the Zen Buddhist monks and the fad obsessed teenaged fashion victims the solemn temple ceremony or the hellish din of the pachinko parlor exquisite temple architecture or all pervasive soulless concrete apartment buildings All represent different often contradictory facets of the greater whole that is Japan one of the world s most intriguing countries The meticulous planning that helped the country to rise from the ashes of World War II to become the world s second largest economic power has in the 1990s created a prolonged slump A people so justifiably famous for hospitality politeness and respect also produced an army whose brutality during its occupation of Southeast Asia during the war remains a stumbling block to normal international relations A society whose indigenous religion centers on nature worship for decades has tolerated appalling environmental damage commercially exploiting its own nature reserves for timber lining river banks and beds with concrete and filling its air water and land with dioxins and other pollutants These are just some of the issues facing anyone wishing to understand Japan if such a thing is indeed possible After all the Japanese themselves are constantly analyzing their own nature In fact they have devised the subject of Nihonjinron the theory of Japaneseness books on which sell millions of copies each year and cover such bizarre topics as the unique chemistry of Japanese blood the special configuration of the Japanese brain and other examples of what supposedly sets them apart from the rest of humanity Unquestionably few visitors will come to Japan truly free of preconceptions There is no shortage of stereotypes the beleaguered workaholic salaryman the exotic geisha the long suffering Japanese housewife Regardless of the degree of truth in these images the secret of any successful and satisfying exploration of Japan is to cast aside preconceived notions and come with an open mind This is certainly a challenging task but the rewards for doing so are the myriad windows and doors into this fascinating country that will open for you For despite its reputation for homogeneity Japan is in fact a country of astonishing contrasts Despite the concrete sprawl of Japan s postwar urban development you can still find tranquillity in a brilliant green moss covered temple garden or in the alcove of a traditional restaurant with its tatami mat flooring shielded from the other guests by shoji paper screens remnants of a not so distant past The Japanese themselves have no trouble wandering easily from one such context to another Home again after a hard day at the office the director of a consumer electronics company who wears a business suit in downtown Tokyo sees nothing strange about buying cigarettes from a machine located inches from a sacred Shinto shrine Once home he might change into a garish velour leisure suit or an elegant yukata light cotton kimono the traditional informal attire for both men and women Even Japan s disaffected youth normally sporting dyed hair nose rings and torn T shirts and whatever else constitutes the latest street fashions to be slavishly copied will attend an important festival in an expensive traditional costume perhaps indicating that despite their parents concerns about their superficial appearance some old values have not been entirely abandoned Everywhere you go you re likely to find this constant contrast between old and young traditional and modern past and present Oftentimes these polar opposites come together Ise Shima the most sacred of all sanctuaries of Shinto Japan s ancient nature worshipping indigenous religion reinforces Japan s profoundly intimate links with the Sun Goddess and her grandson the God of the Earth Although it was established some 1 700 years ago the main shrine you ll see today was erected in 1993 Unlike Christianity s massive gothic cathedrals designed to convey a strong sense of permanence this austere wooden structure is dismantled every 20 years and replaced by a new one Since Japan s Shinto deities are believed to permeate the natural surroundings in this case a beautiful cedar forest the man made shrine is just there for the fleeting present moment This strong sense of transience and impermanence has doubtless arisen as a natural response to Japan s devastating geography and seismology The string of islands that make up Japan is in fact a highly volatile archipelago dotted with volcanoes and regularly subjected to earthquakes and typhoons Over the ages the Japanese built everything of wood and then waited fatalistically for them to burn down collapse or be blown away in one catastrophe or another after which they commenced another cycle of rebuilding Not until a 20th century Western architect Frank Lloyd Wright arrived in Tokyo to build the earthquake resistant Imperial Hotel was it considered possible let alone desirable to attempt to defy the ravages of nature Today office blocks and apartment buildings are of course constructed with modern materials However the failure of many to withstand the powerful 1995 Hanshin earthquake that struck the Kobe area exposed the inadequacy of many construction methods and standards The postwar obsession with comfort convenience and the latest electronic gadgetry has led most Japanese to forsake the traditional simple and elegant house of wooden walls heavy tiled roofs tatami mat floors and sliding panels for a modern Western style house designed to exchange the austerity of the past for the prosperity of the future Japan lies on the Pacific Rim at the edge of Asia It comprises four main islands dominated by Honshu with Hokkaido to the north Shikoku across the narrow Inland Sea and Kyushu to the southwest Together with more than 3 900 smaller islands from northeast to southwest the archipelago would stretch from Montreal all the way down to Miami The climate correspondingly varies from the snowy northern tip of Hokkaido which offers excellent skiing to the subtropical region of southern Kyushu and Okinawa with its popular coral reefs Honshu the main island and home to Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka enjoys a temperate climate of unusually distinct seasons bitter winters and hot humid summers Winters are milder and sunnier on the Pacific coast permitting a welcome double crop of the all important staple rice One advantage of living on what amounts to a long string of volcanoes is the proliferation of onsen or hot springs The profusion of these natural phenomena has long made taking the waters an integral aspect of Japanese culture and lifestyle Onsen range from naturally occurring outdoor rockpools to large hotel style resorts designed for guests to cast aside the stresses of the outside world as they soak for hours in communal hot tubs Spending at least one night in a traditional Japanese inn style onsen is an experience every visitor should enjoy The jagged mountain ranges and dense forests leave less than two fifths of the country suitable for habitation and farming Japan s 120 million inhabitants have to crowd the coastal plains and the narrow river valleys despite a total land area greater than Germany s In terms of the ratio of population to usable land Japan is the most densely populated country in the world Does such crowding account for Japan s legendary tradition of politeness self discipline and resigned acceptance In some ways this is the only way to make an intolerable situation somehow manageable Visitors are amazed at the apparent harmony that reigns amid the bustle of city life especially the absence of the levels of violent crime that seems endemic in much of the rest of the developed world But as with many theories the reality is less straightforward Crime rates are rising especially violent crimes involving the young Even sexual assaults are increasing although this might reflect a reduction of social stigma in what remains a deeply conservative society where previously the number of reported incidents was severely constrained Still Japan remains one of the safest countries in the world to live or visit Historians and sociologists like to explain it all as a continuation of the feudal spirit of rigidly reinforced social hierarchies with company presidents as latter day shoguns and middle management as reincarnated samurai warriors Whatever the validity of such parallels the prevailing social harmony clearly owes much to the homogeneity of the Japanese population From a stock of Mongolian Chinese Korean and perhaps also Malay settlers the country has had several thousand years to develop a solidly unified ethnicity Japan has never experienced the kind of large scale immigration or even until the postwar US occupation from 1945 to 1952 foreign invasion that has made for social conflict in other countries But this does not mean Japanese society has remained totally free of social discrimination The country s 670 000 Koreans many of them residents of Japan for two or more generations regularly protest against their second class status The Ainu an ethnically distinct community regarded by anthropologists as the islands original settlers and now grouped almost exclusively in Hokkaido campaign for civil rights in a movement similar to that of Native Americans in the US A third group not of different ethnic origin from the Japanese mainstream but unquestionably inferior in status are the burakumin village dwellers a euphemism for their old caste name meaning much filth which was officially abolished at the end of the 19th century They are descendants of outcasts employed to perform the originally taboo and still disdained trades of butchery leatherwork garbage collection and the handling of corpses They live in separate hamlets or on city outskirts 400 000 in Tokyo and an estimated 3 million throughout the country You re most likely to come across them cleaning up garbage in parks and temple grounds or shining shoes at railway stations For weeks after the Kobe earthquake in 1995 mounds of garbage lay uncollected despite the quick resumption of other basic services Why One of the worst hit districts was Nada ku a burakumin stronghold that suffered a high casualty and death toll For centuries the Japanese national spirit called yamato damashii embodied in its best sense the honor endurance and loyalty expected of every good Japanese The militarist regime of the 1930s blatantly manipulated the concept to prepare the country for war and regional domination and to convince the people of their innate superiority over the enemy The subsequent disillusionment has diluted yamato damashii as an ideal in the eyes of today s younger generation Despite the renowned management methods and worker efficiency that drove the country s spectacular postwar recovery many wonder whether traditional Japan s collectivist values can appeal to new generations seeking greater individualism and a more prominent role in the running of family company and society The constant clash between modern and traditional values leads to the numerous fascinating contradictions you will encounter in Japan A long history of absorbing outside influences has resulted in a society in which people expect to have a Shinto baptism a pseudo Christian wedding usually held in a hotel chapel and officiated by an unordained foreigner in a robe and a Buddhist funeral As in centuries past people go on mass pilgrimages to witness the spring blossoming of the famous cherry trees or the flaming golds reds and ochres of the autumn maples But they also don t seem to mind when the tranquillity of a Zen temple rock garden is shattered by recorded announcements blaring from loudspeakers parroting the information already contained in the leaflets provided at the ticket office when heavy metal pop music loudly emanates from the radio of the middle aged owner of a corner grocery store and when parks gardens and hallowed temples are ringed by garish souvenir shops whose shelves display both the tastefully understated and the hideously kitsch If you think fanatical following accorded baseball suggests that Japanese society is hopelessly Americanized you should see what happens when a 15 day sumo wrestling tournament is held in cities around the country The centuries old ceremony and ritual are more than a match for the razzmatazz of the American import The slow motion instant replay of a pair of 150 kg 330 pound sumo champions hurling each other across the ring with an utchari backward pivot throw can be sheer poetry in motion Businessmen who by day rule their companies can still despite a recession that has hit the late night entertainment industry hard be seen in nightclubs being pampered by fawning hostesses giggling over countless glasses of whisky or sake and singing karaoke versions of Frank Sinatra s I Did It My Way only to collapse in a disheveled heap on the last train home People who might have spent their day controlling precision systems to turn out cars cameras or computer chips sit glassy eyed and transfixed in front of a pachinko pinball machine doing nothing but watching hundreds of little metal balls going nowhere Back home wives who at first seem passive and subservient are formidably powerful mothers and homemakers driving their children to scholastic success through examination hell Over this amazing cornucopia presides Emperor Akihito His father Hirohito was until 1946 considered a divinity the living descendant of the gods that created Japan or ancient Yamato as it is more evocatively known The emperor s role today is mainly symbolic not unlike that of a modern European monarch But the imperial family remains largely out of sight never giving an opinion wholly removed from the daily life of their increasingly beleaguered subjects This is a far cry from the assertive Emperor Meiji whose radical social and political policies in the late 19th century launched Japan into the modern era So instead of trying to understand Japan forget the bizarre theories of Japaneseness just open your eyes your ears and of course your mind Savor the delicacy of the cuisine which at its finest is truly a feast for a ll the senses Take in the formal beauties of kabuki theater Zen rock gardens and ikebana flower arrangements struggle to stay awake through an entire noh performance Participate in the graceful tea ceremony or watch the dazzling display of skill in kendo stick fighting with its impressively fierce battle cries Wherever you go you will have the chance to admire or criticize to confirm stereotypes or to note exceptions This book has been specifically designed to guide the curious visitor to the myriad aspects of the real Japan whatever that might be Japan is a country where the intriguing the exotic and the utterly baffling are commonplace where little can be taken at face value Yet few people are so warmly welcoming of strangers as the Japanese Ultimately visitors who remain open minded and ready for adventure will be rewarded by unexpected and unforgettable experiences available nowhere else on the planet Welcome to Japan
