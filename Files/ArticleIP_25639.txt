 Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence Please settle an ongoing dispute between my husband and me My husband believes it is OK to floss his teeth while driving his car I am not making this up His teeth are very nice but I believe this activity should be restricted to the privacy of the bathroom only He does not see a problem doing this in public Please respond Sincerely Mrs Floss Dear Mrs Prudie hesitates to ask what he is steering the car with Flossing is not a one handed maneuver You are correct that it is not an activity meant for public viewing but more important seeing to one s dental hygiene while driving a car poses a threat to oneself as well as to others Do tell Mr Floss that Prudie implores him to find four minutes to do his admirable oral upkeep when he is outside of his automobile Prudie nervously Dear Prudie I usually agree with your advice 100 percent but there were two cases where I d have suggested something different I wonder if we actually disagree or if my solutions just didn t occur to you For the woman put off by her old I agree that the best solution would be for the roommate to change her ways but leveling with her would more than likely end the friendship It sounds as if things are just fine as long as your correspondent doesn t have to visit her friend s house So why not just develop a convenient cat allergy The white lie is a time honored solution for situations like this And for the person who wants to keep weight off but can t control what s served at dinner parties it s only good manners to eat what your host serves you with gusto and gratitude You can fast the next day Well OK one bowl of Special K with skim milk Just a thought or rather two I m a Southerner and Manners Are Our Thing Dear I m Thank you for being a Prudie White lies are indeed meant for situations like this but in the case of Nauseously Yours there is the chance that straight shooting would be of real help to the roommate living in filth As for scarfing down whatever party fare is offered Prudie will split the difference with you Granted one can t get into terrible trouble with an indulgence now and then assuming one is eating conscientiously but to inhale a whole meal of rich food is counterproductive Let s say that when at a dinner party where the sky s the limit calorie wise it is permissible to treat oneself to something particularly wonderful which of course would involve small tastes of everything wouldn t it Prudie moderately Dear Prudence I d like to rely on your unwavering good taste and style to answer a fashion question Does the rule of no white clothing before Memorial Day and after Labor Day still apply I learned at a very young age that dressing in white clothing before Memorial Day or after Labor Day was inappropriate Are the standards still alive or are we living under the rule of the casual Friday ilk that has pervaded the standards of dress Waiting on Hat Pins and Darning Needles for Your Reply Dear Wait Prudie supposes that the calendar s rules regarding white are still operative for the old guard Even for them however fashion has weighed in with a wild card winter white To be perfectly candid with you though Prudie s own style sense veers toward the more individual Wear what is flattering and what you like This is why no one has seen Prudie s knees in eons Prudie sartorially Dear Prudence Whatever happened to courtesy When I am out and about whether getting food or shopping for other goods I seem to encounter clerks who equate There you go with Thank you I can t tell you how many times I have heard There you go as I am handed my change or my bag with no thanks given There you go seems to imply Get the hell out whereas a thank you is an appreciation of my helping to keep the staff employed I am not some crotchety old fool I have worked retail for several years myself and I say Thank you because I realize that if I do not act appreciatively the customer may well go on down the road Thank you for you time Courteous Carol Dear Court My dear with all due respect Prudie thinks you have the wrong take on this Actually Prudie finds There you go to be a rather chipper bon voyage at the end of one s transaction Have you noticed how certain phrases seem to take hold Like Have a nice day which Prudie happens to loathe There you go is simply one more evolution of our spoken language perhaps meant to refresh commonly said things You are correct of course that a thank you is always appropriate but that does not mean a substitute phrase is improper Prudie frankly cannot fathom how you ve decided that There you go is code for Get the hell out All you can do really is not go there yourself when speaking Prudie linguistically
