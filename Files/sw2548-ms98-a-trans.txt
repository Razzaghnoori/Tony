                    what kind of car do you drive now   i drive a Honda Prelude and   do you i drive a Honda Accord   oh yeah   yeah   i bought mine a year ago so im not buying a car any time soon   yeah me either i just bought mine uh itll be a year in August   yeah   i love it though i love Hondas   yeah it   i think i found my car   well i i like where all the controls are   right   theyre theyre in good spots and i i have an automatic i cant drive a standard   oh really i have a standard   yeah but um i its and its supposedly real reliable the only thing ive ever heard about Hondas is that the breaks go out first yeah   oh really i hadnt heard that   yeah   what did you have before you bought that   i had a Buick Regal   did you      yeah      i had uh Mazda RX seven before that and that was the worse car ive ever driven in my life   the Buick was was great it was nine years old and and it was still going strong the only   really   problems i had had with it in nine years that i owned it i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old   really   and that was the only major problem that i had i mean i had little piddly things like i had to replace the muffler and i had replaced the tires and   yeah   uh seems like it had a radiator leak once but i never had any major anything other than the compressor   right i never really had anything major with my Mazda but it was a standard also and the clutch went out on it toward the end i had it five years and the last year or last two years it seemed to go out really easily i think it went out twice in two years       and thats thats a lot it shouldnt go out that much   no hm   and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the Honda but i dont think im going to do that again i think im going back to automatic now   well i never well well i kind of know how to drive standard but ive never owned one so i hadnt i dont drive one a lot so i dont feel feel comfortable in traffic with it   right right   and for everything ive heard its a lot easier to sell an automatic   yeah it is   and   thats true   and resale value is really important to me   yeah it is me too thats why i got the Honda Hondas have great resale value     yeah yeah   the Mazda definitely did not  not at all       theyre worse than American cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes   really i did pretty well with my uh Regal because it was in really good shape but it still looked real nice the the interior was still really nice there whatn cracks all over the dash board and stuff and   yeah right   and it had some some nice features so i ended up okay with the Buick   good   and i anticipate the same thing with the Honda whenever i decide to sell it course i may never sell it   right   i may drive it till its dead but   yeah thats what i did with the Mazda drive it till the till the clutch went out and the wheels fell off so probably what ill do again   yeah   yeah   but i really like the Hondas i like foreign cars a lot   umhum yeah   i looked at the Mitsubishi Galant i was looking for a four door car having driven the RX seven so long and it was so small   uhhuh   and its really impractical so i wanted something with a real trunk and four doors something easy to get in and out of and i looked at the Galant and those were really nice and you can get them for a great price   yeah   but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through so thats how i ended up with a Honda   oh hm i wasnt even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh i was thinking about buying a Prelude from a friend who was moving to New York or something so and she was gonna sell her car because she didnt need it anymore and it was only like a year old and i had never driven uh a Prelude so i went to a dealership because they had like uh the same year and same model of Prelude on their used car lot and i went and i test drove it   right   and you know i just fell in love with this brand new white Prelude   oh yeah     you know two liter SI with the the sun roof and the moon roof and i i bought it loaded   theyre nice i think oh yeah oh yeah i have to have them loaded i i love all those little things that you dont need but theyre so wonderful   i mean yeah yeah i went there looking at a used car and two days later i bought this car i i felt i felt like       that was the worst impulse that was that was the largest impulse buy i had ever made the other the two other things that ive bought on impulse are VCR and a washer and dryer i go for the big stuff     i would say   yeah i noticed   yeah   mine was definitely not impulse i really needed a new car mine was just its getting worn out i guess from being a sports car i drove it kind of hard   yeah   and i got it right after high school so by the time i traded it in it was ready ready to go   yeah i got i got my Buick as a high school graduation gift   did you   yeah but i i guess this whatn really an impulse i mean buying it right then and you know right quickly was kind of impulsive but id been thinking about buying a new car for three years and i was just scared to   right   i was scared to start taking on payments because the Buick was long since paid for   right thats same with me would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself   buy a  buy a buy a used car sure   like right i i was going to buy one once and i just i worry about whos driven them and what theyve been through and the warranties and things like that just i cant seem to get over that that just bothers me i dont know why   yeah well um like on Hondas they supposedly the maintenance records are supposed to be registered with Honda or whatever and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff   yeah thats true   mean they cant stop you from doing it so   hoping that they do go to a Honda dealership to get them serviced   yeah   yeah   well and even if they didnt you can still get a good idea from a if you can get a good mechanic to check it over real carefully and check the blocks and everything   yeah thats true   so   well i guess thats all   okay well i enjoyed talking to you   i enjoyed talking to you byebye      byebye
