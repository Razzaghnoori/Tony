                well uh i dont know i think the budget is really out of hand right now and especially in this election year i think that uh       there ought to be some at least some conversation about what we are supposed to do about this   umhum yeah see it like seems to me you know that everyones offering you know their token little tax cut program you know when its when its just such a bad time for it you know   right right and uh well as you said mostly they are token cuts uh especially what for instance George Bush is offering   no it the ninety seven cents a week   yeah ninety seven cents a week now what thats really not gonna do a lot of good it doesnt seem to me to your average middle income person you know another ninety seven cents hell you can buy a Coke or something for that   uhhuh hell i mean mostly you know its its not actually a a a cut its just a cut in the with hold in the amount with held you know   yeah   um yeah i dont just dont see it changing my life style a whole lot   nah that ninety seven cents really isnt gonna do it for me either uh     umhum      i i havent really heard much of what the other people other candidates have said that has made a lot of sense to me either especially the Democratic candidates uh dont seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah maybe that could       do something to affect our budget at this point   umhum yeah i mean you know in in retrospect um was it was it Mondale or Dukakis that said you know ill ill tell you right now im gonna raise taxes   i believe it was Dukakis but i i cant   it was Dukakis yeah i have a lot of respect for him   yeah i mean thats better than George Bush who came out and said no i will not read my lips or whatever and then you know ten months later he said well sorry you know i i cant follow through on this but it seems to me that uh   yeah umhum umhum   that the budget is so out of hand and especially now that they say okay the cold war is over and were supposed to be getting a peace dividend of you know of X number of billion trillion dollars a year well id really like to know where where that money is actually gonna go because   umhum     in my opinion i dont think im ever gonna see any of this peace so called peace dividend   oh yeah  i know it its   i mean if they could actually put put something together and make im not really in favor of large government social programs either because i feel that they waste money also but with this peace dividend it seems like you could set up some kind of like public works   umhum umhum     projects like they had in the thirties or whatever   oh yeah i i i i i think that would be a great idea you know like the conservation corps you know where it would it would it would help unemployment greatly   right exactly exactly and in that way we could really focus on building the infrastructure structure of the country   and it   yeah our infrastructure is in is in i mean we weve weve hurt ourselves incredibly over the last fifty fifty years of the cold war yeah   yeah and and theres no way that we can ever really recover from from the state that were in right now unless at least i feel unless we focus on the infrastructure and i surely dont hear anybody saying that right now   umhum umhum um yeah i i agree totally  um       i mean we this this it just seems so you know so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen um i im in college right now and oh really where do you go   so am i uh IU   right i go to Georgia Tech um and in my i had political you know the required political science class a couple of years ago   uhhuh umhum   and one of the things we discussed was you know were where the budget situation how how the budget situation just got so out of hand and essentially what happened was and i think it was like in eighty in the um tax year of eighty one um   right   Ronald Reagan basically said you know im gonna give this much of a tax cut to the tax payers and and created this this ludicrous budget that he knew that that um that the Congress would not in the right mind pass and Congress Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a the Democratic Congress realizing that they were gonna lose a propaganda war you know by by you know slicing by by removing the tax cut   right uhhuh   further cut the taxes and created you know that that that you know what created the the huge deficit that year which moved us into the trillion dollar deficit   right   and you just  i mean its just   you you just have to wonder what theyre thinking in Washington   i mean its just like you know playing chicken with a loaded gun   yeah uh well its its more than a loaded its a loaded cannon i mean theyve got trillions of dollars to spend every year and they in my opinion dont do a very responsible job of spending that money   yeah umhum well yeah and what really bothers me is it just seems like if if anyone were to say you know well im gonna raise taxes and cut the budget and were gonna have you know were were gonna were gonna have to do some unpopular things i mean he wouldnt have a chance of getting elected   oh no   i mean its kind of like Rome and the bread and circuses thing you know where where people just want want to have   uhhuh   you know what ever will make them feel good right now you know and   for the for the moment and thats what really is getting me about what George Bushs stand on the budget is right now is that he is saying i am gonna give you this ludicrous little tax cut so that youll be happy come November and youll elect me again     umhum umhum   and then im gonna go on and just forget everything that i said or you know it doesnt seem that its gonna make much of a difference   umhum umhum yeah that i mean i dont know i i i dont i dont think George Bush will make the American people happy with ninety seven cents a week   no no not at all   well i just dont think it was a well thought out incentive   no
