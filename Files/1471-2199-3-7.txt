 Background The human FHIT gene located at the chromosome 3 fragile site FRA3B is inactivated early in the development of many tumors 1 Murine Fhit is also located at a fragile site 2 3 and mice heterozygous for disruption of Fhit given low intragastric doses of the mutagen N nitrosomethylbenzylamine develop stomach and sebaceous tumors 4 that can be prevented by viral Fhit expression 5 Fhit a dimer of 147 amino acid subunits is a member of the histidine triad HIT superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and transferases 6 7 Members of the Hint branch of the HIT superfamily are found in all forms of life 8 The S cerevisiae Hint homolog Hnt1 and rabbit Hint possess adenosine monophosphoramidase activity that functions in yeast to positively regulate function of Kin28 Ccl1 and Tfb3 which constitute the kinase component of general transcription factor TFIIH 9 A new Hint related protein Aprataxin is mutated in individuals with ataxia with oculomotor apraxia 10 11 and has a yeast homolog termed Hnt3 9 Members of the Fhit branch of the HIT superfamily have been found in fungi 12 13 animals 2 14 15 and plants 7 and hydrolyze diadenosine tetraphosphate diadenosine triphosphate and other 5 5 dinucleoside polyphosphates The middle histidine of the histidine triad His96 in human Fhit which is critical for hydrolysis of ApppA by Fhit 14 16 is not necessary for tumor suppression 17 18 Nonetheless wild type and His96Asn forms of Fhit are saturated by ApppA in the low micromolar range and form stable complexes with non hydrolyzable ApppA in which two ApppA analogs are bound per Fhit dimer and all phosphates cluster on one surface of the protein 16 These observations suggested that Fhit substrate complexes may be the active signaling form of Fhit and that the function of the catalytically essential histidine may be to terminate the lifetime of signaling complexes 16 Given that neither transcriptional nor post transcriptional regulation has been reported for Fhit protein the level of biological activity of Fhit may be controlled by levels of Fhit substrates inhibitors and proteins that interact with Fhit nucleotide complexes Fhit proteins from humans 19 and worms 15 bind ApppA and AppppA with K m values of 2 to 3 M Human Fhit 14 and the S cerevisiae Fhit homolog 13 which was called Aph1 but is here termed Hnt2 under nomenclature aproved by the Saccharomyces Genome Database cleave ApppA more readily while Aph1 the S pombe homolog cleaves AppppA more readily 20 Consistent with the ApppA hydrolase activity of purified Fhit protein most cancer cell lines that are Fhit negative at the protein level have higher levels of ApppA than cell lines that are Fhit positive 21 Nonetheless the actual concentrations of dinucleoside polyphosphates were submicromolar in every cell culture sample 21 and thus under the reported culture conditions the measured dinucleoside polyphosphates would not be expected to occupy the Fhit active site substantially 19 Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels were measured in adenine requiring S cerevisiae strains before or after disruption of the Fhit homologous HNT2 gene 13 and in adenine requiring S pombe strains as a function of disruption and overexpression of the Fhit homologous aph1 gene 22 Recently it was observed that diadenosine polyphosphates undergo a divalent cation dependent conformational change that might mediate their biosynthesis catabolism or signaling properties 23 Here we discover a requirement of adenine biosynthesis for high level dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation in the absence of the Fhit homolog in S cerevisiae By constructing active site mutants of Hnt2 that were expressed in yeast we demonstrate that ApppN and to a lesser degree AppppN levels are controlled by the Hnt2 active site An added benefit of these constructions is the availability of yeast strains that possess high levels of dinucleoside polyphosphates and at the same time express a mutant Fhit homologous protein because these are conditions which have been postulated to constitute the signaling form of Fhit 16 Finally using controlled genotypes we revisited conditions that lead to increased accumulation of dinucleoside polyphosphates 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 Recognizing that hnt2 deletion is a pathological condition we were particular interested in identifying conditions that lead to accumulation of such compounds in cells that contain a functional HNT2 gene rather than simply identifying conditions that produce diadenosine polyphosphate accumulation in the absence of Hnt2 While cells without a functional HNT2 gene accumulate dinucleoside polyphosphates in excess of 10 M in a variety of nonstressed and stressed conditions 46 C heat shock was the only condition that produced dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation in excess of 10 M in cells containing a functional HNT2 gene These conditions did not render the cells conditionally null for Hnt2 because cells expressing HNT2 continued to limit dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation during hours of heat shock though at levels of 0 1 mM Recently discovery that the Hint homologous HNT1 gene is required for high temperature growth on galactose and observations that alleles of cak1 kin28 ccl1 and tfb3 are hypersensitive to loss of Hnt1 enzyme activity provided evidence that Hnt1 enzyme activity positively regulates Kin28 function particularly on galactose media 9 Though phenotypic consequences of hnt2 mutations have yet to be discovered our observations suggest that synthetic lethal interactions with hnt2 mutations are likely to be found in adenine prototrophic strains undergoing heat shock Results and discussion Disruption of HNT2and tetrad analysis of dinucleoside polyphosphate levels An earlier report demonstrated that disruption of HNT2 was tolerated by haploid yeast strains without an effect on growth and that ApppN and AppppN accumulate 30 and 3 fold respectively on account of the hnt2 deletion 13 Because those data were obtained by random spore analysis we considered it important to test whether elevated dinucleoside polyphosphate levels co segregate with hnt2 disruption in all tetrads examined and whether any other commonly used genetic markers affect dinucleoside polyphosphate levels Diploid strain BY71 Table 1 created to be heterozygous for MAT ADE2 HIS3 LEU2 LYS2 MET15 TRP1 URA3 and HNT2 was allowed to sporulate and was then dissected As shown in Figure 1 tetrads produced four viable colonies two of which were large and white and two of which were smaller and pink on YPD medium which scored as ade on SDC ade medium Markers segregated 2 2 in nearly all cases and possession of a 1976 bp PCR fragment using primers 4726 and 4722 always correlated with geneticin resistance while possession of a 1200 bp product correlated with geneticin sensitivity as expected for segregants containing a nondisrupted HNT2 gene Haploid segregants from three complete tetrads were cultured for 24 48 and 72 hours in SDC medium lysed and levels of ApppN and AppppN were determined As shown in Table 2 strains containing an intact HNT2 gene were never observed to have calculated intracellular ApppN levels above 3 M and typically were found to have ApppN levels below 1 M Strains disrupted for hnt2 had ApppN levels of approximately 6 to 43 M after one day of culture rising to approximately 30 to 300 M and 50 to 350 M after two and three days of culture respectively The ade2 mutation was partially epistatic to the effect of hnt2 disruption on ApppN accumulation hnt2 strains containing ade2 mutations were several fold lower in ApppN accumulation than hnt2 ADE2 isolates Thus deletion of hnt2 afforded a 48 fold increase in ApppN in ade2 mutants consistent with an earlier report of a 31 fold effect 13 but a 211 fold increase in ADE2 strains Earlier hnt2 deletion was reported to increase AppppN levels only 2 5 fold but the study was performed in ade2 mutants 13 Consistent with that report the three hnt2 ade2 strains showed only a 2 fold higher AppppN level than the three HNT2 ade2 strains when nucleotide levels were averaged across the three time points In contrast hnt2 ADE2 strains achieved a 3 7 fold higher level of AppppN than HNT2 ADE2 strains Larger increases in AppppN concentrations have been seen with disruption of Apa1 and Apa2 the diadenosine tetraphosphate phosphorylases in S cerevisiae 34 35 indicating that they have a more significant role in controlling AppppN levels than does Hnt2 In the case of disruption of the Fhit and Hnt2 homologous aph1 gene in S pombe which encodes an enzyme relatively specific for a AppppA 20 a 290 fold increase in AppppA concentration was observed 22 Our data indicate that Hnt2 hydrolyzes ApppN and AppppN in vivo in budding yeast and that an intact adenine biosynthetic pathway is required for high level synthesis and accumulation of adenylylated dinucleoside polyphosphates Hnt2 active site dependence of dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation Catalytic activity of the Fhit ApppA hydrolase depends on His96 14 16 To test whether the active site of Hnt2 is necessary to control dinucleoside polyphosphate accumulation in vivo wild type and mutant alleles of HNT2 that differ at His109 corresponding to human Fhit His96 were expressed from the HNT2 promoter on plasmids Table 3 in hnt2 ADE2 strain BY71 6c As shown in Table 4 reintroduction of wild type HNT2 produced a 40 to 125 fold reduction in intracellular concentrations of ApppN and a two to seven fold reduction in levels of AppppN This reduction was active site dependent adding back multicopy HNT2 with the nucleophilic histidine replaced by alanine or aspartate reduced dinucleoside polyphosphate levels less than two fold Dinucleoside polyphosphate levels may not be limited by the levels of lysyl tRNA synthetase AppppA is induced by heat shock in bacteria 36 and the induction of AppppA was thought to be a function of the heat shock inducible LysU lysyl tRNA synthetase However deletion of lysU had no effect on heat shock inducible AppppA accumulation 37 The KRS1 gene 38 encoding cytosolic lysyl tRNA synthetase was cloned into multicopy plasmid pRS423 39 to generate plasmid pM1 Strains BY71 16d ADE2 HNT2 and BY71 6c ADE2 hnt2 were transformed with pM1 and the pRS423 control plasmid and cultures were harvested at 24 48 and 72 hours Determination of ApppN and AppppN concentrations revealed that ApppN levels are substantially higher in hnt2 mutants than in isogenic wild types at all time points and that plasmids conferring multiple copies of KRS1 did not increase ApppN or AppppN levels at any culture time point Table 5 To address whether plasmid pM1 indeed increased lysyl tRNA synthetase activity lysates from pRS423 and pM1 transformed BY71 6c were assayed for incorporation of 3H lysine into yeast tRNA As shown in Figure 2 tRNA dependent lysine incorporation was increased 2 1 fold by expression of KRS1 from a multicopy plasmid Heat shock is the most effective stress for elevation of dinucleoside polyphosphates In the wild and in the laboratory yeast are exposed to stresses such as hypo osmotic or hyperosmotic conditions toxic cations heat shock and cell cycle disruptive reagents To test whether such conditions induce dinucleoside polyphosphates in hnt2 or Hnt2 cells we incubated ADE2 hnt2 and ADE2 HNT2 cells in water 1 M sorbitol 2 mM CdCl 2 46 C heat shock 10 mM caffeine or in rich media for two hours and determined dinucleoside polyphosphate levels Additionally to test whether moderate overexpression of the lysyl tRNA synthetase gene affected accumulation we compared control transformants to multicopy KRS1 transformants of the two strains As shown in Table 6 the hnt2 samples had substantially higher ApppN levels than HNT2 samples under all conditions Among the hnt2 samples only heat shocked samples showed evidence of ApppN levels higher than the levels in nonstressed hnt2 cells Similarly among the HNT2 samples the heat shocked samples showed increased ApppN levels compared with control treated cells while CdCl 2 and other treated samples showed no significant changes KRS1 on a multicopy plasmid showed no significant alteration of ApppN levels in any sample As with other experiments AppppN levels were lower than ApppN levels in all cases Heat shock was the best inducer of AppppN Hypotonic hypertonic and caffeine treated media produced no increase in AppppN not shown To further investigate the kinetics of heat shock and cadmium induction of ApppN and AppppN levels we transformed hnt2 ADE2 strain BY71 6c with multicopy plasmids containing no HNT2 gene the wild type HNT2 gene or the HNT2 His109Ala or HNT2 His109Asp alleles of HNT2 Cultures were exposed to either 2 mM CdCl 2 or 46 C heat shock and intracellular concentrations of ApppN and AppppN were determined at 30 minute timepoints As shown in Figure 3 ApppN and AppppN levels are higher in hnt2 strains than in cells with a functional HNT2 gene and were not significantly elevated by 2 mM CdCl 2 However when cells were heat shocked as shown in Figure 4 ApppN and AppppN levels increased substantially in cultures with every HNT2 genotype absence presence or active site mutation Increases in dinucleoside polyphosphates in Hnt2 cultures cannot be attributed to thermal inactivation of Hnt2 because the presence of HNT2 plasmids continues to reduce incremental increases in dinucleoside polyphosphates even in the fourth hour of the heat shock Furthermore the active site mutant alleles of HNT2 HNT2 His109Ala and HNT2 His109Asp provided on plasmids pB32 and pB86 demonstrated intermediate abilities to control dinucleoside polyphosphate levels suggesting that elevated temperature reduces the catalytic defects of these mutant enzymes The high levels of ApppN 100 M and AppppN 10 M and the fact that Hnt2 containing samples continue to reduce the rate of increase in dinucleoside polyphosphates without reducing their concentrations demonstrate that heat shock induces dinucleoside polyphosphate synthesis and that Hnt2 is saturated under such conditions In Xenopus oocytes however some work has suggested that heat shock dependent accumulation of AppppN is largely due to inactivation of degradative enzymes 30 Conclusions It had been reported that Hnt2 controls ApppN levels in vivo with a minor effect on AppppN 13 Here we show that the ade2 mutation present in earlier experiments prevents accumulation of ApppN and AppppN and reduced the magnitude of the Hnt2 effect In ADE2 strains examined herein deletion of HNT2 increased levels of ApppN and AppppN by factors of approximately 200 and 4 respectively Mutagenesis 14 X ray crystallography 16 40 and stereochemical analysis 41 indicate that His96 is the nucleophile that attacks the phosphate of Fhit substrates Our analysis shows that the corresponding residue His109 of Hnt2 is required for hydrolysis of ApppN and AppppN substrates in vivo Other than effects on the concentrations of intracellular nucleotides neither deletion of HNT2 nor mutation of His109 of HNT2 had phenotypic consequences In the case of the Hint homologous HNT1 gene of S cerevisiae the phenotype of the single mutant was mild and the biological pathway positive regulation of Kin28 the yeast homolog of Cdk7 was revealed by synthetic lethal interactions between hnt1 and hypomorphic alleles of cak1 kin28 ccl1 and tfb3 9 Because backup systems to limit problems with hnt2 mutant cells apparently exist synthetic lethal interactions may be critical to identify the Hnt2 biological pathway Thus if the major function of HNT2 is simply control of dinucleoside polyphosphates lest their accumulation inhibit other enzymes i e McLennan s foe hypothesis 42 then synthetic lethal phenotypes ought to be sought with hnt2 mutant strains that are wild type for the adenine biosynthetic pathway potentially under heat shock conditions On the other hand if the major function of Hnt2 depends on formation of an enzyme substrate complex 16 then synthetic lethal interactions ought to be sought in heat shocked ADE2 HNT2 His109Ala strains In fact because ADE2 HNT2 His109Ala strains have high levels of dinucleoside polyphosphates and an Hnt2 polypeptide such a strain may be sensitized to secondary mutations whether dinucleoside polyphosphates are friend or foe 42 Materials and methods General molecular biology Yeast media and procedures were as described 43 44 S cerevisiae transformations were carried

plasmid pM1 in which KRS1 is oriented anti to HIS3 Plasmids are summarized in Table 3 Measurement of dinucleoside polyphosphate levels Twelve haploid segregants pregrown in liquid SDC medium were inoculated into 250 ml of SDC at starting density of 10 4cells per ml At 24 48 and 72 hours of growth 50 ml of cells were harvested cells counted microscopically lysed and levels of AppppN and ApppN were determined as described 13 Intracellular concentrations of ApppN and AppppN were calculated using 7 10 14l as the volume of a haploid cell 50 Cultures of BY71 6c were transformed with plasmids pRS423 pB05 pB32 and pB86 and transformants were selected on SDC his media Intracellular concentrations of ApppN and AppppN were determined for transformants from cultures in SDC his media as above To determine whether a multicopy lysyl tRNA synthetase plasmid affected accumulation of dinucleoside polyphosphates we transformed HNT2 ADE2 strain BY71 16d and hnt2 ADE2 strain BY71 6c with control plasmid pRS423 and with plasmid pM1 Transformants were grown for 24 48 and 72 hours in SDC his media and intracellular dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations were determined as above To survey dinucleoside polyphosphate induction as a function of potential stress conditions strain BY71 6c was transformed with either pRS423 or pM1 effectively hnt2 and hnt2 YEp KRS1 respectively and strain BY71 16d was transformed with the same plasmids effectively HNT2 and HNT2 YEp KRS1 respectively After 48 hours of culture cells were pelleted and resuspended in either YPD media water SDC his media or the same media supplemented with 2 mM CdCl 2 10 mM caffeine or 1 M sorbitol The SDC his sample was incubated for 2 hours at 46 C while other samples were incubated for 2 hours at room temperature prior to extraction for determination of dinucleoside polyphosphate concentrations To determine the time course of ApppN and AppppN levels as a function of stresses we used strains BY71 16d and BY71

Experiments presented in Tables 2 4 5and 6were performed two three five and three times respectively Experiments presented in Figures 3and 4were performed four times each Because diadenosine polyphosphate levels vary with time in culture generating a higher or lower range of values in independently conducted experiments we did not average values obtained in separate experiments For the
