 Many damaged and mutant polypeptides as well as some normal proteins have a tendency to aggregate in cells Some protein aggregates are capable of dividing and propagating in cells leading to formation of similar aggregates in daughter cells or even in neighboring cells due to infection These self propagating protein aggregates are called prions and constitute the basis of prion diseases The infectious agent in these diseases is an abnormal conformation of the PrP protein PrP Sc which makes it protease resistant and initiates its aggregation Prusiner 1998 The abnormal aggregated species can recruit normal soluble PrP molecules into aggregates thus inactivating them The aggregates of PrP Sc can proliferate within cells and be transmitted to other cells and tissues leading to the spread of neurotoxicity Prion Domains While so far only one prion protein is known in mammals several prion like proteins capable of forming self propagating aggregates have been found in various yeast species The common structural feature of yeast prion proteins is the so called prion domain characterized by the high content of glutamines Q and asparagines N DePace et al 1998 Michelitsch and Weissman 2000 also known as the Q N rich domain The prion domains are the major structural determinants that are solely responsible for the polypeptide aggregation and propagation of the aggregates Interestingly the mammalian PrP Sc is fundamentally different from yeast prions since it lacks a Q N rich domain indicating that distinct structural features are responsible for its ability to form self propagating aggregates The Q N rich domains in yeast prions are transferable in that when fused to a heterologous polypeptide they confer prion properties to this polypeptide With a low probability soluble proteins with prion domains can change conformation to form self propagating aggregates which can be transmitted to daughter cells Lindquist 1997 Figure 1 As with PrP Sc yeast prions efficiently recruit soluble molecules of the same species thus inactivating them Lindquist 1997 Chernoff 2001 Wickner et al 2001 Also with low probability the aggregation prone conformation of yeast prion proteins can reverse to a soluble functional conformation Certain yeast prion proteins when in soluble conformation function in important pathways e g Sup35 forming PSI prion controls termination of translation and Ure2 forming URE3 prion controls some membrane transporter systems Aggregation of these proteins leads to phenotypes e g suppression of nonsense mutations or transport defects inherited in a non Mendelian fashion owing to the nonchromosomal basis of the inheritance Inheriting Variations A remarkable feature of yeast prion proteins is their ability to produce distinct inherited variants of the prion For example PSI prion could exist in several distinct forms that suppress termination of translation to different degrees These variants of yeast prions are analogous to different prion strains of PrP Sc which cause versions of the disease with different incubation periods and different patterns of brain pathology The molecular nature of distinct PrP Sc strains is determined by specific stable conformations of PrP Similarly variants of yeast prions are explained by different stable conformation states of the corresponding prion proteins Chien et al 2003 Strict conformation requirements for aggregate formation can also explain interspecies transmission barriers where prion domains of Sup35 derived from other yeast species cannot cause formation of PSI prion in Saccharomyces cerevisiae in spite of a high degree of homology This observation is very intriguing especially in light of a recent finding that prion conformation of some proteins is required for formation of prions by the other proteins For example for de novo formation of PSI prion a distinct prion RNQ should be present in a cell Derkatch et al 2001 Osherovich and Weissman 2001 probably in order to cross seed Sup35 aggregates This is in spite of relatively limited homology between the prion domains of these proteins The apparent contradiction between the interspecies transmission barriers of very homologous prion proteins and possible cross seeding of aggregates by prion proteins with more limited homology represents an interesting biological problem On the other hand this apparent contradiction may indicate that prion formation is a more complicated process than we currently think and that it may involve many cellular factors What Do Prions Do Although yeast prions have been studied for almost ten years very little is known about their biological significance We do not know the functions of the majority of proteins that can exist as prions Even if a function of prion proteins such as with Sup35 or Ure2 is known we do not understand the biological significance of their prionization i e that they aggregate and propagate in the aggregated form A very intriguing and unexpected finding was that formation of PSI prion causes a wide variety of phenotypic alterations which depend on the strain background True and Lindquist 2000 In fact comparison of yeast strains of different origin each with and without PSI prion showed that certain strains with PSI prion have different sensitivity to stresses and antibiotics than their non prion derivatives despite their genetic identity In some strains cells with PSI prion demonstrated better survival than their non prion counterparts in the presence of inhibitors of translation or microtubules heavy metals low pH and other deleterious conditions which of course gives a strong advantage to the PSI cells It is likely that some genomic mutations could be suppressed and therefore become silent when termination of translation by Sup35 is partially inactivated in PSI prion cells Lindquist 2000 True and Lindquist 2000 PSI could also reveal previously silent mutations or their combinations It was hypothesized that switches between prion and non prion forms of Sup35 enhance survival in fluctuating environments and provide a novel instrument for evolution of new traits Q N Does Not Necessarily a Prion Make Searching genomes of various species demonstrated that a relatively large fraction of proteins between 0 1 and 2 contain Q N rich domains Michelitsch and Weissman 2000 or polyQ or polyN sequences These domains are often found in transcription factors protein kinases and components of vesicular transport The Q N rich domains usually are not evolutionary conserved and their functional role is largely unknown Some of the Q N rich or polyQ domains facilitate aggregation of polypeptides especially if expanded owing to mutations Such expansion of the polyQ domains in certain neuronal proteins could cause neurodegenerative disorders e g Huntington s disease or several forms of ataxia Importantly aggregates formed by polypeptides with the Q N rich or polyQ domains are not necessarily self propagating aggregates i e prions In fact there are additional structural properties of the polypeptides that provide the self propagation see below Even if a protein with a polyQ domain does not form a prion its aggregation may depend on certain prions For example recent experiments demonstrated that RNQ prion dramatically stimulated aggregation of fragments of recombinant human huntingtin or ataxin 3 with an expanded polyQ domain cloned in yeast Osherovich and Weissman 2001 Meriin et al 2002 RNQ facilitated the nucleation phase of the huntingtin fragment aggregation suggesting that this prion can be directly involved in seeding of the aggregates The major question now is whether there are analogous prion like proteins in mammalian cells that are involved in aggregation of huntingtin or ataxin 3 and subsequent neurodegenerative disease The first indication that mammalian proteins with Q N rich domains can form self propagating prions came from recent work with a regulator of translation cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein CPEB from Aplysia neurons Si et al 2003 The neuronal form of this protein has a Q N rich domain similar to the prion domains of yeast prions The Q N rich domain from CPEB CPEBQ when fused to green fluorescent protein GFP conferred upon it prion like properties The CPEBQ GFP fusion polypeptide existed in yeast cells in one of the three distinct states i e soluble many small aggregates or few large aggregates Mother cells almost always gave rise to daughter cells in which the CPEBQ GFP polypeptide was in the same state indicating the ability of these aggregates to be inherited i e to self propagate Furthermore full length Aplysia CPEB protein when cloned in yeast can also exist in two distinct states soluble and aggregated which is an inherited feature Very unexpectedly unlike other prions the aggregated state of CPEB was more functionally active than the soluble form Si et al 2003 These data strongly suggest that metazoan proteins with Q N rich domains are potentially capable of forming prions The challenge now will be to establish whether CPEB can exist as a self propagating aggregate in Aplysia or mammalian neurons Mystery of Propagation What makes protein aggregates in yeast propagate The key cellular element that is critical for this process is molecular chaperone Hsp104 Chernoff et al 1995 This factor is specifically required for maintenance of all known prions within generations and probably is not involved in prion formation i e initial protein aggregation PSI yeast cells have about 60 seeds of this prion although this number differed in different PSI isolates and maintenance of about this number of seeds after cell divisions requires functional Hsp104 Eaglestone et al 2000 In fact in the absence of Hsp104 prion aggregates continue to grow without increase in number and are rapidly lost in generations Wegrzyn et al 2001 Since this chaperone can directly bind to protein aggregates and promote there disassembly Glover and Lindquist 1998 it was suggested that the main function of Hsp104 in prion inheritance is to disaggregate large prion aggregates to smaller elements thus leading to formation of new seeds Kushnirov and Ter Avanesyan 1998 Interestingly although Hsp104 is conserved among bacteria fungi and plants animal cells do not have this chaperone or its close homologs Therefore if yeast type prions with Q N rich domains exist in animal cells there should be alternative factors that disaggregate large prion aggregates into smaller species in order to keep the number of seeds relatively constant and thus maintain the prions The fact that some proteins with Q N rich domains form self propagating aggregates while others can aggregate but cannot form prions suggests that there should be some structural elements either within the Q N rich sequence or close to it that confer the ability to propagate In an article in this issue of PLoS Biology by Osherovich et al 2004 the authors examined sequence requirements for prion formation and maintenance of two prion proteins Sup35 and New1 They noted that both prion proteins contain an oligopeptide repeat QGGYQ in close proximity to Q N rich sequences and examined the functional significance of the repeats for aggregation and maintenance of the prions In New1 in contrast to a deletion of the N rich domain deletion of the repeat did not affect aggregation of the protein or formation of the prion but abrogated inheritance of the prion With Sup35 the situation was somewhat more complicated since repeats adjacent to Q N rich domain affected both protein aggregation and prion maintenance while more distant repeats affected only the prion inheritance The authors suggested that the oligopeptide repeats facilitate the division of aggregates either by serving as binding sites for Hsp104 or by altering the conformation of the polypeptides in aggregates to promote access for Hsp104 Figure 2 The likely possibility was that the oligopeptide repeats could be interchangeable between different prions leading to creation of novel chimeric prions In fact the authors constructed an F chimera a fusion protein having the N rich domain of New1 and the oligopeptide repeat of Sup35 This fusion polypeptide efficiently formed prion F Furthermore when the oligopeptide repeat sequence was added to a polyQ sequence this fusion polypeptide also acquired the ability to form self propagating aggregates This work therefore clarifies the architecture of prions by defining two structural motifs in prion proteins that have distinct functions in aggregation and propagation Interestingly not all yeast prions have similar oligopeptide repeat motifs indicating that distinct structures could confer prion properties to polypeptides that can aggregate It would be important to identify these structures in order to understand the mechanisms of aggregate propagation The work of Osherovich et al 2004 may help to identify proteins from mammalian cells plants and bacteria that can potentially form prions Finding these novel prions could be of very high significance since they may provide insight into a wide range of currently unexplained epigenetic phenomena
