 Tommy Hilfiger Solos at the Met Have you read the Brooklyn Museum article in the Times is a question Culturebox overheard twice at the press preview of Rock Style an exhibition of rock n roll outfits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art s Costume Institute The show which opens Thursday is the boldest display of corporate muscle and easy museological virtue to appear at a respected New York art institution in oh about two months since Sensation opened at the Brooklyn Museum Rock Style celebrates the influence of rock on fashion deploying to that end an excess of media more often seen on the E channel than in public museums videos a soundtrack floor to ceiling photographs of musicians in full stage regalia that cover several ancient Egyptian frescoes The show was brought to you by Tommy Hilfiger U S A the quasi official couturier to the hip hop generation That means that Hilfiger funded the show of course and also that he served as its principal designer according to the press kit His name is printed in large white letters on the cover of the catalog which he co wrote with Rolling Stone contributor Anthony DeCurtis It was a nice coincidence that Rock Style should preview the same day that the New York Times laid out in sordid detail the kinds of compromises museums make in pursuit of big ticket shows The article revealed that the director of the Brooklyn Museum Arnold Lehman granted the owner of Sensation s artworks Charles Saatchi an astonishing level of control over the show s budget and layout that Saatchi is now claiming that money seemingly donated was actually a loan and that Lehman probably lied to the press as well as to potential donors about exactly how much money Saatchi had contributed and whether Lehman had personally laid eyes on the Sensation show when it was in London The Met is unlikely to suffer similar embarrassment since its director Philippe de Montebello inoculates himself against criticism by being more openly corrupt than Lehman Under Montebello it has become standard practice to ask interested parties to sponsor and curate shows Christian Dior subsidized a show of Dior couture Tiffany paid for a show of Tiffany bibelots Faberg underwrote a show of Faberg eggs jewels and bric a brac for which a Faberg consultant was the guest curator Next to the Metropolitan the Brooklyn Museum looks like a bunch of amateurs Why bicker over artistic control when you can just cede the hall to the sponsor The justification offered by museum directors for shows that double as highbrow advertisements is Hey get real that s the only way museums can afford to get expensive stuff inside its walls No museum except maybe the Getty has an endowment big enough to be free of the marketplace so all other museums have to retail products solicit corporations franchise themselves Glenn Lowry the director of the Museum of Modern Art told a reporter a few years ago It s up to each institution to make sure that none of it affects the content of the exhibitions or the integrity of the museum In light of that excuse Culturebox thinks the following standards should be applied to Rock Style and other shows of its ilk Does it add value above and beyond what you d find in a commercial for the sponsor s product and does hosting it compromise the integrity of the museum In the case of Rock Style the answers to those questions are no and yes It goes without saying though Culturebox will happily say it that the show is a Hilfiger commercial legitimating as art the marketing strategy embraced so successfully by Hilfiger in the past few years which mainly consists of turning rock musicians into fashion models What s notable is that the show s exhibition strategy is essentially the same reducing rockers to clothes horses and without adding an iota of critical perspective The thesis advanced in Rock Style is that individual rockers had a transformative effect on fashion The evidence lies in their stage costumes Elvis Presley s gold lam suit and the Beatles Sgt Pepper s Lonely Hearts Club Band outfits and Janis Joplin s feathery ensembles and George Clinton s outsize rabbit and fox fur coat and David Bowie s metallic clown suit and Madonna s peach colored conical bras and Beck s cream cotton Nehru getup and Tori Amos Tori Amos lilac jumpsuit all looking suitably outrageous if somewhat wilted behind glass The whole glorious spectacle is thrilling to look at even absent the performers For the categorically minded there is a nominal division of styles icons Elvis and the Beatles poets and dreamers Janis the Artist Formerly Known as Prince Bruce Springsteen rebels Lou Reed Alice Cooper Courtney Love and the categories of brilliant disguise Bowie Bono Bj rk and high style Cher Madonna Puff Daddy But fun like this we could have watching old video clips on VH1 The Met after all is supposed to be an educational institution So what do we learn from the show about the history or sociology or even the aesthetics of rock music or fashion Can we say that Janis Joplin s and Jimi Hendrix s romantic thrift store eclecticism created the late hippie look or emerged out of it Ditto with Mick Jagger s and Bowie s androgyny and the disco aesthetic of the late 1970s or Kiss heavy metal goofiness and punk What about rock itself How did it change once music videos made a band s appearance more important than its sound There are no answers because Rock Style s wall captions are stunningly fatuous The concept of the rock artist as poet even visionary endures and many performers uphold the tradition in their music and dress reads a typical one The wall commentary at Costume Institute which was overseen by fashion historian Richard Martin until his death last month has not always been this insipid The bubbleheadedness in this show surely reflects Hilfiger s input The videos etc are no help either The book exhibits a modicum of historical consciousness it s broken up into periods at least But it is also stuffed with Hilfiger s personal reminiscences about serving as designer to the stars which are as presumptuous as they are empty Making clothes for Keith Richards is easy because he knows exactly what he wants In the end all we have to go on are the costumes themselves That s plenty of course Culturebox would never discourage you from going anywhere to see Michael Stipe s gray blue sheer organza suit a beautiful embodiment of androgynous glamour or the wholly deconstructed Edwardian getup Jean Paul Gaultier designed for Madonna with its exuberant bursts of taffeta twill and satin as well as an over the top silk top hat It s hard to keep in one s mind just how out there David Bowie once was so it s instructive to see his black quilted jumpsuit from the mid 1970s the thighs of which are so exaggerated they form a perfect vertical disc then taper in neatly at the knees Get the book which Culturebox forgot to mention is very snazzily designed and give it to the most rock and fashion conscious teen agers you know Just don t expect it to add to their ability to analyze the activity they re so obsessively devoted to Those insights will have to wait for a less synergistic occasion
