 Background Freshwater planarians Platyhelminthes Turbellaria Tricladida are widely employed for pattern formation investigations planaria differ from other models used to study morphogenesis insects nematodes fish amphibians and mammals by their phenomenal ability to regenerate 1 Moreover planaria are used for in vivo tumorogenicity studies of pure compounds and complex environmental mixtures and for mechanistic studies of tumorogenesis 2 Planaria are prospective models for genetic variation studies in populations The planarian species Planariidae family are represented by different strains employing various modes of reproduction including exclusively sexual exclusively asexual or both sexual and asexual 3 4 5 6 Strains that reproduce exclusively asexually are genetically different to strains of the same species able to reproduce both sexually and asexually For instance an asexual strain of Dugesia S mediterranea exhibits morphological heteromorphosis in the third pair of chromosomes 4 Worms belonging to different asexual strains of Dugesia japonica and Girardia formerly Dugesia tigrina are triploid or mixoploid while sexual strains are diploid 5 6 Asexual strains are represented by independent populations that propagate only by fission Recently we supplemented the well known SSH suppression subtractive hybridization technology 7 8 with the Mirror Orientation Selection method MOS for eliminating background clones from SSH generated libraries 9 This innovative procedure allowed the application of these techniques in the subtraction of large eukaryotic genomes including those of freshwater planarian haploid genome size of G tigrina is 1 4 10 9bp 10 Using the SSH MOS combination genomes of two different strains of G tigrina were compared Novel virus like element with unusual features was identified in one planarian strain We characterized the genome structure of the novel element and analyzed its distribution in the planarian body Results Verification of the model Two planarian strains were used for comparison One was an asexual strain maintained as laboratory culture in Moscow Russia for over 20 years Worms belonging to this strain have been successfully used for various experiments including gene discovery 11 12 13 The second strain collected in Russia near Moscow represented sexual planaria capable of both sexual and asexual reproduction The specimens were assigned to G tigrina on the basis of their external appearance 5 14 15 This strain is morphologically similar to the sexual strain collected previously in Spain 5 and like the Spanish animals differs from asexual planaria in their size and details of coloration Unlike asexual animals mature planaria of the sexual strain possess well distinguished reproductive organs and lay fertile cocoons To verify the genetic propinquity of the sexual and asexual planarian strains we analyzed mariner element sequences from the asexual and the sexual specimens Several DNA sequences similar to the mariner element have been reported in G tigrina 10 16 There are about 7000 copies of this element in the genome which appear to code for an active transposase 10 None of these mariner elements are present in the genomes of other turbellarians including the species closest to G tigrina 10 With the aid of PCR using specific primers for the planarian mariner element we isolated and sequenced several clones from sexual and asexual planaria All clones displayed 98 99 identity at the nucleotide level and the differences between sequences of various strains did not exceed the diversity within one strain Based on these data we conclude that the two planarian strains represent a valid model system for studying genetic differences between planarian populations and can be used for the subtractive hybridization of genomes Cloning of PEVE Two subtracted libraries were generated the first enriched with asexual strain specific DNA fragments AS library and the second with sexual strain specific DNA SS library Differential screening revealed 30 and 60 strain specific clones in SS and AS libraries respectively Sequence analyses of selected AS specific clones demonstrated that about 50 contained open reading frames ORFs with codon usage unusual for G tigrina 17 Some of these AS specific ORFs encode polypeptides similar to viral proteins When used as probes in Southern blot hybridization with undigested sexual and asexual planarian DNA these clones stained two relatively low molecular weight DNA bands in asexual specimens only Figure 1 The intensity of hybridization signals was significantly higher more then 100 fold than that for the unique genomic sequence data not shown Our results imply that most AS specific clones are linked to an amplified extrachromosomal virus like element designated PEVE Planarian Extrachromosomal Virus like Element Using PCR with combinations of primers designed from these PEVE sequences and the genome walking approach several overlapping fragments constituting the 7 6 kb contig were isolated PEVE genome organization PCR analyses with PEVE specific primers showed that the putative viral genome comprises two unique regions flanked by inverted repeats specifically Us 1911 bp GenBank Accession No AF364089 and Ul regions Two types of Ul region were identified that displayed some sequence difference Ul1 5699 bp GenBank Accession No AF364090 and Ul2 5695 bp GenBank Accession No AF364091 A schematic diagram of the regions with predicted ORFs is presented in Figure 2A PCR analyses with different combinations of primers specific for PEVE revealed four variants of orientation of Ul and Us relative to one another Figure 2B To purify PEVE DNA the plasmid DNA alkaline lysis method was used Partially purified PEVE DNA was visualized on an agarose gel following ethidium bromide staining Figure 1 Two bands corresponding to two extrachromosomal DNA fragments were detected Southern blot hybridization with different PEVE specific probes revealed that each fragment contained the entire PEVE sequence Figure 1 Using non denaturing Southern blot hybridization on planarian genomic DNA we established that the PEVE Ul sequences hybridized to the lighter fragment whereas Us probes stained the less mobile fragment Figure 1 These results imply that the lighter fragment contains a single stranded ss Ul region and double stranded ds Us region while the less mobile fragment is composed of ss Us and ds Ul sequences Figure 2C Sequence analysis BLAST analyses of identified ORFs showed that two were significantly similar to known viral proteins characteristic of distant viral phyla Other ORFs displayed no significant homology to known proteins The protein encoded by ORF2S designated PEVE E1 is homologous to the helicase domain of superfamily 3 SF3 viral helicases such as E1 proteins of papillomaviruses Figure 3 18 19 20 Similar to SF3 helicases the PEVE E1 domain contains a P loop motif A and two conserved motifs B and C that determine helicase function 18 19 However unlike SF3 helicases PEVE E1 contains only the helicase domain with no additional protein domains The sequence of the ORF4L product denoted PEVE Rep is homologous to circoviral replication initiator Rep proteins Figure 4 Rep proteins of circoviruses nanoviruses and geminiviruses consist of two domains specifically a N terminal nicking domain with conserved motifs 1 2 and 3 and a C terminal SF3 helicase domain conserved motifs A B and C 21 22 Conserved sequence motifs 1 3 are characteristic of Rep proteins that utilize the rolling circle mechanism of replication employed by different groups of viruses circoviruses nanoviruses geminiviruses bacteriophage 174 21 23 24 25 However replication associated proteins of animal parvoviruses which utilize the rolling hairpin mechanism of replication only contain motifs 2 and 3 23 The PEVE Rep protein is considerably similar to circoviral Rep proteins and comprises two domains The C terminus of PEVE Rep contains all three conserved motifs A B and C signifying helicase activity However like animal parvovirus Rep proteins the N terminal part of PEVE Rep contains only conserved motifs 2 and 3 suggesting replication by the rolling hairpin mechanism Distribution of the PEVE element in the planarian body For analysis of PEVE distribution in planarian body a single planarian was cut transversely into six zones as depicted in Figure 5A and six corresponding DNA samples were prepared PCR data from these samples showed that PEVE is distributed unevenly along the worm s body Figure 5 The anterior zones zones 1 and 2 contain lower concentrations of the element than the posterior part of the worm We analyzed the PEVE expression using Northern blot analysis and RT PCR Figure 5 ORF2S and ORF1L probes were used for Northern blot The ORF1L probe hybridized to an about 1000 base poly A message The major transcript revealed by ORF2S probe hybridization was about 850 base For each gene transcript length obtained using Northern blot is consistent with the cDNA length plus a poly A tail assuming the putative promoter positions 1133 1094 for ORF1L and 944 983 for ORF2S and potential polyadenylation signal sequence are utilized RT PCR studies showed that all PEVE ORFs are expressed in planarian body with the same pattern PEVE expression was not detected in the head region and increased from zone 2 to the tail Whole mount in situ hybridization with PEVE RNA probes confirmed the above data PEVE containing cells were not detected in the head region and increased in number from zone 2 to the tail Cells containing PEVE were sparse in unstained parenchyma Figure 6A 6B For ORF1L and ORF2S both sense and antisense riboprobes displayed visible staining figure 6C 6D while in situ hybridization with sense ORF4L probe yielded no signal data not shown We proposed that sense probes can hybridize with PEVE ss DNA while antisense probes can hybridize with both RNA and ss DNA If so there is one polarity of the ss DNA regions within PEVE ORF1L and ORF2S are present in the antisense orientation and their sense probes hybridize with PEVE ss DNA stretches ORF4L exists in the opposite sense orientation within the ssDNA region of PEVE and ORF4L antisense probe hybridizes with both PEVE RNA and ss DNA Examination of PEVE in Spanish asexual planaria We performed PEVE analyses in asexual planaria from an independent Spanish population PCR with PEVE specific primers of genomic DNA and cDNA and Southern blot hybridization on genomic DNA did not reveal PEVE in planaria nucleic acid samples data not shown This indicates that only our asexual planarian population is infected by PEVE Discussion Using the subtractive hybridization technique we identified a novel planarian virus like element PEVE Examination of PEVE genome organization and structure reveals that this virus like element cannot be assigned to any known group of viruses or plasmids and thus represents a novel type of viral element that encodes two helicases in one genome Both putative helicases may be involved in the initiation of DNA replication The proposed scheme of PEVE genomic organization is presented in Figure 2C Based on Southern blot and in situ hybridization data we hypothesize that PEVE exists as two variant forms with different compositions of ss and ds DNA stretches corresponding to the Ul and Us regions The ss stretches are present in a unique orientation and therefore have only one type of polarity The ss Ul region displays sense orientation for ORF4L and antisense for ORF1L while the Us region comprises a strand with all encoded ORFs in an antisense orientation These ss regions are flanked by ds sequences in both orientations PEVE is distributed unevenly along the worm s body Our PCR data reveal very low amounts of the viral like element in the head region The PEVE expression was also detected in central and tail regions and was not found in head region In accordance with in situ hybridization data PEVE is detected in certain differentiated parenchyma cells PEVE is the first viral element identified in free living flatworms This novel element is not widespread in planarian populations and has been detected in only one planarian asexual strain to date However it is possible that similar virus like elements and viruses are present in other planarian strains Although asexual strains of planaria exist independently for a long time they display substantial genetic resemblance In particular the identities of five Antennapedia like homeobox genes have been disclosed from both our and the Spanish asexual strains 11 26 These findings imply that PEVE may affect other asexual strains of planaria thus paving the way for the development of transgenic planaria using the planarian viral sequences as vectors for introduction of exogenous DNA into planarian cells Conclusions We have identified a novel extrachromosomal viral element PEVE in the asexual strain of planarian G tigrina PEVE is the first viral element identified in planaria and comprises two potential helicases that are homologous to proteins from distant viral phyla This element cannot be assigned to any known group of viruses or plasmids PEVE is unevenly distributed in the worm body and is detected in differentiated parenchyma cells Materials
