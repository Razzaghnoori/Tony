        okay hi   hi um yeah id like to talk about how you dress for work and and um what do you normally what type of outfit do you normally have to wear   well i work in uh corporate control so we have to dress kind of nice so i usually wear skirts and sweaters in the winter time slacks i guess  and in the summer just dresses   umhum   we cant even well were not even really supposed to wear jeans very often so it really doesnt vary that much from season to season since the office is kind of you know always the same temperature   and is right right is there is there um any is there a like a code of dress where you work do they ask   so not formally   right   but its kind of understood that were supposed to dress a little bit nice a lot of times we have to go over to uh like Jerry Junkins office and Bill Ellsworths office to deliver stuff   right   and we prepare a lot of foils for Marvin and Bill so  we have to dress a little bit nice were not   right right and does it does it change i guess um you can can you judge like  depending on what you think youll be doing that day   yes now you know if if everybody like in August when everybodys on vacation or something we can dress a little more casual or   right   ice storms of course you know we all came in in our tennis shoes but  i guess that would have to do with the weather but um   yes yeah yeah well it it thats right and it   unless its an extremely you know an unusual day   yeah and it was usually uh also uh where i was it was um in in engineering and and it was it was a casual office there was no formal dress code but   umhum   um uh usually engineers are expected to to dress you know little more professionally it just in case things would come up during the day sometimes unexpected meetings or a client would come in and wanna see you   yeah umhum right   uh other times it could be very casual if you knew you would be at a desk all day and nobody would see you  um   yeah or umhum what area do you work in   uh well i was i was in a uh private consulting firm so um and uh and uh anyway um right now im im not im not there but  but anyway   um okay     um and season really same season to season um uh it changes with the weather you know uh wear light clothing i guess if its hot out but um   it with the yeah but then usually in the summer its cold in the offices because the air conditioners doing its job so well   thats thats true and and i think also that um the women actually have uh uh you have a little bit more variety maybe maybe lighter cotton clothing in the summer and woolens in the winter whereas the   oh yeah   the men often have to wear shirt and tie no matter right right right what time of what time of the year thats right   it uhhuh just suits and theres not a whole lot of fabric variance there and they cant have a rayon suit  so   thats thats true so um do they were were there um are you allowed to um be casual like if it was summer were were you allowed to wear sandals and those that  not really   not really i think i mean its kind of unwritten but i think were supposed to wear hose and and shoes you know most of the people do anyway   right   uh most of the women wear uh most actually most of the women wear suits more than anything else   oh i see uhhuh   but im not in that professional of a position  so i dont im not expected to do that   okay and and and also like the um also the the all the supporting kind of stuff secretaries and clerks and things are they also they have same similar similar yeah   umhum yes pretty much im a secretary  yeah   yeah ours were ours were different i guess it seemed like they they were much there was much more casual dress although i dont think everybody looked at that you know as a good thing   yeah yeah but theres really no written rule i guess they couldnt write that down that might be discrimination or something i dont know i mean ive never been told what to wear or what not to wear   right thats thats right   its just you know judging from what everyone else wears is how i determine   yeah yeah and   you know what i feel a comfortable in you dont wanna stand out too much   thats right yeah thats true and um hm  well thats it   well that pretty much covers the subject  well thanks for calling me   yeah  i dont know what else what more we can say about that thats oh its been nice talking to you and i guess we just hang up huh okay all right nice talking to you byebye   yep thats all goodbye okay bye
