 Background Even though the DNA microarray is still an emerging technology its usefulness as a profiling tool is well established Affymetrix GeneChip arrays enable the concurrent assessment of expression levels for thousands of genes in a single experiment At the molecular level however the microarray experiment is a challenging biophysical problem that is extremely dependent on probe target kinetics specificity and design Among the principal sources of variability are the nonspecific interactions due to combinatorial complexity of the genome the thermodynamic equivalence of probes the accuracy and spatial uniformity of probe synthesis and the preparation amplification and fractionation of cDNA and cRNA The photolithographically synthesized oligonucleotide microarrays that underlie the Affymetrix GeneChip array use pairs typically 16 or 20 of perfect match PM and mismatch MM features Each feature is a rectangular region containing oligonucleotides complementary to a corresponding region of a gene Because of the inherent difficulties of oligonucleotide synthesis the proportion of full length 25 mer probes within a feature is rather low 1 The PM probes are distinguishable from the MM probes only by the nucleotide in the 13th position The expressed design intent behind the MM feature is to quantify the background noise for example scanner noise and nonspecific interactions for example cross hybridization embedded within the PM signal To arrive at a pristine measure of the signal attributable to probe target interaction it has been suggested 2 3 4 that the intensity for the MM feature should be subtracted from that of the PM feature for each probe pair and subsequently averaged excluding outliers to produce the average difference intensity ADI This heuristic is currently utilized to characterize the expression level for a given gene While the importance of differentiating actual expression from noise cannot be overemphasized no published experiment establishes the assumption that the MM signal closely resembles the nonspecific component of the PM signal It has been suggested 1 that a significant portion of the MM signal may derive from probe target rather than background interactions however the relative contributions of specific and nonspecific components have not been established In the present study an assay was specifically designed to isolate the fundamental components of the PM and MM signals The stratification of nonspecific interactions unique to or common to the PM and MM signals was not addressed Our results show that for transcript concentrations above 100 pM the nonspecific component of PM signal is a negligible part of the MM signal In fact the greater part of the MM signal reflects interaction with the corresponding target transcript This prevents the ADI PM MM from being sensitive to changes in transcript concentration above the 100 pM level approximately 1 in 1 500 transcript frequency Comparison of absolute values of probe intensities across the different experimental conditions of the study suggest that thermodynamic equilibrium may be dominated by stable nonspecific interactions essentially decreasing target availability that is cross target bridges in the presence of complex cRNA Whereas our results show that quantitative detection of target transcripts is possible with commercially available arrays they also demonstrate the potential of alternative metrics for further improving the power of the analysis Results Biotinylated target cRNA from four prokaryotic genes lys dap phe and thr from Bacillus subtilis was collectively hybridized to Test2 arrays with and without 0 05 g l of complex cRNA background generated from human brain total RNA This background concentration roughly corresponds to 150 nM 0 05 g l 330 g mol nucleotide 1 000 nucleotides The target transcript frequency can then be simply computed by dividing transcript concentration by total RNA concentration B subtilis genes were selected on the basis of their designation as standardization controls In accordance with the probe array design genes encoded on the Test2 array contain three probe sets corresponding to the 5 middle and 3 regions Thus a total of 12 distinct controlled target transcript measurements were obtained per hybridization Precision in target transcript concentration was increased through a series of tenfold dilutions from a presynthesized in vitro transcribed mixture Each combination of dilution and background was replicated four times array availability to account for and assess variability Figures 1and 2show that the plot of intensity versus target concentration has the typical sigmoidal shape encountered in chemical kinetics The error bars reflect the range of observed values which increases for measurements obtained subsequent to the lag phase and is greatest for the 100 pM level Table 1supplements these graphs by distinguishing values at low transcript concentrations Table 2depicts averaged pairwise ADI ratios across consecutive dilution levels four replicates per dilution 16 pairs in total after normalization Given the sensitivity of the ratio to small absolute values the variance of the ADI ratios in the 1 0 1 pM range was comparable to that of the mean and was highly influenced by the outlier removal algorithm It is worth noting that normalization did not have a significant effect owing to the extremely uniform conditions of this study A cursory review of Table 2will establish that under both hybridization conditions target transcripts versus target transcripts cRNA background a tenfold reduction in the quantity of target transcript was consistently reflected by the ADI in the 1 10 pM range Additionally the window of target transcript concentration under which proportionality was preserved varied in accordance with background cRNA content In the cRNA sample comprised solely of target transcripts and hybridization controls bioB bioC bioD cre and dap approximate ratio equality was witnessed between 0 1 10 pM Under conditions more akin to a standard assay brain cRNA background the range of proportionality shifted to 1 100 pM In both cases the ADI peaks and subsequently plateaus above 100 pM Figures 1 2and Table 1for PheX_3 as the rate of increase in the MM signal becomes equivalent to or greater than that of the PM signal In the veritable absence of nonspecific interactions background noise is bounded by the absolute value of the 0 1 pM MM signal Analogously the nonspecific interaction component of the MM signal is bounded by the observed increase in the 0 1 pM signal in the presence of complex cRNA Consequently by comparing both sides of Table 1 we conclude that less than 20 of the MM signal at the 100 pM level reflects nonspecific binding The major component of the MM signal 66 80 therefore constitutes interaction with the intended PM target transcript Absolute values for the same transcript concentration differ significantly despite averaging over 20 probe pairs which shows the influence of selected probe sequences Table 1 Addition of a complex cRNA background elicited a profound effect on observed intensities especially at the lower range of concentration The absolute values of PM and MM increased for the 0 1 pM level whereas they decreased for the 10 pM and 100 pM levels Table 1 Surprisingly the decrease in absolute values for 100 pM resulted in the improved sensitivity of the 100 10 pM average ADI ratio factor of 6 versus factor of 3 In addition the signal to noise ratio when defined as ADI MM decreased dramatically in the 0 1 10 pM range whereas the standard error of the 10 1 pM ADI ratios increased Table 1 For the 0 1 pM target concentration all 12 target transcripts were detectable in the absence of brain cRNA background However the presence of complex cRNA essentially rendered them undetectable It is evident that the complex cRNA background had a nonlinear effect on the ADI with up to a fourfold difference in the average ADIs observed for the same quantity of transcript Figure 3 To study the effect of hybridization duration the 0 1 1 and 10 pM hybridizations were repeated in the presence of fixed eukaryotic background with the hybridization time doubled from 16 to 32 hours A marginal increase in the average ADI was observed by around 10 although such increase was within the observed 16 hour range Additionally the increase in signal for the 10 pM level remained consistently less than half of that obtained in the absence of complex cRNA The increased hybridization time did result in partial detection of prokaryotic controls at 0 1 pM 5 out of 12 transcripts Finally to examine reproducibility a scatter plot of the log of gene ADIs for two distinct hybridizations 10 pM transcript concentration in the presence of fixed eukaryotic background was produced Figure 4a About 10 of the points corresponding to positive ADIs fell outside the region corresponding to a factor of 2 deviations from the mean Discussion This study was designed to validate objectively the sensitivity of the Affymetrix GeneChip array Whereas excellent earlier studies show a quantitative relationship between the ADI and transcript abundance 2 3 the experimental design of this study differs significantly from those described in earlier publications in order to assess the system s capabilities under conditions closer to real life experiments These differences include increased precision in spiked transcript concentration through dilution from the same IVT product utilization of Test2 chips reflecting current probe sets and production chemistry no post hybridization streptavidin amplification multiple measurements per condition comparison of transcript intensities obtained with absent or present complex cRNA background and the use of commercially available Test2 arrays rather than custom made arrays containing hundreds of probe pairs per gene Of practical consideration is the ability of the system to provide a robust directional measure of transcript levels In order for the system to reliably characterize gene expression correspondence between the quantity of transcript and the numerical measure selected as its proxy intensity must be demonstrated It has been shown previously that the ADI is proportional to cRNA level and predictive of absolute RNA concentration within a factor of 2 2 3 4 Typically the latter is demonstrated by plotting the log of gene ADIs between two identical tissue samples with 98 3 of the points falling within a region bounded by the lines y 2 x and y 0 5 x factor of 2 region Although never rigorously derived this region can be viewed as an empirical analogy of the confidence region It is clear that although this assertion may hold for an average gene it will be more likely to fail for rare genes with small ADIs Figure 4a Comparison of Figure 4aand bshows how the log scale gives a somewhat misleading impression of the uniformity of the factor of 2 region across the dynamic range In addition it is important to remember that sequence diversity and amount of cRNA will nonlinearly affect probe target binding kinetics and by extension intensities Even averaged ADIs for an identical quantity of transcript differed dramatically up to a factor of 4 solely because of the presence of eukaryotic cRNA background This effect is difficult to account for through linear normalization schemes currently used It is important to note that the experimental conditions underlying the initial factor of 2 claim are quite specific and relate to cRNA derived from the same yeast source As evidenced by the range bars in Figures 1and 2 the variability of actual transcript intensities appears to increase with concentration It has been suggested that variability can be reduced by selecting pixels adaptively 5 However it is not clear how to account algorithmically for large pixel to pixel variability from the biophysical or statistical standpoint given that each pixel is supposed to contain an identical distribution of millions of oligonucleotides A contributing factor to spatial variability appears to be microscopic defects on the surface of the wafer 6 Investigation of the nature of pixel to pixel variability may potentially improve the predictive utility of obtained data The observed linear range of the ADI is narrower than that previously reported 2 and potentially inflated from what might typically be encountered given the reduction in procedural variability achieved through the comparatively uniform conditions of the experiments presented here It is worth noting however that the linear range initially reported 2 was obtained using a custom array containing probe sets with more than 500 PM MM probe pairs per gene Consequently it is not surprising that even with technological advances in chip manufacturing over the past four years we are still unable to reproduce fully the linear range of the ADI using commercial chips with 20 or fewer PM MM probe pairs per probe set The premise that subtraction of the MM from PM essentially serves to extract constructively the nonspecific components cross hybridization noise and so on of the signal common to both should be reconsidered in the light of the results obtained in this study It appears to perform inadequately for low and high transcript concentrations alike although the basis for the failure differs At high concentrations above 100 pM level the rate of increase of the MM signal can eclipse that of the PM signal Figures 1d 2d Table 1for PheX_3 resulting in an eventual decline in the ADI Figures 1d 2dfor PheX_3 For example the average ADI of the ThrX_3 probe set at 1 nM was approximately 47 higher than at 10 nM Table 1 Probe target binding can be characterized by sigmoidal dose response curves with different parameters While both PM and MM seem to have comparable maximum slopes due to lower target affinity the linear response phase of the MM signal is shifted from that of the PM signal it occurs at higher concentrations Consequently the ADI decreases for high target concentrations where the slope of the PM sigmoidal has tapered Reports that the ADI saturates simply as a result of saturation of both the MM and PM signals 2 do not seem to be supported by our results It should be noted that part of the observed saturation effect is attributable to limited scanner sensitivity which might reflect a limitation of our installation Scanner related saturation is functionally related to absolute intensity which in turn is dependent on underlying probe kinetics Examination of individual probe signals suggests that scanner effects are likely to be more pronounced at higher target concentrations 1 10 nM as many of the probes have reached the maximum detectable intensity around 46 000 However saturation in the 10 100 pM range is most likely to be dominated by the kinetic properties of the PM and MM probes At the lower end of transcript concentration it seems that eukaryotic background affects the PM and MM probes nonsymmetrically generally resulting in a decrease in the ADI Notably the DapX_M probe set in Table 1has a positive ADI for 0 1 pM level even though the MM signal is greater than the PM signal before outlier removal Additionally the same outlier removal algorithm rendered the small 0 1 pM ADI for the PheX_3 nonexistent suggesting that simple heuristics can fail in a low signal to noise environment Outlier classification is perhaps best addressed using a functional kinetic as opposed to a purely inferential profile constructed from a large repository of experimental data Given the large number of experiments used to derive the ADI such an approach would seem eminently feasible In lieu of an ideal functional profile the use of alternative heuristics may be promising For example PM MM background PM MM also mentioned in 5 while being less sensitive in the 1 10 pM range was more sensitive for higher ranges and more robust for 0 1 1 pM Given that a significant number of genes of biological interest have transcript frequencies at or below 1 pM 7 the commercial usefulness of the system is constrained by the minimum abundance level that is reliably detectable A current limit of 1 in 2 10 6transcripts that is around 0 075 pM or 1 in 7 cells has been reported 4 Indeed the Affymetrix GeneChip array was able to detect this very low transcript level in the absence of eukaryotic background However after addition of cRNA background transcripts at the 0 1 pM concentration became essentially undetectable for all 12 independent transcripts whereas 1 pM transcripts remained robustly detected Our results are consistent with a recent study 8 showing a range of detection between 1 in 300 000 and 1 in 50 000 0 5 1 5 pM It is possible to argue that post hybridization amplification would improve detection but obviously at the expense of potentially saturating expression levels of more abundant genes Perhaps scanning images before and after amplification could maximize detection without suffering saturation penalties Longer hybridization cycles seem to be a viable alternative as these enabled partial detection of transcripts about 5 out of 12 at the 0 1 pM level without significantly affecting high end intensities Given the current inability to localize transcripts with similar abundances on different arrays care should be taken to ensure a sufficient overall number of replicates to obtain a small standard error for 0 1 pM level measurements Also new methods of mRNA amplification 9 that robustly increase the hybridization concentration of rare transcripts might improve detectability but could simultaneously distort the underlying RNA expression profile The addition of eukaryotic background had a profound effect on the properties of thermodynamic equilibrium of probe target binding The decrease in 10 pM and 100 pM intensities suggests the presence of complex stable interactions that is cross target binding which persist subsequent to the 32 hour hybridization A similar hypothesis was previously proposed 4 where probe probe interactions were implicated We believe that cross target interactions are more important in our case as the saturation level was not affected by cRNA background The marginal increase in the signal after 32 hours of hybridization though suggests that thermodynamic equilibrium was not quite reached in 16 hours The increase in signal for 0 1 pM is obviously due to increased background noise The net result of cRNA background is that it has a nonlinear effect on the ADIs Figure 3 which is impossible to compensate for using linear methods Conclusions Our findings suggest that while high density microarrays are a convenient way of monitoring thousands of genes simultaneously increased care is needed in the design of experiments and scrutiny of the predictive utility of the numerical measure used to represent gene expression An increase in the number of replicates is preferable to reliance upon magnitudes of fold changes as the latter is not always linearly related to target concentration and is extremely variable for low transcript concentrations In light of the fact that the MM signal predominantly characterizes interactions with the target transcript a different heuristic used to weight the MM signal accordingly for each probe pair might further improve the quality of Affymetrix GeneChip array data Perhaps such an approach underlies the announced supplanting of historical algorithms in the impending GeneChip 5 0 release Finally longer hybridization times can improve partial detection of transcripts expressed at very low levels Materials and methods Preparation of labeled targets for hybridization The Test2 array Affymetrix Santa Clara CA contains probes corresponding to commonly expressed genes from the human mouse rat and yeast genomes along with several prokaryotic control genes For each of these genes probes derived from the 5 middle and 3
