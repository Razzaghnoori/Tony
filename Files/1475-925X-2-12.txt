 Background The term radiofrequency ablation probe refers to a class of medical devices operating between 460 550 kHz that deliver therapeutic energy into soft tissues The intent of these devices is to thermally necrose tissue by raising targeted tissue temperatures to approximately 100 C for a period of 10 15 minutes 1 2 Ablation probes are inserted percutaneously or subdermally into tissues where cancerous tumors have been identified Once the probes are positioned radiofrequency energy is delivered through the probe into surrounding tissue and to an electrical ground pad that is applied to the skin of the patient As a technique the use of radiofrequency energy in ablation procedures has been well established However its use in treating tumors in soft organs such as the liver presents some new constraints that were not common to its previous uses In cardiac ablation for example the goal of the ablation procedure is to eradicate the tissue pathology needed to sustain an arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythm 3 4 By monitoring changes in shape of the electrograms physicians can determine when procedures are complete In contrast the absence of a natural real time feedback parameter in hepatic tumor ablation makes it difficult to assess completion of an ablation procedure A surrogate endpoint is the necrosis of a tissue area much larger than the size of the tumor to insure that all cancerous cells within the volume are eradicated 5 To achieve this endpoint requires a good understanding of the mechanism of ablation Our present understanding of ablation is mainly derived from experiences with other medical devices such as hyperthermia and electrosurgical units 6 7 8 which function differently than radiofrequency ablation devices The intent of microwave hyperthermia devices operating at 27 MHz or 2 45 GHz is to raise the temperature of tumorous tissues to between 43 45 C for extended periods of time on the order of hours 9 Microwave hyperthermia devices deliver energy at low doses of energy over long periods of time whereas radiofrequency ablation devices deliver high doses of energy for short periods of time 10 Microwave hyperthermia devices and radiofrequency ablation devices differ in other important ways The dielectric properties of hepatic tissue in the microwave frequency range differ greatly from those at radiofrequencies resulting in a substantially different depth of penetration of energy At 500 kHz liver conductivity is approximately 0 148 S m By comparison liver conductivity at 27 MHz and 2 45 GHz are 0 382 and 1 687 S m respectively 11 As a result for comparable source strengths current disperses more readily into tissue at higher frequencies Thus at higher frequencies heating patterns are more spread out and tend to deliver lesser heating than at lower frequencies Another important difference between microwave hyperthermia devices and hepatic radiofrequency ablation devices is the mode of energy transfer At microwave frequencies energy is primarily transferred to tissue via capacitive coupling field heating which causes vibration of particles in tissues resulting in tissue heating At frequencies used by radiofrequency ablation devices energy is transferred primarily by conductive ohmic heating where current is generated through the movement of charge from the ablation probe to the electrical ground plate via the path of least resistance In electrosurgical devices high bursts of energy are used for short periods of time to achieve cutting and coagulative effects on tissues 12 13 14 Electrosurgical devices and radiofrequency ablation probes both operate within the same frequency range and transfer energy in similar ways but differ in the shape of stimulation waveforms Radiofrequency ablation devices utilize a continuous sinusoidal waveform Electrosurgical devices use variable waveform shape and duty cycle duration to achieve fulguration cutting or desiccation 15 16 In general the application of energy with electrosurgical devices is intense for an extremely short period of time several seconds Thus the temperatures achieved by electrosurgical units do not penetrate as deeply into tissue as radiofrequency ablation devices In recent years the use of computational models for radiofrequency ablation has risen as a means of studying the dosiometric and heat transfer profiles surrounding the ablation probes Data from these models however have varied considerably from experimental measurement 17 18 There are several contributing factors for these variations metabolism blood flow tissue perfusion and motion One additional explanation for inaccuracies in these models is the use of constant electrical properties of tissues in modeling There are no known studies to date that specifically study the effects of temperature dependent electrical properties on the dosimetric and heat transfer profiles surrounding ablation probes 19 20 Perhaps the greatest reason for assuming constant electrical properties is the enormous computational advantage of being able to separate the electromagnetic and heat transfer problems By separating the two problems computational resources can be reduced significantly by sequentially solving the electric field and temperature distribution A constant electrical conductivity necessitates a constant electric field and current density and thus imposes a one way coupling between the electrical and thermal problems More specifically the thermal calculation is dependent on the calculation of the electric field whereas the electrical field is independent of the thermal profile Several investigators have shown that the electrical conductivity of materials is temperature dependent 21 The magnitude of this effect is also material and frequency dependent When temperature dependent electrical conductivity is applied to computational models bi directional coupling is imposed between electrical and thermal problems Thus the thermal profile and the electric field are interdependent The purpose of this study is to determine to what extent simplification of constant electrical properties can be used and to determine the amount of error that results when temperature dependent effects are ignored Methods Temperature Dependent Conductivity Since to date there have been no formal experimental measurements on the temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity of liver we have assumed that the temperature dependent behavior of liver tissue is similar to that of an equivalent sodium chloride solution Stogryn 23 derived expressions for the conductivity of sodium chloride solutions at given the temperature T and normality N T N 25 N 1 000 1 962 10 2 8 08 10 5 2 N

produced an equivalent electrical conductivity of liver tissues at 37 C approximately 0 134 S m The rationale for using NaCl solutions stems from several known phenomena First liver tissue has high water content As a first order approximation liver can be modeled as compartmental areas containing salt solutions Second it has been reported that at low frequencies the electrical properties of tissue are dominated mainly by the electrical conductivity 24 The electrical permittivity which is more closely related to the cellular structure of cells is a much smaller component to tissue impedance than the electrical conductivity and can be ignored in a first order calculation Governing Equations and Boundary Conditions Radiofrequency ablation probes operate between 460 550 kHz At these frequencies the wavelength is several orders of magnitude larger than the size of the ablation electrode Thus the ablation probe dissipates the majority of its energy through electrical conduction and not capacitive coupling In this situation we assumed a quasi static electrical conduction model which allows us to solve the electric field by using Laplace s equation T V 0 Eq 2 where is the gradient operator x y z T is the temperature dependent conductivity Siemens meter and V is the electric potential Volts Heat transfer in tissue is governed by the heat conduction equation where is the density kg m 3 c is the heat capacity J kg K k is the heat conduction coefficient W K m b is the density of blood C b is the heat capacity of blood is the blood perfusion coefficient T amb is the ambient temperature and Q m is the metabolic heat source term For all cases we assumed that the metabolic heat source was insignificant In the cases where blood perfusion were ignored 0 Since our main interest is to simulate the highest temperatures achieved during radiofrequency ablation we considered only the steady state problem The difference in the methodology used to solve these governing equations for the cases of constant and temperature dependent conductivity stems from the method in which Laplace s equation Equation 2 is solved In the case where the electrical conductivity is a constant Laplace s equation can be rearranged such that 2V 0 Since the rearranged expression is not a function of temperature it can be solved independently of the heat conduction equation Equation 3 The expression for the electric potential V can be solved quickly over the entire volume and the solution can be implemented into the source term of the heat conduction equation Since temperature is a function of position and is not uniform over the volume the electrical conductivity is a function of both temperature and position in the case of temperature dependence In this situation Equations 2 and 3 must be simultaneously solved which involves iterative computation of both the electrical conductivity and the temperature In both the temperature dependent conductivity and constant conductivity models the boundary conditions were the same For each of the outer surfaces of the model an electrical boundary condition of V 0 was applied to simulate the return ground electrode A source potential V o was applied to the conducting areas of the probe The non conducting portions were given an insulating boundary condition such that n V 0 where n is the unit vector normal to the surface is the electrical conductivity and V is the voltage at the insulating surface The thermal boundary conditions for the surface of the box were T T amb Since the thermal mass of the probe was small compared to the surrounding saline we assumed that heat conduction into the probe itself was minimal Thus for all other surfaces the thermally insulating boundary condition n k T 0 was applied Solver Method Four finite element models were compared constant electrical conductivity without tissue perfusion temperature dependent conductivity without tissue perfusion constant electrical conductivity with tissue perfusion and temperature dependent conductivity with tissue perfusion To solve these models we used an iterative finite element multigrid solver with an initial coarse grid of 8 787 nodes and 42 045 elements Nineteen 19 cycles were necessary to converge the solution resulting in a fine grid of 34 452 nodes and 178 389 elements For each run the electric field E the current density J the heat flux HF and the resulting temperature T were calculated The electrical conductivity J E and the specific absorption rate SAR J E were also calculated Simulations were made for each of the four models with source voltages of 0 2 5 5 7 5 10 12 5 15 17 5 and 20 volts Additional simulations were made at 22 5 25 0 and 27 5 volts for the two models with tissue perfusion to attain simulation data near 100 C All of these calculations were implemented using FEMLAB Comsol Burlington MA USA on a 1 8 GHz Intel Pentium IV with 1 Gbyte RAM Results For each of the voltage settings the maximum electric field current density temperature heat flux conductivity and SAR were recorded for the cases with no tissue perfusion Table 2 and with tissue perfusion Table 3 Figure 3shows a comparison of the maximum electric field strengths computed for the four models when a source voltage of 20 0 volts is applied In each case the electric field is shown to be non uniform favoring the proximal edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe The maximum electric field occurs at the proximal edge In the results from the two models that assume constant electrical conductivity the maximum electric field is the same The models that assume a temperature dependent electrical conductivity have an electric field strength that is approximately 3 less Figure 4shows a plot of the maximum electric field strength plotted as a function of source voltage For the cases that use constant conductivity the electric field is directly proportional to the magnitude of the source As the source voltage increases the differences between the model results of the constant conductivity and temperature dependent conductivity models increase The nonlinearity in the results for temperature dependent conductivity arise from solving Laplace s equation using the more general expression T V 0 Tables 4and 5demonstrate that the changes in the electric field are not related to tissue perfusion A plot of the electric field strength along the surface of the ablation probe Figure 5 shows that in all four models the resulting distribution of the electric field is nearly the same Figure 6shows a comparison of the maximum current density computed for the four models when 20 0 volts is applied In the cases where the electrical conductivity is constant the current density is a linear scaling of the electric field and is the same with and without tissue perfusion For the case where temperature dependent conductivity is applied in the absence of tissue perfusion the current density increases 120 When perfusion is added to the temperature dependent conductivity model the current density increases approximately 53 These data indicate that current density is explicitly related to temperature dependent phenomena and implicitly related to tissue perfusion Therefore any changes in the current density due to perfusion are only observable if temperature dependent electrical conductivity is accounted for in computational models Figures 7and 8demonstrate that in both of the cases with green and without red tissue perfusion which utilize constant electrical conductivity the current density distribution is the same The figures also indicate that adding temperature dependent and perfusion phenomena produce substantially different results A major consequence of accounting for temperature dependent phenomena is the large change in the electrical conductivity Figures 9and 10show that the electrical conductivity change considerably when temperature dependence is accounted for 128 without perfusion 60 with perfusion As seen in the results for current density the electrical conductivity is explicitly related to temperature dependent phenomena and implicitly related to tissue perfusion Figure 11shows the distribution of temperature dependent electrical conductivity along the surface of the ablation probe For the case where tissue perfusion is neglected the center of the ablation probe is the area with the largest conductivity change When tissue perfusion is accounted for the areas corresponding to the proximal edge and the distal tip experience the most change Figure 12shows a three dimensional representation of the temperature dependent conductivity change with no perfusion The figure shows a rapid decrease in the conductivity change in the radial direction The changes in the electric field current density and electrical conductivity contribute to changes in the specific absorption rate SAR The SAR is the mass normalized rate of electromagnetic energy deposited into tissue Figures 13and 14show changes in the SAR that closely resemble the changes in the electrical conductivity and current density These figures indicate that temperature dependent phenomena dominate the changes that occur in modeling results using electromagnetic heat sources Figure 15presents a comparison of the heat flux for the four models when a source voltage of 20 0 volts is applied In each case the heat flux is greatest at the proximal edge and the distal tip of the ablation probe The data show that accounting for perfusion decreases the heat flux by 4 Accounting for temperature dependent electrical conductivity increases the heat flux by approximately 11 This demonstrates that temperature dependent phenomena dominate the changes that occur in the heat sink Figure 16 Figure 17shows a comparison of the temperature distribution computed for the four models using a source voltage of 20 0 volts This figure clearly indicates that the resulting temperature is dominated by tissue perfusion At temperatures near 100 C we see differences of approximately 5 between models that include and exclude tissue perfusion Figure 18shows the maximum temperatures achieved using the four models as a function of source voltage By increasing the source voltage to 27 5 volts in the models with tissue perfusion we were able to achieve temperatures near 100 C Tables 3and 5show that the resulting temperature differences near 100 C are approximately 8 These data suggest that the amount of error incurred by neglecting temperature dependent phenomena is not related to the level of tissue perfusion but is more closely related to temperature Figure 19shows that in the absence of tissue perfusion the highest temperatures are achieved in the center of the ablation probe When tissue perfusion is accounted for the highest temperatures occur at the proximal edge and the distal tip Thus the distribution of temperature is more strongly related to the presence of tissue perfusion Discussion and Conclusions Model Limitations There are several important differences between the temperature dependent properties of NaCl solutions and those of tissue First temperature elevation of tissue results in the denaturing of proteins which changes the electrical conductivity of tissue in a highly nonlinear fashion While the exact effect of protein denaturing is not well understood it is evident that the resulting conductivity does not change linearly with temperature as in sodium chloride solutions Preliminary data suggest that the electrical conductivity of tissues change substantially once tissue is damaged This phenomena has been well established in vitro and in vivo 3 25 Thus the effects of temperature dependent changes are likely to be understated A second limitation in our model is that it does not account for changes in tissue conductivity by assessing tissue damage Several investigators have suggested that tissue follows an Arrhenius function 26 As such tissue damage is a function of temperature and time A subtlety in modeling ablation problems is that plots of temperature distribution do not necessarily equate to plots of resulting lesion size This is especially true if ablations are performed for relatively finite periods of time In our study we have restricted our models to examining the steady state changes in the various thermal and electromagnetic parameters By doing so tissue reaching a threshold temperature is assumed to be uniformly damaged Therefore for purposes of this study temperature distribution and lesion size are equivalent and the Arrhenius phenomena are non existent
