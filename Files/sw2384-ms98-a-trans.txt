 yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people don t uh don t like i guess because it s usually expensive and uh people end up not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess it s kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um that s right put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of fluish type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and need the car the next day type deal so get sick with the flu yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and uh oh and uh start over so uh with little things like that it s it s still a lot cheaper uh that particular for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars wow are these disc brakes yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while you re in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn it down and right put the uh grease the bearings up since it s been a while since they d been done and well i have Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those um hum redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars um hum yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldn t be too expensive but it s when while you re in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those is expensive uh huh that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know that s twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and uh huh i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them on myself uh huh but uh it s a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually you re very fortunate well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we d had a freezing rain apparently um hum and there s some kind of a boot that had had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on um hum and my uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning oh boy bet that got warm it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but yeah that that was the reason i had to replace mine yeah that ll do it it ll cook the whole whole insides there right hum i don t know what the what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they would have put all the parts pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot they d unfreeze you would hope so but that would be nice if uh all that was huh that s interesting yeah i m glad we don t have that problem too often down here i ve heard a lot of horror stories about people that go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you can t turn and you can t stop in a hurry and no i ll stay down here in the South that s that you can t turn that s right it s a little bit different i ve seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldn t want to go over them yeah that s true that s true well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so we do that kind of maintenance and you do that yourself yeah do the oil change oil and filter and air filters and spark plugs and the like can t do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control oh you re that s right um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and i ve thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil but and that would help a little bit but i haven t done it yeah well i ll tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i i recall a a uh coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick oh no and she did it oh and it was just oh that s crazy that was mean that is mean yep so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in or take it to the pit and let them let somebody else do it yeah yeah those have really cropped up years of late but uh they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change yeah yeah that s when i know what the oil costs that s true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and right uh huh and uh stack up on a case of that and grab the two dollars filters when they re on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days right uh well end up having to take it somewhere right some of the stations around here will take it right i think maybe they have to accept it well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless it s a hassle or a labor recycle it in you know just dealing with the customer maybe that s there only reason why they don t it d seem like they d just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on we ll take your money that s right um we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother and we were driving my husband s Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he came came back out and the car the truck wouldn t stop i mean it wouldn t start so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor proba bly and he was going to take it off and either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said i ve got good news and bad news uh the starter motor is fine it would it just had a couple of bolts that held it in place um hum and one had been broken off right and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldn t um hum wouldn t catch right match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and pick them up pick the bolts up for him hum so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and yeah had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldn t believe it because the man could have really stuck us well that s not yeah that s true that s not to bad then no it was great well i hear my kids are needing me again so i ll go see what they need and we ll maybe talk to you again okay Greg okay thank you bye um bye
