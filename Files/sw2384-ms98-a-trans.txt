        yeah auto repair tends to be a a topic that a lot of people dont uh dont like i guess because its usually expensive and uh people end up not pleased with the job sometimes or not pleased with what they had to pay for it so uh i guess its kind of a sour grapes type topic i just recently had um   thats right   put a set of brakes on my little Blazer that we have and fortunately i i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i got into it i got about halfway into it and started feeling a little bad i kind of fluish type and said what a time for this to set in i got the wheel off i got these brake pads off i got car jacked up and       need the car the next day type deal so   get sick with the flu   yeah so uh i continued on and just decided to do part of what i had intended to do when i got inside there which means that when i just get around to doing the rest of it i got to take all of that back off again and   uhoh   and uh start over so uh with little things like that its its still a lot cheaper uh that particular for that particular model car runs a hundred and fifty dollars   wow are these disc brakes   yeah just the front little disc pads but uh while youre in there you usually uh pull the rotor and and uh turn  it down and   right   put the uh grease the bearings up since its been a while since theyd been done and   well i have Nissan uh Maxima and i had the rear brakes on those   umhum   redone but i guess auto repairs are cheaper around here i think it was around eighty five dollars   umhum yeah the rear brakes just doing the just putting the brake pads in wouldnt be too expensive but its when while youre in the front that you usually go ahead and pull those   is expensive uhhuh   that rotor off and repack the bearings and you know thats twenty five dollars and the rotors another twenty five dollars and then the brake pads are eighty or something the labor and parts and   uhhuh     i just go buy the things for for uh about thirty bucks and put them on myself   uhhuh   but uh its a bit of a bit of a pain and you have to schedule it you know get around to find a weekend you can do it and all but still for the for the savings it uh works out usually   youre very fortunate well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after wed had a freezing rain apparently   umhum   and theres some kind of a boot that had had come off the car so the emergency brake froze on   umhum   and my uh brakes were on all the time i drove to work one morning   oh boy bet that got warm   it got warm it was pretty smelly by the time we got there which is not too far a drive but   yeah   that that was the reason i had to replace mine   yeah thatll do it itll cook the whole whole insides there   right   hum i dont know what the what the solution for that would have been you would have thought they would have put all the parts pertaining to that near the brake so if they did get hot theyd unfreeze   you would hope so but   that would be nice if uh all that was huh thats interesting yeah im glad we dont have that problem too often down here ive heard a lot of horror stories about people that go down a straight road long enough and the and the wheel wells ice up enough inside where you get ready to make a turn and and surprise you cant turn and you cant stop in a hurry and no ill stay down here in the South thats   that you cant turn thats right     its a little bit different   ive seen your spaghetti bridges though when i wouldnt want to go over them   yeah thats true thats true well i guess the only other uh things that i like to do you know the oil changes and things that are not worth paying for at least in my neck of the woods so we do that kind of maintenance and   you do that yourself   yeah do the oil change oil and filter and air filters and spark plugs and the like cant do much in the way of actual tune up now that the car now that computers taken over that control   oh youre thats right   um it costs about a hundred and something to get the small module that reads that and   ive thought about taking a course just so i could change my own oil  but and that would help a little bit but i havent done it   yeah well ill tell you some of the horror stories that the the male populace have done to the women i i recall a a uh coed when i was in college some of the guys got together and decided to tell this poor girl the way to change her oil was to uh they showed her where to take it out and she did that successfully and then showed her how to uh put it back in but on putting it back in they had her put in they had her put in all four or five quarts of this oil with an eyedropper down the dip stick   oh no   and she did it oh and it was just   oh thats crazy   that was mean   that is mean   yep so i guess it it is to your advantage to either not have friends like that or take a little course in   or take it to the pit  and let them let somebody else do it   yeah yeah those have really cropped up years of late but uh   they have but i really hate paying twenty two ninety five for an oil change   yeah yeah thats   when i know what the oil costs   thats true i usually try to catch the oil at eighty cents or so and   right uhhuh   and uh stack up on a case of that and  grab the two dollars filters  when theyre on sale and wait for a good weather and go out there course getting rid of the oil is getting harder these days   right uh well   end up having to take it somewhere   right some of the stations around here will take it   right   i think maybe they have to accept it   well they get a little money for it i mean they they pay they sell it so they should be you know unless its a hassle or a labor   recycle it   in you know just dealing with the customer maybe thats there only reason why they dont itd seem like theyd just put a little barrel out there and say it pour here and go on  well take your money   thats right um  we were down in Dallas right after Christmas and on the way back we stopped in Louisiana to visit my brother and we were driving my husbands Toyota pick up truck well we made a quick little stop when we got to Baton Rouge and he came came back out and the car the truck wouldnt stop i mean it wouldnt start so gave it a somebody came along and helped give it a little push and the next morning they took it to the garage and it was just a small private garage and he said it was the starter motor proba bly and he was going to take it off and either repair it or replace it or whatever and we got a call in the middle of the morning and he said ive got good news and bad news uh the starter motor is fine it would it just had a couple of bolts that held it in place   umhum   and one had been broken off   right   and allowed it to shift enough that it wouldnt   umhum wouldnt catch right   match just right and the only bad news was my husband would have to go to a garage and pick them up pick the bolts up for him   hum   so he went to a used car garage i guess or place and got the bolts and   yeah   had it running for about fifteen dollars i couldnt believe it because the man could have really stuck us   well thats not yeah thats true thats not to bad then   no it  was great   well i hear my kids are needing me again so ill go see what they need  and well maybe talk to you again   okay Greg okay thank you bye   um bye
