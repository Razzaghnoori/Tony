 well do you own a PC no i don t i have one at uh the company i work for furnishes so i can work at home oh wow and it s just an old old compact that is super slow and but it does it does it s job so what processor does it have in it um i don t know it s so old oh what kind of work do you do on it it s one of um i do um television ratings and i process some ratings and put do graphics for their television stations those are their clients so oh okay yeah it s basically just data entry and running you know some some software so it doesn t really have to be anything sophisticated you know huh yeah i don t own a PC but i ve i ve yeah i work for TI and uh they so yeah my husband does too so well i have uh pretty fairly a fairly fancy one it s a TI model it s an S P one thousand which has a it has a fast processor in it a three eighty six uh huh and i the the job that i do i do a lot of training of our customers for new products uh huh and i have to develop uh functional specs and desk and desk top publishing and everything so it s uh huh yeah it s kind of fun i mean i i i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house but i just haven t got around to doing it yet oh yeah i d like to have one for the house too but sometimes my husband my husband says usually i work on the computer all day at work i don t want to come home and have to work on one too your husband what what group is your husband in um something with the defense uh oh DSEG defense systems and electronics group yeah something like that yeah they ve changed their name so many times i ve lost track so i see yeah he works up in Plano oh okay yeah i work on uh printers and the peripheral products division basically uh huh uh i work in the airline marketing marketing group oh so we we do a lot of i didn t even know they had anything like that oh yeah man there s so they re i learned so many things that they they do they re into so many different things so yeah i just kind of in for a while you know he had a he had uh one of those what are they top secret things you know where he couldn t talk about what he did so uh huh yeah for a while but then he switched jobs i don t understand half the stuff he does and i have uh is he a programmer uh huh software design engineer so as i see they call it so but i have a degree in information management uh huh which is computer you know right it s basically the more the business business end of it than the programming end of it you know right so but i ve been at it for you know five years so everything s changed so much i probably couldn t even get a job right now it seems like it s changed so much so you know they ve made such advances in computers so really so uh does your husband ever use uh a laptop or a notebook does he bring a little one home with him or no huh uh sometimes he brings he brought home a uh a portable one uh huh but uh it it quit working so he brought it brought it back and he just hasn t brought another one home but they did give him a new computer at work so oh i see yeah we we build uh laptop and notebook computers here in Temple also oh uh huh and those are really handy i mean we they they have modems in them you can send a fax from your PC oh how nice no he doesn t have one of those so but they re they re really what s that he doesn t have one of those yeah they re they re pretty handy because you know when i travel it s easy to check messages just you know uh huh plug in the phone to your computer and dial in and yeah well my husband doesn t have to travel so oh okay yeah i just found out i m going to Denver Sunday night again oh boy so that kind of reeks havoc with plans well at least you get to but it it s really not enough to become a big hassle uh huh well that s good some people enjoy the travel but i don t think i d like it if he traveled a lot so i see yeah i would love to have a computer they but they re so expensive well i don t know there you can get well depends on what you consider expensive i mean you can get real high powered stuff now uh huh for under two thousand dollars where you know just a few years ago it would have been six seven eight nine thousand dollars yeah yeah guess it s not it s all you know it s inexpensive compared to what it used to be but it s a lot to put into one yeah it s still i mean you know two thousand dollars isn t just just pocket change to a lot of people that s right no it s not it s it s not pocket change so it s major so but maybe when the kids get in school that will be you know when they start needing something you know then that will be different but yeah when i started at uh TI i was a summer development student uh huh and finishing up at school and so those papers really i mean it was nice having access to the oh yeah equipment to uh yes i remember that i had to do some of my husband s papers because i had access to one but you know he his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing you know so yeah i did a lot of his papers yeah they come in real handy that was a lifesaver well how many different types of packages do you use at home uh huh um all i the packages i i don t really use them i pictures is what i use that s the only um outside development that we use most of it s just stuff that s been written in house that i use oh okay yeah golly i ve got up up at work anyway i use uh WordPerfect and Lotus and yeah i know those two i worked GemDraw which is a uh uh a a line draw package uh huh i ve just used WordPerfect and Lotus yeah you probably use D base or something like that for your uh data entry stuff that your talking about um the most yeah yeah a lot of the data entr y stuff they used uh survey system and and um you know just in house programs to do what they needed i work do you get to do you work at home all the time or just well no i worked for this company before i had my first daughter uh huh and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things so oh that that was that worked out pretty good then yeah it did you know i don t do i don t really don t do basic a lot of what i used to do i just do you know something really minor but uh huh it s something that nobody else wants to do yeah and it s time consuming so so it keeps you in the company huh that s right you know it gives me a paycheck you know it s only like the works only you know three weeks goes for like three to four weeks three times a year uh huh you know it s not something that s continual because you know the television ratings don t come out you know all the time they only come out four times a year so yeah but boy i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here i d get all kinds of stuff done phone s always ringing and oh uh huh people always asking me to do something else yeah i ve got a lot of especially right now we ve got several new products coming out and i ve got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise uh huh will they let you take a computer home to work well yeah but you know i need to be at the office too you know i ve just got to deal with all those other things that happen but oh uh huh a PC at the house would really take a lot of the load off yeah yeah i bet yeah my husband he took one home when they when they had it you know they had a big deadline coming up and it was looking a little touchy to meet so uh huh well i ve i ve done that before on a couple times but that would make it just that much easier instead of bringing home a computer you just bring home a few floppy disks you know yeah uh huh that s right i thought that would be you know because it s real nice with this because i don t even have to go into the office i ve maybe been into the office once in the past three years you know oh my they just um they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever so you know man that sounds really nice yeah it is real nice you know i just deal with them on the telephone half the people don t even know who they re talking to uh huh but i you know worked i know most of them well i can t say that a lot of people changed around there but most people know who i am but i don t know who they are you know uh huh a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice right yeah i ve got a lot of folks that i ve worked with like that as well yeah you just know them by the telephone so but well it s been good talking to you i think we ve just got the subject yeah we sort of stayed to the topic anyway yeah we tried it s hard to sometimes okay well thanks bye bye okay well we ll talk to you later bye
