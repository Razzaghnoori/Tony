spent two weeks in Bastrop Texas once oh yeah uh where s that it s near Austin oh okay i m not that much familiar with Texas we ve been my family has been everywhere but mostly in Texas on the way to someplace else we ve had oh gosh we ve um hum i ve camped in a in a in a back of a van van then we got then we got a pop up camper and then we got a trailer now they ve got now they ve got a big motor home so they they still do a whole lot of camping have you ever been camping in any of the big national parks oh gosh yes uh oh Yellowstone about four years ago four or five years ago and um oh we did my family when i was younger we went that was just you know what we did in the summers was go to the from you know national park to national park we had a lot of fun when i go camping i don t i don t like to rough it i like to have some a little bit of electricity electricity and a little bit of running water yes me too i m not really into this going and sitting in a tent for a few days with nothing oh no no i ve done it but it s not fun you don t want to do it for like three weeks at a time that s for sure God i have some friends that go camping for a couple of weeks every summer they re both geologists and they load up their truck with their tent and they go to New Mexico and they just find places to camp and go looking for rocks and ooh no no doesn t sound like a lot of fun to me uh my friend said that the last time they went uh she just got tired of the tent and it was cold at night and she got tired of eating out of cans and so they stayed in a hotel one night oh yeah just for fun shaking the scorpions out of their shoes no kidding no kidding gosh that s what the the the bugs i don t like the bugs oh me neither me neither the the mosquitoes just keep you up all night yeah the one good nice thing i remember about camping with my parents is they had a big hammock and they would always find a couple of a campsite with a couple of good trees to hang it in between and i could just lay in that hammock for hours yeah yeah that that s nice yeah when my family when my family camps we re the the only time you re at the camper is when you want to sleep otherwise you re just going constantly you know in all the in all the National Parks and stuff oh hum we camped at the let s see we camped down at at Galveston two or three years ago and that that was that was fun except that they uh were having a lot of problems with dead fish on the shore and they were and the and the smell of that was kind of gross but we stayed in Galveston Island State Park once but if a storm blew in and it was just horrible and the sand was blowing up our camp the little camping area was pretty near the shore oh how awful um hum oh yeah and there were some pretty big dunes before the the camping area and the sand was all blowing up and couldn t even go out of the camper the wind was blowing so hard because you d get sand in your eyes oh that s miserable yeah it was pretty bad yeah i had yeah pretty bad but we had a good time in our camper we usually we usually took box games and things to do in case it rained and they my parents always let us take a couple of friends so we always had a good time yeah yeah it s it s you it s you you always when you when there s kids you ve always got to have other stuff to do because it s always gonna rain sometime and then your parents parents they drive the parents nuts yeah yeah and yeah well children aren t easily entertained by just enjoying the nature oh i know i wish i d appreciated i wish i d appreciated it more you uh when i was when we were camping so extensively you when we when we were younger yeah now i wish i could go back to those places yeah the time and i ve got got a child and another one on the way so i wish i had time my my our pop up camper just sits in the garage and collects dust unfortunately oh gosh it makes it a little my fiance and i one day would like to own a big motor home mainly because he s a football he s a college football coach and we re gonna have to travel a lot uh huh yeah and it d be nice if we had a big ole motor home and that way i could load up the rest of the wives and go to wherever the football game is and have someplace to sleep without spending big money for a hotel and and park it outside of the stadium and have a good ole time yeah that s true plus it s nice to have your own stuff there yeah plus you get eating out is expensive is so expensive and um hum that is nice no kidding it really is so it it it it s a it can be really handy to have a camper just um because my our family lives in Missouri and uh when we take trips home we take our pop up with us in good weather and stay overnight at a state park or something so we don t have to rent a hotel room and that s oh yeah that s nice you know paying five or six dollars instead of forty yeah no kidding yeah well what else well i think that s just pretty much it we ve been on here awhile okay well it s been nice talking to you nice talking to you too bye bye bye
