 Magnum Farce For the past week I ve been driving people nuts with my Clint Eastwood impression I don t do an especially good one but then Eastwood is not especially difficult to do You lower your voice pull it back into your throat so that it s breathy verging on a rasp and yet smooth almost plangent then expel the line from The Outlaw Josey Wales 1976 addressed to the bounty hunter who insists that he s only trying to make a living Dyin ain t much of a livin boy It s a bedroom voice menacing but seductive with over deliberate diction that implies I m so powerful so coiled so masculine that I have to modulate my tone or else Eastwood s most famous Dirty Harryisms Ask yourself Do I feel lucky Well do ya punk and Go ahead make my day are purring come ons The bad guy is practically compelled to submit to this tall handsome killer with his long Magnum pistol Submit in many cases by going for his gun and getting blown into orgasmic nonexistence Eastwood has one of the great movie voices of our era but it s also kind of ridiculous Probably no star could get away with it if he weren t such an image of cool as beautiful and remote and self contained as Garbo or Chet Baker What has enraptured so many critics among them Richard Schickel in Clint Eastwood A Biography is that the actor director has learned to play with his own inexpressiveness to make a joke of his frigid machismo without and here s where the supreme balancing act comes in travestying it Eastwood in this view contains within himself both the myth and the anti myth I think that he s a fine lightweight comic presence at times his scowl is a psychotic version of a comedian s classic slow burn but Schickel goes further He calls Eastwood one of the great ironists of the age and a postmodern hero Clint s gift he writes forever on a first name basis with his subject is to let us see the dark comedy in the American male s contorting distorting attempts to achieve his masteries of the moment while at the same time not entirely discrediting the tradition that makes him bid that effort Whew That s some gift Schickel is alternately sycophantic toward Eastwood and pugilistic toward any critic who has ever had unkind words for the actor particularly Pauline Kael who did seem to have a mission to make the tall man s Magnum shrivel The book has the breathless indulgence of a campaign biography Clint s lack of selfishness his predilection for throwing scenes to other actors partly out of generosity partly out of a serene confidence in the force of his own presence In the end Schickel seems happiest simply basking in the star s aura preferring the company of Eastwood in the fading light of certain wintry afternoons to trudging around and interviewing anyone with a different version of events or a contrasting point of view That doesn t surprise me since contrasting points of view don t make it into Eastwood s movies either which is why I have some trouble accepting this notion of the actor director as an ironist In the Dirty Harry movies or the rabidly right wing 1986 Heartbreak Ridge which ends with a potency reclaiming invasion of Grenada there s little irony in Eastwood s superiority to the succession of louts prisses and psychopaths whom his character inevitably clobbers or blows away or in the fact that he is of greater stature than the actors with whom he surrounds himself Eastwood might acknowledge the faint absurdity of these heroes but none is ever ultimately proved wrong Even the hell bound William Munny in the compelling Unforgiven 1992 who does admittedly shoot a rather nice young cowboy in the gut but instantly regrets it ends up killing the sort of people who when all is said and done need killing When Schickel stops duking it out with Eastwood s antagonists his analyses can be trenchant He s especially evocative on the three spaghetti Westerns that Eastwood made with Sergio Leone for whom the actor forged his amusingly taciturn on screen persona Leone Schickel writes developed a style that alternated cunningly between extreme wide shots and extreme close ups partly in an effort to monumentalize Eastwood s face the director s mise en sc ne became a landscape of masks But then it s back to the issue of irony and Schickel s evasions can make your jaw drop The rousing Dirty Harry 1971 is inarguably a template for the modern right wing vigilante picture replete with digs at Miranda rights due process and the burgeoning civil liberties movement Yet here is Schickel quoting Eastwood s insistence that the film has no larger political agenda It s just the story of one particular police officer in a frustrating situation on one particular case And Willie Horton is just some guy The author concludes It is as a rule absurd and utterly unrealistic to see ideological motives let alone ideological malevolence in action pictures he is conveniently omitting any reference here to Eastwood s pal John Milius the gleeful liberal basher who scripted many of the banner lines in Dirty Harry and Magnum Force 1973 Of The Enforcer 1976 Schickel notes Certainly today attitudes having radically changed Clint would retract the movie s casual contempt for homosexuals admittedly a feature of his early action films That would be mighty white of him And for this biographer one of the most tasteful campaigns in the history of modern American politics Eastwood s run as a property rights Republican for mayor of Carmel Calif was one in which the star likened a civic ordinance that would ban second kitchens to Adolf Hitler knocking on your door OK so Eastwood s not a rocket scientist But Schickel does seem to see him as some sort of Delphic oracle and his attempts to translate the man s monosyllabic pronouncements make for hilarity Women Clint says a sort of sad befuddlement in his tone always want to know what you re thinking Schickel enlarges It is a mystery to him this desire to penetrate the deepest reserves of his privacy It is equally a mystery to him why anyone would think that bringing things up out of this murk and discussing them would profit either party At our cores he believes for whatever reason we are what we are and there is nothing much to be done about that beyond simply accepting the hard facts of personality We are what we are and there is nothing much to be done about that doesn t make for a very interesting aesthetic and Eastwood s dry dodgy movies Schickel touts their directness of address their plainspoken psychological realism bear the stamp of this shrunken worldview A psychiatrist could make the case that the star s legendary promiscuity with its attendant insulation and fear of commitment has artistic consequences Compare Eastwood with Charlie Parker for instance whom Eastwood idolizes and about whom he made the reverent biopic Bird 1988 The English writer Daniel O Brien in his modest more objective new book Clint Eastwood Film Maker suggests that Eastwood wouldn t actually put up with Parker for a second The saxophonist s unruly passion his commitment to his art is the antithesis of Eastwood s manly frugal shoot it and move on way of working But Schickel is starry eyed He compares the films and Eastwood s masculine posing to the modern jazz manner a powerful desire almost amounting to a morality not to woo the audience a profound desire not to make what he does look costly to him emotionally or intellectually One could argue that Eastwood has merely masked his inadequacies as artistic choices But I wouldn t want to go too far I frequently enjoy his movies and there s no arguing with the fact that his stardom has endured for more than three decades There might be a kind of genius here but it s the genius of a seducer not an artist Eastwood makes use of the traditional tools his size his handsomeness the aura of mystery he so manifestly cultivates But the seduction also occurs in unexpected ways Reading the book I found myself conscious of and moved by the ways in which Schickel has been drawn in by Eastwood compelled to fill all kinds of sad moody spaces The author doesn t simply idolize his subject he feels he needs to cover for Eastwood s failures and rationalizations the way one might for an absent or inadequate father Above all he wants us to see the star as misunderstood under unfair attack from all sides the women who demand something more than his sexual favors the liberal media with its shrill feminists and snobby elitists In an age when Ronald Reagan has slipped into the haze of Alzheimer s disease when Susan Faludi writes movingly of males clinging to stereotypical notions of machismo as they re laid off their factory jobs and symbolically robbed of potency it can put a lump in your throat to watch Schickel building like the hero in Field of Dreams a shrine to the Dad whom so many elements of the culture have come to undervalue Eastwood s decision to play dumb in films like The Gauntlet 1977 and Bronco Billy 1980 was a shrewd one It allows Schickel to write lines like A rude beast has been perceived slouching toward the Bethlehem of the New Masculinity waiting to be reborn in more cuddlesome form It also to be fair means that Eastwood can go where the Sylvester Stallones and Arnold Schwarzeneggers and Steven Seagals daren t His performance as Frank Horrigan an aging Secret Service agent in In The Line of Fire 1993 was the most affecting he has ever given a fallen stereotype a glimpse of the human caught in the pose But does the film subvert Eastwood s on screen persona as Schickel argues it does How He bests the bureaucratic fools He outwits the psychotic assassin He beds the young beautiful woman Do Eastwood s other movies really subvert the whole action genre Compared with Charles Bronson s maybe Munny s assertion in Unforgiven that it s a hell of a thing killing a man You take away everything he s got and everything he s ever gonna have was hailed by some critics as a brave line for Eastwood to utter given that he has dispatched so many anonymous thugs so offhandedly for so many years Brave but hypocritical Eastwood did more to make killing casual than anyone in mainstream cinema He paved the way for the Bronsons and Chuck Norrises and Seagals and Jean Claude Van Dammes and all the other righteous slayers of post midnight cable movie channel programming Will history judge the hero of Richard Schickel s Boswellian tome as ironic and postmodern Or as an enlightened Neanderthal profitably pretending to evolve
