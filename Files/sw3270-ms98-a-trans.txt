        well i dont know if theres gonna be a solutions to the US budget   well i know its in pretty disastrous shape for sure   umhum   its only getting worse exponentially it seems um   yes exactly theres uh maybe some short term things that they can do and it hurts everybodys pocket of course but um i know that state has uh cutback uh raises for a year to help uh the uh state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better in a better condition that   umhum oh which state is that   uh state of Minnesota   uhhuh   so theres the potential that perhaps you know the US budget might wanna take a look at its uh federal employees or and take a look at saying well lets freeze wages i mean everybodys doing it so it isnt like uh private business has had to do it so it might have to be something that they might consider doing as a shirt thats got to be very short term   umhum right right   and and the only other avenue that i can think of is um looking at where theyre spending the money and not so much as saying  well were spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the moneys uh   yep   for for instance i think you probably remember the military getting caught um with toilet seats that cost them four hundred five hundred dollars   right   and it was just i mean you can go to Kmart and buy them for uh eight dollars or i think six dollars or whatever for toilet seats so     yep yeah definitely i think that theres probably a lot of   so it gives you an idea that   waste in defense and in government funded research in the first place   sure sure so   i mean there was um people at Stanford who were soaking the government you know using millions of dollars of research money to um   uhhuh   for the President to buy beach homes or whatever it was   uhhuh   and i think that that may be more widespread   than we think sure   than well than wed like to think but  but then   sure yeah   you know its something thats hard to enforce too im sure   umhum it sure is the you know as far as i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days and actually uh the conferences were nothing but uh you know theyre getting paid for this and it was something more than just the conferences they were using it as eating out um when you think about people uh taking vacations these big government officials taking descendants in congress the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers money for that and its a real big crunch   umhum right   uh of course when they get caught then theyre you know theyre guilty of course but uh during that time im sure theres hundreds of uh thousands of people that are um spending money that does not belong to them   umhum well thats right the i think that oh politicians talk a lot about waste but im not sure that thats really that much of the   umhum   problem i mean when you look at   sure   something like the Gulf War it cost us God knows   umhum   how much you know at a million dollars a pop for Patriot missiles     exactly and i i dont think uh its ended up being i mean it gave people jobs   and yeah   but i think it also cost um quite a bit as far as because after theyre done with the war a lot of things were no longer put to use i mean it was kind of like okay well do this during this point and time but after that thats you know um they didnt wanna do it anymore   right umhum   so a lot of things that theyre saying that theyre no longer gonna be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so   umhum   i dont know  okay well it was good talking to you and have a good evening   right okay all right you too byebye   uhhuh thanks bye now
