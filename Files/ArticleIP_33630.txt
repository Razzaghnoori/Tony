set of voluntary guidelines outlined here which will raise the professional quality of behavior of legal commentators and the media outlets that broadcast them The guidelines suggest that pundits 1 comment only on subjects that the commentator knows first hand by watching the trial or reading trial transcripts 2 speak as neutral experts whenever possible and disclose potential conflicts of interest and biases and 3 refrain from scoring trials like sports events or predicting jury verdicts Two nationwide voluntary lawyers groups the American College of Trial Lawyers and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers have adopted similar codes for their members in response to the proposal which has been outlined in recent law review articles Professor Full Monty A Florida
