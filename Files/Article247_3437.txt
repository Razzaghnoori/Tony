 Sourpuss McCain Illiquid Forbes ELLEN I don t think the killers of Matthew Shepard had the brains to even perceive of teaching anyone a lesson I still disagree with you about TV s coverage of Columbine Yes of course there is the massive hypocrisy of the American public when they say in polls that the media is scum They love all the coverage love the Lady Di and Royal Family hagiography etc And of course a large mass murder at a high school especially with the Nazi and goth and geek overtones resonates with the public and media more than day traders in Atlanta but the coverage was mind numbing It was telling to me that CNN spent four hours of airtime on the funeral of the black boy who was killed That smacks of patronization to me And you have to admit that the coverage of JFK Jr s death was over the top Newsweek and Time milked it for two top selling issues Walter Isaacson s personal remarks about Kennedy were embarrassing Douglas Brinkley has ruined his career as a historian by rushing to every TV studio to talk about his good friend John His case reminded me of when Eric Burdon suddenly became Jimi Hendrix s best friend after he O D d in 70 Well we ve both been admonished from the Slate chieftains for straying from the news of the day My heart says Fuck them let s talk about what we want However since they were kind enough to invite us to the table I do have a few things to say about today s news I know you re not as fascinated by electoral politics as I am dismissing it all in a Ralph Nader sort of way but I cannot for the life of me understand the Beltway media s continuing love affair with Sen John McCain McCain is sleazy Talk to any reporter in Arizona which no Washington pundit does and you won t hear about what a maverick he is Instead they ll draw a picture of a sour press hating scumbag who s not very nice to women and has shady business dealings to boot People forget he was part of the Keating Five In today s Wall Street Journal Gerald Seib writes the same story about McCain that we ve seen for months He s unpredictable angers Republicans with his campaign finance and tobacco stands making him an honorary Democrat with that sort of lunacy but is fiercely pro life And of course his POW r sum I wish boomer pundits would get over the guilt of not serving in Vietnam They were right It was a stupid war and not worth fighting and dying for Get over not having that experience The New York Post and other papers reports today that Steve Forbes isn t quite as liquid as everyone thought and is going to have to sell some assets to compete with Bush I wonder how his family feels about his quixotic and ultimately selfish presidential campaign If I were one of his five daughters I d be sort of pissed But Forbes has caught the presidential aphrodisiac Instead of dealing with Bush and getting a plum position in his administration or running for senator from New Jersey where he d stand a better chance than Christie Whitman he s enriching the television stations in various states to get out his message I like his message but I read it every day on the Journal s editorial page I ll get to the Voice s redesign next time which is handsome but I ll close with a tidbit in today s New York Observer by Carl Swanson the under 30 media critic who writes like George Will The Voice has added a new biweekly column called Pucker Up about anal sex Swanson writes in his sniffy Observer way Nobody ever said the Voice was all about the high road and objects to the headline of the column I Am Butt Girl Hear My Ass Roar He then asks editor Don Forst if that isn t a bit too much Jesus what prudes we have in the media Anal sex in the Voice or NYPress is the norm I m sure readers won t raise an eyebrow Best RUSS
