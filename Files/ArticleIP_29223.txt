 Driving While Flossing Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence My 12 year old daughter is friends with a girl whose single parent mother is rarely at home While I understand that she has to work I cannot understand why she chooses to spend most of her free time with her boyfriend who lives an hour away The result is that her daughter is at my house most days after school well into the evening as well as most weekends Her mother calls to check on her but this is no substitute for the time and attention her daughter needs Both my daughter and I feel very sorry for her friend and understand her unwillingness to be alone so much but I am concerned by her mother s neglect and resent the free childcare I have considered sending the mother a note but am convinced it would only result in hurting the daughter and making her feel unwelcome in my house I do not want to be ungenerous to a child in need How should I handle this Concerned Mother Dear Con Sending a note to this neglectful mother you correctly imagine will not change the situation for the better The not so hot mother will become defensive and one way or another the kid will pay the price It sounds to Prudie as though you and your daughter like this child so why don t you redo your thinking privately and come to see this de facto member of your household as a kind of foster child Think of your open door policy as an act of charity a chance to make an important contribution to a youngster s life Your kind approach will also serve as a model for your own daughter If you think it useful discuss your new approach with your daughter It can only help her if she knows her own mom is consciously trying to make a difference It can only be a wonderful lesson by example for her to see generosity put into practice Prudie inclusively Dear Prudie Recently my wife wrote to you concerning my Your answer was predictable It s unsafe tell him to do this in private Well my wife nearly fainted to see me castigated in public no less on the Internet However I feel constrained to respond I never do this in an unsafe driving situation i e curves crowded lanes etc I ve done this all over the United States in New England mostly on the turnpike with never a mishap My wife cannot say the same and she doesn t floss while driving I guess what I m trying to say is if a person can maintain control of the situation he shouldn t be found guilty of not operating according to the manual Thanks for letting me vent Flosser s mate Dear Floss One might surmise that your driving record while flossing is better than the beloved s with both her hands free Perhaps this is a tug of war where the rope is symbolically dental floss Prudie hopes you two can settle this matter amicably so that the next step is not clenched teeth Prudie prophylactically Dear Prudence Some weeks ago I made the acquaintance of a new co worker of the opposite sex We hit it off well and I asked him to lunch After some scheduling problems we managed the meal and had I thought a charming time After that he was quite pleasant when we ran into each other Recently I asked him to join me again for lunch He pleaded the press of work and asked for a raincheck After letting a week tactfully pass I asked again He again declined mentioning the proverbial raincheck His manner has definitely changed and I know he s going to some lengths to avoid me Needless to say I am disappointed but I m certainly not planing to press my attentions on him Unfortunately the atmosphere now feels strained Should I speak to him or just let matters rest I m puzzled Thanks for your assistance Lunchless Dear Lunch To pass on a wise nugget from Prudie s favorite Dorothy Parker It s not the tragedies of life that defeat you it s the messes What has happened is that the object of your attention began to feel crowded for whatever reason It could be that he found you more aggressive than was comfortable since the first and second invitations were yours It could be that while he behaved politely the initial lunch was not as charming as you thought It could be that he intuited more of an interest on your part than he was prepared to deal with He could very well be neurotic or you may not be aware of your own firepower Whatever the actuality he is definitely ducking you and your next move should be this Behave in a cordial correct and distant manner When you encounter him simply nod smile and keep going This approach is the best thing for both of you Prudie plainly Dear Prudie I just received a wedding invitation via e mail at work It s from a person I don t really know that well I will not attend Am I obligated to send a gift eg244 Dear eg A wedding invitation via e mail At work And you don t know the person well My my how outr Do not even think of responding with a gift What might be in order however is a certificate of chutzpah Prudie properly Dear Prudie I have just written a letter to a friend I have been out of touch with for several years He and I were the closest of buddies Then my friend moved away from our small hometown and married We both settled down considerably I have written to him a couple of times over the last few years and have received no response I would really like to reawaken the friendship Any suggestions Anonymous in Wyoming Dear Anon The ways of the world are largely a matter of guesswork Your letter has every indication that your pal from the old days is uninterested in picking up the thread One might postulate a number of reasons Your youthful best pal may not remember things the way you do he may be disinclined to pick up a long distance friendship or sadly his life may have gone haywire and he just isn t up to rejuvenating the old bond Do leave things alone and accept that you may never know the underlying reasons Prudie regretfully
