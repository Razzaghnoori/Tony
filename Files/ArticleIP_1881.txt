 Mea Culpa A proposal to lure people into the District by slashing federal income tax rates for city residents got its second big boost in as many days yesterday when Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott joined House Speaker Newt Gingrich in endorsing it Washington Post July 16 1996 Forgive me reader for I have sinned I confess that I harbor a belief that contradicts much that I have held dear over the years that leads me to reject well established economic theory and practice that has earned me the understandable scorn of my Slate colleagues I confess I favor a substantial federal income tax break for the citizens of the District of Columbia So strongly moreover do I cling to this heretical belief that when one of my colleagues suggested I write a column attacking the district s tax remission on well accepted economic grounds I objected devotion to a free and fair airing of contrary opinions be damned Such narrow minded accountancy I argued would destroy the fragile political consensus on Capitol Hill that might actually produce a timely rescue Yes yes I stole the central theme of this column from a subordinate Another 200 days in Purgatory And finally oh Grand Inquisitor it will not have escaped your soul piercing gaze that as a resident of the District of Columbia I stand personally to benefit should the tax cut be enacted And yet I do not repent Of course I know most economists believe that local tax breaks do nothing to stimulate overall economic growth My files are as full as any policy wonk s with scholarly studies demonstrating that using tax lures to attract jobs and taxpayers often ends up robbing not just Peter but Paul as well Obviously much of the growth generated by such a break is merely stolen from other jurisdictions leading them to offer breaks of their own in an ultimately futile race to the bottom Less obviously the new citizens and businesses may be a bad deal Meeting their needs may require for example new roads and schools without the extra tax revenues needed to pay for them Nor does my heresy blind me to the inefficiency of tax transfers in affecting behavior economic or otherwise I will not deny that it has been shown that as much as 70 or 80 percent of a tax incentive often goes to pay for activity that would have taken place anyway As for the pious hope that the Internal Revenue Service will be able to police the new tax breaks to assure that all claimants are truly residents of the district and that the nation s capital has not become a flagrant tax haven well the IRS has a better chance here than in the Cayman Islands Surely you know argue my colleagues that Congress could just give as much money directly to the district government as the area would gain from a federal tax break at a fraction of the cost to the rest of the country Well this is where I start falling off the train We re talking after all about a city government that with an annual budget of about 5 billion and a shrinking population runs schools that cannot shelter much less educate its children cannot mend its roads or keep its drinking water potable cannot police its own police force let alone its streets or jails cannot care for the sick or elderly or homeless A government that cannot resist the importuning of any special interest or union that lacks both the will and the talent to reform itself What would make anyone think that giving more money to that government would fix anything The only thing that will save the district is more residents and more businesses able not only to pay more taxes but to take a lively interest in how they are governed And only tax benefits big ones will persuade them to move into an ill governed crumbling capital city Yes they will come initially at the expense of other especially neighboring jurisdictions But the areas around the capital have long prospered at the expense of the capital Their commuters benefit mightily from the services provided by the district yet pay no taxes to support those services The surrounding areas cannot ultimately flourish without a vibrant core Moreover the district unlike other cities and because of its unique constitutional origins cannot annex its fleeing middle class Nor can it claim the voting representation in Congress that in America s historical tradition has been considered the essential trade off for taxation That is why there is grumbling but little organized opposition in Virginia and Maryland to the tax grant to the district worth perhaps 700 million a year that is gathering bipartisan support in Congress Still you may ask why should the residents of East St Louis or Detroit provide tax breaks to the district when they have so many problems of their own Why should they allow the district s residents to enjoy a federal tax rate of say 15 percent when they themselves may face rates close to 40 percent Because it s the nation s capital and because it s a good investment No I do not profess that the tax breaks will pay for themselves in no time at all How could I when I have so often written that they will not But the supply siders are quite right when they say that economies are not a zero sum game Is it too large a leap of faith to believe that the right incentives ones that capitalize on the comparative advantages of people or locations can reap positive returns not just for the direct beneficiaries but for the larger society Here is a beautiful city one that ought to make any American proud Its well tended by the federal government parks monuments mansions embassies and museums can compare with those of any city in the world Paris or New York it is not but its downtown streets have a polyglot vitality they lacked only a few decades ago Its neighborhoods are filled with solid housing and well kept gardens and not just in the wealthy enclaves You can have a park in your backyard as I do and still make it to work in 15 minutes if you keep a sharp eye out for the potholes It would be nice if more of the newcomers were artists artisans and producers rather than lawyers and lobbyists but head for head I ll stack up Washington s intellectual capital against any competitor s A timely expenditure of tax revenues might just work wonders And even if the costs were a dead economic loss to other jurisdictions surely there are gains in national pride for recompense I confess that I cannot prove I am right in my belief Costly error or painful recriminations lie on either side of my position The money might after all be wasted on windfalls On the other hand it s also possible that the tax incentives would miraculously repay the federal coffers many fold In either case my knees are ready If Paris is worth a mass Washington is worth a
