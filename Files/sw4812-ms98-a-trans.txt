        so how do you feel about it   uh i i i dont see any problem with with random testing for random drugs   yeah i i myself almost um am in favor of it uh i work at Honeywell and i went through a a pretty i dont know i went through a standard drug testing thing before i i was brought on   umhum   i think thats pretty standard at least at Honeywell it is um i think its important to insure the quality and and uh i dont know almost the goodness of character you know and that kind of thing where do you work   yeah um well im a graduate student right now at Carnegie Mellon and i i just came from Saint Paul uh interviewing with Three M   oh okay oh okay hm oh great   and uh they have a policy for uh testing if if you if they make you an offer then theyll test you right before you start   right   and i guess the only drawback i can see to to drug testing is in in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some uh sort of false positive result   umhum   then there could be some sort of problem but uh it   yeah yeah and that that definitely happens you know i mean those the drug tests assure us theyre accurate but theres always that margin of error   yeah   and thats thats something to be aware of another thing is a lot of times you know they arent that accurate or they arent that sensitive like if youre on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that   yeah   you know i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for Honeywell and uh uh you know i know they didnt catch that or else they would have said something um im sure they screen for just a particular few types although the literature they give with you says yeah we do this and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for   right   um i dont know what what program are you in over at Carnegie Mellon   uh electrical engineering   oh okay great um yeah im a graduate student at UCF in Florida University of Central Florida and this is actually a  an internship up here   oh wow     but um they uh even for interns they they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing so   uh they they test you um before they before you start or before you even interview or   right um they essentially  no i sure dont  um they essentially um they essentially uh made me the offer and then and then uh did the drug testing thing after that so uh it was one of those things where you go through the the general battery of all their tests and and then they essentially give you the offer   uhhuh   and then at that point theyll theyll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that   oh   so uh theres some noise on this end im actually in a mall calling so   oh  yeah   you probably wondered huh but so   what what happens if you were to fail then do they give you like one chance one more chance or two more chances   yeah thats a good question i believe from what i remember of the literature they gave uh if you fail i believe they give you one more chance they probably give you a chance to explain yourself   umhum   and then maybe give you another chance to go through it but uh you know once again those things are not that accurate so theres undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail you know but um what are you working right now anywhere or   uh no im just about to finish my masters in May and uh just interviewing with companies right now   okay oh okay great yeah that was the first time id ever gotten any kind of drug screening you know was was going to Honeywell a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there and hes doing an internship with IBM   umhum oh   and uh they basically uh did the same exact thing um we both got our internships at the same time and we both had to go through drug tresting at the same time so one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process but uh   do do they test you at right now at work too   no no thats one thing they dont do is is drug testing while youre on the job uh i think i think the unwritten rule is yeah expect it but they dont do it   okay oh   you know so thats good i guess i dont know i mean i uh i have gone to a couple of parties since since that time and while i dont do any drugs myself ive seen some people who work there um you know smoking a joint or whatever and uh   umhum   you know thats the kind of thing that would definitely come up you know but no they dont they dont really do that   wow is it formal policy that they said that they might test   yeah
