 Introduction Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women from developed countries Axillary lymph node status is widely accepted as an important parameter for assessing prognosis in breast cancer patients However recurrence and death also occur in patients with node negative breast cancer NNBC A recurrence rate of 30 may be expected during the first 5 years after diagnosis Prognostic factors such as tumour size tumour grading hormone receptor status age histology ploidy and proliferation index are used to define subgroups of high risk NNBC patients 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Despite the availability of these prognostic markers high risk NNBC patients cannot be identified with sufficient accuracy This has led to a search for new and possibly stronger prognostic markers in order to define new subgroups and to facilitate decision making with respect to appropriate therapy 2 3 9 Numerous reports have described the correlation between amplification of oncogenes and its impact on the course of breast cancer disease 4 5 6 7 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 In a meta analysis in which 29 studies were evaluated 33 c myc amplification exhibited significant but weak associations with tumour grade lymph node metastasis negative progesterone receptor status and postmenopausal status Furthermore c myc amplification was significantly associated with risk for recurrence and death However studies in recent years have further shown that the c myc gene participates in most aspects of cellular function including replication growth metabolism differentiation and apoptosis 34 Amplification of the oncogene HER 2 neu has also been shown to be indicative of poor prognosis in breast cancer Studies revealed that the prognostic effect of HER 2 neu is stronger for survival than for recurrence 16 19 20 22 27 29 Furthermore increased HER 2 neu levels in primary tumours were associated with a poor response to endocrine therapy 5 12 15 32 A drawback of many studies of oncogenes in human breast cancer is that usually only one oncogene was evaluated Based on a series of unselected cases in the present study we examined the possible influence of the amplification of the oncogenes c myc and HER 2 neu on disease free survival DFS and overall survival OS Furthermore we studied whether adjuvant therapies such as chemotherapy and endocrine treatment or no treatment at all had any impact on DFS and OS among oncogene amplified NNBC patients 1 2 3 8 9 32 35 36 37 38 Patients and methods Among 181 NNBC patients who had undergone breast conserving therapy or modified mastectomy combined with axillary lymphadenectomy of level 1 and 2 at least 10 lymph nodes per patient had been removed c myc and HER 2 neu oncogenes were assessed prospectively using double differential PCR Table 1shows some clinical histological and molecular parameters The median follow up period was 42 months Postoperatively the following therapies were administered in addition to radiotherapy tamoxifen 20 mg day for 5 years in 54 7 of patients and chemotherapy six cycles of cyclophosphamide methotrexate 5 fluorouracil CMF or four cycles of fluorouracil epirubicin cyclophosphamide FEC in 33 7 of patients Of the NNBC patients 11 6 did not receive any further systemic therapy After tissue preparation malignant and normal tissues were kept fresh and transported to the pathologist U B The pathologist dissected samples for assessment of oncogenes and hormone receptors A positive receptor status was defined as the presence of more than 10 fmol mg cytosol protein The histopathological grading was performed according to the method of Bloom and Richardson 39 Lymph node sections were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin immunohistochemical investigations were not performed The tumour tissues were stored at 70 C and the DNA was isolated using the Fast Prep System Bio 101 Savant Savant Instruments Inc Holbrook NY USA Less than 200 mg 10 200 mg tissue was homogenized using FastDNA Kit in the Fast Prep Machine After preparing the DNA the content was measured and the isolated DNA was stored at 20 C General details for the double differential PCR technique reproducibility and clinical significance were described previously 17 18 28 40 A cutoff point of more than 2 0 average gene copy number AGCN was considered to be positive for HER 2 neu amplification 40 To calculate the cutoff point for c myc amplification all NNBC patients were subjected to Classification and Regression Trees CART analysis A cutoff value of 2 1 AGCN for c myc oncogene led to the best distinction between patients Fig 1shows the CART analysis for all c myc values 41 Results were evaluated using the SPSS system SPSS GmbH Software Munich Germany The monoparametric survival curves were determined using the Kaplan Meier method in order to estimate the impacts of intratumoural c myc and HER 2 neu oncogene amplification on DFS and OS Statistical deviations were defined using the log rank test Recurrence of disease was found at the following locations local n 2 contralateral n 1 axilla n 2 lung n 1 brain n 1 liver n 1 and skin n 1 During the period of observation 14 patients died In order to derive relevant information regarding the effects of oncogene amplification on the course of breast cancer disease the accumulated values were determined after postoperative periods of 36 and 95 months We applied the multivariate Cox model to enable us to identify independently predictive parameters 42 Parameters considered included the oncogenes c myc and HER 2 neu tumour size histopathological grading oestrogen receptor status and age 40 or 40 years P 0 05 was considered statistically significant Results The prevalence rates for amplification of c myc and HER 2 neu were 21 5 and 30 4 respectively Coamplification was found in 22 patients 12 2 Table 1 Among those patients with c myc amplification five recurrences were identified 5 39 12 8 and among those with HER 2 neu amplification two recurrences 2 55 3 6 were identified Among those patients in whom neither c myc nor HER 2 neu were amplified four recurrences were found 4 109 3 6 and among those with coamplification of both oncogenes two recurrences 2 22 9 1 were observed Four patients with c myc amplification 4 39 10 3 and three patients with HER 2 neu amplification 3 55 5 5 died Nine patients who lacked amplification of either oncogene 9 109 8 3 and two patients with coamplification 2 22 9 1 died Using univariate analysis c myc amplified cancers were associated with a significantly lower DFS of 85 3 as compared with 97 3 P 0 0290 among c myc non amplified breast cancers Ninety five months after diagnosis operation the estimated DFS of c myc amplified cancer patients was only 85 3 as compared with 95 6 among c myc nonamplified patients P 0 0079 Comparison of nonamplified cancers with HER 2 neu amplified cancers did not reveal any significant differences with regard to DFS Fig 2 Multivariate analysis revealed that c myc amplification and tumour size in contrast to oestrogen receptor status grading and age were the only independent parameters impacting on DFS Table 2 With regard to OS no independent parameters were identified among the prognostic markers referred to above Regarding various adjuvant systemic therapies such as chemotherapy CMF FEC and endocrine therapy tamoxifen no significant differences were observed with respect to DFS and OS in c myc amplified and HER 2 neu amplified NNBC patients in comparison with non amplified patients However significantly shorter DFS and OS were observed among c myc amplified patients who did not receive systemic adjuvant therapy No corresponding associations were found among HER 2 neu amplified NNBC patients as compared with nonamplified patients Tables 3and 4 Discussion Numerous clinical studies have proved axillary lymph node status to be the dominant factor for prognosis and prediction of DFS and OS in breast cancer patients The fact of the matter is that even among NNBC patients 25 30 can be expected to progress or even die The advantage conferred by adjuvant chemotherapy or endocrine therapy was examined in randomized studies 2 3 8 9 35 36 37 38 Because adjuvant therapies may positively impact on outcome in only around 15 the costs of these therapies make their routine application in all NNBC patients inappropriate 1 For this reason predictive factors that accurately define subgroups of NNBC patients who may benefit from adjuvant systemic therapy would be a great advantage In the present study the oncogenes c myc and HER 2 neu were examined with regard to their ability to predict DFS OS and rate of recurrence as well as mortality All patients were randomly selected from one department Frauenklinik Klinikum Ibbenbueren Ibbenbueren Germany C myc amplification was identified in 21 5 and HER 2 neu amplification in 30 4 Berns and coworkers 12 13 14 reported amplification of c myc in 20 and of HER 2 neu in 24 using a standard southern blot technique In a selected high risk cohort of NNBC patients Roux Dosseto et al 26 applied the same method and found prevalence rates for c myc and HER 2 neu amplification of 25 and 31 respectively Those oncogenes were assessed in the present study using a double differential PCR technique 17 18 40 43 Using this method Brandt et al 17 found c myc to be amplified in 19 7 and HER 2 neu in 16 7 of breast cancers without consideration of nodal status coamplification of those oncogenes was present in 7 In the present study simultaneous amplification of both oncogenes was observed in 12 2 As in the present investigation Roux Dosseto et al 26 found that c myc amplification among NNBC patients was significantly associated with earlier recurrence in univariate and multivariate analyses However HER 2 neu amplified NNBC patients did not have the same outcome Accordingly c myc amplification appears to be an independent prognostic marker which has greater predictive power than does oestrogen receptor status and tumour grade As early as 1992 Berns and coworkers 11 12 14 reported that patients with c myc amplified breast cancers had an unfavourable prognosis The first study to mention possible prognostic importance of HER 2 neu gene amplification was reported in 1987 by Slamon et al 27 That study included 187 patients with NNBC and node positive breast cancer by univariate and multivariate analyses it revealed that HER 2 neu amplification correlated very closely with shorter DFS and OS in a subgroup of 87 node positive patients In 1993 in an analysis of 210 patients Press et al 7 found that amplification of HER 2 neu correlated with unfavourable prognosis with respect to DFS Attempts by other investigators to confirm these findings were met with various degrees of success Some studies claimed that HER 2 neu status was an independent predictive factor in the case of breast cancer whereas other studies could not confirm this 6 14 16 19 29 30 It is certainly of great interest to the clinician that only two out of five studies including more than 100 patients and with a follow up period of at least 3 years attributed some prognostic value to HER 2 neu amplification among patients with NNBC 6 7 16 19 28 Almost all of the studies that dealt with HER 2 neu status and DFS as well as OS showed no benefit of this oncogene in the prognosis of NNBC patients In a survey conducted by Ravdin and Chamness 24 only one 22 of 11 studies concerning immunohistochemical overexpression of HER 2 neu indicated a significant result with respect to OS in multivariate analysis In the present study 19 out of 39 c myc amplified patients received chemotherapy 15 patients received endocrine therapy and five patients received no further therapy The greatest recurrence rates were noted in the group of patients who received no therapy 20 and in those who received chemotherapy 16 The lowest recurrence rate of 7 was seen in patients treated with tamoxifen All patients who received endocrine therapy n 99 were characterized by positive oestrogen and or progesterone receptor status The proto oncogene c myc can be upregulated by oestrogen stimulation of hormone dependent breast cancer cells Endocrine therapy with the antioestrogen tamoxifen can mediate the downregulation of c myc culminating in cell cycle arrest 44 Berns et al 12 reported that 38 of patients with amplification of c myc or with coamplification of c myc and HER 2 neu profited from endocrine therapy C myc amplified patients affected by metastatic disease showed a tendency toward longer DFS with endocrine therapy as compared with shorter DFS following second line chemotherapy However the minor rate of response after chemotherapy did not correlate with OS The poorer responses to chemotherapy among patients with c myc amplified tumours in the present study recurrence rate 16 may be in agreement with experimental findings in erythroleukaemia cells that the degree of cis platinum resistance correlated directly with the level of c myc expression 45 In the present study 26 out of 55 HER 2 neu amplified patients received chemotherapy 22 patients received endocrine therapy and seven patients received no further therapy In total low recurrence rates of 3 8 4 5 and 0 were found in the above mentioned therapy groups respectively Table 3 Compared with nonamplified patients administered the same therapies no significant differences with regard to DFS and OS were observed In contrast to that finding c myc amplified patients not administered adjuvant systemic therapy exhibited a significantly shorter DFS and OS than did nonamplified patients who also received no adjuvant systemic therapy However the therapy groups analyzed in the present study are small and therefore we recommend careful interpretation of the findings Higher recurrence rates or poor response to endocrine treatment with tamoxifen in patients with HER 2 neu amplified hormone receptor positive tumours as reported in studies in node positive or metastatic breast cancer 12 15 32 were not observed in the present study Although deregulated HER 2 neu activity can strongly stimulate cytoplasmic signalling pathways which in turn impinge on c myc at multiple levels causing its deregulated expression 46 this scenario does not appear to be active in NNBC because the recurrence rate of 22 c myc and HER 2 neu coamplified patients was only 9 However among those patients in whom coamplification of c myc and HER 2 neu was absent the recurrence rate was lower 4 109 3 6 Differences in the numbers of recurrences and deaths can be accounted for by the fact that some deaths were not related to tumours Conclusion C myc amplification appears to represent a prognostic marker with which early recurrence may be predicted in NNBC patients C myc amplified NNBC patients who were not administered adjuvant systemic therapy suffer shorter DFS and OS C myc could be used together with the tumour associated protease urokinase plasminogen activator and its inhibitor i e plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 after further randomized studies have been conducted to confirm whether NNBC patients should receive adjuvant systemic therapy 47 48 49 Competing interests None declared
