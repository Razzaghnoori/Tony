 Background Common variable immunodeficiency CVID and selective immunoglobulin G subclass deficiency IgGSD are characterized by subnormal serum concentrations of total IgG or by normal serum total IgG concentrations with deficiency of one or more IgG subclasses respectively in some cases IgA or IgM levels are also subnormal 1 2 3 Most persons are diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD because they have increased frequency and severity of infections due to bacteria and other microbial pathogens 1 4 Although a susceptibility locus for these disorders has not been identified they often appear to be familial and to segregate with markers on Ch6p 1 5 6 The purpose of the present work was to quantify and analyze the frequencies of HLA A and B phenotypes and haplotypes in index cases with CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama who presented because they had increased frequency or severity of infections and to compare the present results to those of control subjects in this geographic area We also evaluated the relationships of HLA A and B phenotype frequencies and haplotypes with phenotypes defined by serum immunoglobulin concentrations and we estimated the combined frequency of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama based upon the occurrence of these disorders in the spouses of the present index cases The implications of the present results in determining the hereditary basis and immunoglobulin phenotype expression of CVID and IgGSD are discussed Methods Selection of Subjects General Criteria for Selection of Study Subjects The performance of this work was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of Brookwood Medical Center and the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the Ethical Principles for Medical Research involving Human Subjects promulgated by the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki were followed All subjects were adults 18 years of age who identified themselves as Caucasians each resided in central Alabama The first persons in respective families diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD were designated as index cases All index persons were diagnosed in routine medical care in a single community medical center none was diagnosed as a consequence of family or population screening We included all evaluable index patients diagnosed between November 1991 and June 2002 CVID and IgGSD Index Cases Each patient was diagnosed to have CVID or IgGSD deficiency as an adult because he she had frequent or unusually severe infections Each patient had a single severe or life threatening infection that required hospitalization or four or more infections per year that required antibiotic therapy for at least two consecutive years None was known to have pre existing isolated IgA deficiency or other abnormality of immunity Diagnoses were based on demonstration of persistent otherwise unexplained serum concentrations of immunoglobulins 2 S D below the corresponding mean levels 1 Criteria for the diagnosis of CVID were 1 decreased total serum IgG concentration and 2 either decreased IgG subclass es decreased serum IgA concentration or decreased serum IgM concentration 1 Criteria for the diagnosis of IgGSD were 1 normal total serum IgG concentration and 2 abnormally low serum concentrations of one or more IgG subclasses some patients with IgGSD also had decreased levels of IgA or IgM levels 1 We excluded persons of African American descent because 1 certain HLA types and haplotypes differ significantly among Caucasians and African Americans in central Alabama 7 8 9 10 2 in adults serum concentrations of immunoglobulins are often greater in persons of sub Saharan African descent than in whites 11 12 and 3 persons of sub Saharan descent occur infrequently in series of CVID or IgGSD patients 4 and such patients are uncommon in our experience We also excluded persons who had isolated deficiencies of IgA or IgM those with hypogammaglobulinemia attributable to B cell neoplasms e g B chronic lymphocytic leukemia plasma cell myeloma macroglobulinemia or non Hodgkin s lymphoma or those with markedly increased immunoglobulin loss e g nephrotic syndrome or protein losing enteropathy Control Subjects Data from 1 321 apparently normal unrelated Caucasian adult subjects from Alabama who had undergone HLA A and B phenotype analysis as part of paternity testing were used to estimate allele and gene frequencies 10 13 HLA A and B haplotypes were determined in 751 unrelated Caucasian subjects from Alabama who had undergone testing to establish paternity 10 Haplotypes were assessed from a child and his her mother or father and included in the data set Preliminary data analysis revealed that frequencies of the major HLA A and B haplotypes observed in the present control subjects were similar to those estimated to occur in Caucasians from a large national bone marrow donor program 14 Family Members We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD deficiency in some family members using the same criteria defined herein for index patients These persons presented themselves for evaluation after an index case was diagnosed in their respective kinships because they also had increased frequency and severity of bacterial infections Although other relatives of index cases were also reported to have increased frequency and severity of infections or to have some form of antibody deficiency they were not included in the present study because we did not evaluate them Screening or other systematic testing of family members of the present index cases was beyond the scope of the present study Laboratory Methods Serum concentrations of IgG IgA IgM and IgG subclasses were measured using standard automated methods before IgG replacement therapy was initiated Reference ranges for serum immunoglobulin concentrations are total IgG 700 1600 mg dL IgG 1 422 1292 mg dL IgG 2 117 747 mg dL IgG 3 41 129 mg dL IgG 4 1 291 mg dL total IgA 70 400 mg dL and IgM 40 230 mg dL The basis of these reference ranges has been reported elsewhere 15 Deficiency of an immunoglobulin class or subclass was defined by a serum concentration at diagnosis that was less than the corresponding lower reference limit Measurement of IgA subclasses IgD or IgE in serum was not routinely performed HLA A and B alleles were detected using low resolution DNA based typing PCR sequence specific oligonucleotide probe in index cases 16 Control subjects were tested using the microdroplet lymphocytotoxicity test 8 subjects were evaluated using antisera that detected allele assignments described in the 9 thInternational Histocompatibility Workshop 17 Because the levels of resolution of the DNA based and serological typing methods we used are similar alleles detected by these respective methods provide concordant allele assignments with the exception of B 70 and B 71 that were not detected by serological methods HLA typing of family members was performed to permit assignment of Ch6p haplotypes In each index patient in whom a single A or B allele was detected by DNA based typing we verified the allele s and set phase to ascertain haplotypes of the index patient using HLA analyses of appropriate family members For the present analysis all haplotypes were defined only by A and B alleles Statistical Considerations A data set that included HLA A and B phenotypes in 240 index patients with either CVID or IgGSD and HLA A and B haplotypes in 195 of these 240 index patients was available Absolute or uncorrected values of A and B phenotype frequencies in index cases A and B haplotype frequencies and occurrence of two haplotype combinations were calculated after enumeration of the raw data To correct for the possible occurrence of spurious HLA antigen and haplotype associations due to multiple comparisons we also computed values of p using the Bonferroni inequality method 18 Corrected values of p are displayed in tabular form along with uncorrected values A computer spreadsheet Excel 2000 Microsoft Corp Redmond WA and a statistical program GB Stat v 8 0 2000 Dynamic Microsystems Inc Silver Spring MD were used to perform the present analyses Means were compared using a student t test two tail Frequency values were compared using chi square analysis or Fisher s exact test one tail as appropriate A value of p 0 05 was defined as significant Only significant values of p are displayed and these are expressed to four significant figures Results General Characteristics of CVID and IgGSD Index Patients There were approximately equal fractions of index patients with CVID and IgGSD respectively Table 1 There was a preponderance of women in index patients in both disorders The mean ages of patients in CVID and IgGSD groups were similar In CVID the most frequent pattern of IgG deficiency was that of IgG 1 IgG 3 subclasses In persons with IgGSD isolated IgG 3 deficiency was the most frequent IgG subclass deficiency phenotype Table 1 Eight of the present index patients 3 CVID 5 IgGSD 2 men 6 women also had hemochromatosis associated with homozygosity for HFE C282Y on Ch6p another man had CVID and a hemochromatosis phenotype associated with the HFE genotype C282Y H63D Frequencies of HLA A and B Phenotypes Sixteen A phenotypes were detected in 240 index cases and control subjects Table 2 The most frequent A phenotypes in index cases were A 02 0 5292 A 01 0 3458 and A 03 0 2875 The most frequent A phenotypes in controls were A 02 0 5206 A 01 0 3397 and A 03 0 2739 The phenotype A 24 occurred with significantly greater frequency in index cases 0 3000 index cases vs 0 1304 controls p 0 0001 uncorrected and p 0 0016 corrected There were no other significant differences in HLA A phenotype frequencies between these groups Table 2 Thirty two B phenotypes were detected in 240 index cases Table 3 Thirty B phenotypes were detected in control subjects The most frequent B phenotypes in index cases were B 44 0 3167 B 07 0 2667 and B 08 0 2583 The most frequent B alleles in controls were B 44 0 2866 B 08 0 2487 and B 07 0 2259 The frequencies of B 14 B 15 B 35 B 40 B 49 and B 50 were significantly greater in index cases based on uncorrected values of p Table 3 The frequencies of B 14 and B 40 were significantly greater in index cases based on corrected values of p Table 3 The frequencies of B 58 and B 62 were significantly lower in index cases based on uncorrected values of p Table 3 The frequency of B 62 was significantly lower in index cases based on a corrected value of p Table 3 Frequencies of HLA A and B Haplotypes Data were available that permitted frequency comparisons to be made between index cases and probands for 85 haplotypes The most frequent haplotypes in index cases were A 02 B 44 frequency 0 1385 A 01 B 08 frequency 0 1308 and A 03 B 07 frequency 0 1000 Table 4 Each of these haplotypes was significantly more frequent in index cases than in control subjects uncorrected values of p 0 0001 0 0252 and 0 0011 respectively Table 4 After performing the Bonferroni corrections the frequency of A 02 B 44 alone was significantly increased in probands p 0 0085 Table 4 Three other haplotypes were also significantly more frequent in index cases based on uncorrected values of p These were A 03 B 14 A 31 B 40 and A 32 B 14 Table 4 The combined frequencies of these three latter haplotypes were 0 0411 in index patients and 0 0126 in control subjects p 0 0002 uncorrected and p 0 0166 corrected Two haplotypes were significantly more frequent in control subjects based on uncorrected values of p These were A 02 B 60 and A 03 B 44 Table 4 However these differences were no longer significant after correction using the Bonferroni method Homozygosity for these haplotypes was observed in some index cases A 02 B 07 n 1 A 02 B 44 n 4 A 02 B 62 n 1 and A 03 B 07 n 2 Fifty two of 195 index patients 26 7 were HLA haploidentical with at least one other index case in the present study Table 5 Forty eight of these 52 index patients 92 3 had the haplotypes A 01 B 08 A 02 B 44 or A 03 B 07 Altogether eighteen different haplotypes defined by A and B typing were observed in these 52 index cases Table 5 Segregation of HLA Haplotypes with CVID or IgGSD in Kinships We diagnosed CVID or IgGSD in first degree or other relatives of 26 of 195 index patients for whom HLA A and B haplotypes had been ascertained These haplotypes segregated with CVID or IgGSD in 24 of the 26 kinships A 01 B 08 10 kinships A 02 B 08 1 kinship A 02 B 44 8 kinships Fig 1 A 02 B 50 1 kinship A 03 B 07 1 kinship A 11 B 35 1 kinship and A 29 B 44 2 kinships In one of the two remaining kinships both A 02 B 07 and A 03 B 07 segregated with CVID or IgGSD Fig 2 In the other remaining kinship one index patient and her sister had IgGSD but they were HLA nonidentical However each of these women inherited a haplotype significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD index patient A 02 B 44 and A 03 B 57 sister A 03 B 35 and A 23 B 27 Relationships of HLA Phenotypes and Haplotypes to Immunoglobulin Phenotypes Comparison of HLA A and B Phenotype Frequencies in CVID and IgGSD The frequencies of A phenotypes were similar in the CVID and IgGSD with the exceptions that HLA A 24 which occurred with significantly greater frequency in IgGSD cases 0 4206 vs 0 1667 CVID p 0 0001 and that HLA A 31 was more frequent in CVID cases 0 0877 vs 0 0238 IgGSD p 0 0277 The frequencies of HLA B phenotypes were similar in the two groups with the exceptions that B 07 and B 50 occurred with significantly greater frequencies in IgGSD cases 0 3333 vs 0 1930 CVID p 0 0101 and 0 0635 vs 0 p 0 0052 respectively and that B 55 occurred more frequently in CVID cases 0 0439 vs 0 IgGSD p 0 0231 Comparison of Haplotype Frequencies in CVID and IgGSD The haplotype frequencies in CVID and IgGSD did not differ significantly with two exceptions The frequency of A 23 B 44 was significantly greater in CVID patients than in IgGSD patients 0 0263 vs 0 respectively p 0 0267 The frequency of A 24 B 35 was greater in patients with IgGSD than in patients with CVID 0 0250 vs 0 respectively p 0 0346 Possible Dose Effect of Haplotype on Total Serum Immunoglobulin Concentrations Eleven haplotypes occurred with significantly greater frequency in index patients with CVID and IgGSD than in control subjects described above Mean values of serum IgG IgA or IgM did not vary significantly according to the inheritance of 0 1 or 2 of these eleven haplotypes Table 6 Similarly some index patients in each pattern of IgG subclass deficiency were positive for one or two of these eleven haplotypes with the exception of the sole index patient with deficiencies of IgG 1 IgG 2 and IgG 4 who did not have any of these twelve haplotypes Frequencies of Index Patients with HLA Haplotype A 01 B 08 Some reports suggest that IgA deficiency segregates with a HLA haplotype s containing A 01 B 08 in some families 4 5 6 19 20 Thus we analyzed the frequencies of the haplotype A 01 B 08 in the present index patients grouped according to presence of normal or subnormal pre treatment serum concentrations of IgG IgA and IgM respectively Although frequencies of positivity for A 01 B 08 were slightly greater in index patients who had deficiencies of IgG IgA or IgM these differences were not significant Table 7 There were insufficient numbers of index patients homozygous for A 01 B 08 to estimate the effect of homozygosity for this haplotype on serum immunoglobulin concentrations Disparity of Immunoglobulin Phenotype in Family Members with Same HLA Haplotype In some kinships different immunoglobulin deficiency phenotypes were observed among family members with CVID or IgGSD who shared HLA A and B haplotypes One representative pedigree demonstrating these disparities between immunoglobulin phenotype frequency of infections and HLA haplotype is displayed in Figure 1 In a second kinship two different haplotypes segregated with antibody deficiency although the immunoglobulin deficiency pattern was different in each of three affected family members Fig 2 One pair of monozygotic twins was available for evaluation The index patient had IgGSD IgG 3 subclass deficiency HLA A24 25 B15 49 and recurrent upper and lower respiratory tract infections Her twin had normal serum concentrations of total IgG IgG subclasses IgA and IgM and did not report increased frequency or severity of infections Estimation of Population Frequency of CVID and IgGSD The occurrence of CVID and IgGSD in spouses of the present index cases permitted us to estimate the combined population frequency of CVID and IgGSD in adults At the time of diagnosis 217 of the present 240 index cases had spouses Of these 217 spouses we diagnosed CVID in one and IgGSD in another because they also had increased frequency and severity of bacterial infections predominantly those of the upper and lower respiratory tracts Thus a conservative estimate of the combined frequencies of these disorders in adults in central Alabama is 0 0092 2 217 Discussion The present observations demonstrate that CVID and IgGSD in Caucasian adults diagnosed in routine medical care delivery are significantly associated with HLA haplotypes on Ch6p More than two thirds of the present 195 index patients who were evaluable for haplotyping inherited one or two of the significantly associated haplotypes A 01 B 08 A 02 B 44 A 03 B 07 A 03 B 14 A 31 B 40 and A 32 B 14 This indicates that a susceptibility locus loci for CVID and IgGSD occurs on multiple haplotypes defined by HLA A and B typing Further this implies that putative Ch6p alleles associated with CVID or IgGSD susceptibility occur on many HLA haplotypes that are common in Caucasians in central Alabama 10 and in Caucasians from a large national bone marrow donor program 14 The present observations also confirm and extend the reports of association of HLA haplotype A 01 B 08 or an extended haplotype containing A 01 and B 08 with heritable forms of immunoglobulin deficiency demonstrated in family based analyses 3 6 19 20 21 22 It is likely that a candidate gene s for CVID or IgGSD exists in the HLA class II region 6 19 20 21 22 23 Because the class II region is closer to the HLA B locus than to the HLA A locus it is plausible that candidate gene s for CVID or IgGSD in the class II region are in greater linkage disequilibrium with HLA B than HLA A This is consistent with the aggregate observations on HLA A and B typing in the present study The present observations demonstrate that the frequencies of HLA A and B phenotypes and haplotypes were not significantly different in CVID and IgGSD index patients with few exceptions These observations could be explained by the occurrence of an HLA linked allele that is necessary to cause either CVID or IgGSD but is insufficient to induce a specific immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype Alternatively the variable immunoglobulin deficiency phenotypes presently classified as CVID and IgGSD are best explained by the co inheritance of multiple alleles each of which has an independent effect on the immunoglobulin deficiency phenotype Regardless the variability we observed in IgG IgA and IgM phenotypes in index patients and family members is best explained by the co inheritance of multiple allele s that influence the immunoglobulin phenotype This is consistent with evidence for the occurrence on Ch6p of multiple distinct susceptibility genes for patterns of immunoglobulin deficiency some recessive and others dominant 20 For example at least two putative alleles associated with heritable IgA deficiency occur on Ch6p and each is associated with a different major histocompatibility MHC region haplotype 22 23 whereas a putative susceptibility locus on chromosome 18 is not a major contributor to selective IgA deficiency 24 Allele s on chromosomes other than Ch6p may also influence the phenotypic expression of CVID and IgGSD in adults The inheritance of certain polymorphisms of the mannose binding lectin gene on Ch10 in persons with CVID are associated with earlier age of onset of manifestations of antibody deficiency and with increased risk of autoimmunity 25 Altogether these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that many common heritable antibody deficiency phenotypes collectively diagnosed as CVID or IgGSD are the result of the inheritance of multiple disease predisposing alleles on Ch6p and possibly other chromosomes We have estimated that the prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in adults in central Alabama is 0 0092 This estimated prevalence could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many of the HLA haplotypes significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD are also common in the general population This could also explain a the inheritance of two significantly associated HLA haplotypes in many of the present index cases including most of the index patients who were HLA haploidentical with at least one other index patient b the disparate immunoglobulin deficiency phenotypes of multiple family members who inherited the same HLA haplotype and c the occurrence of disparate haplotypes in two sisters who had similar immunoglobulin phenotypes Some of the haplotypes significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD in the present study also occur with significantly increased frequencies in central Alabama Caucasian hemochromatosis probands with homozygosity for HFE C282Y on Ch6p 10 These haplotypes are A 03 B 07 and A 03 B 14 10 present study These observations imply that susceptibility alleles for CVID and IgGSD occur on haplotypes that sometimes include the HFE C282Y allele In addition the haplotypes A 01 B 08 and A 02 B 44 significantly associated with CVID and IgGSD in the present study are common in both hemochromatosis probands homozygous for HFE C282Y and control subjects in Alabama 10 present study Taken together these observations could explain the occurrence of CVID or IgGSD and hemochromatosis due to HFE C282Y homozygosity in some of the present index patients 26 and account for the occurrence of IgA deficiency and hemochromatosis in different members of the same family 27 Conclusions CVID and IgGSD are significantly associated with the HLA haplotypes A 01 B 08 A 02 B 44 A 03 B 07 A 03 B 14 A 31 B 40 and A 32 B 14 Many of these haplotypes are also common in the Alabama Caucasian population Immunoglobulin phenotype variability demonstrated in index cases and in family studies suggest that there are multiple gene s on Ch6p or other chromosomes that modify the immunoglobulin phenotypes of CVID and IgGSD The estimated prevalence of these disorders in central Alabama is 0 0092 The estimated prevalence of CVID and IgGSD in central Alabama could be reasonably attributed to the fact that many HLA haplotypes significantly associated with these disorders are also common in the general population Competing Interests None declared Authors contributions Author 1
