 Trash Talking Recently the rulers of two of the world s most populous countries were compelled to relinquish their hold on power Indonesia s Suharto left office amid mounting violence and Nigeria s Gen Sani Abacha fell afoul of a fatal heart attack one key element apparently in his nation s constitutional system of checks and balances Both Suharto and Abacha of course were despicable tyrants with records of venality and bloody oppression Their successors B J Habibie in Indonesia and Gen Abdulsalam Abubakar in Nigeria did not quite concede as much in the first public statements they made but they did use language that seemed to indicate an awareness of the value of human rights and democratic procedures Habibie committed himself to running a clean government free from corruption collusion and nepotism Abubakar declared himself fully committed to a social political transition program leading to an elected civilian government Afterward observers quoted on BBC radio described the two new leaders as making all the right noises Making all the right noises The phrase has proliferated over a period of little more than two decades perhaps in part because it itself makes all the right noises It signals that the noisemaker under discussion may be no more than a golden tongued hypocrite even as it suggests that a reporter having seen it all could not possibly be taken in by the noisemaker s blandishments It also leaves open the unlikely possibility that the actions will indeed live up to the noises Making all the right noises carrying the connotation just described seems to have surfaced mainly in British publications in the late 1970s and early 1980s It surely evolved from earlier use in more literal straightforward contexts for instance to describe the sound of an automobile engine or a musical performance and ultimately from the long established and nonjudgmental phrase to make noises that is to express oneself about something a construction that happily accommodates all manner of adjectival prefixes All the right noises with its stance of jaded cynicism quickly spread from British organs the Economist the Guardian the Financial Times into most parts of the far flung Anglophone circulatory system Today it is applied in a wide range of circumstances especially when the noises being talked of invite a presumption of hollowness sanctimony or hypocrisy Here is New York s Newsday earlier this year analyzing the economic situation in South Korea Kim Jong Pil in line to become Kim Dae Jung s prime minister may make all the right noises about economic reform but his own ties to the chaebol industrial conglomerates may be too tight to break The Times of London writing about the British prime minister Tony Blair must do something And a making all the right noises kind of Valentine message is not enough The Boston Herald assigning blame for the failure of campaign finance reform In his presidency so far Clinton has made all the right noises but has done nothing while playing the same old games to raise vast sums Given some of the tendencies of Scripture translation in recent decades it would hardly be surprising to see Matthew 26 33 35 the passage in which Peter promises to remain a loyal disciple scant hours before turning disloyal rewritten and embellished to render the response from Jesus as follows Truly you make all the right noises But this night you will deny me three times Among the reasons why an expression such as making all the right noises achieves wide usage quickly is this simple one The phenomenon of empty talk is so prevalent that new ways of describing it especially ones that possess a modest elegance and formality are always welcome As it happens many wonderful terms for empty or hypocritical talk are by now quaint and archaic humbuggery Pharisaism Tartuffery and some of the most common terms are simply vulgar bullshit Lip service as in the phrase to pay lip service from the act of raising one s voice publicly in prayer or song while inwardly harboring contrary convictions is probably the most widespread and durable formulation Thus the New York Democrats currently vying for the nomination to run for the Senate this fall recently accused the Republican incumbent Alfonse D Amato of paying lip service to gay issues Similarly lip salve is insincere flattery though it may be enjoyed by the recipient nonetheless as a form of ear candy Lip with its satisfying mouthfeel to use the jargon of the food service industry and its still obvious link to an elemental root the Indo European leb with the connotation has formed numerous slang combinations whose meanings touch all the compass points of verbal intention To shoot from the lip is to speak rashly To zip your lip is to shut up To invite someone to read your lips is to emphasize your sincerity To lip sync is to move one s lips in synchronization with a prerecorded sound and metaphorically to mouth someone else s sentiments Like paying lip service making all the right noises possesses just enough color to be memorable and yet not so much color as to cloy It may be in for a long run In contrast one has to wonder about the longevity of its main rival in the linguistic marketplace right now talking the talk but not walking the walk a vivid expression from black English that seems lately to have become a mandatory part of the repertoire of white politicians corporate executives consultants motivational speakers newscasters and sportswriters A person who talks the talk and walks the walk is one who acts naturally and stylishly whose words and behavior are of a piece a person who talks the talk without walking the walk therefore is one who is dissembling ineffectual or insincere The incorporation of walk the walk and talk the talk into white bread English often by people whose jus folks colloquialism is a pose may not bode well One need only remember how the appropriation of the verbs dig rap and groove by grown ups during the late 1960s and early 1970s proved to be a kiss of death The extent to which the expression has found favor was brought home a few weeks ago when Archbishop Harry Flynn of St Paul and Minneapolis traveled to Rome to ordain a Minnesota bound candidate for the priesthood There in a chapel at the North American College on the slopes of the Janiculum Hill during a service otherwise conducted entirely in Latin Flynn delivered a sermon that included this injunction to the young man When you teach be sure you receive the word into your heart before the word forms on your lips Walk the walk and talk the talk Don t preach one thing and turn around and do something else One can assume that the new priest in response made all the right noises
