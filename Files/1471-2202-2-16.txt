 Background The synthesis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ACh 1in cholinergic neurons is dependent on the availability of its precursor choline most of which is derived from the circulation reviewed in 1 and enters cholinergic neurons via a process catalyzed by a specific transporter 2 3 Some of the choline used for ACh synthesis is stored in membrane phosphatidylcholine PC Previous studies have shown that this choline is liberated from PC in a one step reaction thus indicating that it is produced by a phospholipase D PLD EC 3 1 4 4 an enzyme that hydrolyzes the phospholipid into choline and phosphatidic acid PA 4 However the molecular identity of this PLD remains to be determined There are two distinct PC specific mammalian PLDs designated as PLD1 and PLD2 and encoded by separate genes 5 6 The two enzymes share 50 amino acid identity however regulation of their activity and cellular localization are different PLD1 is an extracellular signal activated phospholipase its activity rises when receptors for certain hormones growth factors neurotransmitters cytokines and other mediators are activated and upon treatment of cells with phorbol esters reviewed in 7 8 Studies using recombinant PLD1 tagged with green fluorescent protein or Flu epitopes indicate that it is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus late endosomes and plasma membrane 6 reviewed in 7 In vitro basal PLD1 activity is usually low and can be stimulated by a variety of factors including phosphatidylinositol 4 5 bisphosphate PIP 2 protein kinase C PKC and several small GTPases e g ADP ribosylation factors ARF and Rho reviewed in 7 8 Regulation of PLD2 is less well understood The enzyme exhibits a high constitutive activity in vitro but it too can be activated by ARF reviewed in 7 and by phorbol esters in intact cells 6 9 Several reports have suggested that PLD2 is mainly localized to the plasma membrane 6 10 possibly in lipid rafts and caveolar membrane microdomains 11 12 Most studies on the physiological functions of PLDs have focused on the product PA a second messenger involved in mitosis cellular morphological changes and vesicular trafficking reviewed in 7 13 However the downstream events that occur as a consequence of PLD generated PA production and the identity of target proteins that are directly regulated by PA remains to be determined PA can be further metabolized to diacylglycerol DAG and lysophosphatidic acid by PA phosphohydrolase and phospholipase A 2 respectively DAG is an activator of certain isozymes of PKC and lysophosphatidic acid acts as an intercellular messenger for many cell types The second product of PLD catalyzed PC hydrolysis choline is used by all cells as a precursor of PC and uniquely by cholinergic neurons as precursor of ACh Previous studies have shown that choline derived from PC is indeed used for ACh synthesis 4 14 15 16 and that this choline is generated by a PLD 4 14 This pathway may become particularly important when extracellular circulating choline concentrations are low e g during dietary choline deficiency or when ACh synthesis and release are accelerated by high neuronal activity thus generating a high demand for choline 16 In the present study we used a cholinergic cell line SN56 17 which is derived from the fusion of septal neurons of postnatal day 21 mice with N18TG2 murine neuroblastoma cells as a model for cholinergic neurons in order to determine the possible role of PLD 1 and PLD2 in generating choline for ACh synthesis We found that the cells express exclusively PLD2 and that downregulating PLD2 expression reduces ACh synthesis while overexpressing and or stimulating PLD2 activity increases the synthesis of the neurotransmitter indicating that PLD2 catalyzed hydrolysis of PC generates choline for ACh synthesis in cholinergic cells Results PLD2 mRNA was present in SN56 cells Fig 1A while PLD1 message was undetectable either by Northern blot Fig 1A or RT PCR data not shown Consistent with these results an approximately 90 kDa PLD2 protein was found in SN56 cells by Western blot however no PLD1 protein could be detected Fig 1B Positive controls for these studies showed that our PLD1 probe and antibody were robust in detecting this PLD isoform in rat brain Fig 1 These data show that SN56 cells express exclusively PLD2 and thus experimental manipulations of the activity of this PLD isoform were subsequently employed to determine if this enzyme is capable of producing choline for ACh synthesis in cholinergic cells In order to reduce PLD2 activity in SN56 cells we sought to inhibit its expression The cells were treated with a 25 mer antisense oligonucleotide at different concentrations and PLD2 mRNA levels were measured Northern blot showed that PLD2 mRNA expression was reduced by the antisense oligonucleotide in a concentration dependent manner Fig 2A and that at the maximally effective concentration of the oligo 200 nM this inhibition reached 34 Fig 2B C In contrast the control oligomer was inactive Fig 2B C Consistent with these findings Western blot showed that the antisense oligomer decreased the PLD2 protein level by about 28 whereas the control oligomer had no significant effect on PLD2 protein expression Fig 2D E Given the fact that the transfection efficiency obtained in these experiments was approximately 30 as determined with fluorescent dye labeled oligonucleotides data not shown the results indicate that in cells that had taken up the antisense oligomer the inhibition of PLD2 expression was complete Treatment of a variety of cell types with phorbol esters activates PLD2 6 12 18 19 Thus we hypothesized that activation of PLD with PMA in SN56 cells would elevate intracellular concentrations of its product choline and result in increased ACh production We tested the effects of PMA on PLD activity and ACh content in SN56 cells incubated in a choline free medium Under these conditions the choline precursor used for the synthesis of ACh is derived entirely from the intracellular pool which includes the choline in PC 4 15 Consistent with previous studies treatment of the cells with PMA activated PLD Fig 3A The maximal effects of PMA 3 3 fold increase in the amount of its product 3H phosphatidylpropanol relative to controls was observed after 45 minutes data not shown a time period employed in subsequent studies Free choline accumulation was also significantly increased by PMA The magnitude of this effect tended to be small approximately 15 presumably because free choline is a rapidly turning over metabolic intermediate that does not accumulate in cells Fig 3B Moreover PMA stimulated ACh accumulation by 26 Fig 3C in the cells The fact that PMA increased both PLD activity and ACh content provided the initial evidence for a relationship between the endogenous PLD activity i e PLD2 and ACh production In control studies performed in the presence of choline 15 M in the medium PMA had no effect on ACh levels data not shown indicating that it did not stimulate the process of ACh synthesis but only the supply of choline Next the effect of downregulation of PLD2 activity on ACh levels was studied in cells transfected with either control or antisense oligomer and treated with PMA In the absence of PMA the antisense oligomer decreased PLD2 activity by 19 Although small this change was statistically significant p 0 05 In the presence of PMA antisense oligomer decreased PLD2 activity by 27 Fig 3A Concomitantly the cellular choline content was decreased by 30 both in the presence and absence of PMA by the antisense oligomer Fig 3B Moreover the antisense oligomer decreased the cellular ACh content by approximately 30 compared to control oligomer treated cells both in the presence and absence of PMA Fig 3C These results indicate that downregulation of PLD2 activity by antisense oligomers in SN56 cells decreases not only the endogenous PLD2 activity but also the intracellular choline and ACh content These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PLD2 can generate choline for ACh synthesis in SN56 cells To further confirm this hypothesis we transiently transfected the cells with a mouse PLD2 expression plasmid Overexpression of PLD2 for 48 hours in the cells caused a 74 increase of basal PLD2 activity and this activity was further increased by PMA by 3 2 fold Fig 4A To examine the ACh synthesis and choline turnover in these PLD2 transfectants the cells and the media were collected and ACh and choline content were measured In the absence of PMA overexpression of PLD2 alone increased intracellular ACh levels by 26 and choline concentrations in the medium by 57 In the presence of PMA intracellular ACh levels and choline concentration in the medium rose further in the PLD2 transfectants reaching values more than two fold higher than those in the control cells Fig 4B C Together with the data presented above these results show that up regulation of PLD2 activity by overexpression and or stimulation with PMA increases intracellular ACh levels A recent immunohistochemical study of PLD1 expression in rat brain showed that this PLD isoform was expressed in neurons in medial septum cranial motor nuclei and ventral spinal cord 20 all areas of the central nervous system enriched with cholinergic neurons These data raised the possibility that certain populations of cholinergic neurons may express PLD1 in addition to or instead of PLD2 Therefore we transfected SN56 cells with PLD1 expression construct in order to determine if choline generated by this enzyme could be used as ACh precursor Transfection of PLD1 into SN56 cells resulted in increased PLD activity and ACh synthesis in a fashion similar to that observed in PLD2 transfectants Fig 5 indicating that choline generated by PLD1 was converted to ACh Discussion In the present study we sought to establish which PLD isoform is the endogenous enzyme that generates the choline precursor for ACh synthesis in cholinergic neurons using as a model the SN56 basal forebrain cell line We found that these cells expressed exclusively PLD2 a property that facilitated subsequent experiments First antisense oligonucleotides were used to down regulate endogenous PLD2 activity Although only 30 of the cells took up the oligonucleotides PLD2 mRNA protein expression and activity were reduced proportionally to the transfection efficiency of the antisense oligomer demonstrating high efficacy of this technique in the transfected cells Significantly intracellular choline and ACh content were similarly decreased by the antisense oligonucleotides indicating that PLD2 catalyzed hydrolysis of PC provides choline for ACh synthesis Next PLD2 activity was up regulated by either overexpressing a mouse PLD2 protein and or by stimulation with PMA Both PLD2 overexpression and stimulation with PMA increased PLD activity choline production and ACh accumulation Moreover PLD2 transfection and PMA treatment had a synergistic effect on PLD activity and ACh levels Our observation that PLD2 but not PLD1 was present in SN56 cells raised the possibility that the former might be preferentially expressed in cholinergic neurons The data are consistent with the report that a variant of PC12 cells also express exclusively PLD2 18 and this expression is stimulated by nerve growth factor 18 a treatment known to upregulate the cholinergic phenotype of PC12 cells 21 22 PLD2 mRNA is abundant in many regions of the adult rodent central nervous system 6 23 including cerebellum frontal cortex hippocampus hypothalamus midbrain brainstem striatum and spinal cord 24 The latter three regions are enriched with cell bodies of cholinergic neurons PLD1 is also highly expressed in brain tissue 6 23 25 notably in neurons in medial septum cranial motor nuclei and ventral spinal cord 20 all of which are likely cholinergic However no data are currently available on the possible coexpression of PLD1 and or PLD2 and cholinergic markers e g choline acetyltransferase in vivo Transfection of PLD1 into SN56 cells resulted in increased PLD activity and ACh production suggesting that PLD1 like PLD2 could potentially be used to supply choline for ACh synthesis Thus while the catalytic activities of both PLD1 and PLD2 appear to be equivalent in generating choline for ACh synthesis in transfected cells it is possible that the modes of regulation of their activity might specify which one is expressed in a particular population of cholinergic neurons in vivo It will be important to determine the mechanisms that control the expression of the two PLD isoforms and their possible relationships with the mechanisms that regulate the cholinergic phenotype Stimulation of PLD activity by PMA and the resulting increase of ACh synthesis from PLD generated choline indicates that this pathway is regulated by PMA responsive PKC isozymes In vivo this form of regulation of ACh synthesis would be controlled by neurotransmitters released by neurons that innervate particular cholinergic cells There are multiple neurotransmitters whose receptors are coupled to PKC dependent activation of PLD 7 and thus this mode of regulating the availability of choline for ACh synthesis is likely to be widespread Significantly among the five subtypes of muscarinic ACh receptors MAChRs Ml and M3 receptors have been shown to efficiently activate PLD and PKC in various cell types 26 27 28 29 30 whereas activation of PLD by M2 and M4 receptors is less robust 26 These observations suggest that in a cholinergic synapse ACh released into the synaptic cleft might stimulate PLD activity leading to a release of choline that could be used for ACh synthesis Since these MAChRs may be present on the pre and postsynaptic neurons 31 this choline may be derived from PC residing in the membranes of either However while the presynaptically derived choline released into the cytoplasm can be converted directly to ACh the choline released by the postsynaptic cell must be initially taken up by the cholinergic nerve terminals Our previous results in cholinergic human neuroblastoma LA N 2 cells indicated that the choline moiety from PC breakdown was released directly into the cytoplasm 4 and a kinetic study using 3H choline in BHK cells also showed that choline was initially released inside the cells by PMA activated PLD and then rapidly appeared in the medium 32 Consistent with the latter study we also observed a rise in the medium choline levels in SN56 cells transfected with either PLD1 or PLD2 and treated with PMA Although it is clear that the PLD generated choline is efficiently utilized by cholinergic cells LA N 2 and SN56 as a precursor of ACh the quantitative significance of this pathway and mechanisms that regulate it remain to be fully determined Studies on a variety of preparations indicate that most of the choline used for ACh synthesis is derived from the extracellular space reviewed in 1 and therefore the PLD pathway has to be considered as an accessory process Interestingly PLD activity is upregulated in the hippocampus of rats whose mothers consumed a choline supplemented diet during pregnancy 33 Given that prenatal choline supplementation improves memory and attention 34 two cognitive functions that require the hippocampal cholinergic system it is possible that the upregulated PLD pathway underlies at least in part the cognitive enhancement observed in the prenatally choline supplemented animals Abnormalities in the PLD mediated release of choline would be expected to result in an impairment of cholinergic neurotransmission and or in a generalized malfunction of cholinergic cells Alzheimer s disease AD is characterized by such a malfunction together with degeneration of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and it is thought that memory loss in this disease is partly caused by this cholinergic lesion 35 In vitro studies point to two novel mechanisms that might cause dysregulation of PLD2 activity in AD The first is based on observations that PLD2 is inhibited by synuclein 36 a protein of unknown function that accumulates in the amyloid deposits in AD brain Normally synuclein is present in the synaptic nerve terminals including those of cholinergic neurons 37 38 but in AD its processing is altered causing it to be abnormally deposited in plaques composed primarily of aggregates of amyloid peptide 39 However how this abnormal turnover of synuclein contributes to the pathophysiology of AD remains to be determined Recent in vitro observations that synuclein is phosphorylated by G protein coupled receptor kinases and that this phosphorylation relieves its inhibitory action on PLD2 40 suggest a novel mechanism by which neurotransmitter receptors including muscarinic receptors might modulate PLD2 activity Since multiple receptor classes are affected by the pathophysiological processes of AD 41 abnormal phosphorylation of synuclein may contribute to both altered synuclein turnover and abnormal regulation of PLD2 activity The second set of observations indicate that reactive oxygen species ROS activate PLD2 in a PKC dependent manner 9 There is much evidence that ROS generation is upregulated in AD brain 42 Thus it is possible that PLD2 may be activated in this disease resulting perhaps in dysregulation of PC metabolism Indeed evidence of an accelerated PC turnover has been repeatedly observed in post mortem samples of AD brain 43 44 45 46 47 as well as in an in vitro model of this disease characterized by the generation of ROS 48 Conclusions Most of the previous studies on the physiological functions PLDs have concentrated on the role of its product PA 7 Our data show that PLD has a dual function in cholinergic cells as the second product of its activity choline is used as a metabolic precursor of ACh and suggest that this pathway may be regulated by the type of PLD isoform expressed in a particular class of cholinergic neurons In our basal forebrain derived SN56 cells this isoform is PLD2 However our observations that PLD1 overexpression increases ACh production form endogenous sources suggest that PLD1 may serve the same function as PLD2 in other cholinergic cells Moreover the data showing that this pathway is stimulated by PMA suggest that it is subject to regulation by PKC activating neurotransmitters The physiological and possible pathophysiological significance in neurological diseases of this pathway remains to be determined It will also be important to determine how cholinergic cells regulate the metabolism of PA a compound with multiple signaling and structural functions when the PLD pathway is stimulated to meet the demand for choline
