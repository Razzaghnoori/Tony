security Worst moment Jiang s entourage asking U S officials to move protesters off the street outside Independence Hall in Philadelphia so he wouldn t have to look at them On the bright side Jiang promised to open China still wider to the outside world and said that without democracy there can be no modernization Pundits agreed that Jiang got prestige at home and around the world and that China is replacing Russia as the chief concern of U S foreign policy Editorialists groused about China s persistent evils but grudgingly conceded that it was a good idea to make nice with Jiang in the hope of reforming China over the long term 10 31 The Nanny Murder Trial ended in a conviction British au pair Louise Woodward was found guilty of second degree murder for causing fatal injuries to the baby

again is proving his idiocy by galvanizing the international coalition against him which had been disintegrating 10 31 Update on the campaign finance scandal 1 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt appeared before the Senate investigating committee and denied allegations that his department reversed its decision on an Indian casino project in order to please Democratic contributors Babbitt explained that he had probably lied to a lobbyist about being pressured in the matter by Clinton political aide Harold Ickes but that he Babbitt was not now lying to senators about having lied to the lobbyist The New York Times called it the closest thing to a quid pro quo in the scandal Pundits blamed Babbitt s troubles like those of Vice President Gore on the corrupting influence of President

out its fears i e it needs to finish puking before it can start eating again In any event no one thinks this is a bear market Tuesday optimists speculated that 1 the correction would scare consumers sufficiently to cool off the economy so that the Fed won t have to raise interest rates and 2 the U S rally would restore global confidence and fuel recoveries in other countries markets Sure enough
