 well do you exercise regularly Judy um i try to ride the stationary bicycle everyday about five miles um hum and i love to walk so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and and walk what about you well um i uh exercise regularly i work at a university and i swim almost everyday uh very good upwards of a mile but Washington is one of my favorite places to visit uh my daughter lives in Arlington and when i go to visit her i love to get out on that bike trail and either ride the bike oh gosh you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern Virginia um hum or just get out and walk uh or even jog a little although i don t do that regularly but Washington s a great place to do that uh huh yeah there are there are lots of bike paths i know my son is a biker and he he s done the whole C and O canal i think it s a hundred and eighty miles with the scouts um hum and so uh but that that somehow takes organization for me it s much easier just the stationary bike you know it s at home i can i can do some of my reading right um but do you live in the District no i live in Maryland uh huh because i think there re so many parts of the District where it s not very safe to get out and walk right right and that s it um at work we have a a nice campus so i m able to um take advantage of of the environment here um um hum the neighborhood also i mean we re within walking distance of of stores and shops so i do now i think um basically is your motive simply um health or because you enjoy it well it s uh it s really both i m certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape and uh and most of the time i enjoy it sometimes i don t but i feel that uh that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don t wanna is also worth something um hum right i think pretty much you ve summed up my my my motivations also and i often find that even when i don t feel that much like exercising like i ll be really tired and i ll start swimming and i ll actually and i ll actually get energy and i ll be have much more energy when i m done than when i started i mean i just feel great that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim oh well that s great that s great that s really a terrific feeling because you just go there at the end of the day and you figure God i m ready for bed um hum and you exercise and then it s sort of it s painful for a while but by the time you get done you re feeling really terrific right and actually in in summer i like to swim we don t have facilities for swimming in winter but um and and that s true when i go home from work at the end of the day if i go up for an hour in the pool i m much much more awake i m ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening yeah yeah so so are can i just ask you are you Canadian no i m not Philadelphia no i m trying to because you have a you have one funny vowel that s probably gonna drive the TI people crazy you say out instead of out you say out oh really no i don t know that but i i must say that um did you know that when when i did do a linguistics course in in school ages ago um the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent hm and it s probably because i i was born in the Chicago area and grew up in California and at and at that point that was sort of a limit but but since then i ve been abroad a lot so hm i see it s a mixture i know this isn t on our topic but where did you grow up in California in Santa Barbara oh okay because i grew up in North Hollywood California i went to UCLA and all that oh i see um hum well very good and i think we ve probably know know each other s exercise habits and um it was nice talking to you yes well same here thanks for calling bye oh okay bye bye
