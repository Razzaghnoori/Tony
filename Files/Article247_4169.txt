 Archer s Follies Dear Dad Yes sad to say I have indeed read most of Jeffrey Archer s novels If you excuse the analogy they re something like sordid one night stands You stay up late in bed with them breathless and excited but when you wake up in the morning next to them you feel ashamed and disgusted with yourself Still it s nice to know you re not bothered by the fact that I ve read them The thing about growing up the son of two New York intellectuals is that reading trashy fiction somehow seems worse more of a transgressive act as some of my academic colleagues would put it than many other minor crimes and misdemeanors even more than using the word hopefully incorrectly The nightmare scenario runs as follows I m sitting in a quiet corner somewhere devouring the latest Michael Crichton the cover carefully hidden from sight Suddenly from nowhere in walks Diana Trilling Ah the son of Daniel Bell and Pearl Kazin she says her great eyes shining sternly What are you reading Proust Dostoyevsky Faulkner The Liberal Imagination I tremble so hard the book falls out of my hands and she sees the cover The shame The humiliation Of course Woody Allen captured this idea perfectly in Bananas in the scene where he buys a pile of intellectual journals and tries to slip a copy of a pornographic magazine in with them only to have the shop owner holler Hey Harry how much for a copy of Orgasm Later Allen sits on the subway gazing at the offending item which he has neatly tucked into the latest edition of Commentary with an article by Irving Kristol on the cover another favorite Woody Allen line of course comes in Annie Hall when he quips that Dissent and Commentary have merged to form a new magazine called Dysentery I was probably one of the few 11 year olds to laugh at that one But getting back to Jeffrey Archer Even if Americans read his books they don t know much about him and in any case the current scandal is much too convoluted with all its references to a previous scandal 12 years ago to generate much coverage here Besides when it comes to illicit goings on by European politicians I m afraid the usual American responses are in order 1 Who 2 Do we care 3 Aren t they always getting up to that sort of stuff anyway I mean take a trio of scandals which in America would have blown the top of the White House into low earth orbit The president is revealed to have not just a mistress but an entire second family whom he has been housing for years in a government owned apartment The same man is revealed to have been essentially a youthful Fascist fellow traveler who later helped shield Nazi collaborators from the law And just to make things really juicy he covered up the fact that he suffered from cancer throughout much of his presidency That was Fran ois Mitterrand But I would guess 10 times as many Americans know the details of Princess Di s bulimia as have ever heard of Fran ois Mitterrand As for the Belgian deputy prime minister the Belgian deputy prime minister he could set off a small nuclear device while simultaneously engaged in an unnatural act with a hippopotamus in the middle of the Grand Place in Brussels and even the Times would probably give it three column inches on Page A13 Is this too cynical But enough about this We re just two and a half weeks away from the year 2000 Any thoughts on the millennium
