 Typos and IPOs Snobs that we are we like to pretend that we don t think much about Salon the only roughly comparable magazine on the Web But the truth is that it does cross our radar screens from time to time Do we regard Salon as our competition Yes and no We are somewhat direct competitors for advertising dollars but for readership the question is more complicated The real competition for any publication in any medium is the clock There are only 24 hours in a day Strangely the least competitive rival claimant for those hours is likely to be a similar publication Print magazines which depend on direct mail for generating subscriptions usually find that their best prospects are subscribers to magazines they most closely resemble Harper s does best with the mailing list of the Atlantic Monthly and so on This isn t because people are persuaded to switch but because someone who has already eaten a blueberry bagel is more likely to eat a strawberry bagel than the average person is to eat a fruit bagel of any sort In a fledgling medium similar publications are even more interdependent since the viability of this sort of enterprise is unproved The cold hard fact is that we need Salon to prosper and vice versa The warm throbbing fact however is that we are only human And rumor has it that they are as well Human emotions like Schadenfreude and there must be a German word for reverse Schadenfreude distress at other people s happiness inevitably complicate rational business judgment Despite our best efforts we couldn t help noticing lately that Salon has announced an IPO That stands for international poetry Oktoberfest Just the thing for a political cultural magazine No actually IPO stands for initial public offering That is they re selling stock a more unusual enterprise for a political cultural magazine Two and a half million shares will be offered at about 12 a share That will raise 30 million if they pull it off minus a few million for the midwives And this is for less than a quarter of the company At 12 a share the value of the whole enterprise would be almost 130 million The editor in chief s shares would be worth more than 6 million That 130 million would be an astonishing figure for a political cultural magazine even if it made money It s about what the queen of the genre The New Yorker went for in 1985 when it was still profitable But Salon is losing money at a rate of 6 million a year and admits that this figure will probably increase Salon also claims to be much much more than a political cultural magazine and we intend no insult by describing it as such Martin Peretz the owner of the New Republic has joked for two decades that he ll only sell TNR for 20 times losses The owners of Salon are asking even more and it s no joke Or at least it s not only a joke Marty Peretz meanwhile is seeing his own joke come almost precisely true as co owner of TheStreet com which is losing 16 million a year and is going public at a price that would value the whole company at 300 million And what do we at Slate think about this If we had any sense we d be delighted After all if Salon is worth 130 million Slate must be worth well a lot Maybe more maybe less but same ballpark As a division of a big company we can t go public ourselves But a successful Salon IPO certainly will help when it s time to ask Dad for our allowance Also our goal is to become profitable If the Salon IPO works the market America s answer to the Oracle at Delphi will have declared its judgment that this sort of thing can become a real profit making business Trouble is Slate has been ridiculing the Internet bubble all along See almost any random item for the past six months or Bruce Gottlieb s recent piece on How can we convince ourselves that this one particular IPO is a rational reflection of actual economic potential if all the rest are a reflection of something closer to clinical insanity The truth is that we can t The deeper human truth is that we don t especially want to The good fortune of other people is annoying enough however good your own fortune may be At least let us cling to the belief that it is unjustified Now that we ve made our general attitude toward Salon and its IPO perfectly unclear let us take a look at that IPO prospectus We were alarmed to discover that it is riddled with typographical errors Typos are an athema to any high qualidy publcation Careless proofreading is a shure sign of inner wroght Although we certainly do not wish to discourage anyone from investing in Salon we feel an obligation to inform our readers about these troublesome lapses They are especially shocking in a formal government filing vetted by lawyers in which inaccuracy can result in disastrous lawsuits And yet The prospectus reports revenues of 2 058 000 in the nine months ending Dec 31 1998 And 300 000 of that in advertising barter an ad for an ad leaving cash revenues of about 1 7 million This cannot be right It is clearly far too low since David Talbot Salon s chairman of the board editor in chief and director told Newsweek last September that revenues this year were 6 million It might be mathematically possible that Salon had 4 million in revenue during the first three months of 1998 and 2 million in the last nine months thus 6 million for the year except that the prospectus also reports revenues of 1 1 million for all 12 months ending March 31 1998 It is unthinkable of course that Talbot a journalist as well as commander grand high executioner and maximum leader would have lied to Newsweek Especially when Salon executives gave the same 6 million figure to the Los Angeles Times in June So clearly the 2 million figure is a typo Talbot also told Newsweek that profits won t come until 1999 This was barely three months before 1999 began So the prospectus is surely mistaken in saying that Salon lost 4 3 million from April through December of 1998 and We expect these operating losses to increase for at least the foreseeable future Of course profits won t come until 1999 doesn t necessarily mean that profits will come in 1999 It depends on what you mean by until But Salon told a trade publication called Link Up in November 1998 just two months before the dawn of bliss that Salon is slated sic to turn a profit in 1999 It s a disgrace How could Salon be so sloppy as to report large and growing losses in its prospectus when it actually is already profitable The prospectus states Our revenues depend on a limited number of advertisers and sponsors who are not subject to long term agreements And We anticipate that our financial results will continue to significantly depend on revenues from a small number of advertisers The problem here is probably the classic misplaced not They mean to say Our advertisers are subject to long term agreements and our financial results will not depend etc After all the January February Columbia Journalism Review cites Talbot as saying that Salon has more than 120 advertisers half long term Or maybe CJR is the sloppy one here Did it omit Talbot s explanation that all those long term advertisers will contribute insignificant revenues Here s a real puzzler Back in 1997 Salon told PC Week that it gets 60 per 1 000 page views compared with 20 to 30 for Yahoo from advertisers because its readership is so classy And yet Salon s 1999 prospectus refers to Salon s average CPM cost per thousand of 23 Has Salon s advertising CPM actually sunk by two thirds More likely that 23 is supposed to be an 83 or a 123 On a subject of particular interest to Slate the prospectus says this about Salon s paid membership program As of March 1999 there were approximately 1 050 members enrolled in the Salon Members program One or two zeros probably were dropped here as 1 000 members at 25 each would be merely 25 000 and yet Talbot told Columbia Journalism Review in January that revenues from the program were above what our projections were Were they projecting fewer than a thousand members Unlikely So the truth must be that they have 10 500 or even 105 000 members since it goes without saying that Talbot could not have been trying to mislead the Columbia Journalism Review Let us though just for the heck of it consider the possibility that perhaps the prospectus is accurate and all these quotations and citations from Talbot and others at Salon are in error Is such a thing possible Although highly unlikely it s possible we suppose that all these distinguished publications repeatedly misheard the same individual in the same way although he has no speech impediment that we know of Surely though it is impossible to imagine that the Salon folks themselves have been lying spinning and covering up Journalists after all expose these practices we do not commit them David Talbot has had inspiring things to say about journalists and the truth In particular he has spoken of Salon s dedication to a mission of exposing important facts And he has made pointed comparisons to other Webzines that are allegedly content to sit on their fannies and analyze or summarize Last fall Salon published the important fact that Henry Hyde had an adulterous affair 30 years ago Many could not see the importance of this fact but Salon said it revealed President Clinton s chief congressional accuser as a hypocrite Those who go around exposing unpleasant facts about other people had better be truth tellers themselves Buckling his swash on CNN Talbot declared Fearless journalists true journalists shouldn t be worried about perception or spin They should be worried about the truth and concerned about the truth and that was Salon s guiding principle here Let s not be sentimental Let s consider this as a pure business matter Here is a chairman of the board editor in chief and director who is marketing his company as what might be called a truth play Truth is his company s Unique Selling Proposition its market niche its core competency its brand value It would be sheer folly for such a company to invent preposterous lies and spins and feed them to the nation s most prominent publications That s why the only logical explanation is typographical errors in the prospectus Thank goodness we don t hav these poblems at Slat
