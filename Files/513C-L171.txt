 March 20 1992 Dear IDDS Members Very few dentists will deny that Indiana is lacking in qualified well trained dental assistants Indiana University School of Dentistry s program for Dental Assisting is one of the most outstanding in the state Yet a few years ago it almost closed its doors due to a lack of applicants In the same period programs like PCI and Aristotle have had no problems filling their classrooms A recent survey of dental assistants showed many of them would have chosen I U s program if they had known it existed Unfortunately I U s Dental Assisting program is not listed in the Yellow Pages due to a lack of funds I U s program is also less expensive than competing programs Who knows how many people dropped their interest in Dental Assisting when they heard the tuition costs at other schools Hopefully all of us can do more internal marketing with our young patients to encourage them to consider the field of Dental Assisting We can also offer scholarships to young people interested in attending I U s program Don t overlook your patients as potential students Lastly Mr Danny Dean can be contacted about establishing a special endowment fund to help the Dental Assisting Program conduct more public relations and advertising and hopefully even list its phone number in the Yellow Pages Checks should be made out to Indiana University Foundation and sent directly to the Development Office at IUSD 1121 West Michigan Street Indianapolis Indiana 46202 Attention Danny Dean A pledge card and return envelope are enclosed Each of us needs to be ambassadors for Dentistry within our own practices and at church athletic and social events Let s do our best to keep I U s programs fully enrolled and funded Let s head off an auxiliary crisis before it happens Remember all donations are tax deductible Sincerely yours Virginia W Crose D D S Consultant to I U S D Dental Assisting Advisory Committee
