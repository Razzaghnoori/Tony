          okay so um yes we do keep uh well we started out keeping a budget about two years ago we have a computer here at the house and i made a Lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month   uhhuh uhhuh   and then basically since then what ive done is is keep track of it through the checkbook so that based on whatever weve got coming in check coming in and how much im spending each half of the month and then trying to also spend and because our house payment is once a month thats our our biggest uh expense so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook each with each paycheck even though its really still there   uhhuh uhhuh   so that i can keep a a good balance running total yeah through the month what do yall do   a running total yeah uh weve weve uh taken how much we have you know write down how much we have coming in each month and then uh weve at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend we sat down made up different accounts like you know weve set a budget for each you know household expenses or food and clothing and entertainment and then our our own fun money and just stuff like that and then we write down each each time we spend something we write down in a book and end of the month we tally it up to see if how close weve you know we we try to stay within a certain budget so   umhum is it is it hard to keep track of it or does it work out pretty well   um it takes some it takes some dedication to do it but it it works out real well so   umhum and and youre staying within your budget and keep everything is working pretty good   uhhuh yeah yeah i stay within i have to stay within it so i   yeah i found   you know and then we have that you know if you cant stay if something comes up and you cant stay within it then we have uh you know a budget for you know like we call our slush fund or something and something unexpected unexpected comes up then youre not   umhum yeah     you know you dont feel it so strapped   you dont have to go out and borrow it somewhere and and do that   right yeah because we dont you know we dont charge anything that we cant pay off by the end of the month   yeah thats a good choice weve been trying were trying to uh do that this year weve budgeted the money that we used to spend we were spending on a CODA account with TI and then money we were also buying stock with for that year weve taken that this year and said were gonna pay off all of our credit cards and uh   uhhuh  you got paper under your table uhhuh   we have a another loan with the bank and so we hope by the end of this year that by doing that well be free and clear   uhhuh to be out of debt free yeah the only thing we have it to pay off is our is a automobile loan and our house payment and thats the only thing we ever we try to stay out of debt so   yeah thats good to be in that kind of shape what are yall trying to do long term   uhhuh oh as long term  we just he has you know his retirement plan and then to CODA and stuff like that thats all weve and you know we just have our life insurance for right now   uhhuh   so  we dont have any long term you know in stocks or anything like that right now so     yeah mostly what were doing weve worked  weve done the uh CODA account with TI where they we put in so much a month and then they or so much a paycheck and then they  match it   yeah thats what were doing  so   and so that that has worked out pretty good and then i used to work for TI and i have when i retired from there or left i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an IRA and we had an out   yeah uhhuh   we had an existing IRA so we have both of us have some money in an IRA that were also trying to figure to put it were putting it in CDs right now and then were also looking at it in possibly getting a  mutual fund   uhhuh yeah whenever we get enough saved we we stick it in a CD for a while and then uh   umhum   you know  and then when we if we need it we wait till it its expired and then so   yeah  the other thing that weve done that that was really nice to see we had one of the financial companies um Hancock oh  John Hancock company came out and their agents did a long term analysis based on salary  and uh what we were planning what what what our uh goals were on a long  term budget in terms of retirement kids college paying off the house buying a different house   uhhuh   um special thing buying land and building our own house and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at   uhhuh   and then gave us a good idea back you know some good information back on whether or not we were going to achieve those goals and yeah or not or what we needed to do so that we could achieve them and money we could put in at what time   or not yeah uhhuh that sounds interesting weve never done anything we have you know just our our life insurance guy has come out you know and hes set up uh  you know determined how much we need to   umhum   you know we need if something were to happen   umhum yeah that   you know   thats the other financial thing i guess that weve done is with our life insurance is since im at home now is is figuring out uh what we would need if something happened to my husband or what he would need if something happened to me   yeah right yeah you you know if i would sell the you know if he something would happen to him i wouldnt stay in Texas i would uh   thats a a big thing to think about     sell the house and move back home you know to my home town and and uh i wouldnt stay here in Texas so   umhum   yeah   you know i dont know what he would do  but   okay   i guess thats most of my um financial plans right now is is there anything youd like to add   yeah mine too nope thats about all for mine   okay well its been nice talking to you   nice talking to you too byebye   byebye
