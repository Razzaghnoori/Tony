 The Online Buffet Russ Apparently you are a morning person I m not I have to stumble out of bed have coffee sit around reading the papers or if it s my turn go into town to get them first no home delivery up here Hopefully something in the paper will stimulate a little adrenalin not much luck this week last time I did one of these things I had Kosovo to write about Only then can I begin to face such questions as What do I think of Slate Well first my relationship to Slate Salon too has been much more like my relationship to a restaurant than to any print publication I go there occasionally sample whatever looks interesting often because somebody has mentioned a piece to me you should try the It s like my relationship to the rest of the Web actually casual and uncommitted without intense expectations about what ought to be there or any necessity as with newspapers and magazines I read regularly to see what Slate has to say about X Plus there s much too much stuff to do anything like read a whole issue I didn t subscribe to it when you had to pay I might now just because it s become more prominent in the public conversation and if I did have to pay I might pay closer attention to it in the interest of getting my money s worth But I m not sure Slate s professionalism is an asset What most interests me about online journalism is it s so much looser and more serendipitous As a writer I m intrigued by this e mail dialogue form It s less like writing a piece than like participating in a panel discussion only allowing me to do what I can t in a panel discussion express myself as well as I can in writing I like the idea of talking to people I don t usually get to talk to at least where they can talk back Re Kinsley himself he is a conventional high journalist as I think of them in my view it would be a public service if all the commentators on the Times the Washington Post The New Yorker and the New Republic would simply merge into one composite columnist who would write once a week so I could find out what the latest conventional wisdom is without having to spend so much time at it What I meant in saying that techno has cultural political significance is that it s the medium of a counterculture techno fans are looking for ecstasy I mean the state of mind not the drug though that too for a kind of erotic communalism that s basically missing from the larger culture right now but where the 60s counterculture was anti technological even though rock n roll was totally dependent on technology this one resonates with the techno utopianism of computer freaks I m not saying the techno audience is computer freaks or overlaps with them I really have no idea just that there s a common impulse there And this is what makes pop music or popular culture of any kind compelling that it becomes the catalyst for a new oppositional and or competing sensibility it holds out the possibility of seeing life and art and the relation between them in some fresh way Whereas rock n roll in its various forms just seems to be rehashing and cannibalizing the past
