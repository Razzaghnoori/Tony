 Background Recombinant inbred RI strains have been used extensively to map a wide range of Mendelian and quantitative traits 1 They offer compelling advantages for mapping complex genetic traits particularly those that have modest heritabilities Each recombinant genome is replicated in the form of an entire isogenic line 2 3 4 5 6 and variance associated with environmental factors and technical errors can be suppressed to low levels This raises heritability and improves the prospects of mapping underlying quantitative trait loci QTLs We have recently used RI strains to map QTLs that generate variation in the architecture of the mouse centralnervous system CNS 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 The main advantage in this context is that the complex genetic and epigenetic correlations between interconnected parts of the brain can be explored using complementary molecular developmental structural pharmacological and behavioral techniques Gene effects can also be tested under a spectrum of environmental perturbations and experimental conditions RI strains can be exploited to expose gene environment interactions and gene pleiotropy These important facets of genetics can only be explored with difficulty using conventional mapping populations in which each genome is unique A third advantage of RI strains is that genotypes generated by different groups using a variety of methods can be pooled to generate high density linkage maps As a result loci that segregate in RI sets can often be mapped with impressive precision without genotyping This attribute was a significant advantage before the advent of efficient and easy PCR genotyping methods 15 Unfortunately over the past decade databases of RI genotypes have accumulated many typing errors Each error expands distances between marker loci and degrades linkage inevitably blurring associations between genotypes and phenotypes and making it difficult to map traits whether they are Mendelian or quantitative in nature The accumulation of false recombinations has become extreme in common RI sets For example the map of chromosome 1 in the complete BXD data set 16 is based on 160 linked marker loci and is an astonishing 1 305 cM long This map is approximately 12 times the length of an F2 map of chromosome 1 and just over three times the length expected of an RI map of chromosome 1 The accumulation of typing errors has led to efforts to reconstitute maps using curated subsets of markers for which genotypes can be adequately and independently verified Sampson and colleagues 17 assembled maps for the AXB and BXA strains that improved the utility of this set Similarly Taylor and colleagues 18 assembled comparable high quality maps for the complete set of 36 BXD strains that are based almost entirely on easily typed and verified microsatellite markers Our aims complement this previous work Our first aim has been to generate reliable high resolution genetic maps for each of five widely used sets of RI strains AXB BXA BXD BXH and CXB These RI sets all share C57BL 6 alleles and they can be assembled into a BXN superset consisting of just over 100 lines The introduction of the RI intercross RIX by Threadgill and colleagues 19 20 provides an impetus to precisely define recombination breakpoints in RI strains RIX progeny are isogenic F1 hybrids made between pairs of RI strains One hundred and one well mapped RI strains could in principle be used to generate 5 050 well defined isogenic and non inbred RIX genometypes Our second aim has been to describe the recombination characteristics of typical RI strains and their chromosomes in a more theoretical context We have empirically tested the Haldane Waddington equation of map expansion in sibmated RI strains We have also tested relatedness among RI lines and measured deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium associated with 10 30 years of inbreeding genetic drift mutation and selection Our third aim has been to help resolve a serious but unrecognized problem in QTL mapping that arises from non syn tenic genetic correlations within mapping panels Genetic correlations between intervals on different chromosomes can be high in RI sets and this can result in spurious results and false positive QTLs We provide detailed correlation matrices that can be used to detect and control for non syn tenic association Many of the files that form part of the analysis reported in this paper are available as Additional data files Results RI consensus maps of mouse chromosomes Undiscovered recombinations and SDPs The number of recombinations in RI sets still significantly exceeds the number of SDPs that have been unequivocally defined On the basis of current marker density we estimate that we have defined from 37 AXB BXA to 59 CXB of the total set of SDPs Table 2 The entire BXN set contains approximately 4 800 known recombination breakpoints Tables 2 3 There are likely to be another 400 breakpoints that we have not yet detected To discover 623 41 of the 1 492 SDPs in the BXD set required 936 selected markers Recovering the majority of the remaining SDPs could require an additional 1 000 to 1 500 well placed marker loci The density of informative microsatellite markers is not yet sufficient to define many more SDPs in the BXN set but once SNP and microsatellite maps have been fully integrated into chromosome sequence databases it will be straightforward to generate additional markers and use these to define all 5 000 6 000 SDPs in the BXN set see 21 for integrated MIT and Roche SNP data files Error checking To minimize genotyping errors we retyped many markers particularly those that were associated with unusually large numbers of recombination events We were particularly interested in minimizing the number of genotypes that appeared to be associated with two closely located recombination events what are sometimes referred to as double recombinant haplotypes These haplotypes appear to be the result of two separate crossover events one of which is just proximal to a particular marker and the other just distal to the same marker For example the haplotype of a short chromosome interval BBBNBBB is associated with two recombinations that flank the central marker with the N genotype Because of interference the occurrence of two recombinations within 10 cM is highly improbable in an F2 intercross and consequently double recombinants are often used as a measure of genotyping error or incorrect marker order In RI strains however recombination events accumulate over many generations and two or more recombinations can therefore be extremely close to each other and can produce true double recombinant haplotypes It is therefore necessary to verify rather than discard all apparent double recombinants in RI strains We checked our own marker genotypes and the majority of microsatellite markers typed by other investigators for whether they were associated with double recombination events in one or more RI strains When two or more strains contributed to double recombinants we usually retyped all strains Approximately 150 double recombinant haplotypes and 300 false recombinations were eliminated in the process of error checking Our genotypes therefore differ from those of many microsatellites reported in original publications and listed in the Mouse Genome Informatics Release 2 5 16 In a few instances our revisions have generated new but verified double recombinant haplotypes We discovered unexpected polymorphisms at several loci in a few lines and all were scored as unknown U Table 4 The clustering of aberrant products in AXB13 and AXB14 is consistent with the common origin of these strains from a partly inbred progenitor line However the genotypes of the other three sets of strains for example AXB1 and AXB3 are generally completely independent PCR primer pairs in several intervals gave two bands consistent with a genuine heterozygous genotype Heterozygous loci are rare among fully inbred RI strains but they are fairly common among new BXH strains that were genotyped at the 10th to 16th generation of inbreeding In scoring recombination frequency we treated all heterozygous loci and intervals as if they had not been typed Mutations in microsatellite loci may be responsible for some heterozygosity 22 Changed locus order The order of loci of the BXN consensus maps generally conforms to that of the chromosome committee reports CCR and the MIT Whitehead genetic maps Figure 1 In about 130 instances we have changed the order of loci over short intervals For example D1Mit276 and D1Mit231 on proximal chromosome 1 do not recombine in the MIT F2 cross but in the BXN set there is a single recombination between these markers in BXA11 that is most consistent with a reversal of order relative to the CCR compare the columns labeled CCRcM MITcM and BXNcM in Figure 1 The only nontrivial discrepancy was on proximal chromosome 15 We reordered approximately 32 loci on chromosome 15 to improve linkage statistics We have not attempted to integrate the BXN data with numerous other mapping panels and it is likely that original CCR order will often be well supported by other large mapping panels or rapidly improving physical maps Full sequence data will soon resolve these minor inconsistencies Reassigned microsatellite loci A number of microsatellite loci were reassigned to locations on chromosomes other than those expected on the basis of their original assignments Table 5 Mapping data in one or more of the RI sets is consistent with a reassignment of 16 microsatellite loci to different chromosomes All of these reassignments are provisional particularly those with LOD scores of less than 10 In several cases for example D10Nds10 we have reassigned microsatellite loci typed by other investigators that now are linked to new and firmly mapped markers All primers used to amplify these microsatellites except D10Nds10 were resynthesized to confirm that they are identical to those originally specified by Dietrich and colleagues 23 Individual maps are based on genotypes of as few as 37 markers chromosome X to as many as 129 makers chromosome 1 per chromosome Table 1 The mean separation between markers is approximately 1 cM 0 95 cM using CCR maps as a reference and 0 87 cM using the RI maps themselves When the 577 markers that do not have unique SDPs are excluded from the analysis the average separation increases to 1 2 cM using CCR maps and 1 4 cM using the RI data Typical resolution of the BXN set for mapping a Mendelian trait is 1 2 cM Approximately 90 of the mouse genome is currently less than 2 cM from a typed microsatellite marker in the RI set The asymptotic resolution of the set of BXN strains given infinitely dense maps in which every possible SDP has been characterized would average about 0 3 0 4 cM There are currently 14 poorly typed regions These regions are operationally defined as intervals of 5 to 12 cM between adjacent markers Figure 2 The largest is on proximal chromosome 2 between 9 and 21 cM Figure 1 Strain independence Several RI strains share common haplotypes and recombination breakpoints This non independence of RI lines will distort genetic maps To systematically search for and eliminate partial duplicate RI lines we constructed a genotype similarity matrix for all strains using the QTL analysis program Qgene 24 25 An example of a small part of this matrix is illustrated in Table 6for the CXB set As already noted by Sampson et al 17 three sets of AXB and BXA strains show high genetic similarity and genotypes of four strains should be excluded from most genome wide mapping panels Phenotype data obtained from members of the three groups listed below should often be collapsed and treated as a single strain Group 1 consists of BXA8 and BXA17 which have 99 8 genetic identity Only two markers are known to be polymorphic D3Mit392 and D6Mit108 The polymorphism at D6Mit108 has been verified using independent DNA samples from these two strains BXA17 is actually a direct derivative of BXA8 separated in 1996 97 17 Any divergence in genotypes or phenotypes is due to the recent generation and fixation of new mutations in these two separately maintained lines Group 2 comprises AXB18 AXB19 and AXB20 There is 97 to 99 identity among any of the three pairs Group 3 comprises AXB13 and AXB14 which have 92 identity These three sets of strains were treated as three single strains when analyzing recombination frequencies The mean allele similarity of the remaining strains averages almost exactly 50 The distribution of values is symmetrical about the mean Figure 3 with the great majority of strain pairs falling in the range of 30 70 similarity The highest remaining similarities within RI sets are between BXD13 and BXD41 74 AXB6 and AXB17 73 BXHB2 and BXH9 71 AXB6 and AXB12 70 BXD28 and BXD33 69 BXD19 and BXD29 68 and AXB11 and AXB14 67 These values are not significantly higher than the similarity scores typically noted across RI sets Residual heterozygosity In theory a set of 75 000 genotypes generated across the genome of 100 RI strains should detect only a single residual heterozygous loci at generation F55 of inbreeding Figure 3 lowest line the inbreeding coefficient at F55 is 0 99998812 DNA from most lines was extracted in the 1990s at F generations between F20 and F70 see Materials and methods We detected a total of 13 strains that were still heterozygous BXA20 from D1Mit77 to D1Mit490 AXB21 from D2Mit102 to D2Mit420 AXB24 at D3Mit62 BXA23 at D5Mit95 AXB3 and BXA16 at D12Mit167 BXA20 from D13Mit224 to D13Mit254 BXD31 at D9Mit243 BXD34 at D7Mit281 BXD37 at D1Mit83 BXH12 at D1Mit417 BXH10 at D12Mit167 CXB8 from D1Mit361 to D1Mit291 DNA samples were taken from single animals of each strain and for this reason these estimates of residual heterozygosity underestimate the total heterozygosity about two fold The central part of chromosome 1 is interesting because it is heterozygous in three strains BXD37 BXH12 and BXA20 There is also an interval of approximately 2 5 cM that is apparently maintained in heterozygosity in AXB21 on chromosome 2 Such maintenance should be accompanied by reduced fecundity in this line if homozygotes are lethal or sublethal This would account for poor breeding performance It is also possible that the heterozygosity is the result of a mutation but if this were the case we would expect novel length polymorphisms and the two alleles were usually the expected parental lengths Structure of RI genomes RI mean map lengths The mean frequency of recombinations C RI between two linked markers in an RI strain generated by breeding siblings is approximately 4 c 1 6 c where c is the recombination fraction per meiosis 26 27 An infinitely dense RI map should average four times the length of the conventional one generation F2 map Most expansion is achieved in the first few generations and by F7 the genetic map is approximately three times the length of an F2 map Figure 4 The expectation is that a map based on loci that are spaced at intervals of 1 cM c 0 01 in an intercross will be expanded approximately 3 66 fold Similarly a low density map based on markers that are spaced at 16 cM intervals will be expanded two fold F2 and N2 maps generated using uniform typing procedures typically have a cumulative length of 1 300 to 1 400 cM Five conventional crosses that we generated four F2s and one N2 each genotyped at 91 to 148 loci average 1 320 50 standard error of the mean cM in length In comparison the fully error checked native BXN map is approximately 3 6 to 3 7 fold longer or a total of 4 786 cM The expansion averages approximately 3 4 fold when the comparison is made to the CCR consensus maps Figure 5 Table 3 The expansion between common proximal and distal markers ranges from 2 8 in chromosome 5 to 3 8 in chromosome 12 In general the expansion estimate of 3 6 fold agrees well with the Haldane Waddington expectation given a mean spacing between neighboring markers of 2 3 cM The X chromosome only recombines with half the frequency of the autosomes and for this reason its expansion is only 1 8 fold Comparison with other maps The summed length of all chromosomes is approximately 1 413 cM when values are converted from RI recombination frequencies to those expected of typical single generation meiotic maps The corresponding CCR maps have a cumulative length of 1 494 cM between the same markers The MIT Whitehead microsatellite maps have a cumulative length of approximately 1 384 cM The agreement is excellent Recombination density per RI strain Individual RI strains contain an average of 47 recombinations with a range that typically lies between 40 and 60 Figure 5 The 13 CXB strains are associated with a total of 671 recombinations an average of 52 per strain The BXD strains are associated with approximately 1 500 recombinations an average of about 42 per strain and approximately one recombination per centimorgan on a standard genetic map Tables 2 3 There is considerable variation in the total load of recombinations and map expansion per strain from a low expansion of 2 24 in BXD40 the RI strain with the fewest recombinations to a high expansion of about 6 in BXH6 Figure 5 These estimates are systematically deflated by a failure to discover recombinations in sparsely mapped regions regions where the recombination fraction c is as high as 0 1 but are inflated by residual typing errors and errors of marker order Recombination density per chromosome Single chromosomes in RI strains accumulate as many as 12 recombinations but across the whole set the recombination density averages about 2 4 recombinations per chromosome The mean extends from 3 47 recombinations for chromosome 1 to 1 88 for chromosome 9 A Poisson model fits the distribution of recombination events per chromosome reasonably well and most chromosomes have insignificant chi square 2 values Figure 6 High 2for individual chromosomes are generally due to a small number of apparently highly recombinant chromosomes in particular strains These highly recombinant chromosomes are probably associated with residual typing errors or incorrect marker order Segregation distortion and Hardy Weinberg equilibrium expectation of allele fixation in RI sets In the absence of selection approximately 50 of the strains should have inherited B alleles at each marker A 2statistic can be used to assess whether the segregation ratio of a particular marker differs significantly from expectation Only the 11 intervals listed in Table 7have 2values that are significant at the 0 01 level Eight of 11 intervals are biased in favor of B alleles This is most extreme on chromosomes 1 15 and X where there are about twice as many strains with B alleles as N alleles The opposite pattern is seen on chromosomes 9 11 and 12 Given the large number of comparisons many instances of segregation distortion may be type I statistical errors In collaboration with the Mammalian Genotyping Service 28 we recently genotyped a tenth generation advanced intercross between C57BL 6J and DBA 2J genotype data for this cross is available at 29 It is therefore possible to test whether similar segregation distortion patterns are present in this related multi generation cross The short answer is that the segregation distortions noted in the BXN RI strains are replicated in 6 of 11 intervals The correlation between ratios of alleles logarithm of B N in these intervals was positive r 0 41 It is therefore likely that several of the intervals marked in Table 7with asterisks represent regions that harbor loci that affect fitness Non syntenic associations One important issue in using RI strains for mapping complex traits is that intervals on different chromosomes can become tightly associated in a statistical sense This non syntenic association can arise either as a result of random fixation of alleles on different chromosomes during the production of RI strains or can arise as a result of selection for particular combinations of alleles on different chromosomes Similar patterns of non syntenic disequilibrium are common in recently admixed human populations and often lead to false positive signals when mapping complex traits In mice even a modest selection coefficient expressed over ten generations of inbreeding can generate positive and negative non syntenic disequilibrium throughout the genome For example if the combination of B alleles on distal chromosome 1 and B alleles on proximal chromosome 19 is favorable for fitness then these two intervals will effectively be in linkage disequilibrium in the final RI set Disequilibrium can also take the form of strong negative correlations and B alleles may be associated strongly with the group of N alleles We searched for marked deviations from the expected Hardy Weinberg two locus equilibrium by making a series of large correlation matrices of SDPs of marker pairs see 30 for a variety of correlation matrices This was done for the entire BXN set and for the constituent RI sets Figure 7summarizes the most extreme positive and negative correlations among the composite set of 102 independent BXN RI strains Whether due to chance fixation selection or epistasis non syntenic associations of the sort illustrated in Figure 7are a major source of both false positive and false negativeresults in using RI sets for mapping It is helpful to examine the correlation matrix once a set of QTLs has been provisionally mapped to see how summed effects of single or multiple QTLs might produce spurious QTLs in regions not actually associated with trait variance Controlling for non syntenic association Non syntenic associations among loci and intervals can be computed in advance of QTL mapping It is therefore possible to statistically control for genetic correlations that are built into different RI sets For example in Figure 7the genotypes at marker D1Mit83 can be partly predicted by genotypes at markers on chromosome 7 and chromosome 10 If the genotype at D1Mit83 is treated statistically as a dependent variable and markers on chromosomes 7 and 10 are used as predictors then one can compute the residual genotype or independent contribution of D1Mit83 and any other marker or interval to the quantitative trait Unlike composite interval mapping the set of controlled loci will necessarily vary for each marker and interval This procedure will reduce type I error but will produce a regional loss of statistical power The correction will introduce blind spots in a genome scan In extreme cases usually small RI sets intervals that can be perfectly predicted by small numbers of other non syntenic intervals will effectively be eliminated from a mapping study and QTLs in those intervals will be missed For this reason it is essential to perform each a genome wide scan both with and without control for non syntenic association Single QTLs may occasionally be assigned to two or more physically unlinked intervals Discussion Information content of RI strain sets Despite the accumulation of genotypes in RI strains these genetic resources have often not been typed with sufficient density to accurately define the frequency and positions of recombination breakpoints For example in the venerable set of 13 CXB strains only 11 unique SDPs had been assigned to chromosome 1 before our work With a more dense map of chromosome 1 that is now based on approximately 60 markers we have recovered a total of 38 recombinations on this chromosome approximately three recombinations per strain The positions of these recombinations have been defined with a precision that ranges from 0 5 to 6 0 cM 2 3 cM average as referenced to standard CCR maps Twenty one of the 38 SDPs are represented by one or more marker but at least 17 SDPs remain to be defined and these SDPs unfortunately cannot be predicted unambiguously For example if two adjacent markers P and D have genotypes BBCCC and CCCCC then there must be at least one unrecovered SDP between P and D Until we actually type markers in the P D interval we do not know whether the intercalated SDP is BCCCC or CBCCC To discover the undefined SDP could require considerable effort especially if available polymorphic markers on the P D interval have been exhausted All unrecovered SDPs lower the information content of an RI set Their absence can significantly reduce linkage of both Mendelian and quantitative traits that are unlucky enough to be controlled by loci in the intervals with ambiguous SDPs How dense should a marker map be to define more than 90 of the total number of SDPs With 862 markers we were able to define approximately 60 of all likely SDPs among the 13 CXB strains In the collected set of BXN RI strains approximately 23 of the estimated 5 000 possible SDPs have been confidently defined with MIT microsatellites We can estimate the density of the marker map that would be necessary to define 95 of all SDPs For example for the BXD set if one assumes a random and independent distribution of breakpoints across strains and a random distribution of markers it would take a map with about 2 700 markers to define 95 of the 1 536 SDPs Use of the BXN set Most mapping software applications used by mouse geneticists are adapted for diallele crosses of various types The BXN data set was therefore formatted in a way that collapses all non B6 alleles into a single N class The collected set of just over 100 strains can be used without complication with software such a Map Manager QTX 33 34 This procedure was used largely as a convenience to integrate RI genetic maps There are self evident limitations that follow from the collapse of all non B alleles A J DBA 2J C3H HeJ and BALB cByJ into a single category Geneticists using the BXN set should therefore begin virtually all studies by mapping with the individual component RI sets AXB BXA BXD BXH and CXB to detect possible levels of allele effects an allelic series The B allele is a common feature and may be a useful reference point for estimating hierarchies among the five parental alleles This separate set by set analysis prevents the N alleles from averaging out as they might in a cumulative analysis the N alleles will often have effects that are both higher and lower than that of the B allele Because the BXN set includes 490 common marker loci and a consistent alignment and integration of the component RI maps it is now much easier to combine linkage likelihood ratios from the component RI sets A simple method based on Fisher s method is described by Williams and colleagues 8 in a study that pooled data from BXD and BXH sets More sophisticated methods for automatically extracting and combining linkage statistics from the multi allele BXN sets will require modification of mapping application programs Pooling data in this way will require judicious and well justified statistical procedures Combining data across the BXN sets can easily degrade a linkage analysis The statistical exploration of different combinations of RI sets provides new degrees of freedom which may generate false positive results but which may also generate interesting hypotheses regarding QTL action The BXN map could be refined further by interpolating genotypes of other markers and genes that have been mapped independently by many investigators in single RI sets Our BXD database includes only microsatellite loci for example and excludes hundreds of potentially informative polymorphic loci many in interesting genes We regret having to use this procrustean approach but because of the difficulty of verifying genotypes and because numerous loci introduce improbable double recombinant haplotypes we have used exclusive criteria to ensure high quality maps Investigators interested in recovering some of this lost data should refer to the comprehensive lists of genotypes maintained by the Mouse Genome Database 35 However genotypes of any marker and strain that introduce new double recombinants into the BXN map should be regarded with a high level of suspicion Power and precision of RI strains A set of 100 conventional RI strains will have twice the genetic variance of a matched set of 100 F2 progeny and four times that of 100 backcross progeny This increased genetic variance comes at some cost 100 F2 animals represent 200 meioses and contain almost 200 unique haplotypes per chromosome the non recombinant chromosomes reduce this number somewhat RI strains are fully inbred and 100 lines represent almost 100 unique haplotypes per chromosome A set of 100 RI strains therefore has approximately twice the load of recombinations as 100 F2s For a semidominant Mendelian trait 100 RI strains therefore provide roughly twice the precision of 100 F2 progeny and four times that of 100 N2 progeny When both genetic variance and recombination load are considered together a set of 100 RI strains should be approximately four times as effective precise for mapping complex traits as an F2 and eight times as effective as a backcross This estimate assumes that only a single RI animal is sampled per line a strategy that is appropriate for mapping SNPs microsatellites and other Mendelian loci The gain for mapping quantitative traits will be greater and will depend strongly on the heritability and to a lesser extent on the degree of dominance at each locus Belknap 3 has compared the relative power of RI strains and F2 intercrosses under several models and assuming different levels of heritability For morphometric traits such as brain weight with narrow sense heritabilities of around 0 5 100 RI strains will provide a level of precision and power that is conservatively equivalent to that of 600 1 000 F2 intercross progeny The advantage shifts further in favor of RI strains for traits with lower heritability Power is one key issue in QTL mapping but at present precision the ability to fine map QTLs to subcentimorgan intervals suitable for candidate gene analysis is the hurdle and one that would be less imposing with improved RI resources 36 Making better RI resources The usefulness of RI strains for mapping is largely a function of the number of known recombination breakpoints and useful polymorphisms that they harbor All current mouse RI sets are small and consequently the most common criticisms leveled at QTL mapping with RI strains is that the precision and power are poor and that only those QTLs with unusually large effects can be detected reliably The BXN set provides only a partial solution to this problem by expanding the set of RI strains that can be treated statistically as a complex cross A much better long term solution is to generate larger sets of RI strains for high precision complex trait analysis RI sets consisting of 100 to 1 000 lines could provide very impressive power and subcentimorgan precision The LXS set 80 90 strains and the enlarged BXD set 70 80 strains mentioned above will soon provide practical demonstrations Generating large sets is an undertaking but the effort is dwarfed by ongoing mutagenesis and sequencing efforts Generating maintaining and storing 1 000 RI lines could be a well justified expense given the long term utility of large RI sets in tackling otherwise intractable problems in functional genomics gene pleiotropy genetic correlations epistasis and reaction norm genetics in a mammal Several other factors make this idea significantly more attractive First an RI set can be produced using more than two inbred strains Four to eight strains could in principle be combined to make RI sets that segregate for a greater variety of polymorphisms This addresses the concern that a single conventional diallele RI set may not be useful for studying particular traits because of a paucity of relevant polymorphisms Such multi way RI lines buck the reductionist trend of eliminating genetic complexity by isolating gene variants on inbred backgrounds but such complexity has its advantages and these strains would provide welcome models for exploring genetic background effects that plague much of the current work on transgenic and knockout mice 37 Second by genotyping and selectively breeding the most highly recombinant animals it should be possible to generate RI strain sets with map expansions that significantly exceed that predicted by the Haldane Waddington equation an equation that assumes random mating of sibs A six to eight fold expansion should be attainable particularly if recombinations are tracked before and during the inbreeding process Figure 4 Recombination density could be further increased by starting RI strains from either advanced intercross progeny 36 or heterogeneous stock Figure 4 as was done in making the new set of 40 BXD strains mentioned above Third the power of RI sets can now be amplified significantly by use of RI intercross RIX and RI backcross RIB designs 19 20 Finally large RI sets will largely eliminate the problem of non syntenic association A second well justified objection to using RI strains to map quantitative traits is that fully inbred strains may not provide representative phenotypes precisely because they are inbred and subject to often severe inbreeding depression The abnormal genetic architecture of inbred strains and the fixation of multiple alleles that affect fitness will almost inevitably produce unusual pleiotropic and epistatic effects on a range of complex traits Outliers are common on these and other inbred lines Can the strain means be trusted RIX progeny provide a surprisingly simple solution to this problem 19 20 RIX progeny made among members of a single diallele RI set will be similar to an F2 intercross with an inbreeding coefficient of 0 5 Crosses between members of completely different RI sets for example AXB1 crossed to LXS80 will have an inbreeding coefficient close to zero In this respect they will be more appropriate models of human genetic variation but with the remarkable advantages of completely defined genometypes and the option of generating large numbers of isogenic individuals Using the BXN and their RIX progeny Mapping modifiers of dominant alleles using RI backcrosses Knowing the precise location of breakpoints in RI lines also makes it possible to map modifier loci of mutations by making and phenotyping a set of different F1 crosses made between inbred carrier stock for example a knockout carried on a C57BL 6 background and fully typed RI lines A set of these RI backcrosses RIB has a genetic structure similar to a conventional N2 backcross but there is no need to genotype any of the RIB progeny and they have the major advantage that isogenic progeny can be typed to obtain much more reliable trait scores This method does depend on either a dominant or semidominant mutant allele since the phenotype must be detectable on a significant fraction of the RIB progeny Provided that this condition is met the costs and logistics of this type of screen may be more modest than a typical screen for modifier loci The analysis can be carried out without genotyping and using replicated genomes to test for environmental modulators BXN and sequencing efforts Five of the widely used sets of RI strains that we have typed and analyzed share C57BL 6 as a parental strain The genome of C57BL 6J is currently being sequenced as part of a public effort 38 and for this reason the utility of the BXN set for converting QTLs to strong candidate genes will increase significantly in the next few years 37 It will become far easier to generate complete lists of positional candidate genes and then to obtain data on gene and protein expression patterns The two other major strains incorporated into the BXN set A J and DBA 2J are also being sequence by Celera Genomics and in principle it will be possible to compare sequences of these three major strains to generate lists of possible allelic variants in positional candidate genes The recent cloning of the Sac locus that controls sugar and saccharin preference on distal chromosome 4 provides a good example of the increased power of candidate gene analysis This locus was initially mapped using 20 BXD stains 39 40 In the absence of high resolution mapping but with astute analysis of human and mouse sequence data Sac was identified almost simultaneously by several groups as the gene for the T1R3 receptor 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 In a few years the identification of genes associated with QTLs will probably be no more of a special exception than the cloning of Mendelian genes was in the mid 1990s Materials and methods Strains and DNA Genomic DNA from most recombinant inbred and parental strains was purchased from the Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor USA DNA was obtained from 40 of 41 AXB and BXA strains and 35 of 36 BXD strains 13 CXB strains and 12 BXH strains 100 strains total For visual clarity in this paper we have dropped hyphens and substrain designations from RI strain names For example strain BXD 1 Ty is referred to as BXD1 Databases and web accessible data tables at the Informatics Center for Mouse Neurogenetics 21 also use this simplified nomenclature All DNA from the Jackson Laboratory Mouse DNA Resource was extracted from individual male mice The RI animals that we genotyped were with a few exceptions the progeny of more than 20 serial matings between siblings Data on the particular generation that we used for genotyping and the current generation of RI animals is available at 30 DNA from seven new BXH strains generated by Linda Siracusa Thomas Jefferson Medical College Philadelphia USA was extracted from the spleen using a high salt procedure 48 The new BXH strains were generated by crossing C57BL 6J c2J c2Jalbino males with C3H HeJ females and their production and genotyping will be described in detail elsewhere L Siracusa and R W W unpublished data Three of the new BXH albino strains are no longer available C2 D1 and E2 We genotyped 107 RI strains Several sets of strains share haplotypes Table 8 We deleted redundant strains AXB18 ABX20 and BXA17 Strains BXHD1 BXHE1 and BXHE2 were backcrossed to C57BL 6J for one generation before sibmatings were begun There is therefore a pronounced increase in the number of chromosomal segments inherited from C57BL 6J These N2 derived RI strains were dropped from most aspects of the analysis of RI genome structure BXD41 has been extinct for several years and was never completely inbred Although we have DNA for this strain our sample is from a F12 generation male We did not genotype BXD41 in this study We refer to the collected RI set as the BXN set because each of the strains includes C57BL 6 B6 or B as one of the parental strains the common substrain C57BL 6J in the case of AXB BXA BXD and BXH and the substrain C57BL 6By in the case of CXB The other parental strain in the BXN set is not B6 derived A J in both AXB and BXA sets DBA 2J in BXD C3H HeJ in BXH and BALB cBy inCXB PCR Microsatellite loci distributed across all autosomes and the X chromosome were typed using a modified version of the protocol of Love and colleagues 49 and Dietrich and colleagues 23 described in detail at 50 A total of 1 773 primer pairs MapPairs that selectively amplify polymorphic MIT microsatellite loci were purchased from Research Genetics Each 10 l PCR reaction mixture contained 1 PCR buffer 1 92 mM MgCl 2 0 25 units Taq DNA polymerase 0 2 mM of each deoxynucleotide 132 nM of the primers and 50 ng genomic DNA Reactions were set up using a 96 channel pipetting station A loading dye 60 sucrose 1 0 mM cresol red was added to the reaction before the PCR 51 PCRs were carried out in 96 well microtiter plates We used a high stringency touchdown protocol in which the annealing temperature was lowered progressively from 60 C to 50 C in 2 C steps over the first six cycles 52 After 30 cycles PCR products were run on cooled 2 5 Metaphor agarose gels FMC Inc Rockland ME stained with ethidium bromide and photographed Gel photographs were scored and directly entered into relational database files Eighteen primer pairs were resynthesized at our request by Research Genetics using the original sequence data Whitehead MIT SSLP Database Release 8 53 to verify that our chromosome reassignments of microsatellite loci were not due to the use of incorrect primer sequences Common markers When we began this work fewer than 25 MIT markers had been typed on each of the four major RI sets We were able to increase this to 489 markers We relied on these loci to assemble consensus RI maps The additional 986 MIT markers were typed by us and other groups in at least one set of RI strains The BXN genotype database includes 1 578 markers Any pair of RI sets share between 500 and 600 fully genotyped markers For example the two largest RI sets AXB BXA and BXD have been typed at 591 common microsatellite markers Databases Relational database files were assembled from the 1998 2000 chromosome committee reports the Portable Dictionary of the Mouse Genome 54 and the MIT Whitehead SSLP database Release 8 53 These files contain a summary of information on chromosomal positions of 6 332 MIT microsatellite markers and information on an additional 15 000 genes and markers We have included Nuffield Department of Surgery Nds microsatellite markers for which primer sequences are available Additional databases devoted to each RI set were assembled from text files downloaded from the Mouse Genome Database 35 New and corrected genotypes were entered directly into these files Additional data files The following files are available for download versions of the BXN genetic maps and microsatellite marker genotypes and the two locus correlation matrices of genotypes for different subsets of strains 30 Files 1 8 are variants of the BXN genotype data shown in Figure
