 Background The normal function of transforming growth factor 1 TGF 1 is essential for the entire organism representing a multifunctional regulator of cell growth and differentiation 1 2 3 4 5 TGF 1 is a potent inhibitor of epithelial cell proliferation Upon binding of TGF 1 TGF 1 receptors phosphorylate SMAD2 or SMAD3 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Phosphorylated SMAD2 3 associates with SMAD4 and as a complex moves into the nucleus where it regulates gene expression 13 14 15 SMAD4 DPC4 is essential for this TGF 1 signaling and transcriptional activation process 16 In epithelial cells TGF 1 decreases c myc cdc2 and cyclin D1 expression and it increases the expression of c jun and c fos 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Activation of the TGF 1 signal pathway in epithelial cells leads to an increased expression of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 WAF1and p15 Ink4band to a release of formerly sequestered p27 KIP 24 25 26 It is assumed that the cooperative action of these cell cycle inhibitors results in the growth arrest mentioned above although p15 Ink4bdoes not seem to be necessary in this regard In addition to mutations in the TGF 1 receptors in a large number of carcinomas disruptions of this signaling pathway by the alteration of a single protein such as p15 Ink4b p16 and p21 Waf1are found 2 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 This may result in resistance to the growth inhibiting action of TGF 1 In several cell lines particularly in pancreatic carcinoma cells resistance to TGF 1 could be attributed to a loss of function of the SMAD4 DPC4 protein 40 41 42 43 However the pancreatic carcinoma cell line BxPC 3 although homozygously deleted for SMAD4 is growth inhibited by TGF 1 30 44 It is thus speculated that alternative signaling pathways in addition to the SMAD pathway may exist After binding to V 6 integrin latent TGF 1 is activated by processing of latent TGF 1 by cleavage of the latency associated Peptide LAP 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 Recently the interaction of latent TGF 1 with V 6 integrin has been shown 45 After binding of latent TGF 1 to V 6 integrin latent TGF 1 is activated by cleavage of the latency associated peptide LAP 45 This V 6 integrin is also expressed by pancreatic carcinoma cells 58 59 60 61 62 63 We hypothesized that there is a SMAD independent TGF 1 signaling pathway in TGF 1 sensitive carcinoma cells To address this question several carcinoma cell lines with different degrees of TGF 1 sensitivity were chosen as a model system We investigated the interaction of TGF 1 with the V 6 integrin and its influence on selected target genes known to be involved in cell cycle regulated growth inhibition Here we demonstrate an alternate TGF 1 signaling pathway via V 6 integrin contributing to TGF 1 growth inhibiton in TGF 1 sensitive carcinoma cells Results Mature TGF 1induces cytoskeletal immobilization of proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation via integrin V 6only in TGF 1sensitive cells Only integrins that have bound their ligands are anchored to the cytoskeleton 64 65 In our experiments mature TGF 1 V 6 integrin and F actin colocalize Figure 1 suggesting association with and activation of this integrin To further support this finding we stimulated cells and performed co immunoprecipitated various integrin subunits of cytoskeletal anchored proteins 66 67 additional file 1 2 3and 4 Our data strongly suggest that

TGF 1 was only seen in the TGF 1 sensitive carcinoma cell lines Figure 2and additional file 5 Notably tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletally anchored proteins is further enhanced after combined treatment with mature TGF 1 and fibronectin in TGF 1 sensitive cells Figure 3 In contrast in the TGF 1 resistant AsPC 1 and Capan 1 cells the interaction of mature TGF 1 with V 6 integrin resulted in an immobilization of high molecular weight proteins to the cytoskeleton without tyrosine phosphorylation Figure 2 Again stimulation of TGF 1 sensitive cells BxPC 3 LoVo 68 SW48 68 Keratinocytes HeLa

with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 resulted in a reduced cytoskeletal immobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins in response to stimulation with mature TGF 1 This finding is in agreement with other observations that MEK1 mediated signal transduction is involved in cytoskeletal remodeling and integrin engagement 70 71 Additional File 5 Portable Network Graphic PNG File

integrin associated signaling 72 73 was determined to assess integrin mediated signaling BcPC 3 cells are sensitive to TGF 1 but are SMAD4 deleted We incubated BxPC 3 cells with mature TGF 1 and observed an association on the cytoskeleton connected with integrin V 6 and activation of p125 FAK Figure 4 Indeed TGF 1 antibodies cytochalasin D and BAPTA AM 66 abolished the association on the cytoskeleton connected with integrin V 6 and activation of p125 FAK These data further suggest that TGF 1 mediated activation of p125 FAKdepends on free intracellular calcium and an intact actin cytoskeleton In order to test whether TGF 1 signaling via V 6 is specific for SMAD4 deleted BxPC 3 cells or if this is a general phenomenon we investigated signaling in TGF 1 sensitive carcinoma cell lines HeLa MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 TGF 1 induced recruitment of p125 Fak p130 Casand Sos1 2 to the cytoskeleton Enhanced expression of c jun c fos p21 WAF1and p27 KIP while downregulating PCNA is

Whole cell extract was probed with PCNA antibodies Actin served as loading control Click here for file TGF 1 V 6integrin signaling is independent of the known TGF 1signaling pathway To explain the TGF 1 sensitivity of SMAD4 deleted cells it is speculated that after binding of TGF 1 to its receptor activated SMAD2 3 may translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression even in the absence of SMAD4 To exclude this possibility cellular proteins were divided into cytoplasmatic and nuclear fractions after TGF 1 stimulation and localization and phosphorylation of SMAD2 3 were investigated In the SMAD4 deleted BxPC 3 cells TGF 1 resulted in phosphorylation of SMAD2 3 but the activated SMAD proteins were retained in the cytoplasmatic fraction Figure 9 Remarkably in NP 9 cells 74 SMAD2 3 are translocated into the nucleus upon TGF 1 stimulation additional file 9 A but we could not observe an enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeletal anchored proteins additional file 9 B Additional

on cell growth is well established but the mechanisms are not fully understood 75 76 77 78 79 Here we assayed for the possible synergistic function of V 6 integrin on mature TGF 1 mediated growth inhibition in Panc 1 cells As shown in the additional file 10 combined treatment with V and 6 blocking antibodies almost completely abolished the effect of mature TGF 1 on the growth of Panc 1 cells We therefore postulate that the growth inhibition of TGF 1 is synergistically influenced by V 6 integrin Additional File 10 Microsoft Excel spreadsheet showing TGF 1 elicited growth inhibition of Panc 1 cells is dependent on V 6 integrin function The assay was performed as described in the Methods section Click here for file Discussion A recent study demonstrated an interaction of latent TGF 1 with V 6 integrin which led to an activation of latent TGF 1 45 Incubation of different tumor cells with mature TGF 1 resulted in a direct binding of TGF 1 to V 6 integrin Certain integrins appear to be preferentially associated with specific growth factor receptors 80 The interaction of these two receptor classes seems to take place via the actin cytoskeleton We were able to exclude such signal pathway association since in our cytoskeletal preparations no TGF 1 receptors were detectable indicating that mature TGF 1 is a ligand for V 6 It has been reported that activated integrins are associated with the cytoskeleton Here we show that binding of mature TGF 1 to V 6 integrin resulted in an association of the cytoskeleton Figure 10 In a variety of integrin mediated signaling pathways tyrosinephosphorylation of proteins immobilized to the cytoskeleton is enhanced 66 67 The same was true in our experimental settings only for the TGF 1 sensitive cells This upregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation was inhibited by preincubation with a TGF 1 neutralizing antibody or by blocking of V 6 integrin thus again proving mature TGF 1 as an initial signaling ligand for V 6 Binding of mature TGF 1 to V 6 integrin exerts several downstream effects in TGF 1 sensitive cells Figure 9 One is a marked phosphorylation of p125 FAK This phosphorylation is dependent on the integrity of the cytoskeleton as disruption of actin filaments by cytochalasin D completely eliminated this effect findings which have also been reported for several integrin signaling pathways 66 67 Moreover incubation of the TGF 1 sensitive carcinoma cells with TGF 1 caused immobilization of the docking protein p130 casand of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS to the cytoskeleton Beyond this a marked induction of the cell cycle inhibitors p21 WAF1and p27 KIPand a decrease in PCNA expression was detectable Finally TGF 1 caused an activation of p21Ras and the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 This TGF 1 induced expression profile was not affected by preincubation of SMAD4 deleted BxPC 3 cells with a TGF 1 RII blocking antibody which was able to completely block TGF 1 induced SMAD2 3 phosphorylation thus demonstrating the independence of the TGF 1 signaling from the known SMAD pathway in BxPC 3 cells In contrast preincubation with V and 6 blocking antibodies curbed the TGF 1 induced regulation of p21 WAF1 p27 c fos and the p21Ras and ERK1 2 activation verifying that the binding of TGF 1 to the V 6 integrin is a prerequisite for the activation of the signal pathway via the V 6 integrin Preincubation of the cells with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 curbed the TGF 1 induced regulation of these genes as well indicating the involvement of the MAP kinase pathway in TGF 1 signaling in BxPC 3 cells As shown recently the growth stimulatory effect of the TGF superfamily member BMP 2on CAPAN 1 cells was blocked by this inhibitor as well 81 82 83 supporting our findings Indeed cytoskeletal immobilization of p130cas and SOS was not prevented by the MEK1 inhibitor PD 98059 Thus these proteins are good candidates to link the integrin mediated TGF 1 signaling to the MAP kinase pathway as was shown previously for signaling events induced by fluid stress or integrin mediated cell adhesion in other cell types 71 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 In order to generalize the integrin mediated TGF 1 pathway identified in the SMAD4 deleted pancreatic tumor cell line BxPC 3 we investigated TGF 1 signaling in the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa and the mammary carcinoma cell lines MCF 7 and MDA MB 231 harboring a wildtype SMAD4 gene TGF 1 bound to V 6 integrin in these cells as well and this interaction resulted both in an immobilization of p130Cas and SOS1 2 and in tyrosine phosphorylation of cytoskeleton associated proteins such as p125FAK TGF 1 stimulation of these cells acvtivated p21Ras and MAPK ERK1 2 upregulated c fos c jun AP1 p21 WAF1 and p27 expression and resulted a decrease of PCNA similar to its actions in BxPC 3 cells Preincubation with a TGF RII blocking antibody attenuated the TGF 1 induced pattern contrary to SMAD 4 deleted BxPC 3 cells This preincubation also decreased activation of p21Ras and of MAPK ERK1 2 indicating the participation of the Ras MAPK pathway in TGF 1 induced transcriptional activation The same attenuation of TGF 1 induced gene expression and the decrease in p21Ras and MAPK ERK1 2 activation was observable after preincubation of SMAD4 wildtype cells with V 6 blocking antibodies demonstrating that TGF 1 signaling via V 6 integrin also is linked to the Ras MAPK pathway and that both pathways have synergistic effects in TGF 1 signaling Full TGF 1 induced transcriptional activation is only reached if both pathways are completed This finding is supported by the observation that activation of p21 Ras and MAPK ERK1 2 induced by TGF 1 is only reverted to the control level by the combination of the TGF RII blocking antibody and the V 6 blocking antibodies or by inhibition of MEK1 Linking of the TGF R pathway to the Ras MAPK pathway is dependent on a functional SMAD4 gene product because TGF 1 induced gene expression and activation of Ras and ERK1 2 is attenuated by the TGF RII blocking antibody only in SMAD4 wild type cells whereas in the SMAD4 deleted BxPC 3 cells no such influence was observable Based on our results we suggest the following model of TGF 1 signaling which offers an explanation for the different growth responses to TGF 1 Fig 10 In the TGF 1 sensitive cell lines with intact SMAD pathway the TGF 1 response can be attributed to both the common SMAD signaling pathway and the integrin pathway described above In the cell line BxPC 3 lacking the SMAD4 gene product the SMAD4 independent pathway can explain the TGF 1 sensitivity via V 6 integrin the cytoskeleton and the Ras MAP kinase pathway resulting in an upregulation of the cell cycle inhibitiors p21 WAF1 and p27 which in turn results in the TGF 1 induced growth inhibition additional file 10 The cell lines Capan 1 and AsPC 1 are not only resistant to TGF 1 because of their alterations in the SMAD pathway but also because they cannot complete the alternate pathway as demonstrated above Furthermore this alternate pathway may explain the TGF 1 resistance of cells with no detectable defect in the SMAD pathway 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 101 as one can imagine that the cooperative action of the both pathways is necessary to exert the complete growth inhibitory effect of TGF 1 Comparable effects have been described for the synergistic operation of growth factor receptor and anchorage dependent integrin signaling 102 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119 Recombinant mature TGF 1 does not contain a RGD motif and thus binding of TGF 1 to the V 6 integrin and the subsequent activation of this integrin must rely on a novel motif distinct from RGD For V 6 integrin a novel non RGD ligand recognition motif was recently described with the consensus motif DLXXL 120 This motif has been detected on several proteins including laminin collagen and fibrinogen 120 A BLAST search for this sequence in TGF 1 revealed a 70 similar motif in two parts of the molecule one in the LAP data not shown and one in the mature TGF 1 In mature TGF 1 the DLXXL motif is freely accessible for interactions on the outside of the molecule Therefore it may be speculated that TGF 1 binding to V 6 via this novel ligand recognition motif is facilitating the signaling Moreover a non RGD ligand binding pocket in addition to the usual RGD binding site has been demonstrated for fibrinogen and the IIb 3 integrin 121 supporting our findings Conclusions We demonstrate an alternate TGF 1 signaling pathway via V 6 integrin independent of SMAD4 This pathway seems to be required for full TGF 1 induced transcriptional activation which explains the TGF 1 sensitivity of those cells lacking DPC4 SMAD4
