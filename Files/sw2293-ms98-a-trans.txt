 okay well um discussing air pollution today i guess um hum um uh well give me your first impressions uh i don t know there s a lot of air pollution yeah um i think industries and companies provide a lot of it um hum and with uh i guess with the oil burning over in Kuwait and stuff that would have a lot of air pollution in it uh puts a whole yeah gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be but uh that stuff going on over there what what uh what part of Pennsylvania are you in um i m north of Pittsburgh so okay okay okay so it s it s it s amazing too you know you with that with the oil wells burning over there that s that s the exact same stuff that s coming out of cars every day just in uh just in a little different grade i guess yeah but uh in Dallas we ve got we ve just uh brought in a whole new set of uh requirements on inspections and things like that for cars because uh people just don t use mass transit and stuff in Dallas everybody loves their car and you see an awful lot of uh one person vehicles on the road on during rush hours that seems to be our biggest problem down here um you know there s uh there s a lot of industry around but uh it s not it s any pollution that industry s dumping around here is not going into the air it s typically water type situation yeah um we have a couple we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff and i know there s a lot of air pollution going in there and like they they get fined whenever they do the air pollution but um hum the fine is nothing you know it s like nothing to them yeah it s it s yeah like like two hours of output or something like that yeah that s true that s true yeah yeah um hum yeah i uh i grew up in South Dakota so i was never i was never exposed to anything of of the of the sort um uh huh there were always the EPA people and what not were always telling us that uh farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that but we just we just never saw the results uh um hum there was there was dust in the air during uh planting seasons and what not but uh that that was all we ever saw and then five years ago i i moved to Dallas and i suddenly start to understand what uh burning eyes uh and all that stuff is about that i d always heard about it uh it s it gets it s real depressing um in the morning sometime uh just you you can tell if it s a good day or a bad day by uh how far out from downtown uh you you can be on the road and still not see it oh my God and uh yeah you know i mean it s not uh i don t think Dallas is considered uh a a real bad place for for air pollution but you you can tell you can tell the differences in the days when it s when the haze is kind of yellowish gray instead of just being a a foggy misty color uh huh and uh it it s a little it s a little disappointing sometimes that you start to realize what you re breathing uh yeah but i i don t know what they can do to really prevent it you know like how can what can they do about the oil burning over in Kuwait what you know i mean they fine the the industries but you know that doesn t seem to stop them there i don t know what else they can do right right it s it s that there really isn t a whole lot it s it s one of those uh it s one of those things that if they do a little bit and uh and every you know every every little bit does help i i do believe that um but i also believe that uh the earth is is a kind of a self regulating system and uh it will clean itself up eventually it the whole idea is not to not to push the limit too hard i guess let let the you know let the natural natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible um hum yeah i i yeah i just don t understand you know what else anyone can do about it i don t think it s something that people really think about either um hum you know it s i mean i it it should probably be a big issue you know because it s it s doing a lot of damage but i it s something you know i don t think many people really think about it because it s nothing they i don t think we really have too much control over it right and it s one of those things it s it s it s so hard to measure uh what what what the damage is it s it s kind of like uh um hum oh i guess it s kind of like kind of like cigarette smoking you know it it it it could go on for years and years until they they start start to see some results and people can actually actually say yeah it s it s it s doing it s doing some damage and and something s got to be done um hum um there s you know there s a lot of things like that it it it you can uh you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks but until it breaks you don t really know that there you were doing anything to it yeah exactly but uh well i really don t know too much else about it yeah well that s it you know i i i think we both agree it s it s one of those deals that uh i just think there s a lot of other problems right now and uh we ve done a lot to take care of it um hum yeah and uh yeah we have tried i mean you know and um i i know where you know where a couple of the mills that have i know i know they put things on their stacks you know to filter the smoke and do all kinds of things but i mean every now and then it breaks you know and and you just got smoke going out into the air for a day or two till you can get it fixed and stuff oh sure sure so you know it s something we we have tried to help but yeah oh there s no doubt about i don t know if you if you ever happened to see uh some of the like Twenty Twenty and what not about uh Romania and East Germany when they first got pictures out of there about how some of their uh systems had been running for twenty and thirty years um um hum and uh you know they absolutely no regulations no controls whatsoever and they had destroyed entire forests and what not just because the air was so polluted that s that s the kind of things that uh you don t see in this country and that s that s why i think that you know it s it s i don t know if you can ever do enough but uh i think it s all relative to the to the time and place and i think right now it s it s it s pretty much under control yeah okay well um hum it s been nice talking to you okay bye bye all righty well you bet bye
