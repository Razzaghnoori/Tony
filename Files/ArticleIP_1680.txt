and centrists Post Paula Starr will find the political world a harsher place predict Jack Germond and Evan Thomas Inside Washington Steve Roberts CNN s Late Edition and David Gergen The McLaughlin Group Starr must deliver a blockbuster wad of evidence to make a splash says Mark Shields CNN s Capital Gang With the Jones matter resolved the public and the pols will lean on Starr to finish his work pdq say Thomas Shields Eleanor Clift The McLaughlin Group and Juan Williams Fox News Sunday But Starr operates in a legal world maintain the conservatives where facts are facts and polls matter little if at all the federal case will stand or fall based upon the evidence Starr uncovers In a legal sense the Jones proceeding is an apple to Starr s orange claims Charles Krauthammer Inside Washington Most pundits point out sometimes ominously sometimes dismissively that no one has seen Starr s cards They may show Lizzie Borden in drag Shields PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer Three conservatives proclaim their confidence that Starr holds enough to undo Clinton s presidency Robert Novak Capital Gang Fred Barnes and John McLaughlin The McLaughlin Group Stuart Taylor wrote as much this week in the National Journal and appears on This Week to reprise the point Taylor s article is referred to in reverential tones all weekend The Jones dismissal directs the scandal s focus away from sex and toward allegations of a cover up many pundits note That is bad news for the president says Krauthammer No it isn t says Clift who doesn t think Americans are overly upset by sex related cover ups The suggestion that Starr may indict Monica Lewinsky and name Clinton an unindicted co conspirator is a sure public relations disaster Clift George Stephanopoulos This Week and Susan Page

Lewinsky questions tomorrow thereby ending the circus immediately advises Stephanopoulos He also admits a zero percent chance of this happening The public isn t calling for a Lewinsky explanation reports Page and therefore won t get one Don t rock the boat agrees Mara Liasson Fox News Sunday The Republicans on the Hill Issue 2 draw fire from all sides The transportation bill is porky the squashing of the campaign finance bill was a dastardly use of procedural rules the tobacco settlement may go through but only because everyone wants to get their paws on the proceeds The Republican leaders wish the impeachment hearings would just go away particularly because the lunatic fringe of the party is howling for Clinton s blood which will play poorly for the cameras Mom Can Grandpa Say That on TV Presidential historian Stephen Ambrose begins his NewsHour appearance by inveighing against evening newscasts too smutty to watch with his 12 year old granddaughter Ambrose in the very next sentence goes on to discuss his theory that God created man with a penis and a brain and gave them only enough blood to run one at a time And that s why we used to have dormitories that separated the boys and the girls and we had chaperones at the dances Novak s Blaxsploitation Last week Capital Gang ster Robert Novak contended that black Americans post bellum achievements represent the slave trade s oft overlooked silver lining This week he apologizes for offending viewers pronounces slavery an unmitigated evil and claims to have meant only that our society was enriched by African Americans Here is Novak s original quotation from Capital Gang He brought along this whole plane full of African Americans and some of our really fine citizens are African Americans in government in business in athletics in show business You know how they got here They were all slaves weren t they So it s kind of a problem We wouldn t have this enrichment of our society if it wasn t for slavery And here s an almost identical Novak comment on the March 27 edition of CNN s Crossfire The president makes these amends for slavery and then he says how wonderful the African Americans who accompanied him are If it hadn t been for slavery they wouldn t even be in America would they That s kind of a problem isn t it Novak s own apology is no doubt unrelated to a letter writing campaign to his employer the Chicago Sun Times mounted by the black community Bruce Gottlieb
