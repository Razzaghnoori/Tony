                okay so tell me about China Cry   okay okay China Cry was basically the the true story written by this this lady who had uh was a native is native Chinese uh uh who was raised by Christian parents and her her time frame was prior to the nineteen forty nine revolution   umhum i see   although she herself had never really accepted Jesus or gone through any of the other uh Christian uh portions of of the faith repentance baptisms et cetera et cetera she had always felt a very strong uh leaning in this direction and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen forty nine occurred and most churches were either banned or their all the clergy and so forth were ah killed or or imprisoned or and the property confiscated she was safe because she had you know not officially joined the the Christian movement   umhum   so anyway she as she grew up towards maturity her parents well her dad was a doctor and and he was rather well you know rather well to do in the old regime and the the China the communist the communist Chinese didnt like this at all you know the bourgeoisie was was was definitely out of uh style then   right   everybody was back to a commonality of one and so they kept picking at him picking at his at her mother and uh finally uh started picking on her   uhhuh   and getting her to you know they were starting to uh accuse her of of of uh crimes and atrocities before the the revolution and and had her write her own story over and over and over uh and the uh the major point of the movie was that that she had uh married this this Chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court now i think im leaving out a portion she graduated she went through college and graduated very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers   umhum   when the they decided that that she needed to start recanting of all of her pre uh regime crimes as it were being a child you know so   uhhuh   they kept on and on at at her and in the meantime she and her husband uh were expecting expecting were expecting a child their own child and uh the the people kept harassing her over you know over a period of months and finally they uh carried her uh out into the courtyard to to either really to shoot her or to go through the motions of of shooting her uh with by firing or you know executing her by firing squad and uh the Lord just said no this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really   umhum   you know shes shes one of mine she is not going to die and um the the the soldiers were blinded when they shot   hm   and she her life was spared and this this frightened the the uh the commandant and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp   huh   well uh and course heres this this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around   huh   well she she put in for going in  going to uh and her husband had escaped to Hong Kong uh and then she put in to go see him and over time she uh uh finally through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of the the middle uh bureaucracy bureaucracy that they finally let her go   huh   and of course she had to walk you know they they stripped her of everything practically besides the the clothes on her back and uh so she so she went across the border to her husband and another and other child that theyd already had   umhum   uh to freedom   oh   and they knew that she wasnt going to come back but yeah she did years later when the uh liberalization you know in real life uh liberalization of China happened and uh she was not persecuted or anything else like that   umhum huh interesting story   yes it was uh very moving too   i uh i dont even remember seeing that advertised and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly   well it was within oh ninety days   oh that recent   yeah no i mean its it was it was advertised over a period of about ninety days   oh i see what you mean   but it wasnt uh they didnt have it in uh too awfully many movie houses but it was it was in the it had large uh uh uh press release   umhum well uh i guess what i what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago  so id remember remember it well was um sort of light by comparison uh   okay umhum   my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy and and uh we ended up going to see Green Card   Green Card   Green Card and and uh   uhhuh   he chose it and uh its got this wonderful French actor whos it was his like his and hes been a star in France and a wonderful actor who weve enjoyed for years but hes never made an American film this was his American film debut and he speaks very broken English   oh i see uhhuh   and basically he played um a Frenchman who married an American girl uh in a marriage of convenience   umhum   so that he could get his green card which is what an alien needs to work in this country   right umhum   and uh because she could claim she was married she could get uh an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in New York that had a garden an an an outside garden which is very unusual there   umhum   because she was a horticulturist and that was sort of her dream of course you know they got married and they never saw each other again except except fate threw them together and the Immigration and national Naturalization Service   oh i see uhhuh     um started investigating so they had to get back together and get their stories straight       and and she was a very sophisticated well sophisticated urban New Yorker and he was a poor Frenchman who had grown up on the   oh   on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was   umhum   hed been working in a restaurant when they met   umhum   and uh they had to learn all about each other basically in a in a weekend and uh it was you knew what was going to happen of course   just a minute umhum   that they would fall in love well they fell into like at any rate and   right uhhuh   and when they went to the query or inquisition or whatever uh they did perfectly and then he said something because his English was so poor on for the most part he he was so proud of himself for giving examples all the correct answers that that on the last one he said oh i never remember that answer and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers   uh oh uhhuh   so um
