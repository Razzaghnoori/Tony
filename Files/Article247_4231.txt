 The Gore Bradley Debates Talk to the Hand In their two televised debates this weekend the Democratic candidates both showed substantial improvement since their previous encounter in New Hampshire back in October Al Gore has calmed down While still hyperactive he seemed much less desperate and hysterical than in the first debate Bill Bradley was much more keyed up He s no longer practicing passive resistance in the middle of a food fight You got a sense of how Bradley has recalibrated his approach in the first of the two events a dull 90 minute Nightline special that kept East Coast political junkies up until after 1 a m on Friday night Bradley finally made an effort to seize the offensive on health care asking Gore repeatedly Who would you leave out In response Gore just kept repeating his ineffectual and inaccurate answer that his plan would leave no one out But it was during the much feistier encounter on Meet The Press this morning the most contentious of the primary debates so far that Bradley finally came into his own He performed a sort of political jujitsu I have never really seen from him before waiting for Gore to charge at him and then turning the assault back on his attacker Bradley used this technique to devastating effect and he did so repeatedly through the hour long broadcast Bradley s best moment came in response to a series of questions from Tim Russert about campaign finance reform Gore offered Bradley a compact that they both agree to a moratorium on 30 second ads and that they debate twice a week for the rest of the campaign In a long exchange Bradley grabbed this weapon out of Gore s hand and pistol whipped him with it Here are some highlights Gore We don t have to wait for the Republican nominee to be picked Bill I ll make you this offer right now If you will agree I will stop running all television and radio commercials until this nomination is decided That can get a lot of the money out of the presidential campaign and accomplish one of the best reforms What about it Bradley Sounds to me like you re having trouble raising money Gore No uh as a matter of fact I m not Bradley I mean this is a ridiculous proposal You know the way you communicate with people is when you talk to them I love to talk to them in town meetings that s my favorite place I ve been doing that since January But I also love to talk to them over television in their living rooms Gore turning to moderator OK here s the second part of the proposal Let s debate twice a week from now until the nomination is decided and just go face to face about the issues and get rid of all these television and radio commercials Why not do that Bradley You know something For 10 months that I was running for president you ignored me You pretended I didn t exist Suddenly I start to do better and you want to debate every day It s ridiculous We re having debates The point is Al and I don t know if you get this but a political campaign is not just a performance for people which is what this is but it is rather a dialogue Gore Look we could call this the Meet The Press agreement We could have two debates every single week and get rid of all the television and radio commercials I m willing to do it right now if you ll shake on it extends hand Bradley Al that s good I like that hand talks to the hand But the answer is noooo I mean why should I agree now I m not interested in tactics Al And that was a very interesting ploy on Meet the Press Gore Look I m ready to agree right now Bradley It was nothing but a ploy Gore Debates aren t ploys Bradley That Come here shake my hand that s nothing but a ploy I ve quoted this exchange at length because I think it represents a pivotal moment in the Democratic campaign I m not sure whether the effect fully comes across in written form but on television Bradley made Gore look like a complete ass Slate s Chatterbox thinks it was the other way around click here for his take For more on the debate see Pundit Central Gore gave him an opening by acting like a fast talking used car salesman in a plaid blazer Bill I ll make you this offer right now Bradley responded by snipping off the huckster s polyester necktie saying in effect Do you have so little respect for me as to think I d fall for something that stupid While Gore waited with his hand dangling in midair Bradley disdainfully critiqued and dismissed his whole approach to politics Bradley was equally effective in neutralizing Gore s assaults on other topics When Russert asked Gore and Bradley what steps they would consider to ensure long term solvency for Social Security and Medicare both candidates tried to rule out the option of raising the retirement age Gore then criticized Bradley for having voted in the Senate at one point to consider raising it Bradley responded that the Clinton administration had itself discussed this option Gore responded that he hadn t ever discussed it Bradley You didn t discuss it in all your Social Security forums out there Gore I certainly didn t Bradley No one ever did right No one ever did Give me a break Gore Bill I voted against raising the retirement age Bradley Give me a break But the point is that at the same time you criticize me for wanting discussion in the United States Senate on the variety of possibilities the exact thing Tim is talking about you and your administration are out doing the same thing What made Bradley s response on this point especially devastating was his accompanying hand gesture undoubtedly unconscious but perilously close to the universal symbol for pull it a little harder Throughout the entire debate in fact Bradley s facial expressions and body language were those of a grown up compelled to contend with an obnoxious punk He would fight back if necessary but only after making clear that doing so was beneath him What Bradley showed I think is that he has found a way around the diabolical box that Gore has tried to put him in He has figured out a way to defend himself without climbing into the mud wrestling pit While Gore rolled around in the muck Bradley did no more than take off his jacket and roll up his sleeves At various points in the broadcast you could hear Gore chuckling and sighing while Bradley was saying something he disagreed with But these expressions of contempt have nothing of the force that Bradley s do Gore s sneering gestures all seemed rehearsed and theatrical Bradley on the other hand came across as straightforward and real his authenticity underscored by Gore s plasticity In sum Gore may want to reconsider his request for twice weekly debates A few more like this morning s and he ll be kaput
