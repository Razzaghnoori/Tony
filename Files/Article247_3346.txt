 The Poetics of Traffic Jams I loved the traffic story for its winning characters a poet of thermodynamics and a Jam professor its clear explication of competing scientific theories and the satisfaction of knowing that our nation s best physicists are even more annoyed by traffic than are the rest of us I noticed that the story didn t use the word sprawl It didn t reference Al Gore s livability agenda for the 2000 election or quote any politicians decrying the pernicious social effect of traffic Sipress did call the Eastern seaboard sprawling but that s it Instead the story was nicely focused on local trouble spots such as the Capital Beltway and the Woodrow Wilson Bridge I wonder if this indicates that sprawl has ebbed back into the realm of the regional or just that Sipress was so annoyed by all the rhetoric that he left it out of his piece Speaking of local issues the carpetbagger issue rankles me too but for different reasons I keep hearing New Yorkers described as transient drifters whose own roots are so ephemeral that we are willing to let any politician rent a hotel room and represent us As someone who s lived in four of the five boroughs whose family on both sides has lived in the city since arriving in America and who worked for the City of New York I am offended This is partly because my local pride has been injured but also because I think that New York with its size diversity abundant businesses crumbling schools huge infrastructure and so on has local needs that are just as if not more particular as any other district in the country And even if New York City s denizens are more transitory than the average American residents of New York State are not So even if we elect an adopted Senator rather than a homegrown one it won t be because we lack a sense of place Yesterday you warned me not to lump you with radio hosts who chide Hillary for capitalizing on her husband s fame and power Yet today you wrote that Hillary owes her celebrity solely to her husband s political career Yes she does just as George W Bush Al Gore and Jack Kennedy once owed theirs only to their fathers If sons can create political careers based on the successes of their fathers why can t wives do so based on those of their husbands If you re going to prevent one political dynasty from being created you re going to have to topple them all Walter our correspondence is drawing to a close Thank you so much for sharing your breakfast thoughts especially with someone with far fewer years of newspaper reading and writing under her belt Cheers Jodi P S I never responded to the wager you made with me yesterday If Rick Lazio wins the New York Senate race I ll buy you a Manhattan at the bar of your choice
