front page piece on the information turned up by Ken Starr for the Arkansas grand jury he has had looking into Bill and Hillary s Arkansas financial dealings The piece by Whitewater experts Jeff Gerth and Stephen Labaton is mostly a useful summary of old news but there is new ground broken the grand jury evidence includes 1 a document found last summer in a briefcase in Vince Foster s attic that impugns Hillary Clinton s account of how she came to represent James McDougal s Madison Savings and Loan and 2 Bill Clinton s testimony that after the initial NYT articles on Whitewater he sent an

photographer tries to take the wearer s picture emits a picture ruining flash The Sunday LAT also featured an interview with Bernard Lewinsky who had this to say in defense of his daughter She s a
