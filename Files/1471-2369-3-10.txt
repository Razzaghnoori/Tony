                    Background        Poisonings are among the most frequent indications for        hospitalization in the United States     However the        frequency of hospitalizations for poisonings drug overdose        or toxicity in renal transplant recipients has been        infrequently reported     in contrast to its        occurrence in kidney donors      Because many        medications used by transplant recipients can be toxic it        might be expected that renal transplant recipients would        have a higher risk of poisonings than the general        population especially in the first posttransplant year        when dosages of immunosuppressive medications are usually        at their highest Analysis of the incidence and causes of        poisonings represents an opportunity to explore the        frequency and risk factors for medical errors since many        such complications may be avoidable The impact of        hospitalized poisonings on subsequent survival after renal        transplantation has also not been assessed Therefore we        analyzed national diata from the USRDS report Our        objectives were to determine the risk factors for and        mortality associated with hospitalized poisonings after        renal transplantation                    Methods                  Patient population          This study used data from the United States Renal Data          System USRDS using standard analysis files SAFs as          of May  The variables included in the USRDS standard          analysis files SAFs as well as data collection          methods and validation studies are listed at the USRDS          website under Researchers Guide to the USRDS          Database Section E Contents of all the SAFs          httpwwwusrdsorgand published in the USRDS The          demographics of the renal transplant population have been          previously described  USRDS report SAFTXUNOS was          used as the primary dataset and merged with variables          from SAFHOSP for hospitalization data and SAFPATIENTS          for dates and causes of death as well as causes of renal          disease as previously reported       Patient          characteristics and treatment factors were those at the          date of transplant Recipients of organs other than          kidneys were excluded                          Outcome definition          We conducted an historical cohort study of the          incidence risk factors and associated patient survival          for hospitalized cases of poisonings based on          International Classification of Diseasesth Modification          Diagnosis Codes ICD xx as a primary          discharge diagnosis in renal transplant recipients Only          the primary discharge diagnosis was used to ensure these          were active diagnoses ie to exclude diagnoses with          history of poisonings These diagnoses include          potential overdoses for heroin but not for cocaine or          other illicit drugs These diagnoses also include most          known causes of environmental exposures including          minerals pesticides vaccinations miscellaneous          chemicals and certain foodstuffs The first          hospitalization for poisonings after the first renal          transplant for a given individual occurring on or after           July  and before  July  which could include a          repeat transplant with followup time truncated at three          years was counted in analysis Hospitalizations were          chosen because they were more accessible in the database          and less subject to interpretation than outpatient cases          of poisonings especially since the USRDS database has no          information on confirmatory studies Hospitalization data          for transplant recipients may be unreliable after the          patient has survived   years post transplant when          hospitalization reporting to Medicare for patients           years or younger is no longer required However Medicare          reporting starts immediately after transplant regardless          of preceding dialysis status All hospitalizations with a          primary discharge diagnosis for poisonings were extracted          from SAFHOSP merged with the transplant file and          hospitalizations outside the range of the study period          were excluded Hospitalizations for poisonings occurring          at any time after renal transplant including after graft          failure censored for patient death were counted in          analysis                          Variables used in analysis          The independent associations between patient factors          and hospitalizations for poisonings were examined using          multivariate analysis with stepwise Cox Regression          likelihood ratio method including recipient and donor          age recipient race gender weight pretransplant          dialysis yesno year of transplant duration of          dialysis prior to transplantation total followup time          repeat transplant donor cytomegalovirus serology          dialysis in the first week after transplant delayed          graft function yesno rejection diagnosis or          treatment occurring during the first six months after          transplant induction antibody therapy maintenance          immunosuppressive medications at time of discharge after          transplant surgery graft loss analyzed as a          timedependent covariate as previously described             and cause of ESRD diabetes systemic lupus erythematosus          because of the potential effect of corticosteroid          therapy prior to renal transplantation hypertension and          glomerulonephritis Episodes of rejection were not          restricted to those occurring in the first year in          contrast to studies of allograft function since there is          no evidence that late vs early rejection has a          different impact on poisonings The total cumulative dose          of prednisone was not available in the USRDS Both the          USRDS and UNOS track the numbers of days of prednisone          administered prior to initial hospital discharge however          values were missing for  of patients in both          databases and could not be used as a covariate in the          above analyses Maintenance immunosuppressive medication          use at the time of discharge after transplantation was          also analyzed as a preexisting covariate Information on          use of medications other than immunosuppressive          medications alcohol tobacco or radiologic procedures          was not available                          Survival times          We defined patient survival times as the time from          when patients had their first renal transplant during the          study period to the time of death or most recent          followup date which was considered May  For time          to poisonings survival time was defined as the time from          first renal transplant until hospitalization for          poisonings with patients censored at death loss to          followup or end of the study which was considered           December  since this was the most recent          hospitalization date The patient survival probabilities          were estimated by using the Kaplan Meier method                          Statistical analysis          All analyses were performed using SPSS  TM SPSS          Inc Chicago IL Files were merged and converted to          SPSS files using DBMSCopy Conceptual Software Houston          TX Univariate analysis was performed with Chisquare          testing for categorical variables and Students twosided          ttest for continuous variables Variables with p            in univariate analysis for a relationship with          development of hospitalization for poisonings were          entered into multivariate analysis as covariates          KaplanMeier analysis was used to construct survival          plots of time to hospitalized poisonings after renal          transplantation Loglog plots were inspected to assess          for proportionality of hazards over time Stepwise Cox          proportional hazards regression likelihood ratio method          was used to model the association of patient factors with          hospitalized poisonings In order to control for          misspecification errors a random sample of  of          patients was excluded from analysis and coefficients          estimated for this sample The sample was frozen and          coefficients estimated from the  sample Because          hospitalizations for poisonings were uncommon Poisson          Regression was used for validation using the GENLOG          approximation in SPSS In order to estimate the          association of hospitalizations with allcause mortality          Coxnonproportional hazards Regression was utilized          Times after hospitalization for poisonings were entered          as  all other times were entered as  as previously          described      Patients with missing information          for variables were excluded from the multivariate models          resulting in models smaller than the total population          Hierarchically wellformed models were used for the          assessment of interaction terms                                Results        There were  solitary renal transplant recipients        in the United States Renal Data System transplanted from         July  to  June  of whom  had complete        enough information to calculate survival times Mean        followup was    years median  years Of the        study population  recipients were hospitalized with a        primary discharge diagnosis of poisonings during the study        period with  total hospitalizations The cumulative        incidence of hospitalizations for poisonings during the        study period was  person years Primary diagnoses        for hospitalized poisonings are shown in Table  Suicide        was not listed as an eventual primary cause of death among        patients hospitalized for poisonings nor was attempted        suicide E Suicide and selfinflicted injuries by        cutting and piercing instrument or E unspecified        cause of suicide listed as a secondary or tertiary        discharge diagnosis among these patients The mean length        of stay for patients hospitalized for poisonings was           days range  days Among renal transplant        recipients with diabetes the most common cause of        hospitalized poisonings was insulinantidiabetic agents        while in patients who experienced allograft rejection the        most common cause of hospitalized poisonings was        immunosuppressive agents        The time to hospitalization for poisonings is shown in        Figure  As shown the risk of hospitalized poisonings        were highest in the first few months after renal        transplantation with a consistent risk afterward Figures        and show the time to hospitalization for poisoning        stratified by allograft rejection and body mass index        respectively In Figure  analysis was limited to patients        who survived at least  months after transplant In figure         the risk of poisonings for all transplant recipients was        similar for the first six months by both survival plots and        loglog plots Therefore since this violated the        proportional hazards assumption multivariate analysis was        also performed limited to patients who survived at least        six months after transplant        Characteristics of the study population including        results of both univariate and multivariate analysis are        shown in table  see additional file  In univariate        analysis factors associated with an increased risk of        hospitalized poisonings were low body mass index graft        loss cadaveric donor rejection within  months after        transplant and diabetes while male gender was associated        with reduced risk of poisoning In Cox Regression analysis        however the only two factors independently associated with        hospitalized poisoning were low body mass index and        allograft rejection There were no significant interactions        between covariates specifically no interactions between        maintenance or induction medications or between age and        body mass index In analysis limited to recipients age         and over low body mass index as assessed in Table  AHR          CI  p   and rejection AHR          CI  p   were again the only        factors significantly associated with hospitalized        poisonings        Additional file         Table         Click here for file        Mortality after hospitalizations for poisoning which        was constant over time is shown in Figure         Hospitalizations for poisonings were independently        associated with increased mortality in Cox Regression AHR          CI  p                      Discussion        The present study demonstrated that almost all        hospitalizations for poisonings after renal transplantation        were due to the use of prescription medications even        though ICD codes x also include poisonings from        environmental toxins vaccines and anesthetic agents        Because many immunosuppressive medications are toxic this        was not a surprising finding However reports from the        medical literature have been infrequent as indicated        previously In fact a Medline search for the terms        medication error transplant yielded only  papers            and none was returned for the search medication error        renal transplant Therefore review of the medical        literature might give a misleading indication of the        frequency of this complication Although reported        hospitalizations for poisonings as a primary diagnosis were        not common hospitalizations for poisonings were        independently associated with increased mortality in renal        transplant recipients and also represented potentially        avoidable morbidity with a mean length of stay of over         days        Antineoplasticimmunosuppressive agents were the most        common cause of poisonings in this population as would be        expected The current study almost certainly underestimates        the incidence of serious immunosuppressive drug toxicity in        this population In addition renal transplant recipients        have many potential indications for the use of        analgesicsantipyretics postoperative pain among them            The frequent occurrence of poisonings due to        analgesics after renal transplantation may therefore seem        understandable However although the risk of poisonings        was highest in the first few months after transplantation        the increase in relative risk in this time was not visually        remarkable Figure  and the risk of poisoning continued        in a constant fashion after transplant There was certainly        no early peak followed by a dramatic stabilization in rates        of poisonings as has been demonstrated for        hospitalizations for cytomegalovirus disease           contrary to what might have been expected This suggests        the possibility that either the dosing or use of these        medications may not be adjusted optimally after renal        transplantation        Benzodiazepinestranquilizers were the third most common        cause of poisonings in this study It is noteworthy that        calcineurin inhibitor toxicity may mimic anxiety or        nervousness    which are common indications for the        use of benzodiazepines In addition many antidepressive        agents may raise levels of calcineurin inhibitors            Results of the present study raise the possibility that        indications for treatment with benzodiazepines may actually        represent toxicities of calcineurin antagonists which        might be best managed by adjusting the dose of the        calcineurin inhibitors Until then we would suggest that        the possibility of other drug toxicities including drug        interactions be thoroughly excluded before prescribing        benzodiazepines in this population Often overlooked is the        effect of erratic compliance with azole antifungals        anticonvulsants or other medications that inhibit or induce        calcineurin inhibitors        The high frequency of poisonings due to        insulinantidiabetic agents is also not surprising given        the high frequency of diabetes among renal transplant        recipients although diabetes was not an independent risk        factor for poisonings in the present analysis This        suggests that diabetic transplant recipients should be        monitored with particularly close attention perhaps in        concert with regular visits with a pharmacist    or as        part of a disease management program to reduce medical        errors            Considering that almost all causes of hospitalized        poisonings after renal transplantation were attributed to        prescription medications the risk factors for hospitalized        poisonings in the present study namely allograft rejection        and low body mass index are all the more remarkable The        significance of a low body mass index as an independent        risk factor for poisonings in this analysis as a risk        factor for hospitalized poisonings independent of age        suggests the possibility of suboptimal dose adjustment of        medications This particularly applies to calcineurin        inhibitors which are lipid soluble and have a large volume        of distribution Most calcineurin inhibitors are initiated        adjusted for patient weight However in a small percentage        of patients currently recommended doses may still result in        toxicity Areaunderthecurve monitoring gives an estimate        of total drug exposure and may help minimize toxicity        particularly in patients with unusual clinical responses to        standard dosing     It would be useful to test this        hypothesis in future studies        The association of poisonings with allograft rejection        in this category of patients may represent toxicity due to        bolus intravenous or high dose oral corticosteroid therapy        or significant drugdrug interactions in this setting        which the database could not determine However the        findings of the present analysis suggest a need for        providers nationally to reevaluate the use of        immunosuppressive agents in a systematic fashion after        transplantation The management of renal transplant        patients is certainly not uniform in some centers the        primary transplant surgeon may continue management of the        patient up to a year or more after transplant while in        other centers a nephrologist or even primary care physician        may assume primary management of the patient after the        first transplant month It is possible that more        standardized guidance on dosing and the possibility of drug        interactions would be beneficial Currently there are no        clinical practice guidelines on the dosing of transplant        related medications although certain institutional        guidelines do exist            The present study is limited by use of primary        hospitalization diagnoses for outcomes The true frequency        of poisonings and medication errors in the renal transplant        population is most likely underestimated Because of the        studys retrospective nature many other factors could not        be validated Patients with multiple potential causes for        admission may not have been included among patients with        hospitalized poisonings However the study is population        based and because accurate coding for hospitalization        discharge is required is likely to be less subject to        reporting bias than case reports of poisonings in the        medical literature        The present study could not determine the reason for        poisonings In short the possibilities of patient error        vs provider error could not be distinguished However        consultation with pharmacists may reduce both            Given the looming shortage of nephrologists    nurses        and other medical providers    multiple safeguards        need to be established to minimize the possibility of error        as much as possible in these complex and challenging        patients This is particularly true given the significant        associations of both body mass index and allograft        rejection with hospitalized poisonings in this analysis        which may indicate that more complex and individualized        methods of medication dosing may be necessary after renal        transplantation than are currently used The present study        identifies specific targets for investigation and        improvement                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        Kevin C Abbott conceived the study
