 well do you have any uh television programs that you watch regularly oh this is kind of tough i don t too often watch you know shows that are on on a regular basis uh huh i don t have a lot of time and i don t really like some of them to tell you the truth i mean i don t think they have any redeeming value no but uh oh i watch things like uh Sixty Minutes every week uh uh huh ooh it s kind of tough to think of some of the others although i do watch some of some of those frivolous things uh like on Thursday nights at nine o clock when i get home from aerobics i will watch uh Knots Landing oh you will yeah just something like that for you know uh end of the evening type of thing but uh relax how about you well i watch um i like news programs like you mentioned and sometimes i will watch um like the cable news network evening news program um yeah i don t get that so i don t have that choice yeah i i like that i i watch that a couple of times a week um it comes on like at nine o clock at night and i really don t have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly i i have seen that um uh huh Murphy Brown that comes on Monday nights before and it s kind of cute and but i don t uh huh yeah yeah there s a couple of those i ve seen once in a while uh i can t think of the name of the one that has the uh military uh huh uh fellow i mean he s playing a military part he s the husband of the girl on Designing Women oh the uh huh right i know who you re talking about i haven t i have seen it i think maybe once yeah you know it was it was on one time when i saw it and you know it it s pretty cute i like that well i um i we really don t watch too many programs regularly my children like some of the morning children s shows when they re home they um i just have one son who s in kindergarten so in the morning they will like to watch like um yeah Eureka s Castle it s called it s just like a Sesame Street show but uh huh and they watch a couple of shows like that but i don t watch any daytime TV at all yeah no i don t and uh i guess uh there s some uh things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly uh huh on Saturdays they have uh a variety of things uh and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time but uh uh huh they have programs on uh house repairs and how to build things and um they have a calligraphy show and i do calligraphy so i watch that oh oh that s nice and um they have a lot of cooking shows uh huh and oh you know i ll just sort of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those i don t sit and watch them but but i enjoy some of it and especially if i m uh cooking on a Saturday evening or something and one of those is on it kind of inspires me that sounds like a good idea i notice that um since we moved here that we we did get the cable TV and when the newspaper comes out on Sunday i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed uh huh and i record some and then uh we have just totally cut down and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there s always plenty of things that we can record and then watch and then record over it something else yeah and so that s been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved yeah we do some of that in i m fact i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on TV than you know other kinds of things uh huh well that s probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies yes that i have really enjoyed that i m seeing for the first time like the Marx Brothers and things like that yeah yeah those are pretty good i i like those old ones much better than some of the new stuff uh huh right and so we we have really enjoyed that and it s really nice not to be running out some of the video rentals can be expensive and yeah well going to the movie can be unbelievable and um hum right going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something so we i have and it s so convenient at home and you can do it anytime you you take the notion yeah and so i have really enjoyed that but but there are i do have friends that watch programs like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it they have some programs that they won t miss uh huh i m not that hung up on most things i mean if i miss something big deal yes well and things are repeated yeah that s true so often that you know if if i have seen just a program once chances are it ll be that exact same show if i ever decide to tune it in again yeah yeah the only one i ve ever seen and it ll be showing again pretty funny yep but uh TV is something that we try to not um deliberately try not to get hung up on it like you say yeah we do too it too many other things to do and too much going on um hum and we don t want our kids to to grow up thinking that that s what you do with your spare time right i agree so it s a little bit something we try doing and there s there s a lot of good children s programs that you could watch they could watch several hours every day uh huh and you could say oh that s a good program for them because it s educational but still you want them to go out and do other things even if they re good programs you don t want them sitting there watching them right yeah anyway well okay well we probably exhausted that huh yeah that was pretty good i i like that and um i guess it s time to go okay i enjoyed talking to you yes nice to have spoken with you too bye b ye okay good bye
