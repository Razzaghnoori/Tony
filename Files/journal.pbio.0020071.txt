                            Evolution is a complex phenomenon that requires a broad understanding of many areas of        biology for us to appreciate it fully Moreover the field has expanded rapidly especially        since the development of molecular techniques in the past two to three decades Futuymas        classic text on evolution  contains  chapters totaling  pages To cover the        topic in only eight chapters and  pages as the Charlesworths have done in         Evolution A Very Short Introduction  is no mean feat        Their book is one of a series of short introductions published by Oxford University        Press covering an eclectic array of subjects that aim to provide an accessible yet        stimulating read for anyone wanting a thorough introduction to a topic In this small        volume the Charlesworths have succeeded on both fronts and provide an excellent account of        the core issues for a broad range of readers One of the reasons for the books appeal is        that the authors draw on a range of carefully chosen human traits to illustrate their        points By contrast most evolutionary textbooks other than those purely on human        evolution tend to focus on nonhuman organisms As with traits in every other organism        many human and humanrelated characteristics have evolved via genetic drift and natural        selection and they provide an effective means of convincing readers of the reality and        relevance of evolution For example to explain how mutation can cause the loss of a        function the authors discuss the relatively poor sense of smell in humans as compared        with many other mammals using an example of a vestigial pseudogene of a human olfactory        receptor gene They also discuss tooth decay enzyme aesthetics heritable differences        cancer and other diseases and the ability to taste and so on        Although the topics the Charlesworths choose to focus on are certainly appropriate they        provide only a brief mention of one important processdevelopment Evolutionary        developmental biology is a burgeoning field that can provide interesting and important        insights into our understanding of the mechanisms of evolution For example the absence of        eyes in cavefish rather than being the result of a degenerative process might be the        result of selection on genes that govern feeding morphology a selection process that has        included suppression of eye development Pennisi  Such developmental mechanisms and        constraints can actually alter the direction of evolution Although the key forces driving        evolution are usually thought of as mutation genetic drift natural selection and        divergence the developmental pathways from genes to phenotypes along with associated        developmental constraints can also determine the rate and direction of evolution        In Chapter  the authors discuss five topics that have traditionally been hard to        understand from an evolutionary point of view These difficult problems are ageing        altruism human consciousness complex adaptations and the origin of living cells        Difficult problems can be interpreted in two ways those that although hard to solve have        either been explained or will eventually be explained by modern evolutionary theories and        those problems that cannot be fully resolved with our current understanding but leave room        for learning about additional mechanisms or factors The Charlesworths generally consider        only those problems of the former typethe explained ones However I think that some of        the more intractable problems should be described in more detail For instance complex        adaptation might be fully explained by mutations and natural selection but additional        unknown mechanisms might be essential for the evolution of the complex traits I realize        that opponents of modern evolutionary theory such as creationists have often cited these        traditional problems to support their conclusion that modern evolutionary theory is wrong        but progress always depends on the consideration of new ideas and there might be important        mechanisms still to be discovered that play a key role in evolution Describing potentially        intractable problems might also spur on young readers who are thinking of studying        evolutionary biology with the hope that there are still some theoretical battles to be        conquered        Who is the target audience of this book For many books the topics chosen and the        writing style can perhaps provide clues to the nature of the readers For instance         The Blind Watchmaker by Richard Dawkins  is a good introductory        book for those interested in natural selection because it seems to be written mainly for        individuals who either oppose or do not understand the role of natural selection In the        Charlesworths book providing evidence for evolution occupies  of the  pages They        explain how the similarities between living creatures can be understood in terms of        evolution Chapter  and subsequently discuss evidence from the geographical distributions        of living and fossil species Chapter  My first impression was that this part occupies        too large a proportion of the book However Chapter  serves as a good introduction to the        basic background of biology such as the gene DNA and cells When I read a recent article        about a teaching controversy concerning evolution Scott and Branch  I began to        appreciate the importanceat least in the United Kingdom and the United Statesof        convincing readers of the reality and cogency of evolution and evolution theory by astutely        providing them with the evidence to judge for themselves        In Japan there seem to be few people who deny the facts of evolution although there        are many ideologically motivated books opposing natural selection and Darwinism To        convince creationists of evolution is usually extremely difficult if not impossible        because they will never doubt their assumption that God created humankind Education of        young and curious people however can make a difference This is where I think the book        will be most successful but this book should not just be limited to young peopleI can        recommend it to anyone who wants to know about evolution Moreover I can recommend it to        Japanese students not only as an introduction to evolution but also as an exercise in        reading a wellwritten and engaging English text
