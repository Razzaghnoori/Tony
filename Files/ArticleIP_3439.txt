 Turn Counterturn Stand By Stanley Plumly posted Wednesday Aug 19 1998 To hear the poet read Turn Counterturn Stand click He s dressed like a patient naked to the waist in bottoms like pajamas And hooked by invisible wire to a monitor hooked to an amplifier All of this on stage like intensive care the badge of his connection at the center of his chest recording and rendering his pulse His heart is the dancer and its muscle the music that rises and subsides each searching step each turn each somersault and curl each sudden rest Baryshnikov is fifty but older paler resurrected in the lights You hear his heart literally leap in the machine magnified midair He won t come down then all at once he will When I bend to hear my parents hearts or lean against a wall to hear my friend s it s like water in a shell held tightly to the ear salt blood and ocean emptiness and wind vena cavae almost still The last thing you want to hear is the sound of your own worn heart It has a signature a rhythm a silence like your voice or fingerprint the heartline of the graph the abstract of a mountain range or large waves coming in repeated and repeated and repeated a child s idea of drawing a child s obsessive dance or nursery rhyme yet years and years of listening to this child who will not change but does When I remember what it was like to see them in the wards impaled in bed and wired every orifice acknowledged every innocence corrupted and exposed when I think of the awful trembling passed by hand the dry white chemical breath of what was said the skeletal skin so ghostly it seemed they d already gone that God in His Mercy had pulled their sick hearts out bled them drained them kissed the dead weight from the bones that I was looking at myself in rags that were my parents when I think of them I think of my friend with no one there those hours no one to witness no one to take his pulse no one to talk or listen no one to cross his heart
