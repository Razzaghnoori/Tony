 Growing Pains That s My Boy produced by Saatchi Saatchi Advertising for Adult Tylenol The strategy animating That s My Boy produced by Saatchi Saatchi Advertising for Adult Tylenol is simple Capitalize on the clich d but timely football motif to appeal directly to the men among the 129 million viewers of the Super Bowl broadcast At the same time reach out to women who buy the pills and stock the medicine cabinet by cleverly deconstructing the macho stereotype so that it becomes familiar funny The idea seems to have worked The ad emerged as one of the Super Bowl broadcast s 10 most successful according to USA Today s people meter a hand held dial that registered the second by second reaction of a sample of 139 consumers And it fared particularly well with women who placed it in the top five The spot opens with an overweight father clearly looking to realize his old dreams vicariously through his son Dad knows that the key to success lies in the early start he did not get that only the savvy fledgling gets the worm So he s willing to go to bat for his boy Now we got a lot of work to do before the next game he tells the perfectly and expensively attired aspirant But I m with you His support the son s almost weary OK Dad suggests is a dubious privilege The second scene shows Dad holding the ball for a place kick The setting complete with Norman Rockwell backyard and white picket fence is perfect It invites nostalgia stirs memories of The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet or for parents born a generation later The Partridge Family when ouch Junior s mighty kick makes sharp contact with Dad s foot Undaunted the self appointed coach keeps his post showing his charge how to throw the ball then going out for a pass I m open he yells Sure he is there s no one else on the field But wait here s a hedge scourge of the less than fleet of foot Awkward klutzy Dad trips As before it s the father who s been hurt the son who expresses concern Dad you OK The father s response Yeah fine when he s clearly not and the next two scenes a flurry of action then a shot of him flat on his face suddenly clarify the spot s real target It s the woman of course who seeing her own frustrated sportsman in the prone figure on the field smiles as she turns up the dial on the ad meter She knows that Dad will try something he shouldn t that he will stub his toe that he will complain and that she will have to give him something to stop the pain The rout continues a blind side tackle eliciting a wheezy Nice tackle son followed by a close up of the clearly pumped up kid The duo runs toward us with Dad puffing struggling to keep up then finally gesturing for a timeout We get a commercial break within the commercial the voice over telling us that the best moments in life sometimes come with a few aches and pains A shot of the Tylenol box and a glass of water accompanies the first mention of the product The contrast with past aspirin and Tylenol ads is striking No pain wracked headache sufferers here No irradiative blue waves pulsating to pounding music This is a happy ad for a pain reliever so effective that as we see in the next scenes it can help you smile through a broken arm And for all the kidding he s taken Dad gets his payoff The scene moves to the real world of real players and real coaches and our footballer still wearing his No 11 jersey seems to be holding his own Your little guy s looking pretty good out there says an approving coach The dad is studiously blas Yeah well he says We ve been practicing The game over father and son walk away from us satisfied The little guy in the big shirt gets a pat on the head from Dad Hey that was a good game buddy The Tylenol name appears at the bottom of the screen in a strong but unobtrusive red A perfect end to a perfect day Dad s been injured sure but his pride is intact his love for his son papering over his shortcomings as a coach Mom s still smiling struck by the warmth and familiarity of this scene and the ad makers hope she s still turning up the dials and buying up the Tylenol Robert Shrum
