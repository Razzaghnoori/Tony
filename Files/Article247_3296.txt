 ER Authoritarian and Aristocratic Dear Marjorie At the risk of letting you lure me into a very old argument I d say Eleanor was a force for ill Not great ill and not unmixed ill but ill mostly in that she helped establish the modern social compact under which citizens trade freedom or as Cook puts it freedom for security The balance sheet gets complicated if you think as I do that a lot of her most noble goals such as racial integration would have happened anyway and consider that a lot of her least noble ones such as disarmament on the verge of World War II were never achieved What tips the balance for me is that Eleanor was a far more authoritarian figure than Cook lets on Granted paternalism was in the air Churchill too urged that we treat the jobless man like a patient in hospital Cook says Eleanor resented it when people compared Roosevelt to a dictator and treats all complaints about Franklin s dictatorial ambitions as cynical rabble rousing meant to protect private interests Maybe at times But Frank Freidel says that in an era that saw the rise of Hitler and Mussolini fears of Roosevelt as an elected dictator while ultimately misplaced were understandable even healthy in a democracy He adds that during the Hundred Days Mrs Roosevelt lamented that the nation lacked a benevolent dictator to force through reforms Ninety percent of what politicians do is self actualization Some make things better some make things worse most do both but that s a secondary project And that s why I don t exactly fault Hillary for her bad luck in ruling in good times which makes a lot of her rhetoric as you say inappropriate She would have been more Eleanor like during a depression and Eleanor would have been more Hillary like during a boom What makes Eleanor s growing love of power so fascinating and troublesome is that it had to be wielded with either extreme ingenuousness or extreme disingenuousness and it s hard to figure out which Eleanor s instincts were aristocratic She ushered in or more accurately restored an era in which political power was seized not through backroom deals and exchanges of money but through cause based kudos accumulation The fact that she gave to charity the millions she made as a radio star does not to my mind exempt her from the charge of Gingrichian buck raking You cannot lament as Cook does America s stingy attitude toward the nation s neglected and rejected people without asking Eleanor to open up her own books You cannot carp as Eleanor did about privileges of race and gender without begging the question of your own megaprivileges land family connections fame not to mention having a husband who s president The latifundium on the Hudson the Astor and Morgan relatives Eleanor enlisted to bankroll her schemes the yearly visits to Newport to which Eleanor was hardly pace Cook dragged kicking and screaming the government and charity connections that allowed her Val Kill furniture company to break even what would Eleanor have been without them As for money Eleanor said If you could give it all where it would do the most good that would be grand but we can t always do that I m with her I m with her But the moment she berates the privilege of those who couldn t afford to make a down payment on her carriage house or invokes the greed of those making 125 percent of the mean per capita income I m with Hick who said to Eleanor during a White House dinner God damn it none of us ought to be wearing velvet dinner gowns these days Best Chris
