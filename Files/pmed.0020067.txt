 Introduction In 1962 Norman Stoll the distinguished Rockefeller Institute scientist who helped to establish human parasitology research in North America described the unique health impact of hookworm as follows 1 As it was when I first saw it so it is now one of the most evil of infections Not with dramatic pathology as are filariasis or schistosomiasis but with damage silent and insidious Now that malaria is being pushed back hookworm remains the great infection of mankind In my view it outranks all other worm infections of man combined in its production frequently unrealized of human misery debility and inefficiency in the tropics Like many other global disease experts who witnessed dramatic reductions in malaria prevalence as a result of DDT spraying during the late 1950s 2 Stoll did not anticipate malaria s imminent re emergence in India However he articulated with eloquence the magnitude of the disease burden resulting from hookworm infection He further offered the silent and insidious character of hookworm as a partial explanation for its neglect by the global medical community This neglect subsequently intensified during the 1970s 1980s and 1990s with the omission of hookworm from the list of diseases covered by the World Health Organization s Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Hookworm has proven to be extremely difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of poverty and poor sanitation Diseases as well as from other global health initiatives Over the last ten years however there has been increasing recognition of the global health importance of hookworm Today new international efforts to control the morbidity of hookworm and other soil transmitted helminth infections are in progress www who int wormcontrol Etiology and Global Distribution Human hookworm infection is caused by blood feeding nematode parasites of the genus Ancylostoma and the species Necator americanus Worldwide N americanus is the predominant etiology of human hookworm infection whereas A duodenale occurs in more scattered focal environments 3 These two hookworms together with the roundworm Ascaris lumbricoides and the whipworm Trichuris trichiura are often referred to collectively as soil transmitted helminths STHs No international surveillance mechanisms are in place to determine the prevalence and global distribution of hookworm infection However based on an extensive search of the literature since 1990 the worldwide number of cases of hookworm was recently estimated to be 740 million people 4 The highest prevalence of hookworm occurs in sub Saharan Africa and eastern Asia Figure 1 High transmission defined below also occurs in other areas of rural poverty in the tropics including southern China 5 the Indian subcontinent 6 and the Americas 7 In all regions there is a striking relationship between hookworm prevalence and low socioeconomic status Figure 2 4 Hookworm s neglected status partly reflects its concentration among the world s poorest 2 7 billion people who live on less than 2 a day Clinical Features Epidemiology and Disease Burden Hookworm infection is acquired by invasion of the infective larval stages through the skin A duodenale larvae are also orally infective Following host entry the larvae undergo a journey through the vasculature then the lungs and other tissues before they enter the gastrointestinal tract and molt twice to become one centimeter long adult male and female worms 3 The worms mate and the female hookworms produce up to 30 000 eggs per day which exit the host s body in the feces Figure 3 Because hookworms do not replicate in humans the morbidity of hookworm is highest among patients that harbor large numbers of adult parasites Estimates of the intensity of hookworm infection are typically obtained by using quantitative fecal egg counts as a surrogate marker for worm burden The World Health Organization defines moderate intensity infections as those with 2 000 3 999 eggs per gram of feces and heavy intensity infections as those with 4 000 or more eggs per gram p 26 in 8 Compared to other STH infections and schistosomiasis hookworm infection exhibits a unique age intensity profile whereas the intensities for the former peak in childhood and adolescence hookworm intensity usually either steadily rises in intensity with age or plateaus in adulthood 3 9 The biological basis for this observation is unknown 10 Adult hookworms cause morbidity in the host by producing intestinal hemorrhage 3 The adult hookworms then ingest the blood rupture the erythrocytes and degrade the hemoglobin 11 Therefore the disease attributed to hookworm is silent blood loss leading to iron deficiency anemia and protein malnutrition There is a correlation between parasite intensity and host intestinal blood loss 12 in children women of reproductive age and other populations with low iron stores there is often a correlation between parasite intensity and reductions in host hemoglobin 3 12 13 14 15 16 In children chronic heavy intensity infections are associated with growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments in pregnant women they are associated with adverse maternal fetal outcomes 3 12 13 14 15 16 When measured in disability adjusted life years the global disease burden from hookworm exceeds all other major tropical infectious diseases with the exception of malaria leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis pp 192 193 in 17 In addition hookworm has been associated with impaired learning increased absences from school and decreased future economic productivity 18 Therefore like other neglected diseases chronic infection with hookworm promotes long term disability and increases the likelihood that an afflicted population will remain mired in poverty Hookworm Control Strategies Because of its high transmission potential hookworm has proven to be extremely difficult to eliminate or eradicate in areas of poverty and poor sanitation 19 Indeed in the absence of comprehensive economic development the impact of sanitation footwear and health education has been minimal 19 Control efforts have therefore shifted to reducing morbidity through mass treatment also known as deworming of affected populations with anthelminthic drugs 19 Although benzimidazoles BZAs are the most commonly used agents for treating STH infections levamisole and pyrantel may also be used in some circumstances Periodic and repeated deworming with BZAs and praziquantel complemented by basic sanitation and adequate safe water is considered the most cost effective means to control the morbidity caused by STH and schistosome infections 19 20 21 22 Efforts led by the World Health Organization have focused on annual twice yearly or thrice yearly doses in schools because the heaviest intensities of STH infections are most commonly encountered in school age children 23 Among the health benefits of periodic deworming of schoolchildren are improvements in iron and hemoglobin status physical growth and fitness and cognition 20 21 22 23 In addition there are important externalities including improvements in education and reduced community based transmission of ascaris and trichuris infections 23 Accordingly at the 54th World Health Assembly in 2001 a resolution was passed urging member states to attain a minimum target of regular deworming of at least 75 and up to 100 of all at risk school age children by 2010 20 23 Developing a New Control Tool The Na ASP 2 Hookworm Vaccine Deworming satisfies a number of United Nations Millennium Development Goals including those related to poverty reduction child health and education However there are also several reasons to believe that the school based deworming programs could have less of an impact on the control of morbidity from hookworm than from other STH and schistosome infections 3 As noted above heavy intensity hookworm infections are common among both adults and children so school based programs would not be expected to have an impact on hookworm transmission in the community 24 School based programs are also not likely to affect either preschool children or pregnant women despite evidence for the health benefits from BZAs in both populations 16 25 Finally a single dose of mebendazole one of the two major BZAs has variable efficacy against hookworm 26 and following treatment hookworm reinfection to pre treatment levels can occur within 4 12 months 27 This and the observation that the efficacy of mebendazole against hookworm can diminish with frequent and repeated use has prompted concerns about the possible emergence of BZA resistance 28 As a complementary strategy the Human Hookworm Vaccine Initiative HHVI is developing a safe efficacious and cost effective vaccine the Na ASP 2 Hookworm Vaccine that would provide an additional tool for the control of hookworm 29 30 The HHVI is a non profit partnership comprising research process development vaccine manufacturing and control and pre clinical and clinical testing units at the George Washington University London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Oswaldo Cruz Foundation FIOCRUZ and sponsored by the Sabin Vaccine Institute www sabin org The HHVI selected the hookworm larval antigen ASP 2 ancylostoma secreted protein 2 based on studies that 1 identified the molecule as a protective antigen linked to earlier generation irradiated infective larval vaccines 29 2 determined a relationship between human anti ASP 2 antibodies and reduced risk of heavy hookworm infection in populations living in hookworm endemic regions of Brazil and China 30 J Bethony A Loukas M J Smout S Brooker S Mendez et al unpublished data and 3 confirmed the ability of recombinant ASP 2 to partially protect laboratory animals against larval hookworm challenges 30 31 32 Process development cGMP manufacture and control and pre clinical testing of Na ASP 2 from N americanus were completed in 2004 Figure 4 Pending United States Food and Drug Administration approval clinical testing of the vaccine will take place in 2005 The Na ASP 2 Hookworm Vaccine will be developed almost entirely in the non profit sector Ultimately the vaccine will be indicated for the active immunization of susceptible individuals against moderate and heavy necator infection Vaccination would reduce the number of hookworm infective larvae entering the gastrointestinal tract thereby reducing the number of adult worms and the fecal egg counts in individuals exposed to the larvae Hookworm as a Model Because immunization would only affect hookworm larvae and not adult hookworms already residing in the gastrointestinal tract of infected individuals the first dose of the vaccine would be administered following deworming Therefore use of the vaccine could build on the infrastructures developed as part of school based programs Given that hookworm afflicts only the world s most impoverished a major hurdle for the development of the Na ASP 2 Hookworm Vaccine is its small commercial market Innovative financing mechanisms must be considered to produce this orphan biologic Towards that end the HHVI has partnered with manufacturers in hookworm endemic middle income countries that would commit to industrial scale up of the Na ASP 2 Hookworm Vaccine pending proof of principle for its efficacy This approach might help to inform the development of business models for the production and distribution of orphan biologics for other neglected diseases
