 ITALY AND THE ITALIANS From the Alps down to the southern tip of Sicily Italy provides the most tangible proof that the world is indeed a wonderous stage Architects and sculptors treat the myriad parks and gardens as set designs and nature turns the landscapes replete with statuesque cypresses tortuous olive and fig trees and rows of vineyards into so many artful backdrops for the daily brio and histrionics of la vita italiana In the cities the cathedrals palazzos monumental public buildings and open air piazzas are planned as if harmonious elements in unrivalled stagesets Venice s dazzling basilica the Doges Palace Palazzo Ducale and the 500 year old Clock Tower Torre dell Orologio all within the sprawling Piazza San Marco and adjacent Piazzetta are the very focus of the city s life The same is true of Rome s grand piazzas Navona del Popolo and di Spagna Siena s unique Campo and Florence s elegant Piazza della Signoria Conceived as a theater and emphasizing the decorative space as much as the buildings surrounding it the piazza satisfies the need of Mediterranean peoples to conduct their lives in the open air And we mustn t overlook the players In each town at that magic moment of the passeggiata at the end of each afternoon they stroll across the piazza find themselves a well placed seat at their favorite caf or stand in groups to argue business politics or soccer the latter tends to be the most popular subject Their celebrated gift for gesticulation aids the inherent air of drama that reassures them of the appreciation of their audience No people more joyfully live up to their legendary image than the Italians As Orson Welles put it all 58 odd million of them are actors with only a few bad ones and those he added most unfairly are found on the stage and in films Watch them at the wheel of a car Long ago driving became a major opportunity for the Italians to display their dramatic talents An Italian designer observed that a nation s cars are like its people Scandinavian and German models are solid strong and reliable built to resist an accident Italian cars tend to be more fragile but slick and spirited built to avoid an accident They are designed above all to indulge the national sense of style The imaginative flair of a Neapolitan taxi driver zig zagging out of a traffic jam forces the admiration of any nerve shattered back seat passenger In the purely visual sphere style has been a national preoccupation from the Renaissance masters such as Michelangelo and Leo nardo da Vinci to the grandiose cinematographic fantasies of Fellini and Visconti in the modern era It is evident not only in the splendor of the frescoes and monumental fountains but also in the dazzling design of a scarlet Lamborghini a coffee pot or a fountain pen The sartorially savvy man about town knows that good English tailoring and the textiles used are not only to be found on Saville Row but in the meticulous workshops of Milan Florence and Rome The fashion followers of the world have long been worshipping at the altar of Italy s high priests and priestesses unrivalled fashion houses and the generations old textile factories that supply them The world also stands in awe of Italian cuisine In the simplest trattoria or most elegant of restaurants the experience of your meal often begins before you sit down Not with the menu but with the magnificent display sprawled across a long table as you enter seafood antipasti stuffed eggplant and zucchini grilled peppers in red yellow and green and whatever bounty this morning s market yielded If you take a plane or train the length of the peninsula Italy offers yet another cornacopia of delights In the north the snowcapped Alps and jagged pink pinnacles of the Dolomites the gleaming Alpine backed lakes of Como Garda and Maggiore the fertile and industrial plain of the Po stretching from Turin and Milan across to ancient Verona the Palladian villa studded hills of Vicenza and the romantic canals of Venice On the west coast the Italian Riviera curves from San Remo to Viareggio on either side of the venerable port city of Genoa Behind the alternating rocky and sandy coastline from the marble quarries of Carrara the mountain chain of the Apennines reaches south into Tuscany where lie the ageless beauties of Pisa Lucca Florence and Siena not to mention the smaller and arguably more magical hillside towns of Montepulciano Volterra and San Gimignano Landlocked Umbria s rich green countryside surrounds a golden triangle of historic cities the Assisi of St Francis the noble university hillside town of Perugia and the medieval mountain post of Gubbio To the east the grand Byzantine citadel of Ravenna dominates the seaside resorts lining the Adriatic The Eternal City Rome lies halfway down the west coast For more than 26 centuries it has witnessed countless declines falls and rebirths and today continues to resist the assaults of brutal modernity in its time locked color rich historical center Another world unto itself the exhilarating chaos of Naples commands its magnificent bay the visible isles of Ischia and Capri and the ruins of Pompeii in the shadow of Vesuvius its still active volcano To the south the former fishing villages of Sorrento and Positano spill down the craggy cliffs of the serpentine Amalfi coast justifiably tauted as one of the world s most beautiful drives On the other side of the peninsula off the tourist track in the peninsula s heel are the curiously romantic landscapes of Puglia from its centuries old trulli constructions to the medieval fortresses of the German emperors Italy s western approaches are guarded by two of the Mediterranean s largest islands Sardinia and Sicily both rugged mysterious and steeped in history Smaller islands with fabled names such as Elba Stromboli and Lipari fill in the necklace of floating gems many reached only by boat where the lifestyle is that of the Mediterranean one hundred years ago The Italian people with Latins and Etruscans mixing over themillennia with Greeks Lombards Normans French and Spaniards are as fascinatingly diverse as this panoply of landscapes Each region sustains a solid and pugnacious local pride from historic division into the city states duchies kingdoms and republics of Florence Naples Venice Lombardy Piedmont and Sicily Nurtured within the geographical separations of the Alps the Po valley and the coasts on either side of the Apennines it was this very diversity that created the richness of Italian art and its competing regional schools of painting and architecture Significantly the move toward national unity in the 19th century coincided with a dramatic artistic decline from which the country is only now recovering Given its short history as a unified nation much of Italy s patriotic sense seems to be most visible in the national football soccer team After the devastating experience of Mussolini s fascism national government is rarely regarded as an obvious solution to the people s daily problems If some form of government proves necessary they prefer the local town hall to the parliament in Rome Most Italians are naturally cheerful and friendly towards foreigners In recent years there have been unprecedented numbers of immigrants from the Balkans Eastern Europe and Africa The Italians reserve their scorn for each other Venetians and Romans or Milanese and Neapolitans comically bemoan the new EU imposed automobile license plates that no longer designate the driver s origin It is not so easy to recognize the home town of a fellow driver Beyond the regional identifications the country remains divided culturally economically and psychologically between the prosperous industrial North and less developed South or Mezzogiorno Midday This division was perpetuated by centuries of feudal rule in Naples and Sicily while the North developed more progressive forms of economy and government The division has come almost to the point of regarding the South as Italy s own Third World as it offers a supply of cheap migrant labor But the warm hearted high spirited Neapolitans in no way feel themselves inferior to the cool pragmatic managerial types of the vibrant northern cities Italy s two halves come face to face in Turin where Fiat s automobile factories have for generations attracted thousands of workers from the Mezzogiorno Sociologists have noted that the transplanted southerners tend to support the populist Juventus football team owned by Fiat s Agnelli family while the other more bourgeois local team Torino is favored by the longer established Turin citizenry Foreign visitors are not obliged to take sides We are free to fall in love with the entire country and invariably do it s a glorious lifelong love affair FACTS AND FIGURES Geography The Italian landmass covers 301 245 sq km 116 228 sq miles The familiar boot like silhouette stretches 1 200 km 850 miles from the
