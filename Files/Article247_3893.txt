 Beyond the Valley of the IPOs Good guys and bad guys I hadn t thought about The New New Thing in those terms since it seemed to me that even though Clark had spats with various people and even though he looked at money people in particular as vermin all of them even the vermin were his co conspirators Everybody involved in this story was in this thing together thinking and acting in this new way trying to reinvent the business world and perhaps even trying to redefine the nature of capitalism itself Can you really generate a net worth of 2 3 billion without ever doing any work Certainly that has to rank as one of Jim Clark s more audacious experiments in capitalism Ultimately every character in the book is going to turn out to be a good guy or they re all going to turn out to be bad guys Let s remember again why we both thought so highly of The New New Thing It offers an astonishingly vivid description of what Silicon Valley is like at this moment in history From my vantage point on the East Coast it seems crazy out there and Lewis has that craziness nailed So let s suppose for a second that this this anarchy as Lewis calls it turns out to be the future of American business which of course is what most people in the Valley firmly believe If that turns out to be the case we re going to look back on this book 20 years from now and say Jim Clark and those guys in The New New Thing they showed us the way They are true heroes But now let s suppose that Silicon Valley at the millennium turns out to be what the 1960s were when we were in college an intoxicating flash in the pan That is all that Jim Clark style anarchy ultimately falls by the wayside much of the wealth evaporates and one day people wake up and wonder What were we thinking In that case we ll look back at The New New Thing and say What a bunch of idiots those guys were Couldn t they see that it was all about to collapse Weirdly and this is The New New Thing s real mark of greatness the book will hold up no matter how this story plays out There is no dissenter in The New New Thing no East Coast sage shaking his head sadly and warning that it is all going to turn out badly And that is perfectly appropriate for this book because there really is no dissent in the Valley But reading the book provoked in me at least the lingering thought that it can t last There is too much venture capital money chasing increasingly marginal business ideas as exemplified by Clark s going in to see John Doerr uttering one sentence and getting funding for MyCFO an idea that may or may not have merit As usual it s impossible to know from the scenes in The New New Thing There is an increasing lack of rigor in Internet startups Catch phrases such as business models which Lewis knowingly mocks have replaced actual business plans Nobody seems to even care about profits anymore All of these things can be found in The New New Thing You just have to come to the book predisposed to look for them Which I admit is my general bias Yes I believe the Internet will be huge and potentially transformative and might even make some companies profitable some day in the distant future But no I don t think what s going on in the Valley right now is sustainable What was that line you quoted In this new world skepticism was not a sign of intelligence It was a sin That s me a sinner Care to join me in hell
