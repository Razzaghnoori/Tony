 The Golden Fleece In the 1980s the spectrum of fabric quality ran from beloved natural fibers down to mediocre cotton poly blends then dipped into trashiness with pure polyester Today polyester fleece is the uniform of hikers climbers backpackers college kids and people who want to look like them As in the 70s you re nothing in the 90s if you re not in polyester preferably polyester from Patagonia The North Face Marmot REI or L L Bean Don t write this off as a mere fashion fad Polyester is undergoing a renaissance because fleece is truly a miracle fabric It s warm and durable but lightweight and it dries faster than natural fibers At the same time it feels natural to the touch not scratchy like the poly of yore And while fleece takes over the sweater and sweat shirt market other synthetic fabrics are horning in on the long underwear business with equally good reason Polypropylene and other newer polyester blends beat out cotton for keeping your skin dry and warm In short in high performance clothing fake is great Fleece is a 100 percent polyester fabric that s made like terry cloth First a machine knits the fleece leaving tiny loops on its surface then the fabric is treated in three ways 1 Napping Machines smack the fleece with tiny wires that break the loops 2 Combing The strands of fleece are groomed to stand up crew cut straight thereby creating air trapping space The trapped air creates warmth 3 Shearing The upright strands are shorn to a uniform height which stops the strands from getting tangled up like dreadlocks a problem that leads to pilling All this manufacturing goes on not at Patagonia or The North Face or any of their competitors these companies just design and sew the garments The fleece used in high end outdoor clothing is made by two textile firms Malden Mills and Dyersburg the Coke and Pepsi of fleece Malden Mills holds a near monopoly on high performance fleece to find out why it s a monopoly you can love click while Dyersburg feasts on the leftovers By all accounts both mills produce superb fabric So is all fleece basically the same It is if you re the kind of shopper who only buys premium brands Otherwise you have to contend with cheap Asian imports People I talked to at Malden and Dyersburg complained mightily about shoddy Asian fleece flooding the market and undercutting them In this case there s a good reason to buy American Most Asian fleece has been napped but it hasn t been combed or sheared Thus 1 Its subpar air trapping begets a pitiful warmth to weight ratio and 2 it tends to pill Some Asian fleece will even pill horrors before it leaves the sales rack You can test this by rubbing the fleece with your palm To be fair the Americans admit that Asian fleece has made great strides but the West is still best Asian fleece is mostly relegated to down market brands the name Kmart was floated by one Malden spokeswoman The top brands proudly announce that they use Malden trademark Polartec 100 200 or 300 or Dyersburg trademark E C O or Dyertech All except for Patagonia that is which pretends its Synchilla fleece is something else Despite costing more and supposedly being better Patagonia s fleece is from Malden and Dyersburg just like everyone else s If there s some other difference between them I don t know about it because despite many phone calls and e mails Patagonia refused to answer my questions on this point Why not buy the cheapest gear you can find that uses American fleece Because design makes a difference Compare Campmor s 60 Polartec 300 jacket with The North Face s 160 Denali jacket also featuring Polartec 300 Both use the same fabric Malden s excellent heaviest weight fleece There are three good reasons to pay 100 more for the Denali and one so so one 1 The Denali has a nylon shell over its torso improving wind resistance 2 The Denali has more pockets with zipper closures 3 The Denali has flaps behind the zippers in its armpit vents all high tech jackets have zippered armpit vents while the Campmor has no flaps so cold seeps through 4 The cool North Face logo and jacket cut will impress your gearhead friends more than the budget Campmor logo and cut To test the designs of these and two other popular fleece tops I went to Duke University s zoology department where many walk in refrigerators and freezers are to be found The entrants in my little competition were the Campmor the North Face the Marmot E C O vest 89 fleece made by Dyersburg from recycled plastic soda bottles and the Patagonia Synchilla Snap T 86 the it fleece of the prep school Phish fan set Duke s walk in fridge runs a cool 40 degrees Fahrenheit With a long sleeve polypropylene T shirt as a base layer more on that later I wore each fleece in the fridge for about 10 minutes The Marmot vest performed best keeping my torso toasty but of course leaving my arms quite cold The other fleeces would have been plenty warm during exercise but standing still I felt a bit chilly The North Face did a fine job here while the Campmor faced the aforementioned armpit zipper problem The Patagonia had two drawbacks While in calm conditions the Snap T was the warmest of the entrants it was especially nonwind resistant the fridge had a fan That was in part because it had no nylon lining but it was still less wind resistant than other competitors without a lining Also the Patagonia had no pockets for my hands a shocking oversight Next I ventured into the freezer a chilling minus 8 degrees Fahrenheit None of the fleeces came close to weathering this kind of cold An outer layer is clearly necessary in these conditions even when you re vigorously exercising which I tried to do in the freezer until I quickly became lightheaded from the icy air Overall winner The North Face Denali jacket with a great design but at 160 the highest price tag by far Sometimes you get what you pay for General conclusion Look for designs that minimize fleece s weaknesses Fleece s Achilles heel is that without a nylon coating it lacks any wind resistance a slight breeze that wool and cotton would turn back cuts right through fleece with a nasty bite Two other weaknesses of fleece to keep in mind 1 If you fall onto a nubby carpet while wearing fleece as I did intentionally the fleece gets irreparable bald spots at the impact points This is especially relevant to all the children s fleece being sold now tykes are prone to carpet falls 2 Fleece easily melts even when exposed for less than a second to the flame of a cigarette lighter The things to look for are a good fit an attractive look a nylon shell and ample and amply sized pockets Fleece makers offer a few other options Shearling fleece looks more like sheep s wool with a pebbly texture Instead of being sheared shearling s strands are coaxed into clumps Some think the resulting nooks create better insulation and wind resistance I didn t try shearling but no one I spoke with recommended it Another option is to blend spandex with fleece to make it stretchier and more form fitting Malden does this with its Powerstretch fabrics available in The North Face s Aurora vest among other products Now that fleece is the insulation of choice other fake fabrics have grown popular as base layers Synthetic long underwear used to be made of polypropylene some of it still is The advantage was that polypropylene dried much faster than cotton spreading sweat across the fabric to increase the sweat s surface area and speed up evaporation But the fabric has severe weaknesses as I found out from testing a Wickers brand long sleeve T shirt made of pure polypropylene 17 99 1 Polypropylene retains odor just trust me on this 2 It s got the same icky feeling against your skin as groovy 70s polyester shirts Sleeping in it was uncomfortable and in time I predict it might cause itch and abrasion themed nightmares 3 While it spreads your sweat across the fabric surface until it evaporates the sweat stays against your skin Lately better synthetics have come along Powerdry a polyester fabric designed by Malden Mills and CoolMax a polyester concoction from DuPont boast two layer dimensional wicking an industry buzz phrase meaning sweat leaves your skin instantly then spreads out on the top layer of the fabric I tested a Duofold short sleeve T shirt made of CoolMax 15 99 and an REI zip turtleneck made of Powerdry 34 According to Malden Powerdry s patented BiPolar construction has two unique surfaces the soft inner layer rapidly wicks perspiration away from the body while the durable outer layer spreads moisture for maximum evaporation I have no reason to doubt them DuPont claims CoolMax has four channel fibers that give it the fastest drying rate of any fabric The only difference I could detect between them was in their feel against my skin CoolMax and Powerdry fared equally well in battling the sweat I worked up running laps around Slate s offices but CoolMax gets the nod because not only does it not retain odor even when worn for two days and nights without deodorant but it truly feels like silk I m going to buy CoolMax for all my underwear it s a terrific product If you missed the link click to see why Malden Mills is a monopoly you can love
