        well Brad what do you hear in San Jose about Ross Perot do you hear as much do you think as we do here in Dallas     um probably not in anywhere near as much there have been a couple of articles uh which ive basically glanced at um but thats about it i just find it interesting that somebody with that much money uh would be interested in the presidency in the first place i guess its its as much you know just the sense of power and the sense of being able to accomplish things       uh as much as anything else i dont know it seems to me that if i had that kind of money i would feel like i were more influential as a private citizen than as the president   well that could be uh Ross Ross Perot is not a politician i mean   this is kind of new to him   umhum   i i dont know are you familiar with things that hes done in the past that have gotten quite a bit of attention like uh rescuing the EDS employees that were being held in jail in Tehran   hum no no i hadnt i hadnt really paid that much attention     yeah  i mean this was this was a few years ago probably ten or so ten or twelve   uhhuh   uh he hired uh some retired Army guys to go in after him and and supposedly even i think went in by himself with went in to see them disguised you know as somebody else   wow   but uh he at least ended up over there in one of the neighboring companies probably countries probably Afghanistan or something to meet them when they came out of uh out of Iran and i think he was uh maybe a little getting a little bit involved in politics or something during the Vietnam war he uh tried to send supplies over to the prisoners   umhum   and i dont know i of course we hear a lot of him because he lives here in the Dallas area   what kind of i mean this this obviously says something for his um you know something for one aspect of his character what kind of person is he in terms of   i he was an outstanding salesman at IBM ive read  until he quit there and started his own company which he later sold out to General Motors and   umhum   and uh it since then hes started a new company but i think he must be a very good salesman or at least he was at some time um my impression is that hes a pretty honest person   be kind of a change   oh i ive heard him on the radio and whatnot i mean he just seems very forthright he he he doesnt have to play games   yeah       hes already hes already won   i mean that he thats right thats right i im just curious to see whats gonna happen to the political scene uh if he gets on the ballot in all the states and whatnot do you do you think he cans be a spoiler for Bush   umhum um i honestly dont think so uh not unless he really puts a lot of effort into it and i dont think he wants to i think its uh i think being a seriously considered being seriously considered as a presidential candidate is something that um it it just takes a really huge investment in personal effort not just you know i mean im sure it takes a lot of money as well   oh yeah   but um just in terms of the number of personal appearances that youve got to make and all the the the hoops that youve got to jump through in order to get the media sound bites and get people paying attention to you i mean   all the backslapping   an occasional newspaper article will will show up for for any variety of things but being considered seriously i think is you know may take more than hes willing to put into it   yeah uh yeah yeah could be could be i i also suspect that one aspect of his personality would be that he would be really really tenacious   hum   or or maybe stubborn even i dont know so i dont know you know he he might       decide to go whole hog and really go out and and turn into a politician and do all the back slapping and and uh handshaking and all that kiss a few babies i suppose   yeah well i dont suppose hed have to do a whole lot of fund raising or uh worry a whole lot about where the funding was coming from so hed have that advantage   yeah yeah yeah its um certainly different i mean Bush is wealthy   umhum   but nothing like that   yeah   i i mean i dont know what they put Perots wealth at i think its probably a few billion or something i   yeah ive ive ive heard it in the billions i didnt hear specifics i figured once it you know once it reaches that point it doesnt really matter how many numbers are in front of the B you know it   yeah     its passed its passed any kind of reasonable imagining in the first place so   yeah well i the in a way i im interested in his candidacy id like to id like to kind of get
