Mote and Beam Much of the criticism of the Pressgate piece and the magazine in general has been from people in the mainstream media who were clearly part of the system I was writing about and thus responded accordingly Because Slate and Jacob Weisberg don t in any way fall into that category and deserve to be taken seriously I thought I should try to respond seriously to some of the factual stuff I ll let readers decide for themselves if the magazine is boring a knock that reminds me of lawyers wishful thinking when I started the American Lawyer First I didn t leak the piece to the New York Times a semi important point for a magazine like ours We blast faxed the piece to every major and minor I think press organization after first faxing it to Kenneth Starr Everybody got it at the same time So the Times decision to put it on the front page was not based on having any kind of exclusive Now to take Jacob s points in order l Whether I prove Starr leaked grand jury information depends on one s definition of grand jury information I used the one used by the relevant court with jurisdiction Starr disagrees with that No mistakes How about the stained dress Or the president testifying that he never was alone with Lewinsky I never say the Times made mistakes by the way 2 Yes Sue Schmidt disputes that quote That happens with reporters a lot But interestingly she didn t dispute it the first time she was asked about the story by Howie Kurtz for his first story My notes have her saying exactly that and then saying it again later on in our interview at the Madison Hotel coffee shop in almost the same language 3 No self contradiction here She volunteered that item about Jordan and where she had got the story in the course of narrating that first weekend of the scandal When I later asked her directly about sources for her first day story and stories beyond that she declined to comment 4 My point was that Lewinsky s No answer was the thing that stood out the most to Mike Isikoff when I talked with him about the tapes And it s a big part of why Newsweek held the story I simply pointed out that this is something Newsweek might have remembered to put in and quote when it went online with its first story In retrospect though it would have been fairer and fuller to note that Newsweek did indeed say the evidence was not at all clear that the president had instructed her to lie Nonetheless I think Newsweek should have included this important quote if it had wanted to be fair 5 To take one example let s look at the first day reports from the networks What did I know a Starr s top deputy had spent much of the day briefing these people Starr told me that and Bennett confirmed it but would not tell me specifics b The network reports included material from tapes that could only be the tapes that Starr s people had made because these tapes allegedly have Lewinsky saying that Jordan and the president told her to lie which was not on the tapes Newsweek heard and Newsweek had supposedly heard the most incriminating tapes Neither Tripp s lawyers nor anyone else even Tripp though she might obviously remember what was on them but she was not accessible to the press at this point could have heard those tapes or briefed reporters about them So I don t think it s intellectually dishonest to say that this information must have come from Starr s office Remember He says his guy briefed them for these reports and the crux of the reports was what was supposedly on these tapes By the way this criticism is kind of refreshing in the sense that it s so different from the everyone knows prosecutors leak criticism that I ve got 6 Jacob is just plain wrong There are no court decisions in the relevant jurisdiction that support Starr on the notion that leaking what people tell investigators before they testify about what they will testify to is OK Sure there are some from other courts elsewhere but they are few and far between and Starr really wouldn t be able to cite them properly in a brief in the District of Columbia 7 Oops forget my last paragraph under Point 5 8 My point about anonymous quotes is made by Jacob I m against totally blind uses of phrases such as sources that don t say how many sources or what ax they might have to grind Example Jackie Judd s citing of several sources to substantiate her witnesses interrupted the president and Lewinsky scoop When a source can t be named enough identification should be supplied so that the reader knows the source s potential bias This clearly worked here Jacob can see that I m using a Times person as the source and correctly identifies the potential bias Now go back and read my description of all the truly blind sources in the article and see if you can tell the difference 9 Conflict Yes I should have disclosed that in 1995 I gave 1 000 bucks to the Clinton campaign I ve also given money to Republicans like Rudy But how could I prohibit anyone even myself retroactively from making contributions That was 1995 this is 1998 and since I sent out the initial direct mail for this magazine which I knew would cover political stuff and politicians I haven t made any contributions to anyone let alone the president to whom again I made one contribution in 1995 The only political writing or editing I did around the time of that Clinton contribution was the Paula Jones piece by Stuart Taylor in the American Lawyer which I instigated and edited and proudly published and which as you know made the case against the president I m proud of our magazine and proud of this piece Prouder in fact now than when we published it because nearly two weeks later everyone who could take a shot at it has and so far I can see that I ve misspelled one name screwed up one sequence the Journal decided not to wait for comment from the White House on its incorrect steward witness story after hearing the White House wanted a half hour to comment not before and included two or three gratuitous adjectives that I now wouldn t There may be more and if there is I will be the first to concede it But I hope my willingness to admit mistakes isn t misread as being so much more fallible than others but only being more willing to admit it Steve BrillBrill s Content New York City Jacob Weisberg responds I appreciate the tone of Brill s letter which is nicer than my piece was Several of his points however demand a reply 1 a My criticism stands The only thing that s clearly illegal is leaking out of the grand jury room Brill doesn t prove that Starr has done that 1 b I didn t say there were no mistakes I wrote that Brill didn t document any significant error of fact by the Post Times Time or Newsweek He doesn t 2 If Brill used a tape recorder we d know whether he misquoted Susan Schmidt or not He doesn t respond to the complaint that he misquoted Jonah Goldberg 3 Still a contradiction in the article It would have been consistent if Brill had written that Schmidt declined comment on her sources except for the one she revealed 4 This is now a point of supernuance not a major criticism of Newsweek s journalistic integrity which was how it was billed in the story 5 I strongly suspect that Starr was the source for stories about what various witnesses have said But there s at least a plausible alternative explanation for where much of this information could have come from As I say it would have been only fair to mention it 6 This whole argument about the relevant jurisdiction is new since Brill s article Eventually the question of what s illegal is likely to be settled by the Supreme Court which will consider lower court precedents from various jurisdictions 7 Brill concedes I think 8 Weisberg concedes 9 Brill concedes 10 Brill concedes Right Back at Ya The June 23 Chatterbox claims that a kind of machinery is at work on the right that doesn t exist on the left today Actually similar machinery has existed on the left for years It runs from the liberals in Congress to the liberals in the statehouse to the liberals on the bench to the liberals on the nightly news President Clinton plugged into the machinery the moment he was elected Examples include the universal use of accepted terms such as extreme right to describe any given idea that emanates from the conservative end of the spectrum It includes broad opposition to the slightest bit of reform that might impact the access of trial lawyers to the money machine of our tort system It includes attack dog opposition to any and all school reform that does not result in massive amounts of additional money for the teachers unions And so on and so on The left has for years started opposing things in tandem the moment the handwriting appeared on the wall Their opposition has always included near uniformity right down to verbiage The Sotomayor nomination is an isolated example of conservatives employing this often successful tool perfected by the left David C Klug Harrisburg Pa Remember Who Lost the World Cup I read with interest Hegemon and Proud of It by Strobe Talbott However and you may choose to call me a smug foreigner who is also sensitive to smugness on the part of the superpower I thought it self congratulatory ill considered and decidedly anecdotal It is certainly true that the United States is the most powerful country in the world It is also true that its erstwhile rival has collapsed rather utterly However even the merest glance at the history books will reveal that Talbott s dominate but cooperate scenario has been played out over hundreds of years The wars were always the exceptions It is also worth pointing out that the United States has actually declined in relative economic importance since World War II In 1950 the United States was responsible for nearly half the gross world product However today even though the United States is far and away the No 1 economy the European Union with its 15 member states actually has a bigger share of the gross world product Never mind Japan and Asia who aren t exactly inconsequential Then there s the rest of the world It seems to me that the world as a whole is an awful lot more interdependent than it ever has been And I think that s a good thing So like get over the American omnipotence thing Alan McGinty London Fictional Journalism 101 Hats off to Michael Kinsley for Fictional Journalism for Dummies Only I would have gone a bit further Based on the available evidence so far this abortion of a CNN Time piece was not just overreaching but a shining example of sheer

comments as a meddie will be much more parochial I agree that surgeons generally work very hard The question of whether a lot of what they do is really necessary or appropriate is debatable as it is for all specialties The virtue and responsibility aspect are more problematic There is the common ritual of medical clearance for surgery where the meddie basically blesses the operation and is allowed to share responsibility despite the fact that the note is rarely read and the recommendations are often ignored A less than virtuous practice that is not unheard of is to hustle the patient of a failing operation out of the OR to avoid dying on the table I have a couple of additions for your medical jokes not original How do you hide something from an internist meddie Put it under a bandage
