 The New Politics of the Drug War Did Election Day mark the beginning of the end of the War on Drugs To some drug warriors the reform initiatives approved by voters in California and Arizona were the first step toward unilateral disarmament The implications of this for the social norms that keep kids away from drugs are very serious says Steve Dnistrian senior vice president of the Partnership for a Drug Free America There has been no greater fundamental challenge to the drug prevention field in a long time What is beyond dispute is that advocates of drug reform are enjoying unprecedented success in setting the nation s drug policy agenda at least for the moment The get tough just say no party is on the defensive Since the first term of President Richard Nixon the American political system has responded to popular concerns about drug use by funding the steady expansion of federal and state law enforcement agencies With the advent of crack cocaine in the mid 1980s the civic credos of getting tough and just saying no carried the weight of common sense and enjoyed sway in schools print and on the airwaves Enter the marijuana problem Between 1992 and 1996 the number of teen agers smoking marijuana roughly doubled a phenomenon that received wide attention during the recent presidential campaign But Bob Dole s harsh attacks on Bill Clinton for allegedly condoning this development failed to excite American voters Given the perception of a leadership vacuum around the time of the election it s not surprising that initiatives such as those in Arizona and California emerged Though lumped together in articles like this the two laws are actually quite different Arizona s is the more sweeping It requires that all nonviolent drug offenders be paroled an estimated 1 000 persons are eligible to go free within the next 90 days that the money saved in jail related costs go toward funding of a new parents commission on drug education that all violent drug offenders do 100 percent of their sentence and almost as an afterthought allows doctors to prescribe marijuana heroin or LSD The California law by contrast shields from prosecution persons who use marijuana under an oral or written recommendation from a medical practitioner The California law is an implicit rejection of the drug war says Sam Vagenas spokesman for pro reform forces in Arizona Arizona was an explicit rejection Is the result a delegitimization of the drug war a cultural surrender an instance of defining deviancy down as cultural conservatives would have it Judge for yourself On the Internet one entrepreneurial mind has already set up a Web site offering 27 grams of mail order medical relief for 270 taxes included and handy guidelines for how to smoke it The legality is virtual All buyers must send copy of medical report and birth certificate A return address in given Is this a brazen hoax Street dealing on the information highway Proceed with a caveat emptor to http www medical marijuana com In the Family Therapy Network chat room a posting on marijuana proved to be the most popular ever prompting a wide ranging adult discussion of law professional responsibility mental health addiction mind expansion and above all children The Berkeley Cannabis Buyers Club had to take down its Web site which had been overwhelmed by surfers hoping to score electronically Tom Tuk the designer of the home page angrily yanked the site with this statement Mail distribution of marijuana is an avenue of diversion for abuse In the nation s capital the sound you hear is of paper being shuffled The president s drug czar Gen Barry McCaffrey has made it clear he regards the two laws as the work of deceptive and mischievous drug legalizers who have snookered a lot of otherwise right thinking people But what will federal drug agencies do McCaffrey told the Washington Post that he would make his recommendations to Clinton by Christmas In the meantime drug warriors in Phoenix and Sacramento are on their own and not happy about it Richard Romley the district attorney for Maricopa County which includes metropolitan Phoenix was perhaps the most incisive of those who testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing early this month While four other witnesses criticized the duplicity of pro drug forces and the naivet of the voters Romley bluntly identified the central choices facing law enforcement go after doctors federalize marijuana enforcement go to court and get a strategy The options are not that attractive It s not clear that many doctors will prescribe marijuana but some surely will Professional groups such as the American Medical Association reject the notion of medical marijuana but caregiver organizations like the American Public Health Association and the National Association of People With AIDS support it Romley and John Walters former staff director of the drug czar s office want the feds to step in Nothing in the law prevents DEA from moving unilaterally against the small number of pro pot physicians who would likely recommend marijuana for their patients Walters testified The DEA he added should prepare to do so That may sound like a good idea from a Washington policy maker point of view From the perspective of a mayor or state legislator it sounds like a public relations debacle The sight of federal agents cuffing some beloved Marcus Welby for recommending a marijuana cigarette for kindly Uncle Sebastian suffering from AIDS will not go over well with voters The federalization of state marijuana prohibitions would also impose some real costs on Washington The problem today from the point of view of cops in California and Arizona is that low volume marijuana traffickers are likely to say in court that they are handling medical marijuana That would not be a permissible defense in federal court but federal prosecutors don t pursue traffickers unless they are handling substantial quantities For example in California s Central District the feds won t take a case that involves less than 200 kilograms 420 pounds or 200 plants Dealers will be smart enough to keep their operations under the federal threshold observed Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates Will the U S Attorney s Office in the Central District of California lower its threshold policy so as to discourage marijuana entrepreneurs posing as medical suppliers A spokesman for the office declined to discuss threshold policies and referred all questions to the still silent Justice Department in Washington The most forthright response to the initiatives comes from California Attorney General Dan Lungren He told 300 cops in Sacramento last week that the people have spoken and counseled grudging cooperation with the forces supporting medical marijuana Lungren made national news last August when he authorized a police raid on a San Francisco buyers club that was openly supplying marijuana to AIDS patients and the police charged to many others who just wanted to get stoned For his vigilance Lungren was lampooned in Doonesbury We must realize voters meant that marijuana should be used only as an occasional exception for someone who is seriously suffering and under the direct supervision of a physician Lungren said The state s voters did not want to start this state down the slippery slope toward the legalization of marijuana But the just say no party can t seem to get traction on that slippery slope The public now seems unswayed by its message Leading prohibitionist spokesmen like McCaffrey and Lungren campaigned vigorously against the propositions Public opinion didn t change much The drug enforcers claim that the drug reformers are some duplicitous self interested cabal is also growing less plausible A civic cause that includes self described limousine liberal billionaire George Soros retired Reaganite statesman George Shultz and Gail Zappa widow of counterculture hero Frank is not exactly narrow or shady sounding And the conclusion that the voters are fools while always tempting to spurned politicians is usually unwise When Arizona Sen Jon Kyl recently said he was embarrassed by the voters collective decision he promptly got roasted by most callers to Phoenix s two top rated talk radio stations and had to issue a clarification On the other hand the reformers have not shown that they can consistently win the confidence of the public which remains very wary of legalization of any drug even marijuana The reality is that we have won a very small victory that is not readily convertible to any other area of drug policy concedes Dave Fratello a spokesman for Californians for Medical Rights the umbrella group that successfully promoted the medical marijuana bill Rob Kampia of the Marijuana Policy Project a pro reform group in Washington says the legislative focus will remain on medical marijuana He claims to have pledges from legislators in 23 states to introduce medical marijuana bills in 1997 Meanwhile Steve Dnistrian of the Partnership for a Drug Free America says he and his allies will be contesting the reformers everywhere and promises that next time drug prohibition forces will be better prepared and organized
