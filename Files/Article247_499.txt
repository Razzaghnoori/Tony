 Really Juvenile Reynolds USA Today and the Washington Post lead with revelations from newly disclosed R J Reynolds internal documents that seem to show that the company has persistently attempted to market cigarettes to teens This is also the top national story at the Los Angeles Times The New York Times leads with the U N Security Council s vote telling Iraq to honor previous promises to allow U N inspectors complete access to suspected weapons sites The new tobacco documents many of them marked Secret released as part of a lawsuit settlement show a company strategy of attracting teenagers through advertising and various youth oriented promotions such as according to USAT NASCAR sponsorship inner city activities and T shirts and other paraphernalia And says USAT the documents show that RJR s introduction of Joe Camel fits in to this strategy The dailies point out that since in 1994 the then CEO of RJR testified before Congress that the company does not market to children these new documents have prompted congressional interest in perjury charges They also report that former FDA head David Kessler says the new material is a smoking gun that shows why Congress shouldn t approve the proposed national tobacco settlement The company responded by repeating its denial of youth targeting and stating that the documents are being taken out of context telling the WP Our documents reflect the social attitudes of the times in which they were created The Wall Street Journal which flags the story in its front page news box passes along another RJR defense that one document that seemed to be suggesting pitching product to 13 year olds contained a typographical error and was really about 18 year olds However according to the Post some documents refer to 12 year olds The WP really goes to town on the RJR story backing up its lead with two more stories inside one on how the revelations will play politically and the other a collection of extensive selections from the RJR documents The NYT plays the story inside The NYT lead passes along a CBS News report that arms inspectors have photographic evidence of Iraqi biological weapon experiments on human beings The paper also states that China was wavering on the Security Council action but was finally brought along by the decision to deplore Iraq s behavior rather than condemn it No telling how many votes could have been garnered if they d gone with not really thrilled The WSJ says that Hallmark Cards is coming out with a sympathy card for relatives of those who ve committed suicide The NYT reports that on educational grounds Georgia Gov Zell Miller proposed as part of his state budget spending 105 000 to make classical music available to every child born in the state During his budget address Tuesday he played a bit of Ode to Joy and then asked lawmakers Now don t you feel smarter already Social scientist James Q Wilson in a Times op ed piece makes the following argument for the sanity of Ted Kacszynski There is nothing in the Unabomber manifesto that looks at all like the work of a madman The language is clear precise and calm The argument is subtle and carefully developed lacking anything even faintly resembling the wild claims or irrational speculation that a lunatic might produce Wilson also observes that besides the Unabomber s manifesto his skill in manufacturing bombs and the clever ways in which he concealed his identity suggest to me that he was clearly sane Of course the legal usefulness of these observations is somewhat dubious because this attempt to show that Theodore Kacszynski is fit to stand trial depends on the assumption that he is the Unabomber which in turn requires a trial first which first requires showing that he is fit to stand trial and so on With NBC s deal to retain ER at a cost of 13 million an episode getting front page coverage at the NYT LAT and the WSJ maybe the next big domestic policy issue will be controlling television health care costs
