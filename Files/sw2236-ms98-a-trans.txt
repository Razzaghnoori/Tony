 good morning uh hi you mentioned model railroading that uh i ve been watching a program on the Public Broadcasting Station here uh about model railroading have you ever seen that yes i i always turn on the TV set and it seems like i catch that program in the last five minutes and uh well it s been very interesting i i think it you know what i see is fascinating and i kind of enjoy it uh i ve always had that hobby ever since i was a child uh huh and uh i refuse to get involved because i never had space for a permanent layout yeah and then here about five years ago we bought a big old house out in Oaktown Virginia and there was uh there was two basements wow there were two two separate furnace rooms and so i took the smaller furnace room and now it s full of trains you should have taken the larger one huh well uh my uh brother had a Lionel train set he was a a bit older than i and so when i came along i was interested in uh fooling with the train and since he was was past that stage why he didn t have any objections and uh in fact i started doing a layout uh in our garage at one time but i got about as far as sort of painting some uh streets and things on a piece of plywood and putting up a few things and it got to be hot summertime when i gave it up um but uh i ve always enjoyed uh the train and you know fooling with it and all do you still have the uh train set he has it he has it yeah i mean since it was his i couldn t very well keep it forever um but uh actually i have had an idea not long ago uh hope to build another house some day and i was thinking i might uh incorporate some sort of a display space and ask him if he would let me put the train up you know not not as a working type of thing but just to put it on display uh huh well those uh the early Lionels can be quite valuable yeah i don t know what year his was bought but probably around nineteen forty forty two maybe i m i m just guessing but something like that i would think yeah well some of those around the war years were uh kind of difficult to get a hold of because Lionel got involved in manufacturing a lot of uh uh war equipment uh huh and uh i think they almost discontinued production uh in nineteen forty two and forty three oh really so some of the pre war models are quite valuable yeah i don t know i don t know if i don t know if he knows i know there s some uh booklets and things you know showing different models and stuff that are quite old that were with it but i don t know if they were original or if they were picked up you know in later years well i managed to sweet talk my brother out of uh his Lionel train set that uh dated back to about nineteen thirty three um and uh he s kind of unhappy i ve got it now but i m not going to give it back yeah that s probably the way it goes sometimes and i had a uh post uh World War version of the Pennsylvania Electric uh GT1 locomotives and it happened to be one of the rare paint jobs oh so i understand that that locomotive is worth around seven hundred and fifty dollars now wow so it s it s sitting on display on top of my bookcase it has a prominent spot huh yeah well i think those things are neat and and as i say i watch that show and there are some uh really interesting museums around that uh have good displays and uh i said that well if i ever took a trip i you know might ignore some of these museums because a lot of them are called childrens museums or toy museums and um hum that wouldn t really catch my attention but if i knew that they had you know really good train layouts i would wanna go and see what they had well Pennsylvania used to have uh some commercial displays there was one place that was halfway between Harrisburg and Allenstown Pennsylvania in a community called Midway which suggest it was halfway um and uh they had a huge room which was probably uh forty feet wide and a hundred and forty feet long uh and the central portion of that room was occupied by one huge O gauge layout running uh uh Lionel train and American Flyer trains wow huh and they had done a lot of work on that with uh scenery and buildings and they had trolleys running around and uh a lot of animation in there and uh it was in business for a long long time i don t know it it still maybe in business it might be yeah well um you mentioned another hobby sailing do you have a sailboat yes uh i bought a uh Bristol thirty five five for my wife um and we keep it on the Chesapeake Bay and uh starting next weekend i m gonna have to go down and uh fill out for the summer season yeah we have a cruise plan to sail from uh Solomon to Maryland up to Philadelphia this summer uh huh about a two week cruise and uh two or three lay days in Philadelphia oh that ll be nice they have a a new waterfront uh marina in Philadelphia it isn t as developed as uh Water Side in Norfolk or the Baltimore uh waterfront but uh the marina is only about uh two or three blocks from the historic district oh so that s quite uh handy for our our youngsters we can take them up and yeah show them Independence Hall the Liberty Bell and uh Franklin uh yeah and just be right there huh Franklin Square yeah well uh we re not uh really sailors but i want some summer soon to um hire a sailboat with a captain since we re not you know versed in that and uh go to the Caribbean um well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the British Virgins right yeah uh that s uh that is almost an ideal sailing area uh if you have a little even a little bit of experience uh i ve seen a number of people go through a uh a cruising class in Annapolis uh huh where they might get uh maybe ten or fifteen hours of sailing experience go down to uh uh British Tortolla and charter a boat for a week and they take it out and have a grand time yeah uh it s fairly sheltered waters right there and uh you don t need any fancy navigation equipment because you can see all your destinations from one spot right uh it just sound fascinating to me i would love to just go down i ve always liked islands and water and that sort of thing anyway and um been on a couple of big cruise ships so uh you know i kind of had seen it from that point of view but i i think i would like the sailboat um hum uh i ve been there several times uh the first trip uh we flew down and uh chartered a uh Morgan uh forty five um and i had fun that then a few years later a guy i was racing with uh decided to take his boat down for a winter season and so i went offshore with him to uh Saint Thomas and then we cruised uh the American Virgins for a week before i flew home which do you think is best American or British Virgins i think the better sight seeing is in the uh British Virgins uh huh uh there s uh some very nice places like the bass which is a uh sort of a huge monolithic rocks that you can you can walk up the beach and into these uh enormous caverns that are partially submerged and you can wade in the pools and so forth very popular tourist spot uh huh uh the Bitter End is an excellent resort up in uh which is very easy to get into and there s some very nice reefs in that uh vicinity if you like snorkeling and uh scuba diving yeah yeah that s neat and uh there are some very nice resort hotels so you can go in and uh enjoy a very classy dinner uh the Peter Island Yacht Club is uh extremely exclusive like uh i think they re probably charging five hundred dollars a day for a room now ooh that s getting up there and uh it s there kind of a nice place to visit uh uh it s better being on a boat than being on land because uh your boat becomes your hotel your uh your dining room your taxi cab and uh everything else everything yeah that s why i think it would be neat um well i d recommend it sounds good
