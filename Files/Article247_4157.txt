 Are Bush and McCain Really Neck and Neck A recent poll found that John McCain leads George W Bush among New Hampshire Republicans by 3 percentage points with a 5 percent margin of error Does this mean they are really in a dead heat Possibly You actually need two numbers to understand a poll One is the margin of error an estimate of how large a discrepancy might exist between a survey s results and the true value It s unlikely for instance that 1 000 people polled in some national survey will speak accurately for all 260 million Americans The margin of error measures just how wrong those 1 000 people could be The margin of error is typically 3 to 5 percent and is almost always cited alongside the results The other important number is the degree of confidence which is the likelihood that the real value falls within the margin of error Most polls use a 95 percent degree of confidence so it s usually omitted from news reports Here s an example of how the two numbers work together This week a Reuters WHDH TV poll showed McCain leading Bush 35 percent to 32 percent with a 5 percent margin of error This means that there is a 95 percent chance there s the degree of confidence that between 30 and 40 percent of the population supports McCain that s McCain s 35 percent plus or minus the margin of error and a 95 percent chance that between 27 and 37 percent supports Bush So based on this poll how sure can we be that McCain is truly ahead of Bush The answer is less than 95 percent sure The reported margin of error relates to each candidate s individual score But the margin of error on the spread i e the difference between their scores is much larger since it incorporates the potential variations in both scores As a rule of thumb you can multiply the reported margin of error by 1 7 to get the margin of error for the spread Since 1 7 times 5 is 8 5 the Reuters WHDH TV survey would need to show McCain with at least an 8 5 percent advantage over Bush for his lead to be 95 percent certain Since his lead is only three percentage points it s being called a dead heat But the small lead is not meaningless although it is less than 95 percent certain that McCain leads Bush it is still more likely than not that he is really ahead Visit the American Statistical Association s Web site for extensive information on common methods and errors in measuring public opinion The Explainer thanks many Slate readers for suggesting this topic Next question
