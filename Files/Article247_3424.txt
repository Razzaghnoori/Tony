 The Conformists Dear Chris A Beatles biographer I forget which one once said that Sgt Pepper brought the world closer together than any event since the Congress of Vienna Whatever that means Maybe monoculture is too strong a word for this way of thinking maybe not But you ve certainly hit on something by focusing on Miller s partiality to music that brings us all together He s an e pluribus unum man Miller quotes Ed Kelly one of the interchangeable dancers on Dick Clark s American Bandstand as saying The craziest part of it was that many of us became these instant celebrities yet none of us really had any talent There is an implicit criticism here of rock s role in creating today s problematic to put it mildly celebrity culture But Miller is not awfully concerned about authenticity For him rock is the product of the coldest sort of commercial calculation true but also embodying a not ignoble vision of an America transformed of Mind and Body Black and White dancing the same dance moving to the same beat as kids en masse joined in their own brand of Dionysian revelry watered down and trite but genuinely uplifting all the same But this is ignoble This is where rock turns into the feed bag for morons the opiate of the masses that its harshest critics have always condemned Once rulers understand the political implications of Dionysian revelry it gets turned to rotten ends Merengue is terrific music too but when half a century ago Trujillo ordered that sound systems be set up to play it all over the Dominican Republic it wasn t to uplift people but to render them passive Rock has its roots in the Cold War it is at least in part the musical expression of outrage at the uniformity and boredom of American suburbia But like so many protest movements it partakes of the very vices it purports to critique Rock at least the canonical line of it that Miller describes here has been a greater force for unthinking conformism than anything Levittown wrought Kids understand this Miller doesn t always That s why he gets blindsided by punk and disco The Sex Pistols of course are incomprehensible without a glance at the two track uniformity of mid to late 1970s music lugubrious 11 minute long navel gazing guitar dirges by the Eagles and Jackson Browne on one hand ad jingles like Undercover Angel and Heartbeat It s a Love Beat on the other Not that there weren t a few truly emetic songs that united the vices of both Gerry Rafferty s Baker Street Walter Egan s was that his name Magnet and Steel But what is disco Since I know little about it and since you make big claims for it I would love to hear more At the time it seemed like a bid by out classes both urban blacks and the last of urban working class whites to partake of the license and self expression that rock had provided to privileged classes Since disco came precisely at a time when the privileged classes in their political incarnation were busily pitting working class whites against blacks through such innovations as forced busing this seems like an odd alliance to say the least Unless the white participation in and enthusiasm for disco was a mirage But it didn t seem like it at the time Maybe you re right that Miller is not listening to much modern rock I don t listen to much either and most of it s poppy stuff I hear on the drive to work I too find a lot of what s come out of the 1990s derivative Sheryl Crow s guitar licks seem so familiar that I have often suspected they re simply mixed out of Stuck in the Middle With You Smashmouth makes me certain that while Jim Morrison may be dead Ray Manzarek is not The New Radicals sound like Todd Rundgren has just emerged from the cryogenics lab where he s lain frozen since 1972 Beck whom I find a consistent delight seems to draw from less mainstream stuff a hybrid of Prince and that terrific high tech British duo Godley Creme who had a pop incarnation as 10cc I m sure these are fogeyish and undiscriminating sentiments My point is that any casual acquaintance is bound to lead to similar ones because the surface of rock is exciting only at rare and lucky moments Best Chris
