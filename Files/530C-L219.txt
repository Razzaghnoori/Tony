 December 6 1991 Dear Friend Thirty years is a long time to be part of the law school community I have witnessed many changes physical location of the law school new faculty coming on board faculty retiring tax students surviving my classes and a periodic changing of the deans Legal education nationwide also has been changing and your law school has been keeping pace with the times For example we now provide students both traditional classroom education which emphasizes legal reasoning and analysis and extensive training in fundamental lawyering skills Our students must now fulfill the law school s legal writing requirements and they encouraged to participate in a wide array of courses and programs that teach professional skills such as trial practice the law school s civil practice and criminal defense clinics moot court and client counseling The law school also continues to develop its curriculum in a number of specialized fields including environmental health and international law areas Earlier this year the law school published the first issue of its second law review the Indiana International and Comparative Law Review At a recent gathering of the law school s Board of visitors Justice Brent Dickson 68 of the Indiana Supreme Court commented about the impact which our law graduates have had on the governance of Indiana and indeed of the nation For example he noted that three of the five Indiana Supreme Court justices are graduates of the law school that our graduates include 100 of the state s 360 trial court judges and that 30 of the state s lawyers graduated from the law school And of course former Indiana Governor Edgar Whitcomb 50 and Senator Dan Coats 72 as well as the vice President of the United States 74 and his wife 74 are graduates of your law school The law school has more than 5 700 alumni approximately 80 of whom reside in Indiana The balance practice law throughout the country and live in 48 different states I think you can be proud just as I am of the graduates of your law school and of their accomplishments I also believe that you can be proud of your law school We have provided throughout the years quality legal education and we are continuing to improve However these are difficult times for public institutions of higher education because legislative appropriations are either flat or in the decline State funds for your law school are not now nor have they ever been sufficient to fund all of our costs To continue to excel in our educational mission we must have both public and private support For this reason I ask that you think of your law school in financial terms in the same way that you would view private institutions The law school s needs range from purchasing additional computer terminals to paying travel costs of our moot court teams and from refurbishing the Gray Lounge to purchasing necessary reference materials for the library These are just some of our needs others are discussed in the brochure which is enclosed with this letter As a tenured professor and staunch supporter of your law school my task is to beat the drums for financial contributions from alumni and friends I cannot overemphasize the importance of your support If we are to maintain our programs and thus continue to enhance the value of the diploma that you earned from IU School of Law Indianapolis we need the help of our alumni You can see by reading the code my friend that there are still many federal and state tax advantages for making charitable contributions In addition Indiana residents may receive tax benefits through the Indiana tax credit which is applied directly against the bottom line of the state tax return Please give Your year end gift to the law school is an investment in the future quality of the legal profession and a significant way for you to remember your past and I thank you in advance for your gift Best wishes
