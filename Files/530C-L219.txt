              December        Dear Friend      Thirty years is a long time to be part of the law school community I      have witnessed many changes physical location of the law school new      faculty coming on board faculty retiring tax students surviving my      classes and a periodic changing of the deans      Legal education nationwide also has been changing and your law school      has been keeping pace with the times For example we now provide      students both traditional classroom education which emphasizes legal      reasoning and analysis and extensive training in fundamental lawyering      skills Our students must now fulfill the law schools legal writing      requirements and they encouraged to participate in a wide array of      courses and programs that teach professional skills such as trial      practice the law schools civil practice and criminal defense clinics      moot court and client counseling      The law school also continues to develop its curriculum in a number of      specialized fields including environmental health and international      law areas      Earlier this year the law school published the first issue of its      second law review the Indiana International and Comparative Law      Review      At a recent gathering of the law schools Board of visitors Justice      Brent Dickson  of the Indiana Supreme Court commented about the      impact which our law graduates have had on the governance of Indiana and      indeed of the nation For example he noted that three of the five      Indiana Supreme Court justices are graduates of the law school that our      graduates include  of the states  trial court judges and that       of the states lawyers graduated from the law school And of course      former Indiana Governor Edgar Whitcomb  and Senator Dan Coats       as well as the vice President of the United States  and his      wife  are graduates of your law school      The law school has more than  alumni approximately  of whom      reside in Indiana The balance practice law throughout the country and      live in  different states I think you can be proud just as I am of      the graduates of your law school and of their accomplishments      I also believe that you can be proud of your law school We have      provided throughout the years quality legal education and we are      continuing to improve However these are difficult times for public      institutions of higher education because legislative appropriations are      either flat or in the decline      State funds for your law school are not now  nor have they ever been      sufficient to fund all of our costs To continue to excel in our      educational mission we must have both public and private support For      this reason I ask that you think of your law school in financial terms      in the same way that you would view private institutions      The law schools needs range from purchasing additional computer      terminals to paying travel costs of our moot court teams and from      refurbishing the Gray Lounge to purchasing necessary reference materials      for the library These are just some of our needs others are discussed      in the brochure which is enclosed with this letter      As a tenured professor and staunch supporter of your law school my      task is to beat the drums for financial contributions from alumni and      friends I cannot overemphasize the importance of your support If we are      to maintain our programs and thus continue to enhance the value of the      diploma that you earned from IU School of Law Indianapolis we need the      help of our alumni      You can see by reading the code my friend that there are still many      federal and state tax advantages for making charitable contributions In      addition Indiana residents may receive tax benefits through the Indiana      tax credit which is applied directly against the bottom line of the      state tax return      Please give Your yearend gift to the law school is an investment in      the future quality of the legal profession and a significant way for you      to remember your past and I thank you in advance for your gift      Best wishes
