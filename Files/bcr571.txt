 Introduction The clinical outcome is generally positive for patients with node negative breast carcinoma i e those patients without detectable metastases in the lymph nodes who have been treated with surgery or with surgery and radiation therapy The disease spreads in about 13 of the patients however and their lives are at risk of death 1 2 3 Genetic tests capable of identifying patients at risk for metastatic spread and or better treatment targeted to eradicate metastatic tumor deposits could have a dramatic impact on the overall survival of these patients The construction of a panel of molecular genetic markers for identifying the 13 lymph node negative mammary carcinomas that are prone to develop metastases 3 would be valuable in indicating those cases in need of early aggressive therapy There would also be considerable benefit to the 87 of women with mammary carcinomas who are not likely to metastasize by sparing them the physical mental and financial costs of the treatment In addition further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms that play an important role in metastasis could ultimately lead to the development of improved therapeutic procedures The evidence for the role of gene alterations in promoting metastasis in general and in mammary carcinomas in particular is still accumulating It is probable however that like tumorigenicity suppressor genes and oncogenes many more genes involved in metastasis remain to be discovered since the process is complex involving a large number of pathways 4 Most of the known genetic mechanisms involved in the progression of a tumor to the metastatic state involve the loss of function of genes that prevent cells from becoming invasive These are similar to tumorigenicity suppressor genes whose loss of wild type growth regulatory function leads to unregulated or malignant growth Similarly the wild type metastasis suppressor genes regulate the cell s mobility and its response to environmental messages presumably keeping most cells localized and differentiated Mutation or complete loss deletion of the wild type counterpart of any such gene in a malignant cell may make that cell more motile invasive or metastatic In particular mutations of genes regulating cell adhesion molecules have been reported to be metastasis fostering alterations 5 6 7 8 In human breast cancers several other genes have been found to be associated with metastasis namely nm23 9 10 KAI1 11 12 mta1 13 KiSS1 14 PTEN MMAC1 15 16 and BRMS1 17 Representational difference analysis RDA a DNA subtractive hybridization method 18 was used in the present study to test the working hypothesis that to achieve the metastatic state primary mammary carcinoma cells must acquire genetic changes in addition to those changes that led to transformation With the RDA method DNA from normal cells was compared with that of the metastatic cells of the same patient The recovered differential sequences were then mapped on human chromosomes and used to screen DNA samples from normal primary and metastatic cells of five additional ductal mammary carcinoma patients to determine whether these sequences were consistently associated with metastasis Materials and methods Tissue samples and cell lines Normal breast tissue and lymph nodes with metastatic cells of a 52 year old patient C 1050 with ductal mammary carcinoma were provided by the Cooperative Human Tissue Network Additional matched normal primary and metastatic tissue samples were collected from four patients patient 1 C 18805 patient 2 C 98 05H patient 3 C 19898 and patient 4 C 20635 from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network and from one patient patient 5 DS 9605 from the Surgical Pathology Department of Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Montefiore Medical Center The DNA samples from mammary carcinoma cell lines HCC 1806 HCC 11433 HCC 1428 and HCC 1937 and matched normal cell lines were received from Dr R Parson of Columbia University New York USA Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by single cell microdissection Single cell microdissection SCM was performed on hematoxylin and eosin stained tissue sections of positive lymph nodes from the ductal breast cancer patient samples 19 In the present method of SCM a Zeiss axiovert phase contrast photomicroscope fitted with a television monitor and a Narashige mechanical microdissector was used A glass micropipette was used to draw up individual cells after dissection Tumor cells were identified in the microscope and using the tip of a glass micropipette attached to a syringe they were dissected out without disturbing the surrounding tissue and were then drawn into the pipette After five to 10 cells were collected in the tip it was broken off and dropped into a sterile eppendorf tube Approximately 10 000 metastatic tumor cells were collected in this manner for RDA experiments The SCM method was used to isolate tumor cells for the RDA experiment because laser capture microdissection LCM equipment was initially not available Isolation of cells from biopsy samples by LCM LCM 20 was used for isolating tumor cells from primary and metastatic tissue samples of additional patients for screening candidate metastasis associated DNA sequences MADS by PCR After many tumor cells have been captured on the LCM cap it is then placed on a 500 l PCR tube containing ATL lysis buffer Qiagen Inc Valencia CA USA and the DNA is extracted DNA extraction About 1 g DNA was isolated from approximately 10 000 cells microdissected from metastatic tumor and normal glandular and stromal breast tissue samples using a modified method of DNA extraction from archival tissues Briefly the microdissected cell pellet was incubated overnight in lysis buffer Qiagen Inc with proteinase K at 55 C Glycogen carrier was added to the cell lysate and DNA was extracted using a phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol mixture followed by ethanol precipitation 19 RDA and characterization of differential products The RDA procedure was basically as described by Lisitsyn and coworkers 18 21 using the Bgl II representation The metastatic cancer cell DNA was used as the driver and the DNA from the normal cells was the tester Three rounds of hybridization were performed to subtract the common sequences The primers used for representation and hybridization steps of RDA are presented in Table 1 DNA from the differential bands lost in metastasis was cloned using the TA cloning system pCR2 1 Invitrogen Co Carlsbad CA USA Clones were selected at random and used as 32P dCTP Amersham Biosciences Corp Piscataway NY USA probes on dot blots or Southern blots containing amplicon DNA from the original normal and metastatic cells to verify whether these sequences are actually present in the normal cell DNA sample and missing in the metastatic cell DNA samples Positive clones showing signals in normal cell DNA and missing in metastatic cell DNA were sequenced A homology search was performed using the National Center for Biotechnology Information National Institutes for Health USA NCBI Blast program and physical mapping Radiation hybrid mapping Radiation hybrid mapping was used to localize the MADS on human chromosomes using high resolution Gene Bridge 4 radiation hybrid panels Research Genetics Inc Carlsbad CA USA Based on the sequences of differential products isolated from RDA experiments 10 pairs of PCR primers were designed for 10 groups of candidate gene sequences Based on the PCR results chromosome localization of these sequences was determined using the Whitehead Institute MIT databases 22 Fluorescence in situhybridization of MADS IX Chromosome preparations were made from phytohemagglutinin stimulated peripheral blood lymphocyte cultures from normal individuals The slides were fixed in methanol acetic acid and were air dried The probes used for fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH were the Spectrum Green labeled centromere of 8 Vysis Downers Grove IL USA and the Spectrum Green labeled 2 kb sized MADS IX sequence Primers were designed from the BAC clone NCBI NIH USA RP11 407 containing the MADS IX sequence to obtain a 2 kb sized PCR product encompassing the MADS IX region Table 1 The 2 kb DNA fragment was run on a 1 gel isolated from gel and eluted in water and was labeled with Spectrum Green using the nick translation method following the manufacturer s instructions Vysis Three day old slides were denatured in 70 formamide 2 SSC sodium citrate chloride solution at 74 C The dehydrated and air dried slides were used for hybridization according to published methods with some modifications 23 24 The slides were counter stained with 4 6 diamidino 2 phenylindole dihydrochloride Molecular Probes Eugene OR USA and images were captured on the Nikon E800 using the Quips Pathvysion system Applied Imaging Santa Clara CA USA Results Isolation of candidate MADS RDA was performed with the DNA recovered by SCM from normal cells and from metastatic cells in the lymph nodes of a patient with ductal mammary carcinoma Since the objective was to isolate sequences that are lost in the progression of cells from normal to metastasis we focused on the products of RDA in which the metastatic cell DNA was used as the driver and the normal cell DNA was the tester As shown in Fig 1 RDA differential products were isolated and DNA was extracted from each of the five bands obtained from the loss side of the third round of hybridization and DNA from each band was cloned separately One hundred clones from each DNA band were saved and a subset of 100 clones 20 clones from each differential product was selected randomly for further characterization These 100 clones were probed labeled with 32P dCTP on dot blots containing normal cell DNA and metastatic cell DNA It was found that 79 clones hybridized only with the normal cell DNA and did not hybridize with DNA from the metastatic cells Fig 2a The remaining clones hybridized with both normal cell DNA and the metastatic cell DNA This may have been due to incomplete subtraction Of the 79 clones that hybridized only with the DNA of the normal cells 50 were selected and tested further by Southern blotting to verify the RDA results None of these clones hybridized with the DNA of the metastatic cells and all were detected in normal cells Fig 2b Sequencing and homology search of candidate MADS RDA derived 50 clones that were sequenced and those with identical sequences were grouped Ten unique candidate MADS were thus identified The sequence homologies found by searching the nucleotide databases of these MADS are presented in Table 2 The search revealed that these MADS have homology with sequences on chromosome 1 MADS III chromosome 5 MADS I chromosome 6 MADS VII and MADS VIII chromosome 7 MADS VI chromosome 10 MADS IX chromosome 15 MADS X chromosome 16 MADS V and chromosome 21 MADS II Nine of these MADS have about 82 99 homology to known human DNA sequences and the remaining MADS IV was found to be novel having no homology with the sequences in the gene banks Radiation hybrid mapping of MADS We used the GeneBridge 4 Radiation Hybrid panel Research Genetics Inc to localize these 10 MADS on human chromosomes For this physical mapping and also to be able to use these sequences to screen additional patient samples primer pairs were designed for each sequence and tested by PCR on a positive control human genomic DNA and on two negative controls Chinese hamster genomic DNA and no template Of the 10 MADS tested only five MADS IV MADS VII MADS VIII MADS IX and MADS X were successfully mapped to specific human chromosomes Table 2 Of these five MADS MADS IV did not show any match with gene bank sequences and therefore appeared to be a novel DNA sequence The chromosome localizations for MADS VII MADS VIII MADS IX and MADS X obtained by physical mapping and by homology search data were in agreement Further characterization of MADS IX While the homology results of MADS IX revealed that it has 94 homology with the sequence on chromosome 10q BAC AC022541 10 the radiation hybrid mapping showed that MADS IX is localized to a 21cR interval between markers D105539 and D10S549 corresponding to human chromosome 10 band q21 1 25 To confirm that MADS IX is not an artifact and is actually a human DNA sequence located on chromosome 10q we used the sequence as a fluorescence in situ hybridization probe on human metaphase chromosomes Based on the sequence of the BAC clone NCBI RP11 407 encompassing MADS IX a 2 kb DNA fragment containing MADS IX was generated by PCR To localize MADS IX cytologically we labeled the 2 kb sized MADS IX with Spectrum Green Vysis and hybridized on normal human metaphase chromosomes Figure 3shows that the MADS IX probe was hybridized on the 10q21 region The Spectrum Green labeled centromere of chromosome 8 Vysis was used as a control To determine whether MADS IX is indeed associated with metastasis DNA was screened from cells recovered with the LCM method from normal primary and metastatic tissue samples from five additional patients Because MADS IX was mapped to chromosome 10q21 we also wanted to determine whether it was located in the region encompassing a well known metastasis associated gene PTEN 15 First DNA samples from these five patients were screened by PCR using primers designed for MADS IX and PTEN MADS IX showed PCR amplification in normal cell DNA samples of all the five patients but the intensities of the PCR bands were less in the primary tumor cell DNA samples and were totally undetectable in the metastatic cell DNA of patients 1 and 3 Fig 4 The PTEN gene on the contrary was detected without any difference in the intensity of PCR bands in the DNA samples of normal cells primary tumor cells and metastatic lymph node cells of all five patients Second MADS IX and PTEN were screened in four breast tumor cell lines HCC 1806 HCC 1143 HCC 1428 and HCC 1937 and matched normal DNA The first three tumor cell lines had known losses in specific chromosomal regions and the fourth had loss of homozygosity of the PTEN gene PCR screening of MADS IX and PTEN showed that MADS IX is present in all four tumor cell lines but PTEN is only present in cell lines HCC 1806 HCC 1143 and HCC 1428 and is missing in HCC 1937 Fig 5 Discussion Reports show a statistically significant increase in loss of heterozygosity events involving unknown genes on chromosome 16q 26 on chromosome 10q 15 and on chromosome 14q 27 in metastatic breast cancers Measuring loss of heterozygosity O Connell et al 27 found that the majority of lymph node negative primary breast tumors did not amplify a region linked to D14S62 and D14S51 while lymph node positive breast tumors retained heterozygosity for these markers These data could imply the existence of metastasis promoting gene s in that region or alternatively the observed molecular changes may be used as a marker of metastatic propensity 28 In the present investigation we used RDA in an attempt to identify genetic alterations related to breast cancer metastasis by comparing normal cell DNA and metastatic cell DNA of a ductal breast carcinoma patient Ten unique candidate MADS were identified and the sequence homologies found by searching the gene bank of these MADS are presented in Table 2 The search revealed 82 99 homology to known human gene sequences for nine of these MADS but MADS IV was found to be novel having no homology with the sequences in the gene banks Further characterization of MADS IX revealed interesting information on the genes and sequence tagged sites STS markers surrounding it Within a range of 1 4 Mb of MADS IX we noticed two CDC2 genes cell division cycle 2 protein isoform 1 and isoform 2 and two splice variants of the ZWINT gene without known exact function In the range of 821 kb there are nine STS markers RH26942 SHGC 58267 SHGC 79901 AFM336XD1 SHGC 103705 SHGC 3856 SHGC 84937 STSG72171 and SHGC 81245 Physical and cytological mapping of MADS IX confirmed that it is located at 10q21 1 Screening of MADS IX on DNA samples from five more sets of normal primary and matched metastatic tumor samples Fig 4 revealed that MADS IX is lost in the transition from normal cells to primary cells to metastasis cells in two of five cases three of six cases if the case used in the RDA assay is included PCR screening of PTEN on these five patient samples and screening of MADS IX and PTEN on a breast carcinoma cell line that had loss of homozygosity of the PTEN gene revealed that MADS IX is neither a part of the PTEN gene or localized in the homozygous loss region of chromosome 10q encompassing the PTEN gene These findings together strongly suggest that MADS IX is a candidate marker for a novel metastasis suppressor gene Additional archival cases are being screened to determine whether MADS IX is a reliable marker for metastasis
