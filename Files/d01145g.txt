usingthese protocols to continue to serve the Congress for the benefitof the American people We will continue to monitor the applicationof these protocols and will consider what if any changes

governing GAOwork for the Congress involving audits program reviews andevaluations analyses and investigationsTo effectively support the Congress GAO must be professionalobjective factbased nonpartisan nonideological fair andbalanced in all its work All GAO products and services shouldconform to generally accepted and applicable auditing accountinginvestigative and evaluation principles and standards GAO willonly undertake work that is within its scope of authority andcompetency GAO will strive to meet the Congress needs withinavailable resources and exercise the independence necessary toguarantee that its products and work conform to professionalstandards and the agencys core values of accountabilityintegrity and reliabilitySources of GAO GAO undertakes work throughthree primary means congressional mandates  congressional requestsWorkand  legal authority allowing GAO to undertake work intendedto support the CongressSetting PrioritiesGAO has a statutory obligation to fulfill requests from theCongress and its committees To effectively accomplish thisobligation GAO senior officials consult regularly with committeeMembers and their staffs to ensure that GAOs work is prioritizedin accordance with the committees needs and GAOs resources bysubject matter To ensure adherence to GAOs core values effectivemanagement practices and efficient use of available resources GAOwill prioritize its work in the following orderCongressional mandates senior leader requests andcommittee leader requestsCommittee Member requestsIndividual Member requestsCongressional mandates include requirements specificallydirected by statutes conference reports or committee reportsSenior leader requests include requests from the President ProTempore Senate Majority Leader Senate Minority Leader Speaker ofthe House House Majority Leader or House Minority LeaderCommittee leader requests are those from the committee orsubcommittee Chair Ranking Minority Member Ranking Member orboth on a program or activity within the committees jurisdictionCommittee Member requests are those involving a program or activitywithin the jurisdiction of the Members assigned committeesIndividual Member requests are those for work where the program oractivity is not within the jurisdiction of the Members assignedcommitteesWith respect to setting priorities GAO considers the nature ofthe requested work in light of Senate and House rules governing thecommittees including their appropriation authorizationbudgetary and oversight jurisdiction over a program or activityWhen jurisdictional issues arise GAO will encourage Members andstaff to consult with each other to resolve any related disputesIn doing so they may seek a resolution through the Senate or HouseparliamentarianGAO devotes a limited portion of its resources for research anddevelopment that enables GAO to invest in issues the Congress may need to address in thefuture and  provide products of broad institutional interest tothe Congress This work includes compendiums such as periodicreports on highrisk areas and other governmentwide major managementchallengesCongressional MandatesGAO treats work that is directed by congressional mandatesdifferently from congressional requests Because congressionalmandates are established by either the entire Congress or one ormore committees it is GAOs policy that products prepared inresponse to congressional mandates are issued without anyrestrictions ie immediately available to the entire Congressand the public When mandates direct GAO to report to a specificcommittee GAO will work with the majority and minority of thedesignated committee to clarify our reporting objectives and timeframes If the mandate does not specify a committee GAO will workwith the committees of jurisdiction majority and minority as setforth in Senate and House rules and any other committees andorMembers identified by the committees of jurisdiction GAO will meetwith designated committees and Members regarding the scope andtiming of work While the work is ongoing GAO will provide them periodic status reports on the work  briefings on thepreliminary and final results of the work and  notificationbefore the draft product is sent to the agency for comment andoffer a copy of the draft for informational purposesCongressional RequestsCongressional

provide the requester the rationalefor declining the work eg the requested work is outside GAOsscope of authority GAO already has ongoing work addressing theissue or resource constraints limit our ability to respond to aMember request GAO will where appropriate suggest alternativesto meet the requesters needs In consideration of its pastpractice for requests from GAOs oversight

accept the request When Members submitindependent requests on the same issue and GAO has not formallyaccepted the requests GAO will consult with the Members and theirstaffs and will merge requests only if the requesters agreeOtherwise GAO will issue separate products In limitedcircumstances however GAO will work with the requesters to mergemultiple requests it receives relating to a major event such as anatural disaster or accidentAfter accepting the request GAO will initiate a meeting withthe requesters staff within  business days of receiving therequest to gain a better understanding of the requesters need forinformation and the nature of the research questions During thismeeting GAO will also  discuss GAOs ability to respond withinthe desired time frame  provide a verbal estimate of the levelof GAO resources required and  advise the requester that asthe original requester only he or she can approve corequestersIf this option is exercised GAO will send a letter to the

Thesecircumstances involve situations in which the request  addressesan important issue of broad interest to multiple committees or theCongress as a whole  involves an issue that is a legislativepriority or is on a fast legislative track or  asks for acompilation of information which GAO has developed from asubstantial body of prior work andor work originally requested byothers In such cases GAO will advise the requester that it cannotdo the work as a request but will instead address the issue as partof GAOs research and development workOn rare occasions the results of ongoing congressionallyrequested work may be important and relevant to pending legislationeg when GAO has information which could inform the legislativedebate on the Senate or House floor or other
