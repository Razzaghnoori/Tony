 Hi What s your name My name is Gloria Cotton And uh Gloria what s your age I m 50 OK Um is the United States your uh birth country Yes it is And uh I assume um that English is your native language Native and only language OK Um well um we wanted to talk about um a favorite story and um do you have a favorite story A favorite story about anything About anything It could be a traditional story like you find in a folk tale or out of a book Or it could be a family story that gets passed down Um do you have a one of those types of stories Yes I believe I have It s not a family story It s a story from The Bible Is that OK That s great OK So it s it s written as opposed to oral Yes Yes OK Uh who Did you read this story itself yourself when you were young or was it first told to you by someone No it was first told to me by my grandmother who is um was my first teacher and remains my hero Even though she s no longer physically on the planet Uh huh How old were you when she shared this story with you My first recollection I was three That s that s very young Uh it s interesting how uh stories become so impressionable the younger the hearer Yes Uh well would you care to relate the story to me now Sure OK Well this story and I must tell you I haven t read this in The Bible so I don t know if it s totally accurate but I prefer to get it like this There was a huge crowd of people and um Jesus decided that what he wanted to do was to uh entertain the little children And all the adults were standing around not really paying much attention to the children because children of course were supposed seen and uh not heard and not really much being seen actually And Jesus uh actually made all the adults move aside and let the little children come up And he said Suffer the little children In other words you know it might be painful for you or inconvenient for you adult people but Let the children come to me and forbid them not don t stop them from coming They have a place here too And he sat and talked with these little children and he hugged them and loved them all And she told me that everyone has to be like a little child to God and that God loves everyone just like He is their own father and they are His children because of what they are And that children actually the innocence of children the unconditional love of children is the way that we now that I m an adult that adults need to be with each other and that the greatest lesson in that when you can be like a little child then you are doing what s pleasing to God Uh huh And also and the thing that I resonated with as a kid was that you always had a special place and a special protection and a special love uh from Jesus and God and that was another thing that made me feel special as a little girl Uh huh So could you reiterate the message quote unquote um that you got from the story from your point of view The message again that I get from the story for me personally was that there would always be a special connection between me and God and actually was just another of the ways my grandmother put for me to learn or believe that I could do anything I could be anything because I had a special connection and special protection um from not only her which was more important for me at the time Right But also from God and that that would always be there that the way that she was able to do it was actually by remembering to me to be more child like more innocent And that keeps me as an adult one remembering to pray like a child and to maintain some of the innocence which is difficult of a child And I think that brings a smile to God s face Um as a child what did you like most about the story as opposed to what you would like most about it now Were they the same or different No What I liked about it was that kids were special And you know with this you know it wasn t many opportunities for kids to be special because kids weren t you know you were pushed out of adult conversation and just really pushed to the side Uh huh Again that seen and not heard kind of thing Right And I liked the fact that the adults were made to wait Yes And be seen and not heard while the children were give a special place of honor So I liked that Yes Do you have a chance to re tell this story um in your work or to your own children How have you shared it over the years Well you know it s really interesting that we re talking about this because my son who is now 28 I guess I shared it with my children when they were growing up but not in any particular special way but my son is in therapy now and uh this is one of the visioning exercises that this therapist told him that he should do whenever he is angry to imagine that he is one of the little children that Jesus is putting his arms around And so he came home and told me about that and he and I had a discussion about that and it took me back to the safety and this warm feeling I had when I was a kid Uh huh I think in my work what I remember to do and what I write into every single class that I facilitate OK no matter what it is if it s leadership conflict no matter what is what I call a STAR model And it s an acronym for Sensitivity Trust Appreciation and Respect Uh huh And all of that is the same feeling from that story that I had when I was a kid And I try to tell people this is the environment you want to try to tell my students to encourage them to embrace the kind of environment where it s safe to agree or disagree to discuss anything And be more productive when you have this sense of honoring and valuing I don t say words like Love and I don t mention Jesus I don t talk about any deity um because that s part of the respect too I firmly am committed to that That not all people are and I don t want to put up any walls for them Uh huh So it s more a context that I am interesting in them embracing If they want to say Working from the universe or Good business sense or God I don t care what they call it Um I let them use whatever words to describe the behaviors that is gonna get you there So it s that same feeling that is created in my workshops that I had when I was a kid actually You um tantalized me with the reference to your grandmother and that she is still your hero Yes Could you describe her Hmm Describe her and what she did Why she s my hero Right What attributes did she have that made you um respect her and view her as your hero even to this day She had the ability to first of all she didn t know any strangers And having first met someone she had the ability to quickly make them feel they had been in the family and not only in the family but a loved member and close member of the family She would make everyone feel comfortable respected and more than that truly loved truly truly loved everyone And as a little girl being blessed to grow up with her I lived with her and my grandfather and my brother and I lived with them until I was six years old exclusively My mother was working and that was fine the best thing she could have ever done to take me to my grandparents And she really just instilled in me a sense of centering and acceptance of who I am a clarity of understanding that I could really do anything that I put my mind to There s nothing that I could not do if I wanted to do it A sense of strong independence to the point that I never had I never had the problem of worrying about peer pressure When I was in elementary school high school or college never ever did I have that thing with my friends like smoking so I had to smoke I didn t none of that because I was very much my own individual and very centered and grounded And I got that from her truly unconditional love Truly unconditional love She would correct me when I was wrong very lovingly but I never ever doubted that she loved me never Um and I to this day I live my life um for the most part in ways that I m always seeking her approval and I think she is my touchstone and my benchmark And I think if Mama would be pleased with this it is good So you know I have my standards and I match my standards to what her standards would have been I believe Uh huh How old were you when she passed She died in 1982 so what does that make me I was born in 1949 I can t do that math in my head That s OK Well you ve described a wonderful person and that highly complements the story you told I mean they re so hand in glove that I sort of see it as one seamless piece that you ve shared Yes So I really I really do appreciate it Was there anything that I failed to ask that I should have relating to this story that you ve told or background to the story that you ve told No I would want to thank you for asking me those questions though because it s given me the opportunity to go back to a very precious place to feel her love really really present and um you know that makes me smile all over Well the magic is that she can be in two places at once because I feel it too Oh great Wonderful That embrace is very special Well Gloria thank you very much and I do appreciate everything you ve shared You re welcome Thank you
