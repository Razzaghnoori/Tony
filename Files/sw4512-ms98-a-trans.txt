        Joe what do you think the election turnouts gonna be this year do you think its gonna be typically     uh this this year uh i think its interesting uh we i mean theres so many candidates still that uh we have well theres uh we have uh uh Clinton and uh uh Brown of course yeah and then uh i dont know if youve heard much about this this other guy the independent Perot   Brown oh yes hes from Dallas   he may be drawing off some uh Republican votes and uh so it  seem George Bush has completely locked up the republican although i think i dont   yes   i guess he has but   if do you think theres gonna be enough excitement that well have more people voting   uh i dont know i think thats i think thats hard to say i know uh Clinton and Brown are both trying to go after what whatever the block vote whatever thats supposed to be and uh i dont know i i think itll be interesting i know a a lot of people have you know are are starting to feel are are more you know with the recession uh recession and everything i think a lot more people are starting to uh become more politically actively i mean   yeah   i think i think there will be more why what do you think   well i i dont know i i think in terms of uh the national elections the election later this year since Perot is from Dallas and if he gets on the   umhum umhum   uh ballot i think there we that we will have the larger percentage of voter turnout than usual   oh you see if yeah right right   but i i think its pathetic that only half of the people in the country that are eligible tend to vote in the national elections   yeah   i and i think it represents uh malaise due to well my vote doesnt count it doesnt matter anyway its its really i think its more of a problem in the local elections   right yeah yeah i agree yeah yeah i yeah i definitely agree with you there i mean its people i mean that that dont care much about uh uh like federal things or you know things you know uh like the deficit people who dont who dont really care about stuff like that really dont have any clues to whats going on like right under right in their own towns or counties or state or whatever so yeah i agree with you yeah i think people are even you know   i its its too bad i you have more control over your local politicians   yeah yeah you youd think people would be more i dont know because theyre more in touch uh theyre you know geographically i mean uh geographically hm   easier to get a hold of  its easier theyre easier to get a hold of its not a long distance call for one thing   exactly sure yeah and i mean most of them are even you know youll see them you know you know however many times a year theyre actually in your city you know in your neighborhood or whatever but uh yeah i guess yeah it is interesting how that works and people just i dont know they just   do you vote   uh yeah yeah yeah i do vote uh i know if i when i first registered uh i guess with the last election uh i was uh in my late teens so i only really registered and voted for the uh who was that then that was uh Dukakis and uh uh yeah Dukakis and Bush i guess it was the last time that was i guess that was the first presidential election i voted in but uh   yeah   at that time i was really apolitical i mean you know that and like you said about uh local uh government or local uh politics i was just you know not in in touch at all   well i i think in your case college students in general pretend not to pay that much attention to the local politics i think theyve got enough going on   yeah yeah thats thats thats true yeah   thats not a part of your world   no no thats true um   campus elections are more important i suppose   campus campus yeah  yeah yeah thats thats thats another thats another thing too   but there theres voter apathy there isnt there   yeah well id say so sure i i know ive never voted in any of the just uh and why i i dont know i just dont see any i dont uh i dont see any importance at all in my vote in the you know in that in that even that smaller uh   isnt   uh arena of politics i dont even see uh you know any kind of influence or anything or any you know   yeah   uh um but uh federally definitely i i think everybody should be you know uh should definitely be uh uh aware of uh you know the presidential elections they should be you know uh   participate a little more but then uh   yeah yeah they should they should participate uh you know   but also think about this if theyre dumb enough to not vote do we really want them to vote   um yeah  yeah but but but i i i think itll be interesting to see you know uh i think the people that vote are the people who um       jeez now now thats hard to say its hard to say who votes and and why um   some of us i think do it out of habit   yeah i i mean   thats a good habit to have   yeah oh it is it is and uh
