 Background Large DNA viruses of bacteria and eukaryotes have complex life cycles with several distinct phases that involve diverse virus host interactions An array of regulatory systems mediate activation or repression of expression of specific batteries of viral genes that are required at different phases of the life cycle Other sets of regulatory genes directly interact with components of the host cell and modulate its response to the virus 1 2 3 Studies on these viral regulatory systems have revealed a pivotal role of transcription and chromatin organization in the control of gene expression and have contributed to the basic understanding of these processes in various model systems 1 3 Several viral DNA binding regulators have conserved domains that are shared with cellular transcription factors The classic helix turn helix HTH domain proteins which govern the switch between the lysogenic and lytic pathways of temperate bacteriophages and repressors containing the MetJ Arc domain are well known examples of such regulatory DNA binding proteins in prokaryotic virus host systems 4 5 6 7 8 Large eukaryotic DNA viruses such as poxviruses phycodnaviruses phaeoviruses asfarviruses iridoviruses all of which form the recently identified monophyletic clade of nucleo cytoplasmic large DNA viruses NCLDVs 9 baculoviruses and herpesviruses also encode a number of transcription factors Some of these share domains with regulatory proteins of their eukaryotic hosts for example the FCS zinc finger and the TFIIS like zinc ribbon 9 Much less is known of the domain architecture and evolutionary history of those viral DNA binding regulatory proteins whose cellular homologs have not yet been identified For example the baculovirus repeat ORFs Bro proteins are a family of DNA binding proteins that may regulate both viral and host transcription or chromatin structure but no homologs cellular or otherwise have been identified for these proteins 10 11 The regulatory proteins of the poxviral variola D6R Shope fibroma virus N1R family have been shown to bind DNA and probably regulate apoptosis of the host cell 12 All these proteins contain a conserved amino terminal domain for which no homologs outside this family have as yet been reported These proteins additionally contain a carboxy terminal RING finger domain 13 and some of them also contain a single stranded nucleic acid binding CCCH domain between the amino terminal domain and the RING finger During the comparative analysis of DNA viruses of the NCLDV class 9 we observed that the amino terminal domain of the D6R N1R family and baculoviral Bro family proteins have a wide range of homologs in both DNA viruses and cellular genomes Typically these domains were identified in multidomain proteins that additionally contained several previously undetected evolutionarily mobile domains occurring in different contexts These observations suggested the existence of a common previously uncharacterized set of regulatory proteins domains encoded by numerous eukaryotic and bacterial DNA viruses as well as some of their host genomes To gain a better understanding of the functions and evolution of these regulatory proteins we initiated a detailed analysis of their sequences using position specific score matrix searches sequence structure threading secondary structure prediction and structure comparisons Here we describe the functional predictions and evolutionary history of these viral regulatory proteins and their cellular homologs that were detected as a result of these analyses The comparison of the domain architectures of these proteins points to a major general role for combinatorial shuffling of a small set of domains in the evolution in transcriptional regulators of eukaryotic and bacterial DNA viruses Results and discussion Identification of the KilA N domain in diverse viral proteins and its potential relationship to APSES and LAGLIDADG domains To determine the evolutionary affinities of the D6R N1R amino terminal regions we initiated a PSI BLAST search of the non redundant NR protein database National Center for Biotechnology Information which was seeded with the sequence of the corresponding region from the variola virus D6R protein This search not only recovered homologous proteins from almost all poxviral proteomes but also previously undetected homologs from the Chilo iridescent virus a variety of proteobacterial temperate phages such as KilA of the phage BPP1 and chromosome encoded proteins from Neisseria meningitidis Xylella fastidiosa Salmonella paratyphi and Clostridium difficile Table 1 Figure 1a The presence of this conserved region in the amino terminus of the BPP1 KilA protein which is involved in killing the host cells 14 with another distinct conserved carboxy terminal region Figure 2 suggests that this region is a mobile domain that is present in different proteins in independent contexts Accordingly this domain was named the KilA N terminal domain Table 2 In all proteins shown to contain the KilA N domain it occurs at the extreme amino terminus accompanied by a wide range of distinct carboxy terminal domains other than the RING finger or CCCH domains that are seen in the poxviruses Figure 2and see below PSI BLAST searches seeded with the KilA N domains from a diverse set of viral and bacterial proteins also consistently recovered fungal transcription factors that are involved in cell cycle specific gene expression and filamentation with E values of borderline statistical significance 0 05 0 15 These hits precisely mapped to the APSES DNA binding domain which is shared by a range of fungus specific transcription factors such as MBP1p SWI4p PHD1p and SOK2p from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Stunted A from Aspergillus nidulans 15 For example a search initiated with the KilA N domain of Pseudomonas phage D3 Orf11 gi 9635595 recovered the APSES domain of Saccharomyces MBP1p with an E value of 0 05 in iteration 3 Reciprocal searches with the profiles of APSES domains similarly recovered the KilA N domain with borderline E values As an example a profile seeded with the MBP1p APSES domain and including all APSES domains in the NR database detects the N meningitidis protein NMA1544 gi 11290039 with an E value of 0 1 in iteration 3 Given the availability of the three dimensional structure of the APSES domain of the MBP1p protein 16 17 we investigated this potential relationship using the KilA N domain sequences for sequence structure threading of the PDB database with the 3DPSSM PSIPRED and combined fold prediction algorithms Both 3DPSSM and PSIPRED gave hits E value approximately 0 05 for 3DPSSM and probability of matching approximately 0 8 for PSIPRED that implied a 90 certainty of the KilA N domain adopting the same fold as the APSES domain PDB 1bm8 1bm1 Additionally the 3DPSSM threading also suggested that the LAGLIDADG endonuclease domain 18 E value 0 2 approximately 80 certainty shared a common fold with the KilA N proteins Threading with the combined fold prediction algorithm also gave the MBP1p APSES domain as the best hit with a very high Z score Z 60 suggesting that the KilA N domain was highly likely to adopt the same fold as the APSES domain Secondary structure prediction using the Jpred method 19 with a multiple alignment of the KilA N domain used as the input pointed to an fold with four conserved strands and at least two conserved helices This predicted secondary structure of the KilA N domain with a head to tail dyad of a 2 strand helix unit Figure 1a is identical to the secondary structure seen in the conserved core of the APSES domains Structural comparisons using the DALI program 20 indicated that the core fold shared by the KilA N and APSES domains is more distantly related to the LAGLIDADG site specific DNA endonucleases and the amino terminal domain of the tRNA splicing endonucleases TEN domain Figure 1b 21 Three dimensional superpositions of the three of these domains for which structures are available aligned the C atoms with a root mean square deviation of 3 2 or less for approximately 60 residues A search with the APSES domain PDB 1bm8 using the VAST program 22 detected significant structural alignments with both the LAGLIDADG and the TEN domains p approximately 10 4 The structural similarity between the TEN domain and LAGLIDADG nuclease domain has been previously noted 23 but the connection of both of these with the APSES domains has not been reported before to our knowledge We noticed however that although the TEN domain is related to the LAGLIDADG endonucleases the active site residues are not preserved in the former and the TEN domain probably functions as a RNA binding domain rather than a nuclease These observations suggest that the APSES LAGLIDADG and TEN domains together with the KilA N domain define a novel nucleic acid binding fold with a conserved 2 2 core Figure 1b Previously it had been proposed that the APSES domains were related either to the winged HTH or to the basic helix loop helix bHLH domains 16 17 24 These connections are not however recovered in any sensitive sequence profile or structural similarity searches A direct comparison of the structures also showed that the only domains that share a similar topology and conformation with the APSES domain are the LAGLIDADG and TEN domains This implies that the previously proposed relationships for the APSES domain are unlikely to represent the true evolutionary connections A comparison of the multiple alignment of the KilA N and APSES domains showed that several characteristic hydrophobic aromatic residues were conserved between the two families Figure 1a suggesting that they have similar functional properties The APSES domains principally bind specific DNA sequences associated with regulatory regions of numerous genes expressed in the G1 to S transition of the cell cycle in yeast 25 26 The sequence relationship with the APSES domain taken together with the evidence of DNA binding by the D6R N1R protein 12 suggests that the KilA N domain is a previously undetected DNA binding domain that is prevalent in the viral world This prediction was also supported by the evidence from mutations to the conserved KilA N domain of N1R that affected the localization of this protein to viral DNA containing cytoplasmic virus maturation complexes virus factories 12 The phyletic patterns of the KilA N and APSES domains have interesting implications for the origin of the fungal transcription factors Unlike several DNA binding domains conserved throughout eukaryotes such as the homeodomain the bHLH bZip C2H2 zinc finger and the RFX domain APSES domains are restricted to fungi 27 28 Their closest relatives are the KilA N domains which are widespread in diverse DNA viruses and prophage derivatives from bacterial genomes This suggests that APSES domains probably emerged early in fungal evolution from a viral KilA N like precursor that was acquired by the host cell An alternative scenario that the viral KilA N domains were acquired from the fungal APSES domain is also imaginable This appears less likely however because the APSES domains show limited sequence diversity in the fungi compared with the much greater sequence diversity of the KilA N domain in a wide range of DNA viruses that had probably already diverged by the time fungi emerged Figure 1a Furthermore the viral provenance of the APSES like domains is analogous to the recruitment of the transposon derived BED finger domain in cell cycle specific transcription factors such as BEAF 1 and DREF in the arthropods 29 Both viruses and transposons are likely to derive selective advantages by evolving transcription factors that regulate their genes in response to the host cell cycle Hence from the above observations it is not unlikely that the host cells co opt the transcription factors of their genomic parasites for their own cell cycle specific gene expression The potential higher order structural relationship between the APSES and KilA N domains with the LAGLIDADG site specific DNA endonucleases and tRNA endonuclease amino terminal domains has interesting implications for their evolutionary affinities and origin A structural comparison of these proteins indicates that the nuclease active site of the LAGLIDADG domains is contained in a specific amino terminal helical extension packed against the core 2 2 domain common to all these proteins Figure 1b 30 The KilA N APSES and TEN terminal domains lack the equivalent residues of the specific active site extension of the LAGLIDADG nucleases suggesting that the former domains do not possess nuclease activity Thus it appears plausible that these domains evolved from an ancestral nucleic acid binding module that on one hand gave rise to the nucleases through the acquisition of an amino terminal helical extension that provided the active site and on the other hand diversified into distinct nucleic acid binding domains Like the KilA N domains that are mainly associated with DNA viruses the LAGLIDADG endonucleases are predominantly encoded by mobile genetic elements 31 Just as the APSES domain appears to be a derivative of a KilA N domain captured by the cellular genome the TEN domains appear to have been derived through the ancient cellular capture of an inactive LAGLIDADG like domain 32 The common ancestor of this fold might have emerged in a mobile genomic symbiont or parasite and subsequently spread widely across viral and transposon genomes Conserved domains in the Bro proteins The baculovirus Bro proteins are encoded by a multigene family and represent another class of virus specific DNA binding regulators whose evolutionary affinities are not yet understood The typical Bro proteins that have been experimentally investigated are BroA BroC and BroD from Bombyx mori nuclear polyhedrosis virus BmNV 11 In addition to baculoviruses we observed that the NCLDV class members such as poxviruses and iridoviruses also encoded homologs of the Bro proteins Proteins such as FPV124 from fowlpox virus and three distinct proteins encoded by the entomopoxvirus AMV showed similarity only to the carboxy terminal part of the baculovirus Bro proteins whereas on their amino terminus they contain a KilA N domain Figure 2 In contrast another group of entomopoxvirus proteins such as MSV226 from MSV and AMV262 from AMV showed similarity only to the amino terminal part of the baculovirus Bro proteins Yet another set of viral proteins such as MSV194 from MSV ORF117 from the phaeovirus ESV and baculovirus proteins such as BroE of BmNV combine the region homologous to the amino terminal segment of the typical Bro proteins with another distinct domain that occurs in a stand alone form in the phage T5 ORF172 protein This suggests that the typical Bro proteins contain distinct amino and carboxy terminal domains Bro N and Bro C respectively that are present independently of each other and in distinct contexts in a variety of other viral proteins To uncover their entire range of diversity we initiated PSI BLAST sequence profile searches seeded separately with the sequences of the Bro N and Bro C domains The Bro C domain was essentially restricted to the eukaryotic viruses of the baculovirus and NCLDV classes Table 1 In contrast the Bro N domain was more widely distributed occurring in a stand alone form or combined with other domains in proteins from temperate phages that infect Gram positive bacteria and Myxococcus xanthus and proteins encoded in the genomes of proteobacteria and Gram positive bacteria The P22 antirepressor protein which regulates phage transcription 33 34 is one of the previously characterized bacteriophage proteins in which the Bro N domain was observed Studies on the BmNV BroA protein have shown that it binds DNA with high affinity and associates with the chromatin in the BmNV infected cells 11 Additionally it has been shown that the DNA binding determinants of the BroA protein map to the amino terminal 80 amino acids that correspond to the Bro N domain defined above 10 Thus the Bro N domain appears to define a distinct superfamily of widespread viral DNA binding domains Multiple alignment based secondary structure prediction of the Bro N domain reveals a core with two head to tail units of a hairpin followed by an helix Figure 3 Thus the Bro N domain adopts an fold furthermore the pattern of predicted secondary structure elements was similar to that seen in the KilA N domain and its relatives Figure 3 The multiple alignment shows that the Bro N domains contain two highly conserved aromatic or hydrophobic residues at the end of the second and fourth conserved strands a pattern that is reminiscent of similarly conserved residues in the KilA N and APSES domains Figure 3 However sequence profile searches do not detect any significant similarity between the Bro N and KilA N domains The sequence structure threading with the 3D PSSM method recovered the APSES domain structure PDB 1bm8 1bm1 as the best hit for the Bro N domain albeit with statistically insignificant E values Thus given that the Bro N domain is a DNA binding domain it appears plausible that it adopts a fold similar to that of the KilA N domain although sequence analysis and threading methods failed to provide strong support for this Extensive lineage specific expansion and domain shuffling in DNA binding regulators containing the KilA N and Bro domains There are several analogies between the KilA N and Bro N domains in terms of phyletic patterns intragenomic distribution and domain architectures Both these domains are widely prevalent in bacteriophages bacteria and large eukaryotic viruses of the NCLDV and baculovirus classes Both of them show expansions in particular viral genomes for example KilA N in FPV and Bro N in certain baculoviruses and the entomopoxvirus MSV Phylogenetic tree construction for the KilA N and Bro N domains using the least squares and maximum likelihood methods showed that multiple versions of these domains from a given genome typically grouped together to the exclusion of members from other genomes data not shown Thus KilA N and Bro N domains probably have undergone lineage specific expansions through amplification of a single ancestral gene The genes encoding multiple copies of these domains do not necessarily occur in close proximity in the corresponding genomes indicating that duplications were accompanied by extensive genome rearrangement resulting in dispersion of the paralogous genes The KilA N and the Bro N domains show additional parallels in the domain architectures of the corresponding proteins Both domains almost always are located at the amino termini of these proteins and most often are fused to another distinct domain at the carboxyl terminus Figure 2 On many occasions the Bro N and KilA N domains are fused to the same carboxy terminal domains Table 1 Figure 2 such as the Bro C T5ORF172 KilA C and Mx8P63 C domains Additionally Bro N domains show specific combinations with certain domains such as HTH and the Vsr superfamily endonuclease These architectures suggest that both the KilA N and Bro N modules are to a large extent functionally equivalent and probably act as the principal DNA binding moiety that recruits a specific activity purveyed by their carboxy terminal domains to the target DNA sequences These carboxy terminal modules may be enzymes such as the nuclease domains or might mediate additional specific interactions with nucleic acids or proteins Thus the principal function of these proteins appears to be transcriptional regulation of viral or host genes Consistent with this hypothesis these proteins include antirepressors from phages such as BPP22 BPVT2 and BP933W The majority of the domains with which the KilA N and Bro N domains combine in multidomain proteins are restricted to proteins encoded by temperate bacteriophages and large eukaryotic DNA viruses the exceptions are a few domains that are common in cellular proteomes such as HTH CCCH and RING finger In order to identify the entire repertoire of domains involved in these domain shuffling events we systematically explored all domains that combined with the KilA N and Bro N domains and compiled a list of domains with which the latter combined in other multidomain proteins Table 2 Figure 2a This information is represented as a directed graph in Figure 2b in which each vertex corresponds to a particular domain and the edges connect domains that combine to form multidomain proteins The entire network consists of 24 domains of which Bro N and KilA N domains show by far the greatest number of connections 12 and 7 respectively compared to other domains The RHA 31ORF238 N and MSV199 domains while less versatile in their connections tend to combine with the same domains and in the same orientation as Bro N and KilA N Figure 2b which suggests an analogous function such as DNA binding Conclusions We show here that KilA N and Bro N domains are two DNA binding domains that are widespread in large DNA viruses infecting bacteria and eukaryotes At least the former and perhaps even the latter appear to belong to a large class of nucleic acid binding domains that includes the APSES LAGLIDADG endonuclease and TEN domains The fungus specific transcription factors containing the APSES domain appear to have evolved through capture of a viral KilA N like precursor early in fungal evolution KilA N and Bro N domains combine with overlapping sets of carboxy terminal domains which in turn combine with several additional domains resulting in an extensive network of 18 domains that are predominantly specific to large DNA viruses and six domains acquired by these viruses from the host genomes 18 6 24 These observations establish a major role for shuffling within a limited set of domains during evolution of viral DNA binding regulatory proteins Materials and methods The non redundant NR database of protein sequences was searched using the BLASTP program 35 Profile searches were conducted using the PSI BLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query with a profile inclusion expectation E value threshold of 0 01 and were iterated until convergence 35 36 If whole length proteins were used the searches were carried out using the composition based statistics 37 in order to prevent the detection of spurious matches that could arise from low complexity segments in the query or target proteins In searches carried out with just the globular domain of a particular protein the composition based statistics was not used because this helps in improving the sensitivity of searches without a major risk of corruption of the profile with false positives 37 Additional searches with hidden Markov models were performed using the HMMER package 38 39 Previously known conserved protein domains were detected using the corresponding position specific scoring matrices PSSMs constructed using PSI BLAST 40 Multiple alignments of protein sequences were constructed using the T Coffee program 41 followed by manual correction based on the PSI BLAST results Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for the JPRED program 19 Sequence structure threading was performed using the hybrid fold prediction method which combines multiple alignment information with secondary structure prediction 42 and the 3D PSSM method 43 Phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor joining least squares and maximum likelihood methods
