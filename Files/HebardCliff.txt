 Yeah OK This is Clifford Hebard with interview one You re doing more than one interview Yeah I have to do three Oh OK All right go ahead Tell us about Disney World All right well thank you for asking Melissa Disney World Disney World is uh is one of my favorite favorite family stories and one of the reasons why it s my favorite family story is because we had been there I think just once when you guys were real little uh no when you were two we took you back You know this story Yes You do Mmm OK so anyhow I remember it was really really hot and it was real crowded It was really crowded and uh and we got there and we didn t really know what to do what to do first so we sort of had different groups It was sort of the crazy ride group That was Mark and and Mark and Kim and me and then there was the grandparents group that would sort of you know stay in the shadows and take it easy because it really was hot And then there was the kids ride group headed by you So you and Mom spent a lot of time on the uh merry go round I forget Mom lost count how many times you were on that merry go round because you were too little I thought I rode the Small World You did You did and this is what you did the rest of the time you were at Disney World So you rode the merry go round and we d go back and meet you every once in a while and you were having a great time We didn t care and the merry go round was uh was as good as it got for you You know big smile bouncing around And then we started looking uh for other rides as we all got back together and we took you to uh I forget which other ones we went to the little helicopters I m sure and some of the other fun rides the little boats and that sort of thing and then we saw Small World and I had no idea what it was like because I had never heard of it but this is a Disney classic this is the best ride they have in a sense makes Disney makes Disney what it is And we all climbed into this boat and I m climbing into a boat thinking Who wants to do this We got in and there was lots of people around and we took you know we took a half an hour to get there because the line was really long and finally we were in the boat This little two year old perched in the front on the boat you know on the bow just floating around and I remember you were pretty quiet you didn t really say too much Dad I didn t say you could talk about me during the interview Well hey I m in charge here I m the storyteller I m just getting started Yeah OK good Uh so then we then you go through all these passage ways and you come into this um this long stretch where all of a sudden it s this like this big long cave and it s all there s stuff all around the walls and there are uh and there are all these little tiny action figures little dolls and so on jumping up and making faces and all that kind of stuff and singing and the music is uh So anyway along we came into this big cavern and there were these big dolls and bright colors and trains just kind of lurching through this this water It was really cool actually and I don t remember when it started because all of us were kind of looking around but somebody said Look at Melissa And there s this little two year old just frozen Your mouth was open your eyes were bigger than I d ever seen and just staring at everything And through the whole trip you never really moved I mean once in a while you d laugh or you d giggle and we stopped watching this great ride just watched you It was just so much fun it was like it was like the best that Disney could be at just the perfect time for a little kid We ve been to Disney I think three or four times total but that s like my all time favorite one a really good time Probably a close tie with uh Space Mountain who Kim and Mark that was fun too but um yeah those are our um OK so what else do you want me to talk about So another story that comes to mind is summer family vacation and one of my favorite was in uh Roger s Rock up in the uh Adirondacks How old you would have been You was about oh boy gosh I I would say your Mom and I were in our late thirties and you were um um well anyway it doesn t matter Um so we went to Roger s Rock you know family camping and this is not your mom s idea of the ultimate vacation Uh it kind of was mine but uh your mom wasn t so sure but we had really nice weather And we were there for a week and we had the old uh the old blue the old blue tent you remember The huge one with the three rooms and the the holes in the top that we fixed and everything that that your mom is keeping it And we had a great time We went to the beach did some shopping I think and exploring but then uh I think the next to last night we decided to have a special like a special camping end of camping trip dinner and we got everything all going We were going to be grilling and everything making beets on the stove lobster or something and barbecuing and all that And after three days of the best weather we d ever had the clouds just opened up and it started raining and it was raining really hard I remember thinking Boy it can t rain any harder than this because we were sitting there with rain pounding all around us and you know everything we owned getting wet and the tent soaking through sleeping bags getting wet And then it really started to rain I mean that was just a warm up You could barely see I mean the air was white it was amazing And I remember your mom sort of sitting in the car looking at me and I don t know what you kids were doing probably sitting in the car with her and I m standing out there in the rain I just I didn t want to leave I didn t want vacation to end And so here everyone is in the car I think with the door open or the window at least watching me and I m standing there in the rain hoping it would end not wanting to give up on my vacation or yours And I remember that it had rained so hard that the boiling water in the campfire that was cooking the beets had cooled down and I really like beets and I I remember the beets were sort a floating to the top and I remember it was sort of like this cave man moment I looked at the beet thought about it for a minute reached in kind of picked it up like an apple and thought This looks good And so I took took a big bite and I remember looking over at Mom and I don t know what she did but uh all of a sudden the signal got clear I think the car we had was one of those old station wagons The Vega remember that one Uh huh So we threw open the back of the Vega and took all our camping stuff everything We didn t even pack it we just wadded it just mushed it all up running around this incredible torrential rain shoved it into the back of the car and uh went home one night early So I don t think it was a huge concession Yeah well we got we got rained on enough that it could have been worse Uh they say this skips a generation too so this could be your future Oh really Yeah Grandpa and Grandma Hebard whenever we went camping every single time it rained it rained hard The whole time I was growing up I can think of one sunny vacation and that s it So that s a vacation story That must be about 10 minutes right Almost Almost OK so what else would you like me to Whatever you want Oh golly Other other stories I m trying to think what else I could tell you about Well I could tell you about my worst skiing trip ever OK OK this was in the summer because ski trips in the summer aren t good No This was in a place you may see some day called Zoar Valley it s in uh where is it Cattaraugus County which is the next county down from Erie County which is where Buffalo is And so that was the place where Andy and Mom and Saul the guys and I would all go in high school on weekends and usually we would just go to uh to walk along the path because it s a huge uh it s got Cattaraugus County Creek down at the bottom of it it s got great big shale cliffs with lots of really loose shale on it and usually we d walk along the stream bank and go swimming and jump off cliffs that sort of thing But once we decided to climb it it didn t look too tough to climb up so we thought What the heck let s give it a shot Andy and I did this and actually I think we climbed down from the top It was fairly shallow a fairly uh fairly shallow angle for about oh I don t know two or three hundred yards and then we couldn t see over the edge down to the creek which was like way down there This little ribbon of water So we climbed up part way down and it was like walking in uh in a in a great big pile of ball bearings you know It was like really loose It was like almost like it was snow It would crunch under your feet it got really dusty you know it wasn t like earth at all And because it was slanted you d slide on it a little bit and about 15 steps into it we looked at each other We both like skiing and went skiing Let s ski this stuff and in a little while we went Yeah you can probably see what s coming here Uh I didn t go over the edge by the way So we both started skiing and we re pretty good skiers We were jumping up and down and pretending we were parallel skiing back and forth and leaping up in the air in big clouds of dust and it was really fun and Andy finally quit He got tired and I thought I d go a little farther and I skied a few more steps and somehow one of us had dislodged a fairly good size rock which I had no idea was bouncing down the hill toward me And I m skiing away having a great time and once when I came up I remember I can still remember I came up in mid air and I was as high up off the shale as you could get making my next turn and Wham this rock smacks right into my hip It didn t hurt I wasn t injured but it hit me in just the right place so that it knocked me right over and all the sudden I was like running like I had completely lost my balance and I m running down this shale as fast as I can which is fine normally The problem is uh you can run forever because you hit this drop off and the drop is a sheer probably a hundred feet or more straight down to the creek So I was running down as fast as I can to get there so I could drop off the end And I remember thinking I can t do this And on and on we went and all I remember is it was getting closer and I really couldn t figure out a way I would try and fall down and I d sort of bounce up again and uh you almost didn t get to be my daughter because of this this was really close What I was kind of well I this was really dangerous as it turned out and I wasn t sure what I was going to do I would fall down and slide and somehow get bounced back up I didn t have an answer and little did I know the answer was right behind me It wasn t Andy he was watching all this thinking This is it So I was getting pretty close Another rock that we had knocked loose up above was bouncing down behind me and it caught me again It just smacked me right down into the shale like a big hand just pushing me right down into this loose dusty shale and hard enough so I sank in a little bit I was dug in with my fingers and my toes and began to slide on my face instead of running and slide down more and more and I stopped and as the over the years I think the distance from the drop off where I stopped gets closer and closer in about eight inches approximately I don t know it could have been 50 yards it could have been 10 feet but it was too close whatever it was And I remember sitting there and kind of looking down at the edge for a moment going Whoa That could have been it That s I think that s the closest I ever came the most dangerous thing that ever happened to me but the good news was it was easy to walk to the top It just took a while so turned back around sort of crawled through this shale listening to Andy yell insults from up above What s shale Shale is a really loose flat rock like you see next to streams sometimes Um you can like break off a layer of it sort it s like stratified Oh You know the skipping rocks you can kind of break up It s it s like that It s a metamorphic rock so it s made out of mud and it sort of gets created by the pressure of the water over thousands of years so it s really kind of a loose kind of rock and the shale that huge shale that we were skiing over had broken off up above on the shale crest and sort of collected And so we were skiing in big piles of loose rock was what it came down to That s crazy Yeah it was great so But happily you the fact that you have a father you owe to a rock Yeah really All right well that s probably enough that s about 15 minutes Is that 15 OK you sure Yeah thank you very much You re welcome
