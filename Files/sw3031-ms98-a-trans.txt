        okay what do you cook   well  i have dinner parties quite often and so we we really i really enjoy cooking um   oh really   i like desserts and uh main dishes  im a chocoholic   oh definitely oh yeah well see i consider baking different than cooking though yeah i can i can bake   do you yeah yeah         well you know the best recipes that i have come from Southern Living   oh yeah   um do you get that magazine   no but my motherinlaw tells me and gets it and just loves to get the recipes     oh its wonderful you know ive never had a recipe fail that ive gotten out of Southern Living and ive had dinner guests come over for dinner and you know say i dont know what this is going to taste like  i got it out of Southern Living its a brand new recipe and ive never tried it before and and ive never had them fail     wow thats great yeah my mother used to like pick out a magazine and show us the pictures and say okay this is what were going to have and were like oh God no   yeah right       i well well thats what i do too and it has a its been wonderful right   yeah she did really good she did really well but i mean like her four basic food groups were kind of like mine theyre frozen canned boxed and take home and       im im a very picky eater so thats another part of my problem when i look at a recipe theres ingredients that i dont like or wont taste and so its kind of difficult   uhhuh uhhuh       yeah yeah where you from originally   im from Oklahoma and then ive been in Texas for a long time but uh   Oklahoma uhhuh so youve had you you know TexMex and that kind of thing i   oh yeah definitely now see i love stuff like that but and a lot of it i will eat but theres ingredients sometimes that im just like i dont even know what that is   yeah yeah yeah well i had never had chili in my whole life until i moved down to Texas and i had Connecticut and i had never even tasted chili and i moved down here and     where are you from oh wow     its hysterical because my kids have to have a refried bean fix at least once a week  you know and its like a week has gone by and we havent had   oh yeah     fajitas or or something and and i just laugh and laugh my family would die if they knew all these things my kids were eating   oh yeah   how funny   that is funny that is funny   yeah weve always always had southern foods but uh mother my mother is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and stuff and i couldnt do that   oh really no no no i dont think i would i would care for that but you know what i recently discovered theres something um at the grocery store its called Cajun Magic   no oh really   and its like in the gourmet section of the grocery store its on the bottom shelf and and its um   uhhuh   um uh like red beans and rice with all the spices already in it and all you have to do is add water and and cook it and it is so good   ooh that does sound good   it is good it is good and its called Cajun Magic and im sure you could probably  you know i buy i buy it at Albertsons   okay ill have to look for that yeah   and um thats wonderful   huh and its in the gourmet section   well  you know where they have those kind of hard to find items you know the the real funny mustards and and that spices and things like that and thats thats where they have it at Albertsons and its really good i like   yeah yeah huh so your kids arent picky eaters   easy i have a daughter who will eat everything and a son who will eat nothing so  as a matter of fact shes babysitting tonight and she called and she said     oh   mom they had the most wonderful dinner it was Hamburger Helper  and its delicious       how funny   and i laughed   well thats what when i got married um both my husband and i had been living separately so my girlfriend wanted to give me uh a wine shower where people brought recipes   what a neat idea   yeah it was really neat because they brought the bottle of wine and then they brought a recipe that went with the bottle of wine   oh how nice   and one of my girlfriends brought a really nice bottle of wine and she had written down the number to Dominos Pizza           i love it i love it when i worked one time we had a thing where we had uh uh luncheon and everybody had to bring a dish and  somebody   oh yeah   gave directions to a to a bakery  you know turn left on Campbell Road and right on you know  and that was cute that was cute     yeah well desserts are definitely a weakness but uh oh i love them and im definitely a chocoholic but i found something its a white chocolate mousse cake   do you like desserts oh   that is just heaven   is it wonderful     yeah but i wouldnt even know how to begin to make it   oh oh   but i need to definitely find the recipe and at least attempt it because it its so good   oh i would love that i i like   yeah   im not crazy about sweets but i really have a passion for cakes any kind of cake i i really like chocolate cake and um apple cake   um yeah ooh ive never had apple cake   love apple cake oh i love apple cake or spice cake something like that yeah yeah i really like that   yeah yeah especially in the morning thats really good then   umhum yeah it is yeah it is   um well im getting hungry now   and i just got done with dinner so  um we had beef ribs and a potato casserole and a salad yeah i do i well     oh really what did you fix um God you really are a cook   you know it was so funny when i was when i was reading the things and they said you know checkoff different categories that you could talk about i thought food i could talk about food  have you not eaten yet tonight     well i i did i went to the doctor the other day and my cholesterol is really high and so hes putting me on a special diet on Tuesday and thats what when the category came up tonight i thought oh God im so glad this is tonight and not next week because   oh oh   um hes putting me on a liquid protein diet and so   oh really was your was your cholesterol that high   it was two forty and im only twenty nine years old   hum   so he said lets bring that down so hes putting me on some liquid protein and im not doing to be able to eat for two weeks   really   yeah so   really wow   yeah i kept telling my husband while a go   is two forty really that high though   it is for for me and my age bracket   yeah yeah   um so i think its supposed to be one eighty and he thought two forty was a little bit high for me   you know what i just recently got um a cookbook its its the oh whats the name of it uh Love Your Heart   oh really   cookbook its a low cholesterol cookbook and then i got the American Heart Association cookbook now this is not Southern Living   huh yeah     yeah lots of yogurt and stuff like that but if you go to like the Bookstop do you have one of those in Carrollton   yeah uhhuh yeah   um they have lots and lots of of uh cookbooks with low cholesterol recipes   huh yeah   and uh i every once in a while i get real ambitious and i think okay im going to do all this wonderful stuff and then that lasts for about a week  and then im like give me the blue cheese dressing     yeah   i want a burrito   yeah yeah give me some more refried beans have you have you tried     well its like like Oprah Winfrey says every once in a while youve just got to have ribs   oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah have you tried the the no fat no cholesterol dressings like the Kraft     yeah i ive tried them   the Italian is the Italian is not bad   well see that thats part of my problem though it goes back to being such a picky eater the only one i like is Ranch which is like the worst as far as cholesterol goes so   oh yeah and does it take have you tried that is it terrible   um i havent tried the new ones that Heart Smart or not   heartwise or heart yeah   i havent tried the the newest one yet so what ive been trying to do is just cutback because i just recently even started eating dressing and the only one i like like i said is Ranch
