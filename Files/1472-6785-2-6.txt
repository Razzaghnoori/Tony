 Background The importance of parasites in the ecology of large mammals is being increasingly recognized but empirical studies on the ecology of parasites of large mammals are scanty Parasites can potentially affect population growth of a species as well as interactions between species Apart from devastating epidemics 1 2 the milder endemic parasites can also play a major role in population regulation 3 4 Parasites have many other ecological implications in phenomena such as parasite mediated host competition 5 sex and sexual selection 6 7 8 9 10 social behaviour including xenophobia and sexual fidelity 11 foraging strategies 12 13 and predator prey dynamics 14 15 Parasites are likely to play a significant role in the ecology of tigers for twofold reasons Watve and Sukumar 16 showed that animals having less predatory pressure have greater parasite loads tigers showing the maximum loads among the 12 species they examined in the Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary The estimated parasite densities in some of the tigers in the Mudumalai wildlife sanctuary were up to 1500 flukes in the lungs or a total of 30 meter length of tapeworms in the intestine 17 Parasites in such a large amount can certainly have considerable impact on the health behaviour and reproductive success of individuals Parasites may be responsible for cub mortality and cub mortality is perhaps the most important factor in the population viability of tigers 18 Secondly parasites having the prey species as intermediate host and the predator as a definitive host may alter the predator prey dynamics 19 Parasites with a predator prey life cycle constitute a substantial proportion of the parasite community of carnivores and therefore these might have a more significant role in the ecology of predators We report here the patterns in the abundance and diversity of faecally dispersed helminth parasites of Tiger in the Tadoba National Park of central India and discuss the possible implications for tiger ecology We use the fecal densities of parasite eggs larvae and cysts referred together as parasite propagules as indicators of parasite load of an individual Coprologic studies have been used to study the parasites of wild mammals qualitatively as well as quantitatively 16 17 20 21 22 23 24 Shaw and Moss 23 found that egg densities were linearly correlated with worm burdens in Red Grouse Skorping et al 24 showed a positive correlation between worm biomass and egg output For an endangered predator such as tiger there is no alternative way of collecting sufficient number of samples Therefore despite the inherent limitations fecal examination is the only practicable way of collecting data on parasites Results and discussion Out of the 70 samples analyzed 57 were positive for helminth propagules The mean intensities in the positive samples were high propagules per gram mean 990 07 median 101 5 maximum 12 049 The mean for all samples was 792 1 The postmortem examination of a dead old tigress revealed an estimated 32 meter length of Diphyllobothrium 8 meters of Taenia sp and close to 1200 Toxascaris leonina Tapeworm segments were frequently found in fresh or old scats The parasite prevalence and abundance in tigers of Tadoba were high but substantially less as compared to two other published studies from southern India 17 16 and Thailand 20 Host species that are free of predatory pressures appear to have higher parasite loads 16 and therefore the high prevalence and abundance in tigers is not surprising There was considerable variation in the parasite loads of individuals and this could be one of the determinants in the competitive success of individuals The parasite component therefore should be an essential part of any comprehensive study of tiger ecology Parasites from 8 genera were detected in the 57 positive samples table 1 The conservative estimate of the number of biotypes based on propagule morphology was 12 and a liberal one was 21 The frequency distribution of parasite densities in all the samples was highly aggregated as indicated by the large variance to mean ratio The variances for all types of parasites were one or two orders of magnitude greater than the mean and tended to increase with the mean Similar to the observations of McCallum 25 on protozoan parasite densities in fish the double logarithmic plot of means and variances was linear with a slope close to two fig 1 The variances thus scaled linearly with the square of the mean A similar pattern was noted by Watve 17 across a range of host species The consistency of this pattern in the three unrelated situations is curious but as yet we do not know the factors that make the parasite variance scale with the square of the mean The prevalence of a parasite species was positively correlated with the mean density in positive samples Pearson s r 0 85 p 0 01 Prevalence abundance correlations are seen in other parasite communities 26 17 as well as free living communities 27 A simple explanation for this could be that parasites which have higher densities are also more easily detected and hence add to the prevalence It is also likely to be due to a spill over effect Parasites that infect individuals with greater intensities produce more propagules and thereby infect a greater proportion of individuals There was no significant correlation between the propagule densities of any two genera or any pair of operational taxonomic units OTUs see methods for explanation Therefore there was no evidence for competitive exclusion or co occurrence between any two parasites The parasite community was dominated by parasites with indirect life cycles This would be expected for hosts that occur in low densities so that direct transmission between individuals is difficult Further the short monsoon and low soil moisture perhaps makes the survival of direct lifecycle parasites more difficult Therefore unlike the prolonged monsoon habitat of Mudumalai wild life sanctuary 17 hookworms were not common in Tadoba National Park Particularly common were Diphyllobothrium and Taenia sp Unlike the findings of Watve 17 and Patton and Robinowitz 20 Paragonimus and Capillaria were not common Diphyllobothrium was the most prevalent and was detected in 37 samples and densities up to 12049 g were found The species of Diphyllobothrium in domestic carnivores have a lifecycle involving fish as the intermediate host The definitive host is known to get infected by consuming infected fish However the contents of over 100 tiger scats data not shown did not reveal scales or any other evidence of fish eating in the study area Dubay 28 also analyzed 140 tiger scats in the same area during 1994 to 1997 but did not report fish scales in the scat If Diphyllobothrium infection were acquired by eating fish the cost of fish eating for a tiger would be large as compared to the nutritional benefit No specific information is available on the pathological effects of Diphyllobothrium on tigers However since Diphyllobothrium are very large worms the energy cost of their growth or even the space occupied in the intestine can be a significant cost to the host individual Therefore fish eating would not be an evolutionary stable behaviour for tigers in areas with adequate ungulate prey density It is possible therefore that the species of Diphyllobothrium seen in tigers has a different life cycle that does not necessarily involve fish eating by the definitive host The definitive host could be small aquatic animals which are ingested accidentally by tigers Alternatively the infective stages may leave the alternative host and enter the definitive host through water or by active penetration of the skin The life cycle needs to be investigated The life cycles of other parasites can be currently assumed to be similar to those in the domestic carnivores table 2 It is hard to obtain data on the pathological effects of parasites on the host individual in the wild Tapeworms hookworms or lung fluke are known to be debilitating when in large numbers 29 If the same applies to wild tigers parasites can potentially be an important population regulating factor in tigers This needs serious investigations Although the 70 samples analyzed revealed between 12 to 21 possible species it is likely that many more species remain undetected This is particularly likely because a number of species were encountered only once We used the non parametric bootstrap estimator of the total number of species including the ones that were not detected 30 16 Using the conservative morphotype number the estimate was 16 44 s d 1 07 n 100 and a liberal estimate was 33 34 s d 1 45 n 100 The helminth community of tigers therefore was highly diverse despite the host population being small and fragmented A possible source of bias in the above analysis is that the 70 samples must have come from a much smaller number of individuals Many individuals therefore must have been sampled repeatedly and each individual sample cannot be considered as independent In an attempt to correct for repeated sampling we subjected the 70 samples to cluster analysis The predominant helminth species of tigers are large and long lived Therefore we do not expect the parasite species composition to change rapidly If this is true a cluster analysis of all the samples should yield definite clusters that probably represent individual tigers We used a log transform of abundance data on each parasite taxon in each sample and subjected all samples to cluster analysis using Euclidean distance and group average strategy for clustering 31 fig 2 The number of clusters decreased with distance with two distinct plateaus Fig 3 Defining clusters at a plateau is natural as well robust 32 The first plateau occurred at a distance of 0 27 resulting into 31 clusters Clusters at this level are unlikely to represent individual tigers for two reasons The samples analyzed contain four from a male and three from a female tiger that were identified anecdotally from sightings and distinctive pugmarks Both of them belonged to two distinct clusters fig 2 The maximum distance between two samples of an identified individual was 0 83 that is considerably greater than the position of the first plateau but slightly less than that for the second plateau downstream It seems reasonable therefore to assume that the distinct clusters obtained with the second plateau beginning at a distance of 0 88 represent different individual tigers The first plateau gives us 31 clusters which is unrealistically large for the study area The second plateau gives us 14 distinct clusters This number is within the limits of the reported tiger densities from comparable habitats 33 The broad statistical patterns observed remained unchanged after clustering The double logarithmic plot of means and variances was linear with a slope of 1 93 The prevalence abundance correlation remained positive but was non significant No association was found between any two parasites after clustering Out of the 14 clusters recognized 4 were represented by a number of samples and 10 were single samples The territory holding resident tigers are very likely to be sampled repeatedly whereas the non resident transients that may have visited the study area occasionally could have been sampled only once If the larger clusters represented resident tigers the study area could have 4 resident tigers and an unestimated but certainly a larger number of non resident tigers Out of the four large clusters cluster 3 consisted of zero or low density 5 g of propagules The propagules however belonged to three different parasites in different samples namely ascarid Taenia and lungworms Therefore the cluster might represent up to three individuals raising the possible number of resident tigers to 6 The cluster 5 consisted of samples having between 5 to 20 Diphyllobothrium eggs per gram and no other parasite The cluster 13 consisted of between 50 to 350 Diphyllobothrium eggs and occasional ascarid eggs and the cluster 14 consisted of a large number 500 4000 of Diphyllobothrium eggs with a low to moderate number of Taenia and Ascarid or lungworm If the areas over which each of the four large clusters was sampled fig 4 were considered as home ranges of individual tigers the home range sizes were 49 25 Km 2for cluster 3 46 75 Km 2for cluster 14 31 2 Km 2for cluster 13 and 15 75 Km 2for cluster 5 The presumed home range sizes are close to the sizes of tiger home ranges in radio telemetry studies 34 There was a considerable overlap in the distribution of the collection sites of the samples in different clusters Very similar overlaps have been seen in radiotelemetry studies 34 Interestingly the presumed resident tigers had significantly lower parasite loads than the presumed non resident ones Median test X 2 7 4 p 0 01 This can happen if tigers which are parasite resistant and therefore healthier are more likely to be successful in establishing territories Alternatively transient tigers may be under greater stress and therefore more susceptible to parasites Ranging over a larger area might also result in acquiring more parasites since the range covers more microhabitats that may harbor different intermediate hosts and different survival conditions for parasite infective stages It cannot be ignored however that such a pattern can arise as an artifact of cluster analysis If the variance in parasite densities within scat samples of a single individual increased with the mean it is likely that the distances become larger for samples with higher parasite loads A log transformation of the data would substantially reduce this effect In any case the suggestion obtained from the observed pattern needs validation that can be done by monitoring the parasite compositions of identified or radio collared tigers over a considerable time period Conclusions Tigers have rich and diverse parasite communities that are dominated by indirect life cycle parasites Parasite community of tiger shares certain statistical patterns with other parasite communities notably the positively skewed distribution prevalence abundance correlation and scaling of variance with the square of the mean Of particular interest are the clusters the territories occupied by each of the clusters and the apparently higher parasite loads of the presumably non territorial ones These findings need to be validated by long term parasite monitoring of identified individual tigers In the absence of such a validation the above results are only suggestive They leave no doubt however about the need to include parasites in any comprehensive study of tiger ecology Since the frequency of locating fresh scats is usually high in most of the tiger areas parasite compositions in scats can be a useful tool in monitoring tigers particularly in areas where tiger sighting is rare Besides a number of questions regarding individual health prey choice territorial behaviour movement patterns and reproductive success in relation to parasite loads can be worth investigating Materials and Methods Study Area The Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve TATR between 20 0 04 53 N to 28 0 25 51 N latitude to 79 0 13 13 E to 79 0 33 34 E longitude lies in the Chandrapur district of Vidarbha Region of Maharashtra and is spread over 625 40 Sq Km As per the Biogeographic classification of India by the Wildlife Institute of India Dehradun it falls under 6B Central pleateau Province of Deccan Peninsula Zone This area of TATR is comprised of the Tadoba National Park Area 116 55 Sq Km and the Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary area 508 85 Sq Km It is composed of two geomorphological units The northern part comprises of a hilly region known as the Chimur Hillocks and covers almost the entire Tadoba National Park The rest is a more or less plain area of the Moharli Kolsa Ranges which constitute the Andhari Sanctuary The area has a perennial river and a number of lakes TATR supports a diverse mammalian assemblage including tiger Panthera tigris leopard Panthera pardus hyena Hyaena hyaena sloth bear Melursus ursinus dhole Cuon alpinus jackal Canis aureus and jungle cat Felis chaus as the carnivores the common langur Semnopithecus entellus is the most numerous primate and the ungulates include barking deer Muntiacus muntjak gaur Bos gaurus sambar Cervus unicolor chital Axis axis wild boar Sus scrofa nilgai Boselapheus tragocamelus and chousinga Tetracerus quadricornis Dubay 20 estimated the densities no sq km of major prey species in the study area as Chital 17 23 Coefficient of variation 10 59 Sambar 5 1 CV 9 16

based estimate by the forest department of 36 tigers in TATR and 15 in the Tadoba National Park No standard deviations are available with these estimates Sample collection and analysis Fresh faecal samples of tigers were collected by following fresh tiger trails in the early morning hours from the Tadoba range over a period of two years Samples were collected from the ground avoiding the part contaminated with soil Weighed quantities of the samples typically 4 grams were analyzed using the quantitative zinc sulphate sedimentation flotation technique 17 16 to estimate parasite propagule densities per gram of faeces The sample was mixed with water and filtered to remove debris The filtrate was centrifuged at 2000 rmp for 5 minutes The supernatant was then removed and 5 ml of ZnSO 4 solution sp Gr 1 18 was added and mixed with the sediment This was again centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 minutes Using an L shaped wire loop with a 6 mm diameter loop the contents of the surface layer were transferred on to a slide for observation All the propagules were counted and the count converted into density per gram of sample Watve 1992 compared different methods of fecal analysis and found that Zinc Sulfate flotation was more sensitive in detecting low densities of propagules although at high concentrations it tended to underestimate the numbers The counts thus obtained were used for calculation of prevalence and mean densities The prevalence was defined as the proportion of samples showing the presence of parasite The mean densities for all the samples were calculated separately and mean intensities in positive samples were calculated ignoring the negative samples Adult worms and tapeworm segments were collected from faeces whenever present and from autopsy of a dead tigress The 70 samples collected came from a much smaller number of individuals Many individuals therefore must have been sampled repeatedly For seven of the samples the individual sampled was identified by sighting or by a distinctive pugmark Parasite identification Parasites were identified to the genus or family level from the propagule morphology Since extensive taxonomic accounts of the helminth species of tigers in the wild are not available we do not claim to have identified all species Whenever morphological differences in the propagules including distinct bimodality in size were present within a genus distinct operational taxonomic units OTUs were recognized Attempt to identify the species was made only when the adult stages were collected Due to the unavoidable tentativeness in identification while analyzing parasite diversity we used two strategies A conservative one in which closely resembling morphotypes were merged into a single OTU and a liberal one in which OTUs were split based on small but distinguishable differences Due to the limitations of faecal analysis the terms prevalence and intensities have somewhat different meanings 17 16 than the classical definitions of Margolis 35 Statistical analysis Parasite distributions are typically highly skewed Therefore we use non parametric methods throughout Species richness estimate by Bootstrap The method uses a computer simulated subsampling from the data and calculates the species richness using Smith and van Belle equation B S S 1 p i n Where B bootstrap estimate of species richness S Observed number of species in original data p i proportion of the n bootstrap quadrats that have species i present The simulation is repeated 100 times to get the mean estimate and its standard deviation Clustering by parasite species composition Parasite abundance data for each taxon was log transformed The log transformed data for each taxon were used for cluster analysis using CLUSTER BAS 31 with Euclidean distance and group average strategy Thus both species richness and relative abundance are considered during clustering
