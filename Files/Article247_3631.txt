 Fly Me to the Moon One of my thousands of favorite things about New York is how weather proof it mostly is How it takes a three foot snowstorm to shut it down and even then the subways work But all this changed a couple of weeks ago when there was a flash flood that shut down the city completely Absolutely flooded the subway system Do you know why I do Because they re not spending enough money keeping the drains clean This was in the newspapers I think but it s one of the nice side effects of living with a former political journalist who is an expert on all sorts of things like tertiary sewage treatment facilities I just heard from New York that everyone is being sent home from work at 1 o clock today that would never have happened but for the incident a couple of weeks ago So you are thinking of canceling a book signing just because no one will come You must go I insist Yesterday you wrote that the 90s don t exist as a culturally distinct decade You are so wrong The 90s began in around 1985 when the 70s ended The 60s were about sex the 70s were about drugs and the 90s are about money There were no 80s They never happened I know this I am about to make a movie that takes place in the 80s and when you make a list of what the 80s were you come down to a list of what they weren t no cell phones no color computers no SUVs no botox no Starbucks no Web sites no 69 etc For the purposes of the movie I think of the 80s as the moment just before everything that is currently happening happened This brings me to a thing I love to think about especially when I fly to Los Angeles the private plane I didn t fly on one I hasten to say But I did read Vanity Fair on the plane and if you look at their list of the New Establishment 45 out of 50 of them have private planes or access to them I m sure the other five think of nothing but how to get them There are people in Hollywood who would truly rather die than be seen flying commercial In fact last year one of my Hollywood friends was visiting New York and said he was going back to Los Angeles the next day The next day I saw him and said I thought you were going home We couldn t get out he said Now what he meant was not that he couldn t get a flight home there are as you know dozens of flights to L A every day but that he couldn t get the Warner jet He actually stayed an extra day in New York rather than submit to the humiliation of American Airlines And guess what This brings me to Ron Perelman Yay Or the Ron Perelmans of the world Because if you really want to know how these guys get beautiful women to sleep with them I ll tell you They take them on their jets The jet is a powerful aphrodisiac The jet is the thing that causes the Patricia Duffs of the world to lose their minds The jet is the thing that makes them all do the I ll never go hungry again thing Back to Gone With the Wind so maybe it belongs on that list of the century s 10 best after all In fact when Ron Perelman and Patricia Duff broke up at the 1996 Democratic convention in Chicago her friends told everyone without irony that one of the injustices of the breakup event was that Patricia was forced to fly commercial back to New York I wish you would write about private planes Really I could go on forever My ghastliest show business moments were spent with Dustin Hoffman but bad as they were there were nowhere near as bad as being told you ve flunked an exam you haven t flunked and being forced to go to summer school and as the Times notes today being punished by your parents for flunking said exam The story in today s paper is truly horrible These are kids with serious self esteem issues anyway By the way in today s Los Angeles Times is an article about Kenneth Starr who gave a speech here in which he admitted to some qualms about his career as a special prosecutor The man is clearly looking for a job I have a rule about who wins the presidency too Mine is the person with 1 the most authenticity and 2 the biggest balls This is why W is so dangerous And your remark about Jesse Ventura truly strikes fear into my heart Although someone gave me his autobiography for my birthday and I feel you could not possibly have read it if you believe you could pull even the smallest lever for him
