 A Comparison of the Burden of Universal Service in Italy and the United States Robert Cohen Rossana Scocchera Postal Rate Commission Poste Italiane Carla Pace Vincenzo Visco Comandini Poste Italiane Poste Italiane Matthew Robinson John Waller Postal Rate Commission Postal Rate Commission Gennaro Scarfiglieri Spyros Xenakis Poste Italiane Postal Rate Commission 1 INTRODUCTION Samuel Johnson said Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel and many postal observers believe that the Universal Service Obligation USO is the last refuge of a postal service wishing to protect inefficiency monopoly profits or economic rents Despite inefficient service opaque accounts and large rents many postal officials maintain that the monopoly whatever its faults is the only means of ensuring universal affordable postal service for citizens throughout the nation Without the monopoly they argue the post office would be crushed by the cost of the USO This paper examines when this argument might be valid All posts probably have some cost associated with the USO but it has been difficult to quantify We agree with John Panzar 2001 that the cost of the USO is the cost of the services that would not be provided in a competitive market Under this definition in practice there has been no discernable USO cost Competition exists in both Sweden and New Zealand and the incumbent posts have continued to provide universal service with no subsidy The USO as defined by the proponents of the monopoly goes well beyond ubiquitous service It also includes a uniform price with respect to location of the recipient1 and a uniform frequency of delivery These conditions might have been appropriate a century ago when the post was the primary means of communication Today however this definition seems unduly restrictive It is incumbent on defenders of the restrictive definition of USO to explain why postal service should be treated The views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily represent the opinions of Poste Italiane or the Postal Rate Commission In other words a firm cannot charge more for delivering similar items to addresses in one section of the country than another Under this definition United Parcel Service UPS is not a true universal service provider because it imposes a surcharge for residential delivery This is ironic because UPS delivers to every address in the continental U S and delivers right to the door The Postal Service which is a universal service provider under the definition used here delivers to mail boxes that are in many cases remote from the actual address differently from other important products such as groceries bank accounts and internet service 2 Notwithstanding we use this restrictive definition of universal service for this paper The obligation to provide ubiquitous service is not in itself onerous It has been pointed out by the American co authors of this paper that a post could rationalize its delivery costs by reducing the frequency of service on unprofitable routes to the point where they become profitable Cohen et al 2000 A post could also rationalize its prices by reflecting the cost of service to different areas The restrictive definition of the USO does not allow a post to rationalize either its cost or pricing structure 3 thus creating cream skimming opportunities under liberalization The burden that the restrictive USO imposes on a post is the increase in its unit costs resulting from cream skimming under liberalization caused by the requirements of uniform pricing and levels of service We use the term burden of the USO to distinguish our concept from other papers that use the term cost of the USO We believe that insights into the burden of the USO can be gained by comparing postal systems Assuming that the keenest insights can be gained by comparing systems with large differences the Italian and United States systems are good candidates The U S has the highest volume per capita in the industrial world 739 pieces in 1999 while Italy has one of the lowest 115 pieces in 1999 4 Previous work by Cohen et al shows that the U S Postal Service USPS is not likely to require the monopoly to continue to satisfy the USO Cohen 1999 2000 However this result may not apply to all posts and it is important to distinguish magnitudes of burden for different posts To this end we develop a model to determine the USO burden for posts with different per capita volumes In particular applying the model demonstrates that the burden of USO is very great for Poste Italiane and other posts with small per capita volumes On the other hand for the U S and other posts with large and medium per capita volumes the burden is small We first compare some statistics for Italy and the U S We then examine the consequences of volume loss on postal systems in order to provide a measure of burden in terms of increases in average unit costs as volume is lost to competitors or 2 Many postal services are increasingly becoming primarily carriers of advertising U S households receive far more advertising than letters bills or other similar matter According to the Household Diary Study United States Postal Service 2000 in 1999 56 percent of the pieces received by U S households were advertising mail 3 An apparent exception is Consignia It rationalizes its delivery cost by delivering twice a day in most urban areas and once a day in rural areas 4 Italy has a very undeveloped direct mail market and the Italian monopoly does not include direct mail The U S monopoly includes all addressed direct mail consisting of fewer than 24 pages The U S Postal Service handled 314 pieces per capita of direct mail in 1999 equivalently the increase in average rates for the volume remaining 5 Next we introduce the concept of delivery route profit and quantify the relative profits from delivered mail and mail not requiring delivery in both Italy and the U S We then compare the distribution of profit margins for routes in Italy and the U S and the effect this has on vulnerability to cream skimming Finally we discuss two measures of the cost of universal service the entry pricing measure and the net avoided cost measure in the context of delivery profits We compare them with our burden measure for the Poste Italiane and the U S Postal Service Our principal findings are The burden of the USO is much greater for small per capita volume posts than it is for large and medium per capita volume posts The likelihood of a graveyard spiral resulting from volume loss to cream skimmers is remote for medium to large volume per capita posts whereas it is a real threat to small volume per capita posts The measure of burden presented here combined with the distribution of route profit margins for Poste Italiane and the U S Postal Service yields results contrary to the entry price and net avoided cost measures for the cost of the USO The portion of mail not requiring delivery is a very important contributor to the finances of a post 2 COMPARATIVE STATISTICS Table 1 contains some statistics for Italy and the U S and for their postal administrations 6 Italy has 21 percent of the U S population and 16 percent approximately one seventh of the U S per capita volume Most of the delivery statistics in the table s second section are reasonably close to this 16 percent figure The number of delivery points in Italy as a percentage of those in the U S is a 5 To provide a basis for comparing Poste Italiane and the U S Postal Service we use a model of postal operations that follows the structure of FY 1999 costs in the U S Postal Service Parametric analyses are conducted by varying volume under different assumptions about the extent that institutional cost varies over the long run The model is validated for Poste Italiane by making adjustments for major differences in the two posts such as the extent of worksharing 6 Prices of goods and services vary between Italy and the United States and the prevailing market exchange rate does not necessarily account for the relative differences in prices We have used the Purchasing Power Parity PPP of 1 677 liras per U S dollar to convert the 1999 Italian statistics reported in Italian liras The PPP has been produced by the Organization of Economic Co Operation and Development OECD and shows the number of Italian liras required in 1999 to buy goods and services equivalent to what can be purchased with one U S dollar In 1999 the average market exchange rate reported by the International Monetary Fund IMF was 1 817 liras per U S dollar disproportionately high 25 percent The disproportionate number of small business addresses in Italy Scarfiglieri and Visco Comandini 2001 may help explain this Poste Italiane also has disproportionately more delivery points per route This results from a much lower coverage percent of addresses receiving mail on a given day a higher population density and other unexplored route and topographical considerations 7 We see in the fourth section that the U S Postal Service cost per piece is much lower than Poste Italiane cost per piece despite having a much higher labor cost per employee This is primarily a result of economies of scale worksharing and the extensive use of automation 8 Table 1 Selected National and Postal Statistics for FY 1999a Italy as Italy U S

fact that 7 USO 206 This the the has in It also illustrates that the concept of the USO has many more dimensions than ubiquitous delivery However the cross subsidy that results from ubiquitous delivery and uniform prices and frequency of delivery is widely regarded as the most important aspect of the USO mitigating against liberalization This paper will be restricted to dealing with this aspect 7 Motorcycles are the primary means of carrier transport in Italy and automobiles are the primary means in the U S 8 It is also the result of the quantity of non delivered mail See Section 4 3 RELATIVE IMPACT OF VOLUME LOSS ON POSTAL SYSTEMS The burden of the USO on a postal system lies within its fixed costs Ceteris paribus unit per piece fixed costs are higher in a low volume per capita system than in a high volume per capita system We examine the effect of volume on unit total costs The sensitivity of cost to volume for a postal system can be investigated directly provided the ratio of fixed to variable costs is known by function Some postal administrations do not have this information and some choose not to make it available to regulators or the public Consequently we have built a model to estimate the relationship between unit average costs and per capita volume 9 The model is described in the appendix and includes parameters for the portion of variable costs by major postal functions When the average unit cost is graphed as a function of volume per capita one obtains a curve with a parabolic shape The exact shape of the curve depends on the specific set of parameters used to benchmark the model such as the proportion of fixed costs at a specific per capita volume Because the cost behavior of the U S Postal Service has been studied extensively and because U S postal costs are the most transparent in the industrialized world we use U S data from 1999 as provided in the most recent omnibus rate proceeding Docket No R2000 1 to benchmark the model10 Table 2 shows the U S institutional variable percentages for the major postal functions Table 2 U S Fixed Variable Cost By Major Function a FY 1999 a Source Postal Rate Commission Docket No R2000 1 b Delivery includes in office and out of office costs Because the U S Postal Service may differ greatly from other postal systems in labor cost automation route topography worksharing mix of mail by shape and the percentage of non delivered mail etc we cannot expect the cost estimates furnished by the model to be extremely accurate estimates of particular non U S systems For our 9 We use pieces per capita rather than total volume to normalize the volume 10 This model has been developed on the assumption that the cost behavior of postal administrations is essentially similar The functions of collection delivery transportation processing and window services are common to the postal administrations of all industrialized countries purposes we do not need great accuracy we only need reasonable estimates in order to examine the sensitivity of total unit cost to volume per capita The fixed portion of non delivery costs would be expected to change as we move from higher volume administrations to lower volume ones It would be expected that lower volume postal administrations would try to keep them small to reduce the burden on rate payers Since these costs are variable in the long run and we do not know how other postal administrations deal with them we parameterize them for purposes of modeling As a preliminary matter using the fixed variable ratios for U S Postal Service costs from Table 2 Figure 1 shows that as per capita volume increases the mail processing proportion of total cost will increase and the delivery proportion will decrease This is because mail processing costs are almost all variable while delivery costs have a very large fixed component Since the U S volume per capita is the highest in the world the U S Postal Service delivery costs proportion should be the smallest of any postal service On the other hand Poste Italiane per capita volume is among the lowest in the industrialized world and so its delivery costs proportion should be among the highest Figure 1 Functional Percentage of Total Costs Benchmarked by U S Costs and Volumes with 25 of Non Delivery Institutional Costs Long Run Variable Percentage of Total Costs 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 Pieces per Capita Again using the ratios for U S Postal Service costs in Table 2 Figure 2 shows the variability of the major functions as per capita volume changes It can be seen that at low volumes mail processing and transportation costs have a high degree of fixity while at high volumes they are almost all variable Figure 2 M odeled Variabilities by Function B enchm arked by U S C o sts and V o lu

The three curves represent different variabilities of non delivery fixed costs as shown in the legend It appears that unit costs are not very sensitive to changes in per capita volume at the high end but are quite sensitive at the low end For example a ten percent reduction in pieces per capita for the U S Postal Service would result in costs increasing about one cent A ten percent reduction for a post at 100 pieces per capita would increase unit costs by nine cents The increase in unit cost resulting from a ten percent decrease in per capita volume for a range of volumes is shown in Table 3 Figure 3 Model Estimates of Unit Cos Benchmarked by U S Costs and Volumes Pieces per Capita Long Run Variability of Non Delivery Institutional Costs In the per capita volume range of most Northern European countries Canada New Zealand and Australia the effect on unit cost from a ten percent reduction in per capita volume is not great At about 200 pieces per capita the effect of volume loss on unit cost becomes much more pronounced 11 Table 3 Unit Cost with 10 Decrease in Volume Assuming 25 of Non Delivery Institutional Costs are Long Run Variable 1999 U S Dollars Pieces per Capita 700 600

revenue losses revenue minus cost must be made up from the remaining volume to maintain breakeven status The burden measure quantifies the resulting increase in unit cost and revenue that must be made up from each piece of mail that remains in the system An important question is whether the rate increases would lead to a graveyard spiral We think the burden measure provides an answer to this question Insofar as the burden of the USO might introduce a death spiral Crew and Kleindorfer 2000 owing to the loss of volume because of liberalization the probability seems slight until per capita volumes are in the 100 to 150 piece range Below that point the possibility of a death spiral increases rapidly Thus we conclude that the burden of the USO is much greater for low per capita volume posts than for medium to high volume ones In order to make the model more useful for comparing Poste Italiane and the U S Postal Service we adjust model costs to account for important known differences Since worksharing activities reduce United States costs by about 25 percent Cohen et al 2001 we increase model costs to account for the lack of worksharing in Italy The portion of the model costs that are labor costs is adjusted downwards to reflect hourly labor cost differences between Poste Italiane and the U S Postal Service In addition model costs are adjusted to reflect the Poste Italiane proportion of low cost letters and cards medium cost flats and high cost parcels The appendix describes the adjustment factors Table 4 shows estimates of Poste Italiane unit costs derived using the model It can be seen that the model comes fairly close to Poste Italiane unit costs Of course the model could be further refined to account for many more specific differences We leave that project for another day Nonetheless we think the model is sufficiently accurate to allow us to draw a major conclusion the burden of universal service is highly dependent on volume per capita so policies suitable for liberalizing medium and large per capita volume posts are likely not suitable for small per capita volume posts Greece Italy Portugal and Spain have per capita volumes below 200 Table 4 Model Estimates of Poste Italiane Unit Costs Based on U S Costs and Variabilities Adjusted for Worksharing Wage Differences and Mail Mix Long Run Variability Unit Costs per piece of

in the USO and cross subsidy within the delivery system it is important to define the concept of route profit and loss We define the profitability of a delivery route as the revenue generated by the mail delivered on the route minus the attributable upstream costs of the mail delivered and the total cost of the route Cohen et al 1999 Some mail handled by a postal service does not require delivery recipients pick up mail from post office boxes and large volume recipients pick up mail in bulk from designated counters 12 Non delivered mail can also be considered to have delivery profits in the same manner as delivered mail 13 A postal service has variable and fixed upstream costs as well as variable and fixed delivery costs In a breakeven postal service total delivery profits from all routes plus profits from non delivered mail must equal fixed upstream costs 14 Put another way fixed upstream costs minus profits from non delivered mail must equal delivery profits In order to compare profits from delivered and non delivered mail in Italy and the U S we increase Poste Italiane revenue by 24 percent so that it equals cost and is thus at breakeven 15 Table 5 shows that non delivered mail accounts for a very disproportionate share of delivery profits in both posts and presumably in all posts The most obvious reason for this is that non delivered mail incurs no carrier delivery cost In addition although many delivery routes are highly profitable losses from unprofitable routes reduce the net delivery profit from delivered mail 12 In the United States this is frequently called firm holdout mail 13 Revenue minus attributable upstream costs that includes the small amount of costs for non carrier box or counter delivery activities associated with non delivered mail 14 An analogous identity holds for a post at any given profit loss 15 Data in this paper are from 1999 In that year the U S Postal Service had profits of 400 million and total revenue of 62 8 billion Table 5 Distribution of Volume and Profits between Delivered and Non delivered Mail Percent Italy U S Volume Profits Volume Profits Delivered 8658 79 33 Non delivered 1442 21 67 Because total delivery profits from delivered and non delivered mail must equal fixed upstream costs non delivered mail plays an important role in reducing the revenue needs of a breakeven post Ceteris paribus the higher the proportion of non delivered mail the lower the rates that a breakeven post must charge Thus the higher the proportion of non delivered mail the less opportunity there is for a cream skimmer to undercut the incumbent 16 17 Moreover highly profitable non delivered mail is much less vulnerable to diversion 18 5 DISTRIBUTION OF ROUTE PROFIT MARGINS AND VULNERABILITY TO CREAM SKIMMING Volumes revenues and route profits differ widely on routes in both Italy and the U S The uniform pricing constraint of the USO creates cream skimming possibilities because an entrant can target only highly profitable routes and charge a price below the uniform price Consequently it is not cross subsidy per se that allows cream skimming All routes could be above incremental cost and the problem would still exist Cream skimming stems from the uniform pricing and service constraints given that routes have disparate profits and not necessarily from the need to cross subsidize routes 16 We would expect that the USPS s percentage of non delivered mail to be among the highest of industrialized country posts because the U S payment system involves a large fraction of financial transactions paid by check and mailed to large volume recipients This mail is generally picked up by them or their agents at a post office i e it is non delivered mail 17 In a small per capita volume post the fixed cost of delivery represents a larger share of total cost than in a large per capita volume post Ceteris paribus per piece profit from non delivered mail is greater in a small per capita volume post than in a large one 18 Many of the 18 million boxholders in the United States do not want mail delivered to their premises We cannot quantify the number but presumably this is an important reason why mail recipients rent a post office box These box holders would not be good candidates for cream skimmers Fifty six percent of non delivered mail is single piece It is not likely that cream skimmers would be able to successfully put a collection system in place to capture much of this mail Of the 44 percent of non delivered mail that remains 36 percent is First Class much of which is time sensitive According to most models of cream skimming delivery frequency would be reduced Time sensitive First Class would be less likely to make use of a service with less frequent delivery Finally non single piece mail addressed to box holders is being transported and delivered over large areas of the nation A delivery cream skimmer would have to have a national presence to compete for this mail This means much of the mail could not be handled by local niche players or even regional cream skimmers The more revenue that leaves the system because of cream skimming the more rates must be increased on the remaining mail to maintain a breakeven status Consequently the greater the share of system wide revenue that is from high margin routes the greater impact that cream skimming could have on a postal administration In order to compare the possible effect of cream skimming on the Italian and U S postal administrations we have arrayed their routes by profit margin using FY 1999 data Again we have adjusted the Poste Italiane revenue to breakeven in order to facilitate comparison Figure 4 displays the profit margin19 of routes arrayed by semi deciles The most profitable Italian semi decile has a margin of just over 30 percent while the most profitable U S semi decile has a margin of over 50 percent However a greater percentage of Italian routes are profitable than U S routes We do not know the profit margin that would actually attract cream skimmers If it is 30 percent then 10 percent of U S routes would be vulnerable and less than 7 percent of Italian routes would be vulnerable Virtually all profitable routes in Italy are urban In the U S only about half of the routes served by city carriers are profitable while three quarters of the routes served by rural carriers are profitable 20 It may well be that competition is much more likely to develop in urban areas If so Poste Italiane would be at greater risk from cream skimmers than the U S Postal Service 19 For purposes of this discussion profit margin is defined as the ratio of delivery profits to route costs i e upstream variable plus total delivery cost 20 In the U S about one fifth of the routes served by rural carriers are in high density suburban areas 60 50 40 30 20 Average Profit margin Percentage 10 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1011121314151617181920 Semi decile Routes by 5 Increments a Revenue for Poste Italiane is increased by 24 to create breakeven conditions The percent of total revenue by semi decile is shown in Table 6 At every semidecile except the first Poste Italiane receives a greater percentage of total revenue than the U S Postal Service This is due to the fact that a much larger percentage of U S revenue comes from undelivered mail The distribution of profitable routes shown on Figure 4 indicates that the U S Postal Service s revenue volume per route is much more skewed than Poste Italiane s as measured by the relative size of the bars at the extremes This would tend to make the U S Postal Service more attractive to cream skimmers than Poste Italiane at most profit thresholds This skewness results from mail volume being highly correlated with income and U S income distribution being much more skewed than Italian income distribution Berthelemy and Toledano 2000 Kolin and Smith 1999 In fact the U S has the most skewed income distribution of any industrialized country as measured by the World Bank s Gini Index The U S Gini Index is 40 8 while Italy s is 27 3 21 Thus Italy should be fairly typical of the distribution of route profit margins of industrial countries and the U S should be an outlier World Development Indicators 2001 Table 2 8 The World Bank Washington DC The unweighted average of Gini Indices for industrialized countries is 30 6 Austria has the lowest index at 23 1 Table 6 Delivered Mail Revenue As Percent of Total Revenue Routes by Semi decile Ranked by Profit 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Cumulative

U S Italy 53 62 56 66 59 69 61 72 64 74 66 77 69 79 71 81 72 83 73 84 Because volume and revenue are highly correlated if volume is lost to cream skimming then revenue is also lost Figure 4 and Table 6 can be used to estimate likely profit and revenue losses to cream skimmers and Figure 3 to estimate the cost impact of volume losses Depending on the threshold selected the potential impact on the respective posts can be compared We doubt that cream skimmers could capture even a majority of the volume on any route owing to the limited amount of contestable volume in the U S and perhaps other countries 22 Nevertheless to the extent that volume would be lost to cream skimmers the impact on Poste Italiane would be greater than on the U S Postal Service As mentioned above the Italian data have been adjusted for breakeven Had we not done this very few Italian routes would be profitable A postal service that is below breakeven will be less attractive to cream skimmers than otherwise On the other hand if a postal service is above breakeven its routes will be even more profitable and hence more attractive to cream skimmers 6 ENTRY PRICING The entry pricing measure defines the cost of the USO as the sum of lost profits from entry by a competitor The form of entry that we consider is delivery cream skimming If an entrant were more efficient than the incumbent then the USO would not cause the lost profit Under the restrictive definition of the USO however it is possible for the incumbent post to be more efficient than the entrant and still lose profits because the incumbent must charge a uniform price The entrant would most likely attack routes with much higher than average profit margins The incumbent would not be able to Cohen et al 2000 found that less than 16 percent of total U S Postal Service volume is contestable respond because of the restrictive USO Ceteris paribus the more skewed the incumbent s route profit margin distribution the more vulnerable the post is to entry 23 Figure 4 shows that the Poste Italiane profit margin distribution is much less skewed than the U S Postal Service s distribution Thus according to the entry price measure the cost of the USO is higher in the U S than in Italy 24 This is contrary to the conclusion that we have drawn in Section 3 i e that the burden of the USO is much higher for Poste Italiane than for the U S Postal Service The possibility of an equal or less efficient entrant capturing significant volume depends on the fraction of mail on profitable routes that is actually contestable Given the huge scale economies of a universal service provider and the limited amount of contestable mail it is very difficult for an entrant at least in the U S to charge prices lower than an incumbent Cohen et al 1999 7 NET AVOIDED COST The net avoided cost measure NAC of the USO is the sum of the losses from unprofitable routes Dobbs and Golay 1995 Elsenblast and Stumpf 1995 As stated earlier the profits from delivered and non delivered mail must equal the upstream fixed cost in a breakeven post If the profits from the money making routes and non delivered mail exceed the upstream fixed cost then there must be an offset of money losing routes This is simply an accounting identity The more skewed the distribution of delivery route profit margins the greater will be the losses from unprofitable routes Figure 4 shows that the NAC would be greater for the U S Postal Service than for Poste Italiane assuming adjustments for scale Again this is contrary to our finding in Section 3 about the relative burden of the USO Furthermore we believe that the logic of the NAC measure is flawed Suppose that a government decides to provide a subsidy to its breakeven postal service to offset losses on unprofitable routes because it wishes taxpayers and not rate payers to fund the USO The postal service would then have a surplus In order for the postal service to return to breakeven prices would be reduced 25 Because of the price reduction unprofitable routes would become even more unprofitable and some formerly profitable routes would become unprofitable Because the total losses from unprofitable routes are greater than before the government would have to increase its subsidy 23 For purposes of the discussion of entry pricing and net avoided cost we ignore the impact of the percentage of non delivered mail 24 Bradley and Colvin 2000 estimated the entry pricing cost of the USO for the United States That estimate assumed that the entrant would capture all volume on all profitable routes It is a worst case scenerio 25 The same logic would hold for a postal service earning any given profit loss This process would continue until there is but one route not subsidized by the government and that route would be the route that initially was the most profitable one in the system Thus the net avoided cost measure implies the absurdity that a government must fund the entire delivery network if it wants to fund the cost of universal service 8 CONCLUSION We introduce and quantify the concept of the burden of the USO which is the upward impact on unit costs that would result from competitive entry We find that the burden on low per capita postal systems is much greater than on medium to high volume postal systems This is contrary to results obtained when using the net avoided cost or entry pricing measures of the cost of the USO We also find that the burden decreases as the percentage of non delivered mail increases The distribution of route profits is much more skewed for the U S Postal Service than for Poste Italiane This would tend to make the U S more attractive to potential cream skimmers On the other hand a greater percentage of Poste Italiane revenue is generated by delivered mail and this would cause cream skimming to have a greater impact on its unit costs APPENDIX Model Definition The model is designed to define average unit cost as a

Poste Italiane Significant differences in the composition of mail and labor costs exist between USPS and Poste Italiane To make the comparison of the unit cost from our model which is based on USPS cost data and the actual unit cost of Poste Italiane more meaningful we apply three factors to the results of our model The unit cost assuming 25 of institutional fixed costs vary with volume in the long run is calculated in the example 1 First the attributable variable cost from the model V Q0 P 0 194 is adjusted to reflect the different shape mix of mail handled by Poste Italiane The proportions of letters 88 and nonletters 12 for Poste Italiane are applied to the USPS variable unit cost of each 13 46 and 26 60 cents respectively The weighted average unit cost that results 15 04 cents is then divided by the actual USPS unit variable unit cost of 16 88 cents The resulting ratio 0 891 is applied to the variable cost from the model Example 0 194 0 891 0 173 2 Next the resulting variable cost is adjusted to account for the savings from worksharing reflected in the USPS costs which do not exist for Poste Italiane The USPS variable costs in FY 1999 were 40 lower than they would have been without worksharing Cohen et al 2001 so the variable cost from step one 0 173 is increased by that amount Example 0 173 1 4 0 242 3 Finally both variable and institutional costs are adjusted for labor cost differences Since 78 6 of USPS costs are labor costs that portion of the variable cost from step two 0 242 and institutional cost from the model 0 662 is adjusted by the ratio of Poste Italiane labor costs to those of USPS 74 7 Example 0 786 0 242 0 662 0 747 1 0 786 0 242 0 662 0 724 REFERENCES Berth l my Francoise L and Jo lle Toledano 2000 In France Mail Goes Where the Money and
