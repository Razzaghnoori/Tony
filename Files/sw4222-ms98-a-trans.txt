                hi um im Ralph um Cincinnati Cincinnati   hi Ralph um uh the the machine said that the topic was uh taxes   yeah um weather we pay too much or uh maybe we got back what we uh because we got i guess to die for what we paid   okay well im im ready anytime that you want to start   okay um lets see i guess we got one oh   okay um   oh yeah go head   well lets see i guess uh since im in the process of filling them out i guess i kind of fill like uh um its it is too much but i dont know what i uh cut out i guess   no i i know what you mean were in the process of doing ours and it it it does seems  like a lot uh i wish i had a better feeling for uh a better breakdown rather than oh well you know X X billions of dollars go to defense and X billions of dollars go here it it its hard i i have a hard time conceiving of any larger amount of money then say uh really a couple thousand dollars every thing else is is like Monopoly money it its so larger you dont really have a personal feeling for it if you go to by a new car you get a better feeling for for whats going on but even then it usually most of that is is finance through the bank and you not actually holding the money in your hands   umhum   but uh i Americans in general well i i would like to see a little bit better return for the the social program i actually dont mind paying taxes for things like social programs helping people out       because my basic philosophy is that that most people are out to mess with the system most people actually generally want to work or want to to make themselves better and they are not lazy i dont believe that everybody is out there to rip of the system   umhum   but there is a hold lot of bureaucracy and so many places for the money to fall through the cracks that after a while it becomes to easy and and and people uh say well oh sure well we we havent plan ahead so we could spend twice as much as as what we really need thats okay we will just let it go and and then it comes down to the crunch and crisis management and oh well just spend another few thousands dollars and   hum   so there theres no good handle on it no one i guess feels really responsible in those situation and all that money adds up and you have enormous cost in the government and people get angry and upset   hum       thats interesting but uh i guess thats uh something that happen when there is so many people involved each one fill like they take a responsibility for um making sure that thing work the way there suppose to or something but um i never really thought of it that way but   huh   i guess there  seems like their some programs that are more valuable and other that be that be useful to have more uh sort of tax payer involvement in some of that decision making     oh sure yeah i know i agree with you on that what  sort of a involvement with with something like maybe oh a defenses a little hard but but what sort of involvement uh would we be able to do what type of oversight would you like to see on that     um i know maybe just in the point of you know having focus group with uh or elected representative will be one solutions where they actually maybe they do have more in some area of the country then then where im from but its i think its rare to actually no like you can influence what uh your representative is really doing because if you know if even if theres even a lot of writing campaign chances are therell be a lot of letters on both sides of the issue particularly if if it is a controversial bill or something like that   huh yeah well here it here in Massachusetts i mean we have a just like the rest of the country we have a a server budget problem and and often here uh people are are angry about their taxes being so high and the ideal of the higher taxes is help us to pay off the high deficit in the state   umhum   and many people fall back on well theres money theres a lot of money being misspent its all there we do have to do anything except well its all out there somewhere   umhum   and the the next step is to identify where
