 The Speaker Speaks Eight years ago House speaker presumptive Bob Livingston then an obscure junior congressman and Slate s Jacob Weisberg then an obscure writer for the New Republic were both on an official U S delegation to certify the legitimacy of an election in Guatemala It was Bush administration policy that democracy was spreading in Latin America and that the election was going to be fair Weisberg wrote in TNR about his adventures When we arrived back at the Supreme Electoral Headquarters at the Hotel El Dorado two hours before the polls closed our delegation was already working on its statement Bob Livingston a bluff Republican representative from Louisiana had somehow become our chairman and was summing up the prevailing consensus that the election was free and fair I pointed out that at least two of us had heard charges of vote buying Vote buying isn t fraud Livingston bellowed I could show you vote buying all over Louisiana The logic here is that of Tallulah Bankhead s famous remark about cocaine Of course it s not addictive darling I use it all the time But Livingston s exquisite ethical sensitivity should serve the new speaker well as he presides over congressional investigations of presidential perjury campaign finance abuse and so on Where in the World Is Michael Lewis Many readers find it suspicious that Michael Lewis has stopped filing dispatches from the Microsoft antitrust trial and they do not accept our explanation that he got bored found the hard wooden seats nightmarishly uncomfortable especially combined with the judge s power mad restrictions on leaving to go to the bathroom felt he had said most of what he wanted to say has a pressing book deadline and so on They think he was canned because his reports were critical of Microsoft It s not true It simply isn t true There is no evidence for it because it s not not well it s all nonsense is what it is In short it s not true And if we re stammering a bit that may reflect the strain of not making any jokes Because we wrote a jokey little item in this space two weeks ago about having Lewis killed and whatnot and some people have taken it seriously We hope that Slate hasn t attracted the kind of readership that needs the word PARODY or SATIRE or HUMOR stamped on every bit of good hearted raillery and we hope that what we publish in these genres is funny enough not to require labeling Lewis is alive and well and willing to testify that Slate expressed nothing but disappointment at his entirely voluntary decision that he d had enough One part of the problem here may be a misunderstanding of how journalism especially magazine journalism works How mysterious is it really that a writer should drop out of a project before it is completed Answer Not very Does such an occurrence justify paranoid speculation about corrupt motives and conflicts of interest Answer No not at all Many people might suppose that it is highly unusual for a writer to agree to produce some piece of writing and then fail to produce it perhaps offering a variety of whiny and often hypochondriac excuses about hard wooden benches and so on That is because many people do not know writers In fact such behavior is extremely common In fulfilling perhaps half of a medium term oral agreement to cover a trial of uncertain duration and with long periods of boredom and discomfort Michael Lewis is actually above average So we thank him for his dispatches and invite readers to check out his replacements Herbert Stein Jodie T Allen and others still to come Warning The previous paragraph contained jokes Michael Kinsley
