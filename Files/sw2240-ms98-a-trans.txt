 okay okay Bob um our project s painting um do you have any uh any thoughts on whether painting s a good idea or a bad idea well well of course uh it depends i guess on what you re uh oh oh what you re you re interest and abilities are so far as whether you re going to paint yourself uh i ve painted uh like i said both interior and exterior myself uh not a lot of exterior but uh i ve painted you know rooms and ceilings inside and you know and i usually find it uh pretty easy and and it s cheaper than hiring somebody else to do it oh that s yeah that s for sure um what kind of paint do you like to use it s um yeah yeah it well i i nearly always use a latex base uh especially for interior uh the brands uh you know vary but uh Sherwin Williams makes a pretty good paint and Jones Blair and you know Kelley i think makes pretty good paint so yeah then you don t have you don t have that mess to clean up when you use an oil oil base painting and boy i ll tell you oh yeah right right you know um um we uh i designed and built my own home about twelve years ago um and it was one of the uh you know the old New England saltbox so instead of painting because i figured when i got uh just a couple years older i m not going to want to climb up on a ladder yeah so we put uh white cedar shingles on the house and let it weather naturally um hum and the trim instead of painting i stained yeah so i figured instead of going out there and scraping and you know having a having to climb up on a ladder the stain kind of just uh it weathers um hum so i eliminated that chore that i don t have to do that i stained the original stain and i stained once since then because it started fading a little bit um hum but other than that um i m like you i like to use a latex paint on the inside we ve uh we ve done some uh walls right yeah the ones we haven t papered we ve done in uh uh latex uh uh pastels yeah yeah and clean up is is uh is a joy uh a little soap and water and air dry them and you don t have to worry about that right yeah the what kind of what kind of equipment do you use uh i mean just brush and roller or yeah a roller and uh i bought one of those that you can screw in uh uh a three foot extension um hum so you can climb up on the walls and the ceilings we didn t paint the ceilings was just natural plaster uh huh so i didn t want to get into doing anything there it s just uh so far it s okay you know we haven t had any problems with it yeah that s uh i i did a had to paint the uh my brick my house is brick on the outside except for the overhangs and you know like a a little bit of uh what do you call the the eaves and stuff and uh yeah so you re lucky too you don t have to worry about going out there and scraping and painting and yeah yeah but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller that uh it s really designed for indoor use but it s got an uh you know an extension and a pump you just put your can of paint down in the in this pump and it pumps the paint up through the roller how do you control the amount of flow or anything and and it works pretty good well it s got a uh got a regulator on it that you just set the set the deal on it you know for the the flow and then it s got a trigger on it that you can release to let the pressure pump the paint up into this handle well is there a little electric pump you put in there yeah it s an electric just a little electric pump motor that uh turns on and off you know builds up pressure so that it you know it kind of pushes the paint up this uh up the extension hum that s interesting it s a uh Black and Decker brand and and it works pretty good like i said it was designed for indoor use you know for painting walls and ceilings but i found it worked pretty good for outdoors uh yeah there s certain times of the year of course that uh that it probably wouldn t do very well because of the temperature and stuff but but uh the right time of year it works pretty good you really have a problem down there with with having to repaint with with paint blistering or peeling off or well if if you buy a good grade of paint uh you don t really uh of course Texas heat you know you it really gets pretty hot outside so you have to be sure and get a good grade of paint oh that s there for direct yeah the direct sun beating on it yeah yeah that s right for the direct sunlight and stuff right but uh but i i haven t really found it too bad we ve lived in our house about uh oh thirteen years i suppose and and really really only painted once and you know it was new when we bought it and we painted one time since then but you know it s probably going to be time to paint again in a couple of years so you re in the same position that i m in i ve i ve only done mine twice and you ve you ve done yours twice too well once was on there and then you just had to do it once right right so and uh yeah on the on the interior do you do uh do y all have a lot of uh plaster walls that the the uh color is built into the plaster so you don t paint a lot no no oh yeah i i watch uh some of these TV programs you know how to do it s you know you fix it oh like This Old House you fix it so yeah This Old House and some of those and i i really haven t you know haven t paid a lot of attention to to whether or not you do painting on on top of plaster or not so hum so i hadn t hadn t really thought about that so they just when they when they put the plaster walls up they just tinted the plaster well that s what my impression was that they you know that they were just white well they re white walls you know unless it s white if you want white walls then white plaster is uh doesn t need to be painted or that was my impression anyway i m not sure hum yeah that s interesting no ours you know wouldn t they were just regular plaster walls but uh yeah uh huh and then some of them you know like the kitchen and the bathrooms we uh we had put paper up right yeah and actually the uh bedrooms upstairs too but but the rest of it and i i just don t like papering i painting is is a lot easier yeah that s yeah yeah well we really have uh our our bedrooms i guess are the ones that have uh that have to be painted uh we ve got paper on uh our dining room and kitchen and bathrooms and then we ve got paneling in our family room and game room all right so you don t have a a lot of paint either so but we don t have a lot of paint inside of course the ceilings are you know all all have to be painted uh huh yeah but uh but they don t require a lot if the only the problem that i ve seen in the past is like when you ve got uh if you ve got natural gas and heat of course you don t in the east i suppose you don t have a lot of natural gas heat but if you don t have your y our heat adjusted your gas adjusted right then you can get some stains you know on the ceilings and you know ceiling ceiling oh they get yeah yeah and that s something we don t we get uh we ve got on oil fired hot water baseboard um hum yeah so and it doesn t generate uh there s a little dust on it once in a while but it s not even like hot air yeah right so and we don t use gas in fact there wasn t any gas in the in the street when we built there was no houses around yeah um so we didn t have that problem um yeah so i ve got a wood stove um hum and i thought for a while that that may create a problem but it hasn t it s wood it s uh yeah if it s been a dry air tight yeah so that even that doesn t doesn t create a problem but i think uh yeah yeah more and more people are getting away from paint they re they re doing other things um especially with the oil base yeah yeah yeah but the paneling and the wallpapering and the and that kind of stuff are alike yep yep the and there s there s less maintenance um hum yeah it s and it s been nice to not have to worry about painting the these rooms that we ve got to have the paneling on them yeah you don t have to of course if you decide you want to change the paper and you know you ve got just about as much problem as yeah that s right so well we did do that we we stripped the paint off or the paper off of one of our you know off of our part of our house and then repapered it and it s that was not any fun but uh we stripped and then had somebody else come in and do the actually put the paper up next time i think i ll do it the other way around let them strip and i ll hang the paper oh i hate hanging paper that is oh that s one of the jobs that i just i d do anything else but i ll i ll um uh huh yeah yeah but papering and uh and and putting up uh drywall for the plaster i hate that stuff too you know i just contracted that stuff out and yeah yeah that s yeah i did the papering you know when we built but that s not my uh that s not my cup of tea yeah it s there hanging the hanging the drywall is not uh not a lot of fun you got to you got to really pay attention and and know pretty much what your doing with that to get it up and get the the uh seams and everything yeah covered up just right and all that so it s so what are the other questions that i m actually i had a house um my home before this one was uh was a Cape Ann and i wasn t up and down too that was uh that was kind of high and that was painted um oh yeah they are we bought that and it was uh the paint was uh so so i had scraped i had to do a lot of scraping and then i put uh uh water base paint over the uh oil um hum and it was eight years before i had to do it again oh that s and uh and the manufacturer recommended that uh he gave me uh i can t remember what the solution was and he said just uh wash your house down with it um hum and then uh you know with a long brush and then just hose it all down and i had the whole yard was full of soap suds yeah and he said just paint over that and we sold the house oh well twelve years ago yeah yeah and i don t think they ve repainted since well now that s so that s held up and that s an oil base on the bottom and then a water base and it was right i had uh i had put one coat of of uh over that water base and then before we sold it there was another one and i d wash the house down and all that um hum yeah and it s it s held up
