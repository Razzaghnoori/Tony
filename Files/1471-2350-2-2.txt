 Introduction Although conflicting findings about bone mineral density BMD in patients with type 2 diabetes have been reported there are substantial data which support the notion that type 2 diabetes is associated with increased BMD 1 2 3 The Rotterdam Study 2 which involved 5 931 subjects including 243 men and 355 women with type 2 diabetes provides the most convincing evidence They found that diabetic men and women had increased BMD independent of age obesity the use of estrogen thiazide or loop diuretics impairment in the ability of daily living and smoking 2 Furthermore hyperinsulinemia has been reported to be associated with an increased BMD in diabetic 4 and non diabetic subjects 5 From the Rancho Bernardo Study 5 the level of fasting insulin was significantly and positively associated with BMD in non diabetic female subjects where each 10 U ml increase in fasting insulin level was associated with an increase of BMD by 0 33 g cm 2in the radius and 0 57 g cm 2in the spine However no independent association between fasting insulin level and BMD was noted in males 5 Since fasting insulin level is an indicator of insulin resistance it is tempting to hypothesize that insulin resistance decreased insulin sensitivity is associated with increased BMD BMD is known to have strong genetic determinants Our understanding of the relationship between BMD and VDR gene polymorphism is based on a twin study of serum osteocalcin level 6 The synthesis of osteocalcin the most abundant non collageous protein in bone is induced by calcitriol the active form of vitamin D through the VDR Since a variation in serum osteocalcin level was shown to have a strong genetic component mediated through the VDR the relationship between VDR polymorphisms and serum osteocalcin level was found Furthermore this relationship was shown to be independent of age or menopausal effect 7 Subsequently the VDR gene polymorphisms were found to account for 75 of the total genetic effect on BMD in healthy people 8 However to date there are more than 50 studies on the relationship between VDR gene polymorphisms and BMD 9 About half of the studies found a significant association and the other half found no association 9 The most convincing evidence comes from a study of peak BMD in a group of pre pubertal girls 10 which confirms the relationship between VDR gene polymorphism and BMD Since the VDR is expressed in tissues namely muscle and pancreatic islets 11 12 13 14 which are involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism we hypothesized that the VDR gene could play a role in glucose metabolism In this study we examined the role of the Fok I polymorphism in the translation initiation codon of the VDR gene in 49 healthy glucose tolerant Caucasians who underwent a standard oral glucose tolerance test The insulin sensitivity and beta cell function were estimated using a homeostasis model assessment HOMA 15 We found that the Fok I polymorphism is associated with insulin resistance in a Caucasian population Results Characteristics of the study population Since hypertension is associated with insulin resistance 16 only those with normal blood pressure systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg were enrolled into the study Because we were also concerned about the effect of glucose toxicity on beta cell function and insulin sensitivity 17 all subjects underwent a standard 75 gm oral glucose tolerance test Only those subjects with a fasting plasma glucose level less than 6 1 mM interval plasma glucose levels at 30 60 and 90 minutes less than 11 1 mM and two hour plasma glucose level less than 7 8 mM were enrolled in this study This study included 49 healthy Caucasian subjects of which 28 were female Clinical features of the subjects were mean age 28 years old range 19 39 years mean body mass index 24 26 kg cm 2 17 58 34 26 kg cm 2 mean waist hip ratio 0 80 cm cm 0 65 1 03 cm cm mean systolic blood

glucose level 5 71 mM 2 94 7 60 mM Genotype phenotype and biochemical association After genotyping we identified 18 FF 21 Ff and 10 ff subjects In this Caucasian population the allele frequency was 58 for the F allele and 42 for the f allele The distribution of genotypes was in compliance with the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium p 0 873 Since only 10 ff subjects were identified they were pooled with the Ff subjects Two groups FF vs Ff ff had compatible gender distribution age body mass index systolic and diastolic blood pressure fasting lipid profiles and fasting plasma glucose level Table 1 However the Ff ff subjects had a higher mean waist hip ratio and a higher mean fasting plasma insulin level compared to the FF subjects p 0 042 and p 0 006 respectively These results indicate that the Ff ff subjects are more obese and more insulin resistant than the FF subjects Beta cell function B and insulin sensitivity S were estimated from the HOMA based on the average of three fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels before the oral glucose tolerance test No difference was noted in B between the two groups p 0 23 However there was a drastic difference in S between the two groups p 0 006 After an oral glucose load Figure 1 the Ff ff subjects had similar plasma glucose levels at each time point compared to the FF subjects However the Ff ff subjects had higher postchallenged insulin levels at 30 60 and 90 minutes than the FF subjects p 0 009 p 0 049 and p 0 041 respectively Furthermore the Ff ff subjects had a higher insulin area under the curve than the FF subjects p 0 009 These results again indicate that the Ff ff subjects are more insulin resistant than the FF subjects Stepwise regression analysis Various covariates have been shown to affect either beta cell function or insulin sensitivity or both To examine the influence of the available covariates in addition to the Fok I polymorphism on beta cell function and insulin sensitivity we employed a stepwise regression analytical approach Age gender body mass index waist hip ratio and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were entered into the model and a backward stepwise regression analysis was performed It revealed that the Fok I polymorphism was an independent determinant for S but not for B Table 2 The Fok I polymorphism combined with waist hip ratio explained 29 3 of the variance in S This result confirms that this polymorphism is an independent risk factor for insulin resistance Discussion We found that in healthy normotensive Caucasian subjects with normal glucose tolerance the Fok I polymorphism in the vitamin D receptor gene accounted for 15 2 of the variance in S but had no impact on B Although the Ff ff subjects were more obese than the FF subjects p 0 042 for waist hip ratio the difference in S between the two groups decreased after adjusting for waist hip ratio 0 50 vs 0 69 before and 0 52 vs 0 65 after adjusting for waist hip ratio However this polymorphism remained an independent determinant for S after adjusting for waist hip ratio p 0 039 Figure 2 Therefore we concluded that the Fok I polymorphism was a risk factor for insulin resistance independent of obesity The allelic frequencies of the present study 58 for the F allele and 42 for the f allele are very similar to the reported frequencies in a Japanese 56 for the F allele and 44 for the f allele and a Caucasian 59 for the F allele and 41 for the f allele population 18 19 In the present study we pooled the ff subjects with Ff subjects for its small sample size 10 ff vs 18 Ff and 21 FF To examine whether there is a difference among the three genotypic groups we examined the influence of genotypes on S and B by ANOVA We found a significant difference in S p 0 016 and again no difference in B p 0 408 However no difference in S was noted between the Ff and ff groups p 0 159 The main difference in S is between the FF and Ff groups p 0 007 Although we cannot exclude the possibility of inadequate power to detect the difference from the present sample size this observation is consistent with the functional study of the Fok I polymorphism in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells 20 In this functional study they compared the inhibitory effect of 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D 3 on the growth of cultured human peripheral mononuclear cells isolated from subjects with different Fok I genotypes and found significant differences among the three genotypes but found no difference between the Ff and ff groups 20 Obesity is well known to be associated with insulin resistance 21 In the present study we also found that the Fok I polymorphism was associated with obesity assessed by waist hip ratio but not by body mass index Table 1 However the association between the Ff ff genotypes with both insulin resistance and obesity prompted us to further examine the interaction among this polymorphism obesity and insulin resistance Multivariate analysis revealed that this polymorphism had no independent impact on waist hip ratio p 0 1468 after adjustment for age p 0 0203 gender p 0 0007 and body mass index p 0 0001 while systolic and diastolic blood pressure had also no impact on waist hip ratio p 0 5549 and p 0 3806 respectively However from the multivariate analysis result of S Table 2 we concluded that this polymorphism had an important impact on insulin sensitivity which was independent of the influence of waist hip ratio Although gender was excluded as an independent covariate for S in the present study after adjustment for waist hip ratio which was affected by gender the interaction between gender and this polymorphism if any needs to be addressed in a study with a much larger sample size The role of VDR gene polymorphisms has been examined in four groups of diabetic patients however their roles in insulin sensitivity have not been examined In 93 Southern Indian families with type 1 diabetes transmission disequilibrium testing analysis demonstrated the preferential transmission of the b allele of the Bsm I polymorphism to affected subjects 22 However it was less certain for the Taq I and Apa I polymorphisms in this sample set Nonetheless this study indicates that the Bsm I polymorphism at the VDR gene locus is a risk factor of type 1 diabetes In a study of 152 Caucasian families with type 1 diabetes there was an excessive transmission of bT and bAT extended haplotypes to affected individuals but no evidence of excessive transmission of Taq I and Apa I alleles alone 23 Recently we confirmed the association of this marker with type 1 diabetes in a Taiwanese population 24 These studies in two different populations indicate that the Bsm I polymorphism at the VDR gene locus confers susceptibility to type 1 diabetes The study of type 2 diabetes with the VDR gene included 164 Bangladesh Asians who were at risk for type 2 diabetes and 25 of them were either diabetic or impaired glucose tolerant An association between the Apa I polymorphism and insulin secretion index was noted 25 These studies suggest that the VDR gene locus is a genetic marker for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes Since the Bsm I polymorphism is located in intron 7 the Apa I polymorphism in intron 8 and the Taq I polymorphism in exon 9 within the 3 untranslated region of the VDR gene they are less likely to have any biological consequences in causing the disease and affecting glucose metabolism Furthermore functional studies of these polymorphisms show no clearly demonstrable difference among them 26 27 28 29 The T to C transition polymorphism at the translation initiation codon of the human VDR gene not only destroys a Fok I site but also abolishes the first translation initiation codon of this gene The alternative translation initiation codon which also adheres the first AUG rule by Kozak 30 is located downstream by three amino acids In the present study we examined the Fok I polymorphism which not only affects the translation of the peptide but also affects the biological activity tested in Hela Cells 31 This T to C transition resulted in the synthesis of a smaller F allele three amino acids less than the f allele protein with increased vitamin D dependent transcriptional activation 31 In addition the different response to 1 25 dihydroxyvitamin D is also demonstrated in cultured human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from subjects with different Fok I genotypes 20 We found that the subjects with homozygous F allele had increased insulin sensitivity compared to those with the f allele Although the molecular basis of this association is unclear the study of the relationship between the level of vitamin D and glucose tolerance 32 provides some insight to the underlying mechanism Glucose tolerance and vitamin D level were assessed in 142 elderly Dutchmen Fasting insulin and postchallenged insulin levels decreased with increased vitamin D levels 32 As a higher insulin level is a surrogate for decreased insulin sensitivity their observation suggests that a higher vitamin D level is associated with increased insulin sensitivity Since vitamin D binds to the vitamin D receptor to initiate the downstream action a higher vitamin D level would lead to an increase in vitamin D dependent transcription activation Our observation that the subjects with homozygous F alleles associated with an increased activity are more insulin sensitive than those with the f allele is consistent with the notion above Our original hypothesis was that the allele which is associated with increased BMD was also associated with higher insulin levels and insulin resistance However since the F allele is associated with increased BMD 31 33 our observation of the association between the F allele and increased insulin sensitivity is not consistent with our original hypothesis On the other hand not all reports support the association between the F allele and increased BMD 34 35 Nonetheless our observation shows that this polymorphism is an independent determinant for insulin sensitivity and is in agreement with the notion that a higher level of vitamin D is associated with increased insulin sensitivity 32 Furthermore additional studies in the Caucasian and other ethnic populations are required In the present study we report an association between a polymorphism at the translation initiation codon of the human VDR gene and insulin sensitivity in glucose tolerant and normotensive Caucasians This polymorphism is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity explaining 15 2 of the variance in S and with waist hip ratio explaining 29 3 of the variance in S Although the speculated mechanism of our observation is in agreement with the published association between vitamin D levels and insulin sensitivity further studies are required to confirm our observation in other ethnic groups as well as in another Caucasian population To explore the underlying molecular basis of the Fok I polymorphism at the VDR gene locus as well as the association between vitamin D level and insulin sensitivity also warrants further study Subjects materials and methods Study subjects We confirm that the study has complied with the recommendations of the Declaration of Helsinki The study was approved by the institutional review board and a written informed consent was obtained from

minutes These samples were used for glucose insulin lipid measurement and genomic DNA isolation Fasting plasma glucose and insulin levels were calculated as the average of three fasting samples After the oral administration of 75 gm glucose postchallenged blood samples were drawn at 30 60 90 and 120 minutes for glucose and insulin measurements A limited physical examination was performed on all study participants including measurements of weight height waist hip and blood pressure After resting quietly for 30 minutes three consecutive measurements of systolic and diastolic blood pressures were taken one minute apart and the average of the three measurements was reported DNA extraction and genotyping of the Fok I polymorphism Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral lymphocytes as
