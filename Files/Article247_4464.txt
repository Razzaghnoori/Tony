 Trees Tomboys and Seat Belts Hi I too have my share of pre Title IX sports injuries A question Were all girls growing up in the mid to late 60s and early 70s swinging from trees Tarzan style Or was it just you and me The Toledo version of the tomboy in the tree episode is pretty basic I m 7 years old and reaching for the rope as I prepare to leap The kids who are in charge of pulling the rope from below yank it too soon And I go thudding to the ground The plaster cast for my broken right wrist reached all the way to my shoulder At first I was chagrined to say the least It was late summer and there still were many days and nights of sports remaining before school started again But the cast did come in helpful with some of the bullies on the block Defending my little sister and brother I conked a few bigger kids on the head in those weeks That was fun You know some injuries aren t humorous And some are downright sad I don t know Derrick Thomas I ve never interviewed him never met him but I can t stop thinking about him Who can imagine what that poor guy is going through right now He s a nine time Pro Bowl linebacker with Kansas City and while going to the airport his car hits a patch of ice and he s not wearing his seat belt and he s thrown from the car and he s paralyzed from the waist down I guess doctors don t know if it s forever or not but it doesn t sound good You picture these guys grunting in the weight room for hours a day lifting running sweating You ve watched them I ve watched them And then he doesn t put on his seat belt such a pro athlete thing eh and his spine snaps in two places and that s it Apparently he s a good guy one of those players who is great about charities and really into his community And I read that the other man who was thrown from the car ran Thomas charity golf tournament That man died in the accident This makes me sad Do you think this has quieted any of that Super Bowl bluster down there in Atlanta Do you think even one pro athlete who didn t wear his seat belt yesterday wore it today Probably not They re all fearless They ll all live forever Right Until tomorrow Chris
