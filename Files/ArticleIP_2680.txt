 Juicy Journals Forget books and magazines Turn off the television Put down the Starr report If you really want the lowdown something that will tell you almost anything you want to know about people medical journals are where the action is One of medicine s hidden pleasures is that while there is a fantastic amount to learn about human beings most of it is already spelled out in some journal In 1997 alone the National Library of Medicine added references to 519 012 new articles from some 3 200 journals to its Medline database The fact that all these journals can survive and multiply should be a clue that there s something compelling about them Subscribers are willing to pay dearly to keep their favorite journals going Rates run to 3 000 a year or more for some journals As a result while The New Yorker lost millions last year the scientific publishing giant Elsevier put out some 1 200 journals and made a whopping 40 percent profit on them To be sure for many doctors and scientists the interest in a given journal is purely parochial Even the smallest ones Elsevier produces some with fewer than 500 subscribers can be the prestige publication for a tiny field Moreover behind the glossy covers and stilted prose many of these little journals function as the gossip rags the People magazines for the science niches My pet journal is Health Affairs circulation 8 000 the journal that all health policy wonks get and therefore write in It s how we keep tabs on what everyone is up to An infectious disease specialist friend of mine reads the Journal of Virology circulation 5 000 My parents subscribe to the Journal of the American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin circulation 26 000 But people should not let all the Balkanization and technical sounding talk scare them away Poke around in a few medical journals and you re bound to find material as absorbing as anything you ll find in Vanity Fair The names alone are worth perusing Many journals follow the standard Annals of or Archives of or Journal of approach you know like the International Journal of Leprosy But the best are the direct in your face journal names Placenta Gut Brain Blood When you pick up Placenta you know exactly what you re getting What s more you get the impression that the editors are proud to give it to you that they have no second thoughts about the field they have chosen Consider by comparison Foot and Ankle International It s a terrible name It conveys embarrassment a sense that the editors thought Foot alone wasn t good enough for them Even adding Ankle was still too minor league for their ambitions so they had to tack on that International You want a journal more willing to glory in its small arcane world Clearly however the cool stuff is what s inside and a few journals always have the cool stuff The Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy is not surprisingly reliably fascinating no matter what your profession A recent issue I browsed through at the library while hiding it in a copy of Science had such topically relevant reports as and Penile Erections Shape Angle and Length A quirkier favorite of mine is the Journal of Emergency Medicine which is replete with oddball articles such as the recent one from the University of Tennessee on 14 cases occurring over five weeks in which prisoners reported swallowing razor blades and other metal objects Click for more details Not long ago however I discovered the journal that never fails to amaze the American Journal of Forensic Medicine and Pathology A typical issue contained an article on three suicide victims with multiple gunshot wounds to the head complete with photos from the death scenes one poor guy shot himself five times before he finally died another on improved methods to determine the age of an unidentified victim and yet a third on the homicide rituals of the Italian Mafia You ll never go wrong picking up a copy of that journal Each of these specialized journals offers an obsessive s eye view of the world around us a new look at the seemingly familiar International medical journals however can do the opposite They tend to share the common language of doctors everywhere and so can make the unfamiliar reassuringly accessible while still conveying a revealing sense of their national Zeitgeist I recently picked up the Annals of Saudi Medicine for example and discovered to my surprise the telling obsessions of a modernized country ulcers a growing epidemic of obesity smoking heart disease child abuse The Indian Journal of Medical Research on the other hand despite all the press reports about India s burgeoning middle class is currently filled with reports on infectious diseases the scourge of poor nations Sadly few people appreciate the refined charms of medical journals Occasionally however I ll come across a fellow journal junkie We ll exchange tips like frat boys do Have you seen the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology one such friend asked me not long ago That journal is hot I looked it up at my next opportunity It did not disappoint The first issue I read for example had a study of 219 subjects who were instructed to put on a specific facial expression while looking in the mirror What the psychologists found was that participants told to do nothing more than put on a happy face developed a significantly more positive mood than those told to adopt a neutral expression And those made to assume an unhappy expression had the worst moods of all The journal was full of strange little studies like that I made a mental note to check it out again And when I left the library that evening you can bet I had a smile on my face If you missed the sidebar on adultery click If you missed the sidebar on razor swallowing prisoners
