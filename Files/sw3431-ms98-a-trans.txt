        okay Mike i guess well be talking about painting recently any of kind of recent painting youve done uh yourself have you done any recently     well we um remodeled a bathroom   uhhuh   and which required uh completely repainting the bathroom and the other project weve done around here is uh weve remodeled all our all our closets   wow wow thats thats quite a chore   which required quite a bit of painting   yes i imagine it did did you have that done professionally or did you do that yourself   no we did it ourselves did it myself   you enjoy that   yeah   oh thats thats fun we just recently uh had our boys room our two oldest boys share a room and theyre uh the paint has uh kind of faded and deteriorated and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth and uh looks quite good we were quite pleased with the result   is this a project you did yourself   yes its a project uh that i did yes and and uh   what what what brought about the fading of the paint just sun exposure   well i dont think its sun exposure but um boys will be boys and there there were crayon marks on there and we had to to scrub the crayon marks off of course try and get it clean   oh okay yeah latex paint latex   and so pardon me yes it was it was latex paint and thats uh what we put back on there was a latex paint   umhum   plus uh they had bunk beds and the boy one of the younger boys when he was younger about three years old got a uh got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures   on the ceiling   so  yes on the ceiling and uh you scrub and you scrub but you cant it all off   yeah no thats true   and so thats one of the reasons why we painted and uh   did you go what what kind of paint do you use on the ceiling   we used a flat latex paint and in the bedroom as i understand thats uh one of the better type of paints to have because its not so reflective and and glossy colored   okay umhum   and it uh turned out real real well   seems like um ive weve done some remodeling of some uh rental houses that we have   umhum   and it appears as though that uh oh in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built uh they used a lot of uh semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints   umhum   and that was a little difficult to cover with todays paints it seemed like       we had a occasion uh where we had to do some sealing   uhhuh   of uh the ceiling of the this type of paint before we could paint it   oh you had to prime it and and seal cover over it   yeah right   huh   you had pretty good luck with one coat type paints you use a particular brand or anything   well i like to use this this Sears uh the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee yes   weather beater type stuff yeah   and the reason being is once i paint it i dont wanna have to go and do it another five or seven years later   understand   but uh and uh were quite satisfied with that and and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale and we do do that fact i was just reading an article you mentioned painting your bathroom   umhum   i read an article recently that uh you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend to to peel or come off because of the moisture high moisture content in your bathroom bathroom   yeah its a lot like uh wall paper   and uh did you have any problems with that or   thats true well the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath so we didnt have a problem with that   oh good   um i have had ive uh have never experienced that type of a problem   uhhuh   uh with a latex paint   oh good neither neither have i   so you shouldnt have a you shouldnt have a problem with it   oh good   theyre theyre pretty well refined today a lot of the paints  and Sears is one of the better ones   uhhuh yeah you   ive used uh many a gallon of them myself   do you uh have you ever used an oil base paint   uh used oil base paints for trim   umhum   you know like around doors and and on doors things like that   why why do you use that im im kind of learning at this new at this but   uh primarily because it seems it seems to be a little more um what do i wanna say   it adheres better or lasts longer   well not so much that it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings   oh okay   as opposed to uh a latex type paint   uhhuh   and uh it just you know it it gives you a a variance even though its the same color   right well thats good thats good   so its worked out pretty well for us   um have you ever done any painting outside   uh quite a bit painted a couple of houses uh recently this summer we painted a uh out building which is a shed that we have on the property
