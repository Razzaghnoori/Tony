 December 10 1993 Dear Graduate Enclosed is a specially prepared and entertaining crossword puzzle that challenges your knowledge about the law school Also you will find with this letter a 1993 fact card about the law school information about the Indiana Tax Credit if you reside in Indiana and a gift card and envelope to use in returning your contribution to the school These are exceedingly difficult times for public higher education For this fiscal year and next the law school is required to absorb reductions in its state appropriation and increased health costs totaling more than 400 000 Moreover significant increases in state financial support for public higher education are extremely unlikely during the remainder of this decade As a result of the current economic climate alumni support is more critical than ever before We are no longer a state supported law school for the state no longer provides the great bulk of our funding Instead I believe we can best be described as a law school that is state assisted Student tuition covers about half of our operating revenues and gifts from alumni and friends provide the true margin of excellence for our programs Contributions to the law school s Annual Fund enable us to increase our support for scholarships student programs and activities e g moot court and client counseling student researchers and stipends for faculty research projects to mention just a few examples I believe we do our job well and are continually strengthening our reputation as a first rate law school We have excellent students and a talented faculty who are highly regarded as classroom teachers and scholars We cannot entirely succeed however without the financial help of our alumni I urge you to support your alma mater so that we can continue to make you proud of the degree that you hold from this institution Sincerely Norman Lefstein Dean Enclosures
