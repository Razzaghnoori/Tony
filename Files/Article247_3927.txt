 Hong Kong Airport Better Than Disneyland E shopping Cell phones You love all technology in any form and what you are glossing over is that this stuff is homogenizing the world It s turning Hong Kong into some sort of New York City with its highly refined versions of such Western paraphernalia as Nine West shoe stores everywhere Of course people in Hong Kong will shop on online Why Because it s there And now Hong Kong is even getting a Disneyland the last thing it needs in the year 2005 So in five years we ll be able to ask ourselves if we d rather travel to Orlando or Hong Kong and if we d be able to tell the difference once we got there Oh wait Florida is the place with the palm trees right I can understand why Hong Kong feels as if it needs a shot of something to revive its flagging tourism industry But really the problem is not that the city lacks a Magic Kingdom This is simply not a city that screams vacation destination Try instead Money More money How about going up in a skyscraper and making some money today Apparently the Chinese government s decision a few months ago to import the movie Mulan unleashed a mighty appetite for all things Disney So we re going to get another of those infamous theme parks on Lantau Island near the brand new Hong Kong Airport While the last thing any place in the world needs is a Disneyland I think there are special circumstances here that make the incursion even more distasteful Putting Disneyland on Lantau Island can only distract us from the airport itself which seems to me to be the perfect iteration of a modern day theme park with its brilliantly modern design that effortlessly propels travelers to their gates their luggage a brand new rail link to downtown Hong Kong The airport already offers everything that Disney is promising excellent public restrooms Theme restaurants that serve dim sum A lack of litter Harrowing rides on airplanes It even has entertainment in the form of trendy shopping The airport houses an outpost of the it s cool to be Chinese Shanghai Tang department store with its trademark teddy bears which are far cuter than any Disney character that I ve come across while eating themed fast food In fact if I were running the Bureau of Tourism for the Chinese government I would bill the Hong Kong airport as a destination in itself
