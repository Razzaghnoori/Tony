 Remnick s Progress The Times of London Monday was much impressed by Russia s dash and daring in sneakily moving into Kosovo before NATO s troops In an editorial titled Who Dares Wins the motto of the British SAS commandos the paper said that the Russians have won not only Pristina and the initiative but the secret admiration of scores of NATO officers frustrated by an enforced wait on the Kosovo borders Their coup de th tre has served as a reminder that dithering loses to derring do the paper said This may have been a media dominated war but to halt and advance to allow the cameras to catch up is a grotesque irresponsibility But this was a minority view in the British press On the Left the Guardian said the Russian military seems ever closer to being out of control and that its behavior in Kosovo is proof that there is no longer one government in that vast country but rather several held in loose often hostile connection to each other NATO should continue to deny Russia its own sector in Kosovo but should also soothe its wounded pride by admitting that the West has been cavalier in its treatment of the former superpower and that it now has to be given a seat at the commanding table On the Right the Daily Telegraph criticized the United States for being too accommodating to Russia It is hardly surprising that a cardinal aim of Russian policy is to counter NATO s influence in central Europe and the role of honest broker between the West and Belgrade gave them an ideal opportunity to do so the paper said Trusting them with that task prolonged the air campaign and has now seriously queered KFOR s pitch it added NATO cannot blame the Russians for making difficulties The fault lies in giving them such an opportunity In Paris Sunday Le Monde ran an editorial saying that the message of Russia s race to Pristina was a brutal one that the Russians are not willing to submit to NATO s authority and that they want control of the northern sector of the province to carry out a de facto partition of Kosovo While the West had good reasons to be considerate toward Russia by delaying preparations for a land invasion and seeking a solution to the crisis within the unusual context of the G 8 only because Russia was a part of it it also has the right to expect Russia to play the game Le Monde said The West was right to involve Russia it concluded but not at any price and especially not at that of a partition of Kosovo Another Paris daily Lib ration said Monday that Russia s dash into Kosovo shouldn t be treated lightly because it s unclear who pilots the Russian plane today Bill Clinton might well ask this question of Boris Yeltsin when they meet in Cologne Germany on Saturday the paper said but it isn t certain that his answer will be very convincing In Germany Monday the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called the move Yeltsin s coup but added in a front page comment that the next few days would show whether Yeltsin has only been acting on whim or whether there s a strategy behind it Europe s Monday papers were generally dominated however by the results of the weekend s elections for the European Parliament in Strasbourg that on very low voter turnouts throughout Western Europe delivered heavy rebuffs to both Chancellor Gerhard Schr der of Germany and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain Conservatives trounced the Left in Italy as well where the party of TV magnate Silvio Berlusconi a former prime minister came in first But in France the Socialists triumphed Le Figaro of Paris said however that the real winners of the elections were the absentionists In France fewer than one elector in two voted in Britain fewer than one in four did The Financial Times of London said the low turnouts threatened to undermine the effectiveness of the European Parliament and most British papers said the results might set back Blair s plans to bring Britain under the European single currency the euro David Remnick editor of The New Yorker told the Milan daily Corriere della Sera Monday that his objective for the magazine was that it would be said that of the 100 best articles of the century 25 were published in The New Yorker ideally half of those under my editorship Confessing to interviewer Alessandra Farkas that The New Yorker was still in the red Remnick said he is pleased that it has been rechristened the most authoritative and prestigious weekly on the planet because when you re the best in your field it s inevitable that sooner or later you become profitable He rejected a suggestion that The New Yorker was elitist saying that the word applied better to the New York Review of Books a purely celebral if brilliant undertaking Asked if he agreed that the quality of the world s press is in decline Remnick replied We are the living proof of the opposite Investing in quality has and always will have a place in the market Despite our deficit nobody tells me what to publish and what not to publish And do you know why In a world of fast food there will always be room for a five star restaurant
