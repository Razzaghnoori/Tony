 Background Although electrocardiograms ECGs have been obtained in conscious mice currently reported techniques require restraint 1 or anesthesia and surgical implantation of telemetry devices 2 3 4 Anesthesia however may depress cardiovascular function and adequate recovery after transmitter implantation in mice is nearly 3 weeks 3 5 Accordingly we developed a non invasive technique for obtaining ECGs in conscious mice by placing the animal on a platform embedded with paw sized ECG electrodes connected to an amplifier This method is much less traumatic requires no anesthesia or surgery and promotes rapid screening of large quantities of mice ECG data we obtained non invasively in conscious mice are comparable to those recently published using surgically implanted telemetry devices 2 4 To test the efficacy of our system we evaluated ECGs in mice of either sex of several strains and of different ages Moreover we tested whether our system could detect ECG alterations in response to pharmacological challenge by isoproterenol The baseline heart rate data and responses to the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol we recorded non invasively in mice are comparable to data published using invasive methods 6 We developed an ECG signal processing analyzing and database Web portal which we named e MOUSE accessible to the biotechnology community The advantages of the ECG recording and analyses paradigm we developed are clear given the high cost of breeding housing and transporting mice and the call for comprehensive yet widely available phenotyping tests 7 Results We recorded ECGs in 10 males and 10 females each of C57BL 6 129 Sv and FVB N mice three inbred strains commonly used to model human diseases A representative ECG recording from an adult male C57BL 6 mouse is shown in Fig 1 Since the mice are conscious baseline artifact and noise are apparent in the unfiltered signals Yet the P waves and T waves are discernible by eye and interpretable by the software algorithmic processing of the signal digitized at 2500 samples per second Analyses of the digitized signals via e MOUSE demonstrated significantly faster heart rates in C57BL 6 female mice than in males 741 2 bpm vs 692 5 bpm P 0 05 n 10 and shorter QRS duration 7 5 0 2 ms vs 8 1 0 2 ms P 0 05 Table 1summarizes results in 129 Sv mice 10 males and 10 females again demonstrating faster heart rate and shorter QRS duration and QT interval in female mice than in age matched males Rate corrected QT QTc in male 129 Sv mice was significantly longer than in females 66 7 1 9 ms vs 58 4 1 6 ms P 0 05 Gender differences in heart rate were also apparent in the FVB N strain 736 5 bpm in males n 10 vs 706 7 bpm in females n 10 P 0 05 Reducing the spacing of the electrodes allowed us to record ECGs in 6 day and again in 12 day old nursling C57BL 6 mice 8 males and 5 females and return them to their mother The ECG from a 6 day old C57BL 6 nursling female is shown in Fig 2 Heart rate variability in neonates was significantly less than in adults 2 5 0 4 bpm vs 21 2 bpm P 0 05 Heart rate in nursling females was significantly slower than in adult females 655 6 bpm vs 741 2 bpm P 0 05 Interestingly the gender differences in heart rate we observed in adult mice were absent in 6 day old and 12 day old neonates Upon weaning 21 days old however gender differences in heart rate became apparent 697 14 bpm in males n 5 vs 750 8 bpm in females n 3 P 0 05 The acute increase in heart rate within the first minutes following one intraperitoneal injection of the adrenergic agonist isoproterenol 2 5 g g was significantly less in female compared to male C57BL 6 adult mice 5 2 females vs 12 2 males P 0 05 n 5 for each group Saline injection had no effect on heart rate After 3 days of repeated isoproterenol injection 2 5 g g once at 9AM and once at 9PM heart rate in males prior to the 6 thinjection was significantly reduced compared to control heart rate in males prior to the 1 stinjection whereas the heart rate in females did not change Both male and female mice exhibited significant acute increases in heart rate 27 6 males and 22 3 females after the 6 thinjection of the drug on day 3 P 0 05 compared to increases following 1 stinjection on day 1 Fig 3illustrates significant electrocardiographic alterations immediately after the 1 stadministration of isoproterenol on day 1 in a C57BL 6 male mouse ST segment depression suggestive of acute subendocardial ischemia was consistently observed in C57BL 6 male mice but not in all female mice immediately following administration of isoproterenol Heart weight in males and females treated with isoproterenol for 3 days was significantly increased 16 compared to hearts from mice treated with saline for 3 days P 0 05 Discussion Strain Gender Differences in ECGs in Adult Mice To our knowledge this is the first study to describe gender differences in heart rate in genetically homogenous strains of conscious mice Studies in humans 9 10 and in rats 11 12 have shown females to have faster heart rates than males differences that disappear with age 10 13 In C57BL 6 mice and in 129 Sv mice we found that conscious females exhibited significantly faster heart rates than male mice In FVB N mice however we noted faster heart rates and briefer ECG time intervals in male compared to female mice Mitchell et al using implanted transmitters reported slightly but insignificantly faster heart rates in male compared to female FVB mice 4 Gender and strain differences in heart rate may reflect differences in hormone activity which are known to affect cardiovascular autonomic regulation differentially in males and females 9 and vary among mouse strains 14 Our strain dependent observations agree with results of invasive studies 8 6 and support the importance of genetic factors in influencing heart rate Developmental Changes in ECGs in Conscious Neonatal Mice We found that the gender differences apparent in C57BL 6 adults were absent in nursling mice Reduced activity in newborns could contribute to reduced heart rate and heart rate variability However observations in quietly resting adult mice n 3 monitored 30 min after placement on the recording platform of reduced heart rate 471 20 bpm and increased heart rate variability 53 6 bpm suggest that the results in neonates may be attributable to reduced sympathetic and parasympathetic signaling 15 The time domain heart rate variability data we obtained non invasively are comparable to those obtained using implanted telemetry devices 2 16 The developmental changes in heart rate we measured in mice parallel those in human neonates 13 17 lambs 18 and newborn rats 19 Moreover our observations in neonatal mice are in agreement with Wang et al who reported progressive and significant shortening of R R intervals during neonatal development 1 Accordingly our approach adaptable to the study of small mice that might otherwise die from anesthesia or surgery might be valuable in examining developmental changes and abnormalities 13 17 Effects of Sympathetic Stimulation in Conscious Mice The blunted heart rate increase in response to adrenergic stimulation in conscious C57BL 6 female mice is consistent with gender related differences in baroreflex control of heart rate in healthy humans 20 Estrogen has been shown to enhance baroreflex sensitivity 21 and attenuate the response of heart rate to administration of isoproterenol in rats 22 After repeated injections of isoproterenol heart rate decreased and the QRS duration increased significantly in male mice but did not change in female mice Yet both males and females demonstrated increased sensitivity to acute isoproterenol injection after repeated administration that resulted in significant cardiac hypertrophy 23 24 We observed a 16 increase in heart mass in both sexes after 3 days of isoproterenol treatment compared to mice treated with equivolume of saline Although adrenoceptor desensitization 23 or reduced ATPase activity 25 may account for the decrease in basal heart rate in the hypertrophied male hearts the increased sensitivity to isoproterenol may support the hypotheses of ischemia induced activation of adrenoceptor kinase 26 or modulation of G protein signaling to preserve adenylate cyclase activity 27 To our knowledge this is the first report that describes electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial ischemia in conscious mice although ST segment changes have characterized isoproterenol induced ischemia in rat 28 and man 29 Why males consistently developed ST segment depression following isoproterenol administration and females did not remains unanswered However significant gender related differences in the expression of glutathione S transferases GST have been observed in mice with female mice expressing significantly more of this antioxidant than male mice 30 In mice isoproterenol induced oxidative stress may be attenuated in females due to higher levels of GST 31 Study Limitations Mice are sensitive to even modest handling 3 8 and transport 3 32 The ECG indices we measured may reflect physiologic responses to the experimental environment relative to its home cage We encourage a 10 min acclimation period prior to recording data to attenuate effects consequent to handling and transport Usually mice establish contact between 3 electrodes and 3 limbs within 5 minutes after acclimation to record a continuous ECG for approximately 2 seconds The duration of the ECG recording should be considered in the interpretation of heart rate variability 33 The age gender and strain variations in heart rate may reflect age gender and strain variations in physiologic responses to transport 32 handling 3 and adaptation to repeated measurements 8 Yet the inter strain differences in heart rate we non invasively obtained after ECG recordings of short duration are in agreement with invasive experimental techniques intended to monitor heart rate in mice as caged 6 8 Our measurements were made in daytime hours disrupting the less active phases of the mouse circadian cycle Future innovation might incorporate an array of conductive electrodes into the animals cages to eliminate the effects of handling and transport and perhaps enable timed recordings Materials and Methods Mice Young adult mice 9 1 weeks old 21 1 g from 3 commonly used inbred strains C57BL 6 129 Sv and FVB N The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME were housed in standard conditions within the Animal Resource Facility at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Boston MA Nursling C57BL 6 mice of either sex were examined at post natal day 6 and 12 and returned to their mothers The same mice weaned were examined at 3 weeks of age ECG recording Mice were gently removed from their cages and positioned on the ECG recording platform An array of gel coated ECG electrodes Red Dot 3 M St Paul MN were embedded in the floor of the platform and spaced to provide contact between the electrodes and animals paws For adults the spacing between electrodes was 3 cm and for nurslings the spacing was reduced to 2 5 cm Filter paper with openings for the electrodes prevented mouse urine from short circuiting the signals The electrodes were connected to an amplifier HP78901A Hewlett Packard Andover MA by a shielded 3 electrode lead set M1605A Snap Hewlett Packard Andover MA Since even modest handling of mice may induce alterations in heart rate 6 each mouse was permitted to acclimatize for 10 min prior to collection of baseline data The signals were digitized with 16 bit precision DI 220 DATAQ Instruments Inc Akron OH at a sampling rate of 2500 samples second When mice were sitting or otherwise positioned such that the paws were not in contact with three electrodes the output from the amplifier was discarded Only data from continuous recordings of 20 30 ECG signals were used in the analyses Data were transmitted to the mousespecifics com Internet site Mouse Specifics Inc Boston MA using standard file transfer protocols for ECG signal analyses by e MOUSE ECG analyses Each signal was analyzed using e MOUSE an Internet based physiologic waveform analysis portal e MOUSE incorporates Fourier analyses and linear time invariant digital filtering of frequencies below 2 Hz and above 100 Hz to minimize environmental signal disturbances The software uses a peak detection algorithm to find the peak of the R waves and to calculate heart rate Heart rate variability was calculated as the mean of the differences between sequential heart rates for the complete set of ECG signals Subsequently determination of 1 stand 2 ndderivatives and algebraic if thens search the ECG signals for probable P wave peaks and onset and termination of QRS complexes Since the T wave is not separate from the QRS in rodent ECGs 28 34 there have been discrepancies in the definition of the QT interval and reported values 4 In accord with Mitchell et al 4 we routinely included the inverted and or biphasic portions of the T wave in our calculations of the QT interval We defined the end of the T wave of each signal as the point where the signal returned to the isoelectric line 1 35 the mean voltage between the preceding P wave and QRS interval The QT intervals were rate corrected QTc by application of the equation recommended by Mitchell et al 4 for use in mice The software plots its interpretation of P Q R S and T for each beat so that spurious data resulting from unfiltered noise or motion artifacts may be rejected e MOUSE then calculates the mean of the ECG time intervals for each set of waveforms adrenoceptor stimulation To test the sensitivity of our system for describing ECG alterations in response to a drug C57BL 6 mice were given either an intraperitoneal injection of 2 5 g g isoproterenol Sigma St Louis MO 5 males 5 females dissolved in 0 1 ml saline or an equal volume of saline 5 males 5 females twice daily for 3 days ECGs were recorded within 5 min prior to each injection and between 1 and 2 min after each injection to capture the peak of the response to the drug 6 After the last measurement mice were euthanized by intraperitoneal administration of pentobarbital 150 mg Kg consistent with the American Veterinary Medical Association Panel on Euthanasia guidelines Excised hearts excluding atria and blotted dry were then weighed Statistics Data are presented as the means SE Comparisons between genders among strains were performed using Student s t test for unpaired observations Effects of isoproterenol or saline injections within groups were performed using Student s t test for paired observations and between group comparisons using Student s t test for unpaired observations Differences were considered significant with P 0 05 Conclusions We developed a non invasive technique for obtaining ECGs in conscious mice We developed an Internet accessible portal for analyses of mouse electrocardiograms Using this system we demonstrated significant strain gender and age dependent differences in electrocardiograms in mice Moreover we demonstrated significant gender dependent differences in the cardiovascular response to adrenoceptor stimulation Our results may suggest that the stimulatory effects of genes and drugs on cardiac function may be more profound in male or masked in female mice This non invasive and rapid ECG phenotyping technique may improve the quality and increase the quantity of data collected from mouse models
