 Order out of Chaos Dear Ester Sorry you had trouble with your e mail account Actually last night I had trouble getting at an open line But today I made a second pot of coffee and am settling into my office at home Like you I read Safire s piece on the Brooklyn Museum issue in the New York Times It was on the mark The museum s ad on Page B10 of the Times only confirmed his point It s as if everybody has their script and dutifully follows it including the media and pundits In my own experience including with courts I am stunned by how willing people are to trivialize the concept of free speech in order to exploit it for some form of political advantage But it is only the beginning of the season The stunner in today s news was the atrocities by some U S troops in Korea As tragic as it is to hear finding out about it at least serves the purpose of demonstrating that monstrous evil is not only to be found in the former Yugoslavia or African countries The capacity of good people to do or at least tolerate evil things should never surprise us Finally for now I have continued to think about the discussion I attended the other night about Fukuyama s book The Great Disruption I think that we are slowly beginning to understand the dynamics of why the disruption occurred the changing role of women the interaction of that change with the pill the freedom that resulted for some men no longer responsible for being a parent the excesses that accompanied the moral freedom that many felt from normative setting institutions such as the church and many of the other powerful ideas that caught on so very quickly e g that mental illness did not exist and shaped social policy I think that I wrote you about the conversation among Fukuyama Adam Wolfe Norman Podhoretz and others The part of the discussion that didn t begin and which I would have enjoyed even more was why things now seem to be turning around now I can write what I did the other night about why and how crime was reduced in New York City but it still begs the question of why suddenly and a decade is suddenly individuals and organizations could commit themselves to successful strategies and collaborations Although I haven t finished Fukuyama s book he seems to suggest a biological drive toward order and that humans are rational can see their mistakes and can correct themselves I wonder So I hope your e mail problems are solved George Kelling
