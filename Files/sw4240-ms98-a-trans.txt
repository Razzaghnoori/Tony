                so how do you like the benefits of TI   um well actually to tell you the truth uh not very well i resigned from Texas Instruments not shortly   oh thats right yeah   ago and found that my uh after having worked there for twenty one years   my vested interest in my pension fund was amounted to less than three quarters of a year of salary   yeah thats thats one problem with uh engineering jobs is its you you really need some sort of more flexible or portable pension you know something more like a either K well i guess you get part of into K one oh K but what what is the uh key health plan that people who are privately employed use     um i dont know uh the the uh i guess i guess the that that issue was a TI retirement uh benefit is it is what they call a defined a defined benefits program which means if you retire you get benefits   right   um if you dont retire you get shit   umhum   uh but i think the government sort of passed some kind of legislation some long time ago that said well you cant do that you cant just kiss them off if they dont retire and so theres some nominal uh amount amount that has to be vested with the employee but uh in this modern day and age where there is job mobility i mean uh its time for employers to stop screwing the employees out of their retirement benefits by invoking this uh defined benefits plan   yeah what also seems like a lot of company set the benefits based on your last salary when you left the company so you know lets say youve worked there for twenty years   right   you stopped working there you go work for somebody else for fifteen years and because of inflation alone um you know your twenty years is worthless just because its its not an index to fund its based on the actual dollar amount of when you worked there   right which is all the more reason i think that the employee should have control over his pension account   yeah   um of course the initial question that was asked related to uh actually i cant remember anymore but to   it benefits benefits in general   it related to what do you look for in a position other than salary and i guess my mind before it referred to benefits my mind was not thinking a long the with the ideas lines of benefits at all but rather um career gratification gratification and you know that kind of thing   umhum well thats one thing you do get with a large company theyre you know its well its actually can go both ways something some ways you have more opportunities because therere so many things going on within the company but you also may get key holed and you are a ex type person therefore you should only work on this type project   umhum   and that i guess to some extent depends on the philosophy of the company and whether they pigeon hole people or allow people to go in to to any area they want to   umhum umhum boy i there there were some something happened to your signal your signal at that point did you notice it   yeah there there was some clicking on the line im not sure what   yeah   whether thats local or somewhere in the long distance network between New Jersey and wherever you are   in California   California okay   or whether its part of the uh switchboard system   this is also possible   yeah   somewhere between Texas   well  party of my part of my reason for coming to California was California   umhum   uh it is it i love it its a wonderful place but the the price of housing is is just totally looney   well it depends on where you go if you go up uh far enough north it doesnt it gets cheaper again but then again theres you you   well thats true up in Redding uh the housing prices are probably comparable to Dallas where i came from but down here the housing prices are   umhum   about a factor of five higher which is really ridiculous   yeah i know New Jersey is just slightly above the national average which was yeah its about twice the price of Atlanta   at any rate   but uh the housing the housing prices have definitely dropped   so i guess one of the things you look for in a job uh is um affordable cost of living   yeah cost cost of living cost of housing is the salary enough to allow me to do the activities i want to do   of course the most wonderful thing for the company and the most wonderful thing for the employee too is if what you want to do is to work   yes   not so great for the family but uh
