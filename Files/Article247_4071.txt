 Hair of the Donald Evan Nice analysis of the Bradley McCain New Hampshire Independents dynamic You left out just one thing Bradley can t win Under any circumstances He could be inducted emperor of New Hampshire and Iowa and Delaware and half a dozen other tiny but reputedly important primary states and still have no chance of becoming the Democratic nominee much less president The problem with Bradley is Bradley He s a terrible candidate the worst since Bob Dole maybe the worst of all time Ever watch him on the stump He can t give a speech He has precisely no sense of humor A lot of his ideas about policy sound like they were thought up in the shower this morning At appearances he often looks like he s about to fall asleep He answers questions like he d rather be having hemorrhoid surgery Worst of all he has total disdain for everything about politics down to and including voters Watch carefully and you can actually see him exuding contempt like the oily haze that rises off airplane engines on a hot day This sort of thing may be appealing to some New Hampshire voters and others who mistake ineptitude for integrity but how do you think it ll play in the rest of the country In Florida Or Texas No way man He s got no chance Speaking of Texas I like your Times hates Texas theory and I agree it s possible that Molly Ivins single handedly poisoned the relationship between your state and the World s Most Important Newspaper On the other hand what does Texas care It s not like Arkansas a state whose citizens are acutely aware that the rest of the world is laughing at them I remember being amazed when I moved to Little Rock by how seriously people even the relatively worldly cynical newspaper people I worked with took the usual attacks on Arkansas that it s corrupt politically incestuous culturally backward etc They were genuinely wounded In other words they half believed their critics Texans are in no danger of that Even if editors at the Times really did consider Texas to be as you put it overrun with oil slicked bumpkins tyrannical high school football coaches mechanical bull riding smoothies and the odd computer geek and let s be honest here Evan that s not an entirely inaccurate depiction I m still not sure many Texans would even notice These are not people with a self esteem problem Sadly I too have run out of space to talk about the Donald But perhaps in your reply you can answer the most pressing question about his candidacy What s with his hair I ve wondered for years but now that Trump is back on television a lot I m haunted by it Plugs That s what I d always assumed and yet I ve never spotted the telltale Barbie like implant clusters Rug Maybe except the whole effect strikes me as too tussled to be a toupee On CNN yesterday Wolf Blitzer asked Trump about a million questions have you overcome your hand shaking phobia Who will be your secretary of state but tragically never broached the Hair Issue I don t think we ought to elect him president before getting to the bottom of this Best Tucker
