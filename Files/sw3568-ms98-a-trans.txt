                this is a kind of ironic subject for me because this is the first year um i purchased i mean i i was actually able to uh get some credit cards because im twenty one and i got it through school   oh uhhuh     uh and i ive kind of you know you kind of make a purchase and you and you forget you know what you put on your credit card and you know within a month you know they send you your bill and uh i im about three thousand dollars in debt right now   oh dear  it can add up in a hurry     yeah they do i mean its amazing its like a an an illness or a sickness or something   uhhuh well its its uh its easy to use theres no doubt about them ive had ive had one for oh probably ten years now and if you can if you pay it off every month generally generally youre okay um our experience has been um we usually pay it off each month but around Christmas time   umhum   we sometimes have to slide a month or a month or so to   yeah Christmas time i can understand but what my after i got one i didnt just stop i got ive got about five   yeah get caught up oh uhhuh theyll send you one about every time you turn around   six six credit cards yeah and uh so i just charged a little on each and uh and you just get the um   uhhuh      the adding machine out and you add it up and its its amazing   well you see these people that cut theres up say its time to   uhhuh we went to we went on vacation and uh and i charged a lot you know just well i charged um like clothes for the vacation and then on the vacation you know charged your hotel   uhhuh yeah right   and then you know when you got to eat you charge the rest i mean you know its so convenient and   oh and theres uh   and you just dont i guess you know im just really stupid i just didnt realize   yeah well i like them for a couple of aspects one is you dont have to carry a lot of cash with you   umhum   and the other is you know you got that statement and you can make one payment you dont have to write out a bunch of checks or always be paying for things its convenient from that standpoint so its its nice from that standpoint from that angle but it can get out of hand in the interest rate on them is is quite high generally there are some that are lower you know you can get some that are   umhum   oh probably around twelve thirteen percent but most are around sixteen to eighteen or higher   umhum yeah i have a friend that um shes married and her and her husband uh she said you know they tried really hard to pay them off and it took them three years before they were able to uh pay off their credit cards   okay yeah although you know they keep increasing your limit too you know i had a card that uh   umhum   well i think it started out with like a fifteen hundred dollar limit and ive had it for several years and i think im now up to uh seven thousand five hundred on it   umhum   i mean im not course i dont always spend that much but thats what theyd let me spend if i wanted to   umhum   i guess they they get to trusting you a little bit and i want to hold that bait out i dont know if the card companies that you have usually around Christmas time theyll theyll send you a little group of checks   umhum   say instead of using your credit card if you want to just go ahead and write these checks and well charge itll go right against your account they they try to induce you during the Christmas season to to wrack up a few more dollars   umhum umhum   so i think theyre good but youve got to be careful   yeah      thatd be my overall summary   i think it was hard for me because i wasnt working at the time and i was just going to school   uhhuh   and it was like every weekend i would just its it was like sickness to me and i just got and just   yeah   spend uh but   well  i dont know  everybody likes them at least for a couple of things theyre theyre handy theyre nice on when you travel   just yeah   well what kind do you have   um i have a Discover   oh uhhuh   and a Visa   umhum   a Sears and i have like most of the department stores   yeah well the Discover one is supposed to pay you back a little bit   yeah   have you experienced that or not   i have um i have maxed that one   what have you well thats uh i think that ones sponsored by Sears if i     yeah it is and i got the Sears through the Discover before i had um and i didnt even know i went over my limit i mean thats i just didnt even add it up i dont know im just   oh yeah   i was just going crazy           well   and theres about fourteen hundred dollars on that card   uhhuh well it can it doesnt take long i i just ordered a video camera yesterday and thats why that always bothers me a little bit to give your credit card number over the telephone but i   umhum i wouldnt do that i would not do that ive seen on TV and and theres too many scams   yeah and there there can be theres no doubt about it weve
