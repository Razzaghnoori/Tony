            do you know something about how to take care of kids   yeah i was just wondering how did this get on my list  how how did this subject get on my list oh well im not sure um   its what i i dont know ive got mine   well uh my children are grown now but i used care child care services uh for a number of years and i i dont know if i had it to do it over again maybe i would be a little more selective and really you know find out more about them i think the main thing was that i needed someone to take care of my children and i and i generally used some place that was either you know uh close to where i lived or close to where i worked and i really never had any had any real problems and i always felt like that they did a good job and um but i dont have small children now so uh i dont know if it would be different now you know i hear i hear i know a lot of uh mothers or uh people that i work with and they are you know putting their children in different places   well yeah i i dont have kids yet um i wont for a couple uh for at least two or three years and my wife is planning on probably taking care of them at that point um   um   so you yeah uh i suppose uh depends it depends on what kind of program they have especially for summer summer programs um whether or not you know a lot of it is uh when theyre in school and you know their after school thing youd hope that they would have time for studying but most of the time they dont they just play   yeah   but uh i think Summer time ill i i know i was talking to one lady shes just changing her daughter to a different uh child care center for the Summer because they have so much more structured time and they offer different classes like her daughters going to be taking gymnastics and she said if she had left her where that she was uh previously that a lot of time would you know just be free time for them to do whatever they wanted do and a lot of times they get bored so   thats actually yeah what ive been im thinking of the child care center because they have like licensing procedures and and stuff like that that seems to me you know good and i mean it is a state license to seemingly more often than not that means that theyre good and they have lots of activities and people who know how to take care of the kids   umhum   and some   and i guess the ratio of of workers to children you know would be something to consider uh especially if theyre little bitty children that would be a i would i i would hate to leave an uh a real small baby you know   umhum   uh before say before three or four years old anything anyone younger younger than that id just kind of feel kind of uncomfortable about leaving the child but   with somebody else yeah oh i agree   yeah but i did it so i mean but but i look back on some of the things that i did with my kids and i shudder   and i wonder actually i wonder about costs because most people i know who who have kids you know uh one parent doesnt work a part of the time you know only works part time and takes care of the kid part time and then it turns out that that persons salary just winds up going to paying   umhum   the people who who who take care of the kids   thats true thats true   you know that which which amazes me um i i you know it never occurred to me how expensive that sort of thing can be   so basically i think that that when they do that that person really feels a need to get out of the house and you know even if their the money is going mostly to child care theyre not really having much to take home   yeah   its something a filling fulfilling another another need i suppose than staying home with with children all the time but thats a tough deal to do too too you know but uh itd be nice to to work you know i dont know i dont know a good solution to that but but its its tough to be i started i started to say stuck at home with children all the time and never getting out that thats just probably not a real good way to put it       yeah that   but some people you know they their their life and children can be a full time job and you dont have time for anything else so you so i would say maybe you know a day or two a week to get out to go do something else not necessarily go back to work or something but i dont know   yeah i dont i dont you know i just yeah it it just strange because people do i mean in that sense it probably is pretty good to go out and just who cares if it if if all your salary goes to pay somebody you sort of get away for a while too we have i dont i dont um its strange its funny that i should get this particular we should be on this topic now because uh because we have even though we have no kids we have people staying with us   umhum umhum   um for the for the for the for the the weekend and they have a six a six year old son and a three month old son   oh   so im just sort of seeing what all the hassles are you know of you know like last night we we we the six year old decided he wanted to go camping in the back yard       so we pitched a tent in the dark yard actually and his father and and the little boy and i all went out and had you know a a boys a boys night out   oh really   in the back yard and about quarter of one he woke up half crying and he couldnt sleep and this and that i mean we we wanted to bring him inside so when about a one oclock in the morning we all got up and sort of wandered inside so im think all the benefits of taking care of kids or all the fun part of taking care of kids i guess   uhhuh yeah i tell you its uh yeah maybe its something before you start having children you know maybe theres a lot of stuff but but if if youll never have them if you start  doing all that get too logical about it but its great its great having kids and then uh yeah i think everybody ought to ought to try it   yeah we plan on a couple of years and i just like its just like child care will become very important to my life then   yeah yeah shell probably shell probably spend a lot more time finding the right place uh   you know   i dont know i i tend to think if theyre licensed then theyre you know i dont know i you know you you can feel you can get a feel from it too if your child is too small you cant but if you if theyre old enough to to know you know theyll theyll let you know if theyre unhappy or if or if someone isnt treating them well or   yeah that that that thats probably true although i i dont like you say i dont know if id put a kid there whos less than you know uh four years old or something   ill tell you one thing is that my of course im im a single parent and so i guess and um my my son was five and my daughter was two and i had uh they had to go in child care but uh but i think they were more uh well i uh my sister who had two boys and she did not work and she and she had a real difficult time when the when time for them to go to school they did not uh want to leave her and my children who were so used to being out and uh learning how to get along with other children and taking directions and stuff like that they just went very smoothly off into school you know without a problem so i think even if you dont leave them full time but have them you know preschool or mothers day out or couple things a couple of days a week or something like that i think its always good   yeah probably just to make friends and and stuff like that   umhum   yeah i if its just like i say this is a very foreign topic for me so   so     one of those things i have to learn about i do i work with kids a lot   you do   i i i do work with kids a lot i uh i i do uh um i teach a karate class twice a week with with with kids   oh oh what age   um theyre four to seven actually theres one at i work mostly with four to seven and then eight to twelve i im im the class  so i i help out in this class and uh and its really um weird because im not you know the first when i first started doing it i i can put it this way it it its helped me gain lots of respect for people who can work with lots large numbers of kids   umhum   because when i first started like i had no idea how to how to handle a five five year old kid with especially when there are ten of the m floating around and youre supposed to be running around teaching them things and   um do they pay have uh their attention span is it do do you have a hard time holding their attention   of course uh i i do but im finding theres theres uh another person there who has good he has got absolutely no training from what i know but hes just wonderful with kids and he seems to know how to hold their attention you know he keeps them he does lots of you know hes hes hes fast moving with them theyll do this exercise theyll do that theyll do this theyll do that he keeps them moving quick enough that you know when they stop losing attention they start you know theyre the all of a sudden theyre switched   umhum   and you know therere a couple in there who actually have um who i think have attention deficit disorders or they have very very low attention and those are harder to work with but i you know but i i i i uh the regular ones you know the normal kids you can just let them go a little bit and and and he sort of hes real good at keeping them in line im learning from him how to do these sort of things just just by watching him   did you say uh your karate class is all boys or mixed   no its its boys and girls it it it its mixed there are uh there are um more boys than girls but there are a number of number of girls in there who actually uh do some good stuff and beat up a lot of the little girls i mean i mean a lot of the little boys too   is that right   why why would a parent want their child to take karate or is it the child wants to take it uh   um in some case actually a lot of parents send their kids or just bring their kids because because of the sort of discipline you know and it its not we dont you know say get down and do a hundred push ups for me now you little guy but um it teaches we we we focus very highly on you know on on on issues of respect and selfdiscipline and selfconfidence we have a lot of students kids who come in very shy you know and unsure of themselves and and you can see them come you know week by week that they come more and more out of their shells and start to become you know more sociable and more sure of themselves instead of more sure footed   hm   you know um and the parents love it actually they find you know we we we there are rules like the kids arent allowed kids have to bring their report card in every after every quarter or whenever or whenever they get their report cards they have to bring them in to make sure that theyre keeping up with their grades
