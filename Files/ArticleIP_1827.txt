 Bertie Wooster s Party Tricks Anyone whom Jesse Helms brands as his enemy is instantly sympathetic Helms says he will use his powers as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to derail William Weld s nomination to become ambassador to Mexico because Weld supports the decriminalization of marijuana for medical use But unlike other Clinton nominees who have given up when Helms opposed them Weld has girded for battle Earlier this week he resigned his position as governor of Massachusetts to combat Helms ideological extortion full time Weld wants his fight with Helms to be a battle over the soul of the Republican Party And where does Bill Weld think the soul of the Republican party should lie He declares himself a philosophical libertarian who discovered Hayek in law school But his alleged libertarianism is inconsistent and may be no more than a convenient fancy formulation for the combination of policies fiscally conservative socially liberal needed to get elected as a Republican in a Democratic state Weld certainly did not advertise himself as a libertarian when he worked for the Reagan administration running the Criminal Division of the Justice Department Weld s popular appeal is based less on the perception that he s a libertarian than the perception he s that even rarer animal a moderate Republican With the crusty rural reactionary Helms as a foil Weld seems a moderate cosmopolitan thinking man above petty politics He is even willing to accept a job in a Democratic administration But Weld s moderation his independent spirit like his libertarianism may actually reflect two less admirable qualities first a Clintonesque political slipperiness and second a lack of seriousness He s a flake He s a flake because he s an aristocrat And he brilliantly fuses these two politically disadvantageous conditions into a political plus Weld comes from wealthy pure WASP stock and married a great granddaughter of Theodore Roosevelt Far from playing this down he revels in Brahmin shtick incessantly gabbing with reporters about his prep school days publicly proclaiming the sacrosanctity of his twice weekly squash games and cracking jokes like The Welds arrived in 1630 with only the shirts on their backs and 2 000 pounds of gold More successfully than Ross Perot or Steve Forbes Weld s demeanor plays on the ancient myth of the Cincinnatus the notion that a man of wealth makes the best statesman because he will never be tempted to act in his own self interest and will work solely for the common good Unlike Forbes and Perot Weld never seems to be straining to garner the public s approval An obsequious 1992 New York Times Magazine profile put it this way In the Governor s office Weld has restored a tradition of aristocratic Yankee lordship he has made governing look easy and WASP ascendancy seem an expression of natural law if not of divine right He can drink a martini while balancing a budget But all is not aristocratic ease and devil may care frankness Weld came to national prominence in 1988 when he resigned as head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division allegedly in protest over Attorney General Edwin Meese s interference in the investigation of Meese s friend E Robert Wallach accused of using his company Wedtech to abuse government contracts Weld later conceded that he had planned months before to leave the Justice Department He didn t mention this when he struck his headline grabbing stance And then there s his claim that as governor he restored the health of the Massachusetts economy Remember back to Michael Dukakis 1988 presidential run Mid campaign the state s economy which Dukakis was referring to as the Massachusetts miracle sank creating a huge government budget deficit and threatening the state s financial solvency To stave off collapse during his last two years in office Dukakis stewarded over 1 billion in tax increases through the state legislature When Weld campaigned for governor in 1990 against Boston University President John Silber he vociferously supported a ballot measure that would have reversed the Dukakis tax increases Silber argued correctly that repealing the tax increases would ruin the state s bond rating and result in irresponsibly large social spending cuts Silber was too persuasive for his own good As it became clear that the disastrous tax cut would not pass the liberals of Cambridge Newton and Boston disliking Silber for his cranky hard line views on social issues felt it was safe to vote for Weld The Republican won by less than 3 percent Weld s combination of positions on issues plays to the great weakness in today s liberalism its obsession with social issues and relative indifference to economics Because Weld is pro gay pro choice and pro affirmative action liberals overlooked his strident economic conservatism As promised in the campaign he slashed social spending and welfare rolls However taxes remain at nearly the same levels as when he entered office and government spending has increased more than 50 percent during his six year tenure If he had got his way about repealing the Dukakis tax increases he and his state would be up shit creek He has the unpopular stands taken by Michael Dukakis and John Silber to thank for creating the conditions for solid growth that have buoyed his popularity The pose of the post partisan suits Weld because he can change his positions on a dime Three years into his term he dropped his strident opposition to gun control when the position began hurting his poll numbers Though he describes himself as being to the right of Attila the Hun on crime he authorized the Willie Hortenesque early parole of more than 700 sex offenders in 1992 Despite twice campaigning actively against Bill Clinton he has begged for a post in his administration Weld s capriciousness is key to his success Even when it would seem blatantly self serving his unpredictability jibes with the public s expectation that his personal wealth will allow him to do whatever he thinks is right His whimsy can be downright charming During a signing ceremony for a bill he dove headfirst fully clothed into the Charles River And he once sent pictures to reporters of himself with a giant boar he claims to have hunted down though it turned out to be in captivity His decision to resign and run for the ambassadorship few expect him to win should be treated like these other nutty episodes Even reporters who describe the move as quixotic express admiration for his audacity He has already demonstrated his acumen at milking the confrontation with Helms for its maximum theatrical and political value And since he clearly has further political ambitions he has talked about becoming attorney general or secretary of state and no doubt thinks of even higher office the spotlight will serve him well He can indulge in the self serving grandstanding and self effacing silliness that only William Weld could possibly pull off
