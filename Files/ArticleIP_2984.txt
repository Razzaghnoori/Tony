 Innocence Lost Philip Roth s American Pastoral arrived in the bookstores a few weeks ago and I have been hearing about it ever since A friend regales me over lunch with Philip Roth s inflamed passion against American innocence Someone else telephones to discuss the radicalism of the 1960s generational warfare and the intricacies of black Jewish relations in industrial New Jersey as depicted by Philip Roth A mailman stops me in the street I m not making this up to expound his own deduction from Philip Roth s tale of family calamity to wit that without a clear sense of God modern Americans are doomed to lose their bearings and society will go to hell The mailman it s true has not yet read the novel only the reviews and our lively conversation many skyward hand gestures veers in theological directions alien to American Pastoral But I cite the theological detour to show what is going on these days every time I pick up the phone or loll about on the springtime sidewalk The novel itself Roth s fulmination against American innocence is mostly a portrait of a single personage a New Jersey ladies glove manufacturer named Seymour Levov the Swede a husband and father of exasperating conventionality serene handsome athletic bland shallow a man who seems to have been extracted as if by a blender from the onion and garlic world of the immigrant Jews until every last hint of taste and texture have finally disappeared And on this perfectly nice and liberal minded businessman Roth in his malicious rage has bestowed a monster of a daughter a stuttering left wing bomb thrower and murderous lunatic destined to ruin her daddy s family and his life just to show what comes of so much cheer and post ethnic American optimism The Swede is a great character I can t say that I entirely understand him his placidity and easy manner but then nobody understands him Is he mad to be so passive and smiley in our world of tragedy and foreboding Or merely stupid Not even the world famous novelist Nathan Zuckerman Roth s narrator can figure it out About the Swede Roth s Zuckerman writes Something had turned him into a human platitude But the motive factor remains elusive All that rose to the surface was more surface It was clever of Roth to come up with such a personality and to send him wandering around the New Jersey wilds But the peculiar virtue of this characterless character is that he requires Roth to write about him in an ever shifting series of tones each more precise than the last in an effort to define what cannot be defined There are passages where Roth describing the rural New Jersey landscape from within the Swede s benign imagination produces a fine sugary lyricism that is not more than 5 percent ironic a lyricism of white pasture fences and rolling hay fields and the Swede pretending to be Johnny Appleseed tossing his imaginary seed Then again there are passages of dark fury the outraged indignation of the Swede s wised up brother Jerry the Miami heart surgeon who can t stand the innocence any longer and whose drumbeat imprecations achieve a kind of poetry What are you Do you know What you are is you re always trying to smooth things over What you are is always trying to be moderate What you are is never telling the truth if you think it s going to hurt someone s feelings The one who abides everything patiently The one with the ultimate decorum Decorum Decorum is what you spit in the face of Well your daughter spit in it for you didn t she Or this even louder an ability to turn up the volume is one of Roth s special strengths again in Jerry s voice You think you know what a man is You have no idea what a man is You think you know what a daughter is You have no idea what a daughter is You think you know what this country is You have no idea what this country is You have a false image of everything All you know is what a fucking glove is This country is frightening I could cite a dozen other tones of pleading impatience of emotional exhaustion of inveigling desperation and so forth every possible reaction to the Swede and his predicament I wonder if Roth himself appreciates how lively and persuasive these tones are how vividly they conjure up the Swede s reality In any case as if still unsatisfied around these tones Roth has orchestrated a still vaster range of side topics ethnic sociology Jews blacks Irish WASPs intermarriage industrial history glove making craftsmanship and its decline recounted at length political debate the crimes of Presidents Johnson and Nixon the migraine rhetoric of Angela Davis and more some of it rendered with exquisite precision which is fun to read The details do pile up though until you begin to think about the research that Roth must have undertaken which is always a bad sign Then he compounds his error by investing these background details with portentous meanings about America and its history and he compounds the compound by overheating the plot you will have to discover the details for yourself By the end he is delivering verdicts like this The outlaws are everywhere They re inside the gates Or He tells us that the real subject is one of wantonness and betrayal and deception of treachery and disunity among neighbors and friends the subject of cruelty The mockery of human integrity every ethical obligation destroyed So here is a novel that is not only about the 60s but exudes a distinctly 60s fume of windy prophetic curse hurling A good idea all puffed up which is a bad idea The result is fascinating without being exactly moving A terrific book halfway undermined But I don t want to make too much of my complaints given that in my little circle of friends no error or misjudgment on Roth s part appears to have inhibited anyone s desire to subject American Pastoral to analytic vivisection Mayhem family collapse the occasional terrorist bomb mad government policies human platitudes in this pleasant springtime of 1997 these as Roth renders them do seem to be everyone s favorite topics of conversation
