 Double Take Since NATO began bombing Yugoslavia a month ago American hawks and doves have agreed on one thing NATO and the Clinton administration have miscalculated The administration completely miscalculated when it launched the air campaign declared Sen Frank Murkowski R Alaska April 19 They assumed that the Serbs would immediately retreat when the bombs began to descend This critique is well founded but it s only half of one dimension of the story In war there are two players and each can miscalculate Furthermore war has a psychological dimension in which each side s morale is undermined by its mere belief that it has miscalculated To win the practical war you don t have to calculate perfectly All you have to do is outcalculate your enemy Likewise to win the psychological war all you have to do is make your enemy second guess his belligerence more than he thinks you re second guessing yours The surest way to lose the psychological war is to fret that you have misjudged your enemy s resolve while failing to entertain the possibility that he will decide he has misjudged yours The miscalculation critique permeated Wednesday s war debate on the House floor It appears that President Clinton and other NATO leaders mistakenly thought that bombing specified military targets in Serbia and Kosovo would send a message to Yugoslav President Milosevic that would cause him to quickly embrace the NATO peace plan It is obvious this was a gross miscalculation charged Rep Bill McCollum R Fla Rep Chris Smith R N J denounced the tragic miscalculation by President Clinton that Milosevic would back down if we bombed Serbia for a week or maybe two Since this way of framing the conflict treats NATO but not Yugoslavia as a rational player susceptible to threats punishment failure and re evaluation Yugoslavia is happy to encourage it Last Friday Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic warned that a NATO ground invasion of Kosovo would be yet another miscalculation by those who have already been proved wrong so far posing dangers to the whole continent and drawing the United States into a quagmire that would make Vietnam look like nothing Tuesday morning NATO s military commander Gen Wesley Clark decided he had heard enough of this critique Wrapping up his opening remarks to reporters in Brussels Clark turned the miscalculation argument on its head Milosevic said Clark may have thought that NATO really wouldn t launch the airstrikes But he was wrong He may have believed they wouldn t last after they were started Wrong He may have thought that some countries would be afraid of his bluster and intimidation they would withdraw the use of their bases or buckle under his intimidation He was wrong He thought that other countries might rush to his aid Wrong again Clark went on He thought that taking prisoners and mistreating them and humiliating them publicly would weaken our resolve Wrong again He thought his air defense would be effective against our aircraft Wrong He thought his troops would stay loyal Increasingly he s wrong about that There are more desertions Former generals are under arrest Dissent is growing louder and louder Military press censorship has been imposed He thought he could hide the truth from his own people I suppose and increasingly he s wrong in that We re winning Milosevic is losing and he knows it He should face up to this and he should face up to it now In recent days other NATO and U S officials have reinforced Clark s campaign to counterframe the miscalculation thesis NATO spokesman Jamie Shea suggested that the assignment of fresh Yugoslav troops to Kosovo demonstrates yet again Milosevic s miscalculations He thought he could defeat the KLA in a short five to seven days operation This was completely wrong and is further testimony to the success of the air campaign Sen Joe Lieberman D Conn contended that Milosevic counted at the outset of this when he moved his forces into Kosovo on NATO breaking up quickly and quite the opposite has happened White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart predicted that Milosevic will change his calculation as his apparatus of power is progressively destroyed Did NATO misjudge Milosevic s efficacy and resolve Absolutely But to debate that question by itself is already a loaded proposition because it overlooks the corresponding question of whether Milosevic has misjudged NATO s efficacy and resolve and whether he accordingly can be humbled into reconsidering his belligerence before we reconsider ours Gen Clark understands that in war morale is both vital and relative He has heard enough pessimism from pundits and politicians on the subject of whether NATO has miscalculated He is not interested in changing the answer He is interested in changing the question
