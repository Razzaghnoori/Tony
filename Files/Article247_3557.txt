 Never Trust a Travel Guide Say what you might about travel guides I ll always respect a literary form that can be field tested For the benefit of eavesdroppers I ve included a thumbnail sketch of the subjects of our little experiment Fodor s is the gold plated grandam of the American guidebook scene No matter how old you are this is probably the guide your parents use Frommer s like Fodor s targets well to do graying travelers but aspires to youthful hipness with the occasional off the cuff misguided pop culture references Keeping the kids distracted is key sic to making sure your stay doesn t turn into a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon If they delight in misusing outdated slang like jiggy this is probably the guide your parents use The Insight Guides are softer emphasizing glossy photos and punchy captions over facts like prices and opening hours Compass America a Fodor s associate is stylistically a synthesis of these two models A backpacker favorite Lonely Planet s guides advocate a budget minded low impact approach to travel They re the only guides we are discussing that didn t originate in the United States and are still largely targeted at travelers from Australia and the British Isles New Yorkers feel a great affinity to sic their subway tokens akin to what Americans in general feel about their useless one cent coin The brainchild of information designer Richard Saul Wurman the Access Guides seek to better the guidebook s always rocky marriage of maps and text Though the books are not actually written by Wurman his name graces the cover and the spine lending credence to the idea that one need be neither much of a traveler nor much of a writer to be a travel writer Testing Ground No 1 The Statue of Liberty All the books agreed that this was a worthy site and they all had the same advice on how best to see it Get there for the earliest ferry and beat the crowds in the race to Lady Liberty s crown where spectacular views of Manhattan await The guidebooks disagreed on or simply didn t mention when the first ferry actually left but none quoted a time earlier than 9 15 a m But when I arrived at 8 45 a sign informed me that the 8 30 ferry had already left and that only those lucky souls aboard would be admitted to the crown Here I learned or rather relearned a valuable travel lesson Never trust a travel guide If a guidebook fact is going to make or break your vacation day you d better call and double check it yourself The disclaimers in the books tell you as much themselves Which begs the question Why do people myself included continue to rely on and delight in products that so frequently prove unreliable And how can so many guides to New York Frommer s alone has 10 titles prosper and inspire fierce brand loyalty when they all say approximately the same thing The Statue of Liberty is just the beginning From Wall Street to the Met there is almost no disagreement about Manhattan s worthiest sights Testing Ground No 2 Harlem I was intrigued to see how the guides covered areas perceived as dangerous by travelers with whom I spoke Frommer s warns that uptown Manhattan s sights are best seen by bus tour Lonely Planet rails against this ghetto safari mentality chastising If you re too scared to go on your own stay in Midtown While I agree with LP s assessment I visited yesterday by subway without incident the haughty tone is a bit troubling Have you noticed that travelers are always quick to ridicule other travelers Budget guides can be particularly harsh Is this a considered reaction to the economic and environmental damage that higher end and package tourism can cause or just knee jerk irreverence Should travel guides educate their readers or simply pander to their preconceived notions In the days of Marco Polo and even the early days of Arthur Frommer travel guides were written by bona fide experts and people who bought them were unfamiliar with the places they described But mass media has made armchair travel experts out of all of us at least in the cases of such high profile cities as New York and Chicago We know or at least think we know what these cities are about and what we want to see when we re there In theory it s thrilling that people can travel farther from home and that they know more before they arrive but is the end result simply longer lines at the Statue of Liberty and the Hard Rock Cafe Can travel guides still gently educate their readers or have they merely become handmaidens shuttling readers from one over visited landmark to the next Jodi how things are going in Chicago Are you finding any substantive differences in the way your guides cover the city Are they at least getting you to the ferries on time
