 Chatterdump How to Stop Drudge Etc THEY MAY have finally found a way to neutralize Matt Drudge make him famous Since the Monica Mess broke Drudge has apparently been so busy giving interviews and making television appearances that he s had no time to write his famed dispatches The last one was Jan 21 Did you notice on Meet the Press how Drudge s face seems to curve from top to bottom like a giant half moon letter C Peyronie s Disease of the chin While Chatterbox loves Drudge except for that nasty Sidney Blumenthal business on TV he does come across as one mighty weird fellow MUCH CHATTER about what a relaxed good mood Vice President Al Gore was in when he showed up at a dinner last Wednesday honoring the Associated Press The Monica story had broken that morning CHATTERBOX WAS GOING to predict that Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York would be the first prominent Democrat to suggest that Clinton might have to resign Really we were But Moynihan beat us to the punch with his declaration in the New York Post that Clinton could not survive admitting an affair with Lewinsky The Post said Moynihan s comments carry special clout because he is one of the Senate s most respected members seen as a leader on matters of ethics and values In truth Moynihan s remarks were as predictable as the sunrise He s been getting press by stabbing Clinton in the back since before Clinton s election Moynihan endorsed Nebraska Sen Bob Kerrey against Clinton in the 1992 primary Later he publicly undermined Clinton s health care plan Then he undermined Clinton s welfare plan Anyone who reads Moynihan s recent book Miles to Go will see he strongly dislikes if not loathes the president He may have good reason for this disdain but it means his resignation talk doesn t carry much weight at all He probably thought Clinton should resign before the Monica scandal Like the anti Republican Republican analyst Kevin Phillips Moynihan is a convenient figure reporters know they can count on for a faux contrarian remark Who will be next to stick in the shiv Chatterbox predicts Kerrey who knows he shouldn t but who won t be able to resist DEPARTMENT OF GROVELING Bill McMichael e mails about a Chatterbox item speculating that Gary Hart must be happy at Clinton s troubles That was a very cheap shot against Hart and my guess is that he is gloomy over the whole mess not experiencing any schadenfreude If so Hart is a bigger man than Chatterbox But Chatterbox magnanimously concedes McMichael has a point THE WALL STREET JOURNAL editorial page Monday goes on about anti social personality disorder as psychiatrists now call it only to conclude in Mr Clinton s case a strict diagnosis does not hold
