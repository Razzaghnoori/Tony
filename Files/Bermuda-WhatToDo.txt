 What to Do We provide local Bermuda phone numbers for many of the activities mentioned in this chapter When calling from outside the islands remember to dial Bermuda s own area code 441 before the seven digit number Recreation and Sports Bermuda is an ideal vacation destination for outdoor activities Summer brings warm but not hot weather and warm sea temperatures making it ideal for diving snorkeling and other water sports On land you can fill your day with tennis and golf along with long walks and beach activities In winter the sea temperature makes it a little too cold for diving but

the Peppercorn Ceremony are colorful exciting and rich in history They also bring out the whole community and attending makes you feel as though you are a part of Bermudian society Shopping Bermuda is not a duty free island In fact since there is no income tax for the local population charging duty on imported goods is one way for the government to raise funds Duty varies on the type of goods but is always included in the price However there is no sales tax at all in Bermuda so here is your opportunity to save a little Tax free shops will claim to save you up to 30 percent on prices back home but this is not universal It is always important to do some research at home before you arrive so that you can compare prices Some goods are only a little cheaper in Bermuda but you might want a real bargain In many ways Bermuda is still a vendor of fine British goods although the range of merchandise is definitely expanding Bermudian traders have always bought directly from the manufacturers rather than through middlemen which has traditionally resulted in a cheaper price than you would find at home However government imposed import duty means that prices might not be as advantageous as they once were The key to tax free shopping in Bermuda today is quality not price There is a comprehensive range of quality luxury goods on sale in the major towns on the island Front Street in Hamilton is a shopper s delight and the staff offer a helpful and not overpowering sales service You can browse here in a relaxed unpressured atmosphere The best in crystal porcelain tableware silver

distinctive taste and is sold at many small roadside vegetable stalls Marmalade and preserves have been made for centuries to prolong food supplies for the islanders and you can choose from a wide range of flavors Alcohol and Liquor Dealing in alcohol and liquor is one of the longest standing trades in Bermuda and you will find the finest products from around the world However alcohol is duty

to the airport for you to collect just before you leave Bermuda Prices for brands that you have at home might not be cheaper than at your local store so please undertake some research before you leave for your trip Activities for Children There s nothing that young visitors like better than a sandy beach and the sea they can play for hours in the shallows or build sandcastles on the shore Most of the major resorts have clean safe beaches with good facilities Always remember to cover youngsters skin with a suitable sunscreen and to limit their time in the sun for the first few days Bermuda has very clear air resulting in more of the damaging rays reaching the surface Also make sure they are well supervised whenever they are near the water Some large hotel complexes will offer special programs for children Some might even have a special club where children can make new friends and spend the whole day in pursuit of such activities as face painting Also be aware that certain hotels in Bermuda have an adults only policy or few facilities specifically for children Always research the facilities available at any hotel before you make a reservation For the Young at Heart Below are
