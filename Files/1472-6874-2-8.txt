 Background Premature ovarian failure is a condition characterized by cessation of normal ovarian function before the age of 40 In most cases a precise mechanism for the ovarian failure is not identified however there is evidence suggesting a genetic mechanism in at least some cases 1 2 3 4 Normal ovarian function in reproductive aged women is dependent upon the presence of a store of functional primordial follicles This store develops from primordial germ cells a small population of cells that differentiate from other cell lineages in very early embryonic life 5 Premature depletion of primordial follicles is a known mechanism of premature ovarian failure 6 7 Studies in mice have demonstrated that c kit a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor plays a critical role in hematopoeisis melanogenesis and gametogenesis The c kit receptor kinase and its ligand KL kit ligand stem cell factor are encoded at the white spotting W and steel Sl loci of the mouse respectively Various mutations at the W and the Sl loci have been shown to cause anemia pigmentation defects and sterility 8 Point mutations in the Kit receptor tyrosine kinase in mice can selectively impair fertility without inducing detectable abnormalities in hematopoesis or pigmentation 9 Studies employing cultured mouse primordial germ cells have demonstrated that the Steel Kit interaction is required for germ cell survival 10 11 12 These observations in mice suggest that mutations in the human KIT gene MIM 164920 might be a cause of premature ovarian failure in women The human KIT gene is located on chromosome 4 at map locus 4q12 Mutations in the human KIT gene have been identified as a cause of Piebaldism a rare autosomal dominant disorder of melanogenesis characterized by patchy absence of pigmentation of the skin and overlying hair 13 14 Here we test the hypothesis that specific human KIT mutations might be a cause of spontaneous premature ovarian failure even in the absence of detectable disorders of pigmentation or hematopoesis Methods Subjects Our institutional review board approved the study and all participants signed an informed consent and the procedures of the study were in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration The study population comprised 42 women with premature ovarian failure and 10 normal healthy control women who had regular menses and proven fertility Referring physicians made the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure based on the following criteria development of at least 4 months of amenorrhea before age 40 associated with two serum FSH levels above 40 IU L drawn at least 1 month apart Women with premature ovarian failure as a result of surgery radiation chemotherapy or known karyotype abnormalities were not included in the study Patients who had not previously had a karyotype analysis were included pending our analaysis There were 34 Caucasian 6 African American and two Hispanic women The median age at the onset of menstrual irregularity was 25 years range 14 to 39 25 thpercentile 18 5 75 thpercentile 34 Five women had a family history of premature ovarian failure two patients had sisters with premature ovarian failure one patient s mother had premature ovarian failure one had a paternal aunt with premature ovarian failure and one patient had a paternal aunt a grandmother and a great grandmother who were thought to have the condition All patients underwent a history and physical examination and laboratory screening to confirm the diagnosis of premature ovarian failure Cytogenetics Karyotypes were obtained on all patients Peripheral blood specimens were cultured for 72 96 hours using standard methods and methotrexate thymidine synchronization 15 Harvesting and GTW banding were also performed according to standard cytogenetic protocols 16 Fifty metaphases were examined for each patient and scored for numerical or structural chromosome abnormalities Band resolution was at the 600 band stage or higher Fluorescence in situ hybridization FISH was performed on metaphases from cultured lymphocytes of two patients with abnormal G band findings Chromosome and probe denaturation hybridization detection and counterstaining were all done according to standard protocols as recommended by the manufacturer DNA extraction and polymerase chain reaction PCR Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood using standard procedures Specific primers for PCR amplification of the exons were designed based on the human KIT genomic sequence Genebank accession number AC006553 Human chromosome 4 Table 1 In exon 21 the reverse primer is located in the 3 noncoding region in all other cases the primers are located at introns flanking each exon The PCR amplification was carried out in a total volume of 25 l reaction mixture containing 1 5 mmol l of MgCL 2 0 2 mmol l of each dNTP 50 ng of genomic DNA 0 5 m of each primer and 1 25 IU of Taq DNA polymerase per manufacturer s instructions Invitrogen Carlsbad CA The PCR began with an initial denaturing at 95 C for 5 minutes Thereafter the cycling profile consisted of 35 cycles of denaturing at 95 C for 30 seconds annealing of the primer pair at the appropriate temperature for 30 seconds Table 1 and then extension at 72 C for 60 seconds This was followed by a final stabilization step of 10 minutes at 72 C After PCR 5 l of the amplified product was examined by 1 5 agarose gel electrophoresis Single stranded conformational polymorphism SSCP analysis Analysis of DNA polymorphism was conducted using a method of Cold SSCP as described previously 17 Briefly the PCR products 4 l were mixed with SSCP sample buffer 6 l formamide with 0 05 bromophenol blue and xylene cyanol After denaturing at 95 C for 5 minutes the DNA samples were placed on ice immediately and loaded onto precast 20 TBE acrylamide gels Tris Base Boric Acid EDTA 4 glycerol and 20 acrylamide Invitrogen Carlsbad CA Gel elecrophoresis was run in 1 X TBE buffer at 200 V with the circulator set at 4 C using a Penquin Water cooled Dual Gel Electrophoresis system attached to a thermostatically controlled refrigerated circulator Amersham Pharmacia Uppsala Sweden Gels were stained with ethidium bromide 1 g ml for 20 minutes at room temperature DNA bands were visualized and photographed under UV light 340 nm Direct DNA sequencing PCR products were either purified using ExoSAP IT USB Co Cleveland OH or subcloned into a TA cloning vector Invitrogen Carlsbad CA per the manufacturer s instructions DNA sequencing was conducted by PCR 26 cycles of 96 C 10 seconds 50 C 5 seconds 60 C 4 minutes using a dRhodamine terminator cycle sequencing kit PE Applied Biosystems Foster CA and 10 l of purified PCR product or 1 g of purified plasmid DNA The sequencing samples were separated by 5 Long Ranger gel electrophoresis on the ABI Automatic 310 Sequencer Applied Biosystems Foster CA Results Clinical None of the 42 women were found to have clinical findings to suggest Turner syndrome None of the patients had clinical or laboratory findings to suggest a stem cell deficiency in melanogenesis or hematopoiesis Two women were found to have partial monosomy of the X chromosome that was felt to be related to the presentation of spontaneous premature ovarian failure For this reason they were excluded from further analysis These findings highlight the usefulness of careful cytogenetic screening of women with spontaneous premature ovarian failure The remaining 40 women had a normal 46 XX karyotype analysis One woman of normal stature had a karyotype analysis showing 46 X rec X dup Xp inv X p11 4 q24 ish rec X dup Xp inv X p11 4 q24 KAL In all cells examined there was one normal X chromosome and one X chromosome that had most of Xp Xp11 4 Xpter replacing a portion of Xq Xq24 Xqter This rearrangement was confirmed with a FISH study A probe to the Kallman syndrome region Oncor Inc Gaithersburg MD at Xp22 3 was hybridized to patient s metaphases and showed signal on both ends of the abnormal X chromosome as well as the normal X chromosome confirming the G band impression that both ends of this chromosome was comprised of Xp In summary the patient had partial trisomy Xp and partial monosomy Xq as demostrated by G banding and FISH A second woman of normal stature had a karyotype analysis showing 46 X der X t X 13 q22 3 q14 1 All cells examined in this patient had extra material on Xq which was 13q in origin FISH was performed using whole chromosome probes to the X and 13 Oncor Gaithersburg MD The X probe showed signal covering the entire normal X as well as Xp and the proximal half of Xq on the derivative chromosome Whole chromosome probe 13 showed signal on the normal 13 as well as on the derivative X chromosome These results are consistant with partial monosomy Xq from q22 q terminus and partial trisomy 13 from q 14 1 q terminus Given the lack of symptoms characteristics associated with trisomy 13 multiple congenital anomolies with severe cognitive delays we hypothesize that the derivative X chromosome is the inactivated X thus sparing the patient the expected phenotype Screening of the KITgene All the exons of the gene Figure 1A were successfully amplified by PCR in all 10 controls and all 40 patients with 46 XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure Except for product 21 which carried only the coding region each PCR product contained one complete exon All PCR products were of the expected size As shown in Figure 1B the size of the 21 PCR products ranged from 198 to 438 bp and all appeared as a single clear band The PCR products were screened for mutations by SSCP analysis We found mobility shifts in the PCR products from two of the patients and none of the controls As shown in Figure 2 patient 4 had a mobility shift in the products from two exons 10 and 16 patient 5 had a mobility shift in the product from exon 17 In patient 4 both the polymorphisms were determined by sequencing to be within intron regions and would thus not change the sequence of the c KIT protein In the polymorphism 71 nucleotides upstream of exon 10 substitution at nucleotide 71 replaced the normal T with an A IVS9 71T A In the polymorphism downstream of exon 16 there was a deletion of 5 T nucleotides from within a normal series of 22 consecutive T nucleotides IVS16 66_ 70delTTTTT Figure 3 In patient 5 sequencing uncovered a mutation at codon 798 however the mutation C798T was silent with no change in amino acid sequence Isoleucine Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis The C798T substitution in exon 17 of patient 5 generates a new restriction site for Ssp I AAT ATT To determine if this mutation was homozygous or heterozygous we analysed restriction fragment length polymorphism RFLP on PCR products As shown in Figure 4 the mutant PCR product 390 bp for exon 17 was digested with SspI to yield two shorter DNA fragments only 207 and 183 bp These data suggest that this mutation is homozygous We did not perform RFLP analysis on the mutant PCR products from exons 10 and 16 because no new restriction sites were generated by the mutations Other methodologies such as forced RFLP and sequencing of multiple cloned products could be applied to determine if these mutations are homozygous or heterozygous Discussion Primordial germs cells originate from a small number of progenitor cells that arise in very early development Thereafter complex factors that are not well understood direct their proliferation survival migration to the genital ridge differentiation into oocytes and the subsequent expenditure of oocytes via ovulation or apoptotic death 5 7 18 Mutations or deletions in any of the genes involved in this complex process could theoretically be a cause of premature ovarian failure on the basis of germ cell deficiency either due to a deficient initial endowment of primordial follicles or an accelerated expenditure of this endowment Evidence that genetic factors play a role in some cases of premature ovarian failure has been around for a long time 19 20 However the small pedigrees necessarily associated with this condition make it extremely difficult to conduct genetic linkage analysis that can be used to identify candidate genes 4 One approach to this dilemma has been to evaluate candidate genes based on existing knowledge of ovarian physiology as has been reported in the case of inhibin 21 Other candidate genes are those that when mutated are known to cause germ cell deficiency in other species for example the diaphanous gene of drosophila 22 Numerous growth factors have been associated with primordial germ cell behavior during migration in mice using in vitro studies but in most cases it is unknown whether these factors function in vivo 5 One exception is the Steel Kit interaction Steel and W are genetic loci identified in strains of mice that exhibit sterility on the basis of germ cell deficiency The products of these two loci are now known to be the tyrosine kinase receptor Kit W and its ligand Steel factor Steel It was on this basis that we set out to examine patients with premature ovarian failure for mutations in KIT The SSCP technique has been used successfully for mutation searching in other genes 23 24 25 26 Using the PCR SSCP technique we were able to detect only one polymorphism in the entire coding regions of the KIT gene and this polymorphism did not change the amino acid sequence at codon 798 Therefore these results suggest that mutations in the coding regions of the KIT gene are unlikely to be a common cause of premature ovarian failure The upper 95 confidence limit of the proportion 0 40 is 7 2 no mutations found in 40 women with 46 XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure The DNA polymorphisms that we identified within intron regions upstream of exon 10 and downstream of exon 16 would not change the amino acid sequence of the c KIT protein However we cannot exclude the possibility that these changes in nucleotides that are close to exons might alter c KIT transcription or that mutations in the regulatory regions of the KIT gene might be a cause of spontaneous premature ovarian failure Furthermore it should be noted that SSCP methodology does not detect all mutations of PCR products Although in this report using this technique we were able to detect a single nucleotide mutation in a PCR product of 390 bp most laboratories would suggest that SSCP detects approximately 70 to 80 of mutations Screening a larger group of patients with a more sensitive technique such as denaturing high performance liquid chromatography might detect more mutations Conclusions We were unable to detect any significant mutations in the entire coding region of the KIT gene in 40 patients with 46 XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure Therefore mutations in the coding regions of the KIT gene do not appear to be a common cause of 46 XX spontaneous premature ovarian failure in North American women Competing
