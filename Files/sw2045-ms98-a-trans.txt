you made a lot of uh a lot of vases and things or no i i do ceramics i i you know the pieces are made from a mold and i paint them what kind of oh uh you know you get them you clean them up you know get the uh mold line off um hum you know you scrape that off and uh make it as smooth as possible uh then you uh put it in a kiln and fire it you know it s like a big ogen oven um hum and uh when you pull it out it s called bisque uh it started it off with greenware when you first start off and then it goes to bisque and that s when you can paint it huh do you have your own kiln or do you do you no i ve uh you you can rent people s kiln they they uh you take your pieces to their house or their ceramic shop and uh pay them there s one woman that charge ten dollars a month for fire all that i wanted oh oh well that that doesn t sound like it s too expensive a hobby does uh does the uh clay and and the paints and things are they expensive the paints and stuff can get expensive the greenware it depends on what you buy now i bought a a chess set for my husband and painted it for him and i d say the greenware for you know twenty four pieces i think is what they re no no thirty two pieces is a was cost cost me about eight dollars um hum well that doesn t sound very expensive to me no i liked it i had fun with it but uh you know uh i m a little shaky when it comes to detail work so i couldn t get the fine pieces so you know i had to um hum get parts that had big spaces in them yeah uh couldn t do the fine detailed fine detail on it hum but uh you know i made my son his uh Donald Duck and you know the Disney characters painted them for him in real bright colors uh huh and uh he enjoyed them till he was about two and then he uh had fun throwing them and broke them hm oh no well and that was during one of my softball games and my husband had him and he just kept giving them to him and letting him breaking them well children will tend to do that yeah well i didn t get mad at the kid i got mad at my husband for giving them to him oh well i i i enjoy working out when i i get home from work just to just to have something to do that that i know isn t going to that s that s
