 posted Thursday Jan 16 Where s the Fleece It s truly amazing that Jack Shafer s recent article The Great Fleece Panic of 96 takes the New York Times to task for reporting Christmas catalog and retail shortages then ends with can it be a sales pitch for where to find L L Bean Land s End and J Crew on the Web True there were other references at the end of the article for Buy Nothing Day and Adbusters but the premise of Shafer s commentary was that the New York Times Tardy Catalogue Shoppers Risk Losing Out Dec 10 1996 fabricated a catalog shortage in order to herd shoppers into buying thereby playing the role of a shameless pawn in the American sales game I was not a tardy catalogue shopper I didn t wait till the last minute I dogged the pages of a number of catalogs in November and called in my selections before Thanksgiving in order to ensure ample delivery time What I got was out of stock back ordered or not available for just about everything I chose I thought I was just having rotten luck The New York Times Tardy Shoppers article which I read for what it was a consumer report was a much needed reality check Mr Shafer obviously didn t order anything from a catalog before Christmas 96 Cydney Gillis Amazon Pleasure Jonathan Chait and Stephen Glass piece Amazon Con doesn t jibe with my personal experience I m a relatively new Web user My girlfriend was attempting to find a book for a Christmas present and had struck out at about half a dozen bookstores around Manhattan I had heard about Amazon so we went online with my new Power Computing machine We found the book she was looking for and found a couple of other interesting books My girlfriend enjoyed browsing through the lists of Nobel and National Book Award winners as well as the Amazon Editors Favorites section In the end a couple of days later Amazon e mailed us telling us that the hard to find volume was in fact out of print and that the rest of our order was on the way We got the books in a timely fashion In sum my experience with Amazon was good They didn t work magic by finding books bookstores couldn t but they did deliver on their promises and Amazon certainly presents some interesting browsing methods and far better search facilities than most bookstores I m not sure precisely why you favor the overblown megabookstores over Amazon They both have their place and I for one am glad that Borders and Barnes Noble have some genuine competition I agree that there is nothing like going to a bookstore on a cold winter morning but there is also nothing like discovering an interesting new author while sitting in your home in your robe sipping a cup of coffee How many books they physically have in their warehouse has no relevance to me Shemmy Mishaan Barnes Noble Nightmare In your article Amazon Con you compare order time on the phone for a traditional bookstore vs Amazon com online and wait for the UPS driver to show up while not addressing the question of convenience Have you ever had to fight your way through and wait in line at a Barnes Noble in Manhattan or lived in Tokyo where the closest Borders bookstore is in San Francisco You ignore the big picture on how the Internet is changing how we buy books and give me nothing but the impression that Slate i e Microsoft does not want to share the spotlight with another Seattle native Guy Cheney The Amazonian Experience I chuckled at first reading the Amazon Con article but then stopped realized that the first of April was still months away and that Chait and Glass were serious Let me illustrate the absurdity of their review I walked into Borders Books Music to find The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth by John Allegro At first I was astonished that I had to walk through the store to find the archeology section I then had to read several book spines using a well adapted pseudo binary search algorithm I have developed in my brain over the years looking for the author s name It was not to be found I then stood confused for a few moments until a human male confronted me with a question Can I help you find something I figured this must be some biological version of a search engine so I said The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Christian Myth by John Allegro hoping the query was syntactically correct I was disappointed with the speed at which the engine performed for he as did I moments before searched the archeology section though with perhaps a less well adapted algorithm and found nothing Then he suggested the religion section toward which I was led still on foot He again browsed the books visually and pulled a tome from the shelf Here it is Is there anything else I can do I grabbed the book looked at the cover Yes indeed this was the book in question Yes I said I wanted the scroll translations and a couple of other books on the same subject I didn t know the titles A list of all books by author Vermes first name unknown having to do with Dead Sea Scrolls also books by Richard Leigh and a guy with the last name Baigent on any subject I need publishing dates and oh yeah prices By the expression on his face I knew for sure I had blundered the syntax this time Amazon com is not a physical bookstore and Borders is not an electronic bookstore You can t browse titles on a shelf if they re not there and you can t drink caf latte over an asynchronous connection They re different My first Amazon order was placed on a Friday and arrived on Tuesday My last order placed at about the same time the article s authors ordered took about nine days I have paid with shipping about the same for books through Amazon as I would have at a local bookstore But I have found books on Amazon s site that are certainly nonexistent on Borders shelves If you gotta order it you gotta order it I remember taking some time filling out the form for my initial order I don t know how long it took but I was taking my time making sure everything was correct I don t remember it being difficult And now after selecting my books it takes me less than a minute to order I type in my e mail address my password select credit card punch my way through about three are you really sure screens and my order is in Amazon remembers who I am where my books are going and my credit card information It couldn t take me 37 minutes as Chait and Glass suggest even if I were typing with the back of my head Did I mention I never have to wait in line at Amazon Some trick Some con Frank Wayne
