 The Buck Stops With the Doc When medical practice goes wrong who is to blame The traditional answer in journalism has been unambiguous the doctor If the press found out a person had died from improper care or had had the wrong leg cut off the reaction was predictable A clamor went up for the incompetent physician s head or at least his license And doctors everywhere cringed There but for the grace of God go I each of us would say For all of us make terrible mistakes Only the unlucky few are publicly exposed So I ve been intrigued by the increasingly popular alternative explanation the system did it In many cases this is the right way to go Bad systems are more often at fault than bad doctors I worry however that we have already begun to take this explanation too far so far that we are introducing a dangerous murkiness into the question of who is ultimately in charge when it comes to taking care of patients Take the recent horror story in which Christopher Sercye a 15 year old gunshot victim lay bleeding to death 35 feet from the door of a Chicago hospital while the staff refused to help citing hospital policy prohibiting workers from leaving the emergency room If you somehow missed or have forgotten the details click The case provoked a national outcry This time the white hot light of publicity focused blame more on the administrators than on individual caregivers City state and national officials demanded to know how a medical facility could maintain such an appalling policy In an unusual step President Clinton personally announced that the policy was so outrageous that he would seek to have the Ravenswood Hospital Medical Center expelled from Medicare In this particular case however the impulse to hold the CEO more responsible than the doctors seems wrong What shocked me was not so much the hospital s policy as the fact that doctors and nurses would stick by the rules rather than help a person in desperate need News organizations demanded an explanation from the hospital CEO John Blair but I could find no reports that mentioned so much as the name of a staffer who had refused to help This was not an isolated instance of medical personnel providing bad care in obeisance to a policy The Los Angeles Times recently uncovered several cases in which doctors at Northridge Hospital in Southern California refused to provide epidural anesthesia during childbirth to women on Medicaid unless they anted up 400 on the spot The reason It was hospital policy patients were told One patient offered credit cards a check and finally had her mother wire in the money but the epidural was denied The cash hadn t arrived in time Certainly these policies deserve scrutiny But the real issue here is who ultimately is in charge of patient care By putting all the blame on the rule makers the public is implicitly accepting that sometimes the rule makers are in charge instead of the caregivers That is a very recent phenomenon and it should be resisted Hospital policies after all are not federal laws They do not demand slavish devotion In odd cases rules adopted for the best of reasons can make for bad medicine And real life is full of odd cases I remember one not long ago when late at night a patient came into my hospital at death s door because of a rupturing abdominal aneurysm Understandably our hospital forbids residents to start operations without an attending surgeon present But none was around and this guy would have died waiting So we didn t hesitate to break the rules and operate on our own It was his only chance Ravenswood s policy may also have been well intentioned According to a hospital spokesman it is an old policy maintained by most hospitals to make clear that staff should not be expected to sacrifice the care of sick patients in the ER to go hither and yon But the dying boy presented a case where the staff should have broken that rule Indeed the Chicago Tribune reported that a year earlier an emergency worker at a partner hospital with the same policy had done just that He ran outside to help a woman suffering a brain hemorrhage in her car As for just plain barbaric policies like the one at Northridge Hospital I see no way in which the doctors who follow them are not ultimately culpable To say they were obeying an administrator s instructions is not even the slightest defense Patients still can and should insist on holding doctors responsible for providing proper care The managed care debate presents this issue in a slightly different context The recent clamor in the press and among some politicians to allow patients to sue insurers for medical malpractice makes it sound as if we are going in the wrong direction here too But the semantics are important The laws under consideration would not actually make insurers liable for malpractice Instead they would make it easier to sue insurers for failing to pay for proper care I m all for giving patients a fair chance to contest improper refusals of payment but we should not lapse into calling such refusals malpractice Just because an insurer won t pay for a treatment doesn t free a doctor from providing it Essentially a patient in this position is uninsured And doctors are still ethically obliged to offer appropriate care to uninsured patients in need This might sound like I m calling for a return to olden times when medical decisions were nobody s business except the doctor s and the patient s I m not That fragmented system without oversight had its problems deviance not all doctors provided good care and cost the doctors drove up the bills Hospitals government insurers and private insurers have stepped in with standard guidelines for care review of medical decisions and changes in how doctors are paid Much of this systematization of care has clearly been to public benefit But not all of it has and not all of it will be At the margin we doctors have found ourselves being asked to do things that make us queasy A new guideline for example may tell us to send heart surgery patients home earlier It forces us to justify doing otherwise It s a big pain in the butt But it is not a command and we should not let it become one Perhaps the previous way was based on nothing more than fusty old habit and being forced to rethink it is good for us However if I know the new way is inappropriate I cannot be permitted to cave In Chicago and in Northridge the doctors should have known that blindly following policy was bad The buck still stops with them Missed our link to the sidebar recapping the
