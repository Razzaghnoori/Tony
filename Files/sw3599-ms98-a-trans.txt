        up in New York     freezing   is it dry or wet   um its um its its been pretty dry yeah it it rained but we had a problem with a little bit of a water shortage but it rained for a bit but the last about three four days i guess you probably had a cold front last week but uh they said that it was coming across the country but the last few days has been like really cold it was down to about thirteen degrees um yesterday morning when i woke up its starting to warm up a little bit now but we havent got any snow yet just a couple of sprinkles here and there   well we havent had cold weather weve just had rain and rain and more rain       this is our third consecutive day of rain and the weather man is promising us at least four more days of rain   is it you say in Dallas   yeah in Dallas and were on the verge and its going to happen either today or tomorrow of setting an all time record for most rain in a year   wow   our normal rainfall is twenty nine inches and were already up to over fifty inches   wow thats wild   and its and its coming down and coming down its it is been raining all year at an incredible pace   thats pretty wild   i know were about to float away   its usually pretty i guess twenty nine is pretty dry its Dallas is kind of in the desert huh   well its not really in desert the desert starts about fifty miles west of here is where the desert sort of starts but twenty nine inches is is our normal we have very dry summers and uh spring time is usually fairly wet but this time of year is fairly dry and were having spring time rain right now   well how how cold has it been   oh its uh pretty warm its about fifty three degrees or so uh so its not cold but its just wet   yeah i lived in Oregon for three years so i know what thats about   what is it warm but wet up there   yeah i used to it wasnt super warm during the winter it would be you know forty five fifty degrees most of the time but always a sprinkling type rain uh in New York you get when it rains you get like real showers sometimes you never got that out there  but uh but here it it  it rains about forty i guess about forty two forty two inches a year yeah i know we had a little bit of a a drought this year as a matter of fact because the water supply in our reservoirs was a little low   well were not having any problem like that the last time we had drought around here was nineteen eighty when we really got very little rain but since then its been normal and then this is about the fourth year in a row where weve had above average rain last year we had about forty five inches and which is well above and now what were having this year so its been tremendous rainfall   does it do any damage i mean you have floods or anything like that or   uh some areas have had some flooding the worst flooding occurs in the spring time when some when our main river around here the Trinity River goes over its banks and causes damage but uh for the most part theyve been trying to deal with that although the traffic is horrible   when it rains   when it rains oh yes everything comes to a a standstill with the rain this morning it took me thirty minutes extra to get to work   yeah          yeah yeah i found that i used to commute i used to live in New York City and commute out to Long Island which is in the suburbs and uh it was normally about an hour and fifteen minutes hour and a half drive itd take          there was really a lot of traffic but it was like pretty good flowing traffic and then it would get really bad when when it rain  together you know takes whatever   is your is your weather now normal for this time of year or is it different   uh yeah its pretty normal today is pretty normal today its probably about  thirty thirty five degree well maybe thirty degrees out now and its supposed to go up to forty and then thats about normal we dont we dont usually stay below freezing uh for long periods of time uh you know we have cold spells that that happen but but aside from that usually the temperature probably average temperature is thirty five forty degrees during the winter so this is kind of normal   well we had we had early freezes here we had our a normal freeze is around November twentieth and we had our freeze this year on November second and between the second and the tenth of November in those eight days we set record lows six of eight days and so we thought we were going to really have a cold winter but since then its the temperatures have been normal its just that the rain has been incredible   yeah thats what happened here last year we had we had uh a lot of cold early on and then it and then the winter was relatively mild i think they i think its going to be a cold winter this year though because of that volcano in uh   oh in the Philippines   in the Philippines thats supposed to like cover up the uh or rather raise the warming layers and stuff like that so its probably going to be a couple degrees cooler   well i dont know what i dont know if that volcano caused all this rain but somethings been causing all this rain   but uh it could it could it could cause rain im not sure but
