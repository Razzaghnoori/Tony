 Introduction Objective of the study The purpose of this study was to test whether a low cost outreach education programme managed by a district health management team DHMT in a rural district of Kenya could increase private drug outlets knowledge of and compliance with national malaria treatment guidelines The cornerstone of the programme was to train and equip drug wholesalers both mobile drug vendors and wholesale counter attendants to serve as unpaid outreach educators of the new malaria guidelines Since the wholesalers were to educate the drug retailers during their normal business interactions with them the programme was called vendor to vendor Retailers consisted of shops kiosks pharmacies and private clinics many of them unlicensed Study setting In Kenya approximately 26 000 children die each year from malaria or about 72 per day 9 In August 1998 the Government of Kenya changed its first line anti malarial treatment from chloroquine to sulfadoxine pyrimethamine SP 10 Amodiaquine was to be the second line drug A gazette notice in October 1999 permitted SP to be sold over the counter and required that chloroquine be sold only by prescription Amodiaquine was not mentioned so it continued to be sold over the counter In 1999 the Government of Kenya also conducted tests of 33 SP brands and approved five However because of lack of enforcement the 28 unapproved SP drugs still remained in the market as well as chloroquine and amodiaquine Furthermore the gazette notice was not well publicized so many shops and kiosks still believed that they were prohibited from selling SP Bungoma district located in Western Province Kenya is a malaria endemic area with a population of about 900 000 11 Home treatment of malaria using drugs purchased from private outlets is common A 1996 study found that 47 of children received home treatment with an anti malarial drug purchased mainly from pharmacies 54 or small shops 29 5 A 1998 survey conducted by the Bungoma DHMT estimated the district had about 1500 private drug outlets as compared to 38 health facilities The survey revealed that 87 of the shopkeepers had never received training on drug use but 60 gave their customers some instruction on dosages Nearly 27 did not know the difference between anti malarials and anti pyretics 11 Description of the programme The main components of the vendor to vendor programme were design and production of a shopkeeper job aid and a client awareness aid orientation of wholesale owners training and equipping of mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants and monitoring With the assistance of the USAID funded Quality Assurance Project and the African Medical Research and Education Foundation members of the Bungoma DHMT first conducted focus groups and individual interviews with private drug outlets wholesalers and consumers They learned the common misperceptions the public had about SP e g that it is too strong for children below one year of age and the main difficulties faced by drug sellers e g when consumers demand anti malarial drugs of doubtful efficacy The team then worked with a Kenyan graphic artist to develop two posters in Kiswahili to communicate Kenya s new malaria guidelines to retailers and to motivate the public to purchase the approved SP drugs The shopkeeper job aid was for a retailer to consult when selling anti malarial drugs It was to be hung where the retailer could easily use it when serving clients The job aid listed the clinical symptoms of malaria a dosage chart of the approved brands of SP and anti pyretics treatment advice and common situations faced by private outlets with suggestions on how to deal with them The client awareness poster was to be hung near the entrance of the outlet to generate consumer demand for the five approved brands of SP and to communicate that SP was now available over the counter It urged customers to treat malaria properly by using one of these recommended drugs which were depicted in their actual packaging The DHMT next conducted two three hour orientation sessions for owners of wholesale shops and pharmacies to gain their cooperation Following these sessions virtually all agreed to send their counter attendants to the training and let them distribute the job aids and posters during their work In April May 2000 the DHMT conducted five one day training sessions for mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants Mobile vendors are entrepreneurs who purchase drugs from wholesale general shops not wholesale pharmacies and re sell them by motorcycle or bicycle to small retailers wholesale counter attendants are stationary employees of wholesale pharmacies or general shops who are paid a daily wage Of approximately 105 wholesalers identified about 70 were trained 22 wholesale pharmacy attendants 11 wholesale shop attendants and 40 mobile drug vendors Extensive role plays were performed on how to communicate the posters and advise outlets on where to hang them Additionally each trainee received a receipt book to record recipients of posters and to obtain their agreement to comply with the new guidelines Wholesalers were to discuss and distribute the job aids at the point of sale for mobile vendors at the retail outlet for wholesale attendants at the wholesale outlet No retail outlets were directly trained by the DHMT At the end of the training all wholesalers received caps and shirts with the malaria dosage chart on the front About three months after training the DHMT monitored the mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants During the visits the team checked malaria knowledge with a 10 question quiz and collected receipts Although the DHMT was not able to observe how the wholesalers communicated the guidelines to the retail outlets they were able to confirm that the wholesalers had the requisite knowledge and understood every element of the shopkeeper job aid The total cost of the programme that would be borne by a district was 8300 The cost breakdown was as follows formative research to learn about malaria treatment issues 2000 design and production of 1500 shopkeeper job aids and 1500 client posters 3000 training of mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants including t shirts caps and receipt books 2800 and monitoring of mobile vendors and wholesale counter attendants by the DHMT 500 These costs do not include the time spent on this activity by district health personnel or by outside technical advisors but it does include daily allowances to district personnel for the days they spent in training or monitoring Methods Research design Six months after training the mobile vendors and wholesale attendants the study team employed eight mystery shoppers unemployed people posing as clients and four supervisors members of the DHMT to assess the implementation and impact of the programme The mystery shopper evaluation approach was chosen because it has been used effectively elsewhere to assess the quality of drug retailers primarily dispensing practices for diarrhoea and respiratory infections without observation bias 12 The study team received clearance for using this approach from the Steering Committee overseeing the Bungoma District Malaria Initiative during their 1999 annual meeting which included representatives from the National Malaria Control Programme and the Ministry of Health Care was taken to follow ethical guidelines such as preserving confidentiality of individual outlets Data were collected for eight days Two mystery shoppers one man and one woman and one supervisor visited each drug outlet included in the sample The females were to have a nine month old child at home whom they believed had malaria They asked the outlet attendant for advice on what drug to purchase The males were to have a two year old child sick at home They specifically asked for Malaraquin a popular brand of chloroquine Both types of mystery shoppers were only to provide information e g age of the child duration of the illness etc if asked Immediately after leaving the outlet the shopper discreetly completed a form to record the interaction Some time after both mystery shoppers visited an outlet a supervisor entered to check stocks look for job aids and ask questions to assess malaria knowledge Sample design Determining an appropriate sample design posed some challenges First since the DHMT had no control over which retail outlets were reached by the wholesalers it was not possible to randomize outlets into intervention and control groups or localities Second because the DHMT had conducted its own survey of private drug outlets in Bungoma district only two years before implementing the vendor to vendor programme it was reluctant to delay launching the programme in order to allow researchers to perform an additional baseline survey focused on private prescribing practices Hence the study team opted for a post hoc evaluation recognizing the limitations of this design Because it was not possible to randomize outlets the researchers decided that informed outlets would be defined as outlets that had received the posters confirmed either by the presence of a shopkeeper job aid or the respondent stating that it had been received Outlets never having received job aids would be defined as controls The study team was aware that informed and control outlets might differ in ways that could affect directly the outcomes of interest To increase internal validity the team sought to visit control outlets that resembled receipted outlets in terms of location size and type In addition during data analysis the team examined whether the respondent s position employee family member or owner educational level or gender could bias results None of these seemed to be confounders A post hoc stepwise logistic regression analysis found that the only variable predicting whether an outlet was labeled informed or control was its sources of drugs informed outlets were more likely to report purchasing drugs from mobile vendors However it is not known if informed and control outlets differed in other ways not measured by the study team such as receptivity to being educated by a wholesaler For locating informed outlets the team started with the 231 receipts collected from wholesalers They discarded 105 for the following reasons 10 were duplicates 19 were schools or laboratories did not have names or were outside the district and 76 were in remote sub locations Thus 126 informed outlets were sought Of these 47 37 were no longer operational or could not be found 9 7 had never received the job aids and 7 5 were not visited by one mystery shopper Hence 63 of the receipted outlets sought were characterized as informed The nine which did not receive job aids were characterized as controls For control outlets the strategy was to select one to two drug outlets near the receipted outlets as well as 15 outlets from a neighbouring district Teso Of the approximately 200 non receipted outlets visited 20 10 did not have anti malarials in stock 38 19 had received job aids and were labeled informed outlets and 142 72 never received job aids and were labeled controls In all 101 informed and 151 control outlets were obtained Data analysis Data entry and statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 8 0 Chi square ANOVA and logistic regression were performed to compare informed versus control outlets to examine the potential impact of confounders and to check for differences by mystery shopper scenario Results Profile of private outlets drugs and prices Private drug outlets More than half of the attendants at the 252 retail outlets interviewed by supervisors were female and about 42 were the owners see Table 1 Nearly 25 had eight years or less of education About 75 of these outlets were shops or kiosks and 58 were in rural areas Outlets reported serving nine malaria clients on average per day range one to 120 of whom half were children under five About 20 of these outlets obtained anti malarial drugs from mobile vendors Informed and control outlets were similar in terms of sex and education level of attendants as well as setting Informed outlets were more likely to be pharmacies but they did not have a significantly larger clientele on average than control outlets Informed outlets were also more likely to purchase their drugs from wholesale pharmacies and mobile vendors About 27 of informed outlets reported getting job aids from wholesale attendants 51 from mobile vendors and 22 did not know who supplied them Drugs available More than 70 different brands of various anti malarial drugs and over 30 brands of anti pyretics were found in the outlets visited This represents a significant increase from 17 brands of anti malarials found in Kenya in 1995 7 On average pharmacies had 10 different brands of various anti malarials in stock while shops had two and private clinics five Amodiaquine AQ the second line drug was the most frequently stocked see Table 2 Of outlets visited 81 stocked AQ while only 39 stocked SP and 41 stocked chloroquine CQ Drug stocking and source of drugs were found to differ significantly by type of outlet About 60 of shops kiosks bought drugs from wholesale general shops which only stock over the counter drugs In contrast almost all pharmacies chemists and private clinics obtained their drugs from large wholesale pharmacies Mobile vendors sold mainly to rural shops and kiosks Drugs sold to mystery shoppers Not only was AQ the most stocked anti malarial it was also sold most frequently to mystery shoppers see Table 3 SP was sold to less than 15 of mystery shoppers about the same proportion who were sold CQ Mystery shoppers were never sold injectables and very few were sold combinations of anti malarial drugs About 5 of shoppers were sold antibiotics anti pyretics or other drugs as anti malarials Nine mystery shoppers 2 were sold drugs that were not genuine In 29 of visits the outlet refused to sell any drug probably due to concerns by shopkeepers about the legality of selling drugs for young children Refusal to sell drugs differed significantly by child s age and outlet type 43 of shops versus 3 of pharmacies would not sell anti malarial drugs for a 9 month old child whereas 26 of shops versus 2 of pharmacies would not sell for a 2 year old child Whether shoppers were told the correct dose differed significantly by type of drug Shoppers who were sold SP were much more likely to be told the correct dose 76 than those sold AQ 26 or CQ 7 The fact that SP is a single dose treatment may have made it easier for attendants to remember Many attendants mistakenly recommended a single dose of AQ instead of the required three day treatment Drug prices The prices paid by the mystery shoppers for treating their child s malaria as recommended by outlet attendants varied widely from about 0 03 to 2 29 These prices included anti pyretics On average the price per tablet was 0 10 whereas the price per bottle of syrup was 0 81 The price within drug brands also varied For example one tablet of Malaratab the most popular AQ ranged from 07 to 21 Profit margins may provide a motive for why AQ was sold so frequently In general AQ drugs had higher profit margins than SP drugs and syrups had higher profit margins than tablets Average profits for a full child dose ranged from 03 for Fansidar tablets SP to 34 for Malaramed syrup AQ Coverage and acceptability Coverage During the training about 1400 copies of each poster were distributed to the wholesale attendants and mobile vendors for dissemination Based on the receipts collected and the proportion of unreceipted informed outlets found during the study it is estimated that in six months about 450 to 500 private drug outlets were reached with minimal effort from the DHMT Job aids acceptability visibility and use About 63 of the informed outlets were displaying the shopkeeper job aid and the client poster at the time of the supervisor s visit The majority of the shopkeeper job aids were displayed in a visible location such as on a wall About 62 of retail attendants said they used the shopkeeper job aid and 47 believed clients used the client poster An indication of the usefulness of the shopkeeper job aid was that 31 of informed outlets spontaneously used it when asked about dosages of SP drugs Impact of programme Knowledge of correct malaria treatment During the evaluation the supervisors administered a ten question malaria knowledge quiz Informed outlets scored significantly better than control outlets on seven out of ten questions and slightly better or equivalent on the rest Informed outlets had better knowledge of important concepts such as that SP is not too strong for children and that SP can be sold in shops Among outlets that stocked SP 76 of informed outlets 48 63 knew the correct dose of SP for an 18 month old child as compared to 43 of controls 15 35 chi square 10 9 p 001 A total knowledge score was calculated by assigning one point to a correct answer and zero points for an incorrect answer or don t know Informed outlets scored 8 7 out of 10 on average while control outlets scored 7 1 Informed outlets receiving job aids from mobile vendors had significantly higher scores than those receiving job aids from wholesale attendants 9 2 vs 8 6 Analysis by education level revealed that at each level informed outlets scored higher When compared by outlet type the intervention appears to have had a significant impact on shops and pharmacies knowledge but not private clinics see Table 4 Stocking of drugs As shown in Table 2 informed outlets were significantly more likely to stock SP than control outlets 62 vs 23 Shops mainly accounted for the striking difference in SP stocking Overall there was no significant difference in stocking of AQ Informed shops were significantly less likely than control shops to stock CQ 22 vs 42 as were informed clinics relative to control clinics 0 vs 54 Dispensing practices The key malaria dispensing practice is selling an approved first line anti malarial The Kenya National Malaria Guidelines state that SP is the first line drug for uncomplicated malaria in all age groups and should be taken with an anti pyretic As shown in Table 5 the intervention seems to have had a differential impact by outlet type Of those mystery shoppers who went to shops kiosks 32 visiting informed outlets were sold SP compared to only 5 at control outlets p 000 There was no significant differences in the other outlet types Among the informed outlets those receiving job aids from mobile vendors were significantly more likely to sell correct drugs than those who received aids from wholesale attendants 29 vs 7 Explicit consumer demand appeared to have an impact Overall 9 of female shoppers who did not demand CQ were sold a CQ based drug compared to 21 of male shoppers who did demand CQ If more than 40 of outlets had stocked CQ the demand effect might have been higher Controls were twice as likely as informed outlets to sell CQ based drugs to mystery shoppers see Table 5 Of all shoppers who were sold a drug 24 37 157 purchased an approved SP and an anti pyretic at informed outlets as compared to only 3 6 202 at control outlets More than twice as many mystery shoppers were told the correct dose by informed outlets 38 than by control outlets 15 All told 17 of shoppers who purchased drugs at informed outlets both received an approved drug and were told the correct dose as compared to only 2 at control outlets p 001 To provide effective malaria treatment the drug seller should ask several diagnostic questions In comparing informed to control outlets 92 vs 85 inquired about the child s age 50 vs 30 asked about symptoms and 21 vs 11 about the duration of illness All of these differences were statistically significant p 001 Significantly more informed outlets 24 than control outlets 13 told the mystery shopper what to do if a child s health worsens Discussion In areas with a high transmission of malaria adverse outcomes from malaria can only be reduced if malaria symptoms are recognized early within the first 12 18 hours after onset and sick children are treated promptly with effective anti malarial drugs in the right doses Public education campaigns on malaria symptoms and the importance of prompt and effective treatment are vital Yet these campaigns will be of limited value if consumers are sold ineffective drugs in the wrong doses For this reason strengthening the capacity of private drug outlets to provide the recommended anti malarial drugs and information is important The challenge is to achieve greater performance of private outlets at a cost low enough for the activity to be scaled up nationally Four strategies have been advanced for improving the practices of retail pharmacies in developing countries information persuasion incentives and coercion 13 To date very few interventions to change retailer behaviours through persuasion or any other means have been systematically introduced and evaluated 14 One intervention for pharmacy attendants in Kenya and Indonesia called face to face educational outreach resulted in significant short term improvements in diarrhoeal product sales and communication with customers on diarrhoea treatment 15 Other studies have indicated that job aids tailored to the needs of the target audience can positively affect performance 16 The vendor to vendor programme combined the strategies of persuasion and customized information to achieve improved knowledge and dispensing practices among all private retailers Prior research by the DHMT had revealed that wholesalers were considered credible sources of drug information for retailers Hence they were designated as the persuaders Informal interviews indicated that the mobile vendors were more enthusiastic distributors of the job aids than were the wholesale attendants largely because being involved in the programme apparently heightened their status Also since they were not facing queues of retailers communicating the guidelines was more feasible for mobile vendors The main alternate model for changing shopkeeper anti malarial dispensing behaviours has been piloted in Kilifi Kenya The model consisted of a series of three workshops each lasting for three days followed by a two day refresher training The activity seems to have led to dramatic improvements in CQ prescribing practices among a limited number of shops 17 But due to the high turn over among employees and the shortlife spans of many outlets this model would require constant identification and training which could be onerous for districts Furthermore the Kilifi approach does not involve the wholesale distributors who seem to play a key role in influencing drug purchasing and prescribing practices While the vendor to vendor programme did seem to improve shops knowledge and behaviour in a relatively short time the gap between actual and desired performance was still depressingly large This could be due to several factors First informed outlets still had stocks of old drugs that they needed to sell Virtually all drug outlets operate on very limited budgets and cannot afford to discard drugs that are no longer recommended Second confusion and fear about SP were common in the district Many outlets still were not sure whether they were indeed entitled to sell SP over the counter Also nearly half still believed that SP was too strong for chldren Third the programme did not address the use of AQ which had become extremely popular in the district due to extensive advertising high profit margins for sellers and an apparently cheaper price for consumers than SP due to misleading packaging It seems likely that the main reason that the programme did not significantly affect pharmacists relates to the large profit margins on AQ syrups which were only available in pharmacies For the vendor to vendor programme to have a substantial rather than a limited impact these issues would need to be addressed Affordability is a critical issue for scaling up The vendor to vendor model can be considered high quantity wide coverage and moderate quality significant but limited improvements at low cost about 40 per wholesale outlet reached including mobile vendors and about 9 11 per retail outlet reached To help other districts to launch the activity on their own the Quality Assurance Project has produced a comprehensive how to manual for district managers interested in introducing the vendor to vendor programme in their districts The manual can be downloaded from the QAP website http www qaproject org It should be noted that the evaluation had some serious limitations mostly related to the sampling design Informed and control outlets might have differed in important ways that were not measured but could affect the outcomes presented Informed outlets may have been self selected i e control outlets may have been offered job aids but refused them Another form of selection bias may have resulted from the decision to exclude receipted outlets in remote locations due to logistical considerations Moreover because outlets were not randomly selected one cannot extrapolate from the study to estimate the percent of all outlets in Bungoma district stocking SPs or giving correct advice to customers Hence additional studies of the programme are needed to validate the findings Using mystery shoppers yielded important information but it also had some drawbacks Mystery shoppers cannot evaluate institutions where they would be detected as outsiders e g school dispensaries or where they are required to bring their child with them e g some private clinics If the mystery shoppers had brought sick children private clinics probably would have dispensed more injections It is also possible that real clients who are familiar to the shopkeepers would be refused treatment less often than unknown clients mystery shoppers Conclusions The vendor to vendor programme a low cost outreach education strategy seems to have had a moderate impact on private drug outlets knowledge of and compliance with malaria treatment guidelines in a rural district of Kenya Given the difficulty of changing private sector practices the DHMT found the results encouraging Significant differences were observed between informed and control outlets on types and brands of drugs sold dosages sold questions asked of clients and advice given The programme has also had a positive impact on knowledge of malaria treatment guidelines especially among retail attendants with less education The programme appears to have had the greatest impact on shops and kiosks These effects could be heightened if the programme addressed several issues more intensively such as building consumer demand for SP and sustaining the interest of wholesale attendants in the activity perhaps through an incentive programme The district launched a neighbour to neighbour programme in 2002 to raise public awareness about correct malaria treatment However this programme will not be able to achieve a high degree of success without national policies and programmes addressing the profit margins of SP versus AQ drugs advertising and sales of unapproved drugs the enforcement of correct dosage labeling and retrieval from the market of inefficacious drugs Moreover the national government needs to be more active in educating consumers about the importance of early recognition and prompt treatment for malaria why SP is the preferred first line drug and which drugs have been approved Coupled with these national activities district level vendor to vendor programmes would probably have greater impact List of abbreviations used AMREF African Medical
