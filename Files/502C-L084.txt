 Dear 1990 Graduate Congratulations on the completion of your bachelor s degree from Purdue University School of Engineering and Technology at IUPUI As members of your graduating class we appreciate the hard work that has made your degree possible Not only have many of our class juggled family and job responsibilities with studies but they also have made time to participate in student activities which have become traditions in our school For example those in MET who worked on Team Indy were among the first Indianapolis campus participants in the annual Purdue Grand Prix at West Lafayette Others who worked with ACM s high school programming competition with engineering s super mileage vehicle with RHllv1 s Baker s Club or with any of the School s other activities helped to maintain traditions in their departments that future classes will be encouraged to continue These activities have helped develop a sense of community that enabled everyone to endure and succeed even in difficult times Even if we have not engaged in formal extracurricular activities however many more of us have helped each other by reviewing homework problems in one of the student lounges by participating in group projects in classes meeting sometimes after class hours by taking time to listen to a classmate s personal problems or just by socializing between classes As graduates of the class of 1990 we would like to leave behind something tangible in appreciation for the support and encouragement we have received from other students in the School of Engineering and Technology To do this we are initiating another tradition Senior Challenge Senior Challenge is an opportunity for us to contribute to the school that has given us the tools to enrich our lives and make our dreams come true The goal for Senior Challenge 1990 is to raise funds to purchase furnishings for the student lounges in the ET building and in the new building that will house Computer Technology and Engineering programs At one time or another we have all met classmates in the lounges in the ET Building or the Administration Building at the 38th Street campus We all realize how the availability or lack of comfortable seating and conference space made it possible for us to socialize or to get help in a course giving us difficulty Lounges newly furnished through Senior Challenge will promote teamwork in the school by allowing future classes to benefit from each others friendship and assistance With this goal the real beneficiaries of our class gift will be the students who follow us As our senior year draws to a close we challenge you to participate in this worthy project By making a contribution or a pledge using the card enclosed you can put a positive finishing touch on your graduating year With the participation of everyone we will all be proud when the presentation of the class gift is made to Dean Renda at Commencement on May 13 1990 Please complete the enclosed card and mail it in the envelope provided In the next few weeks you will be contacted by a fellow senior either by phone or in your classes to answer any questions you have about Senior Challenge Sincerely Tyrone Artis Larry Gutsch Carol Hutton BS EET 90 BS MET 90 BS SPV 90 Eddie Lashbrook Melissa Warriner BS CPT 90 BS SPV 90
