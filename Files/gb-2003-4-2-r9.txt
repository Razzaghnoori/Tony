 Background Plasmodium falciparum a parasitic protozoan is the causative agent of the most lethal form of human malaria It is responsible for 300 500 million infections per year in some 90 countries and regions throughout the tropical and subtropical world Of these clinical cases approximately 2 1 million result in death annually 1 In areas where mosquito abatement has failed chemotherapy consisting of a limited selection of antimalarial agents is the only defense against this disease The increase in drug resistance throughout the malaria endemic regions is cause for great concern and calls for the development of new antimalarial measures which would involve a larger variety of drug targets as well as a wider array of vaccine strategies reviewed in 2 3 The study of malaria will be greatly helped by the publicly available complete genome sequence of P falciparum The sequencing project driven by the Sanger Centre the Institute for Genomic Research TIGR and Stanford University is essentially complete 4 The sequence of the completed chromosomes are available for download from each sequencing center and from the Plasmodium Genome Resource PlasmoDB 5 6 Preliminary analysis of the 23 megabase pair Mbp P falciparum genome indicates the presence of approximately 5 400 genes spread across 14 chromosomes a circular plastid genome and a mitochondrial genome Strikingly more than 60 of the predicted open reading frames ORFs lack orthologs in other genomes 4 This fact underscores the need to elucidate gene function yet many of the tools that have propelled the study of model organisms remain inefficient or nonexistent in Plasmodium Despite recent improvements in P falciparum transformation techniques 7 the efficiency of stable transfection under a direct drug selection remains approximately 10 6 making knockout and gene replacement experiments difficult and genetic complementation strategies nearly impossible Genome wide expression profiling by microarray technology provides an easy alternative for the functional genomic exploration of P falciparum In organisms ranging from bacteria to humans expression profiling has proved a powerful tool Profiling has been used to gain important insights into processes such as development responses to environmental perturbations gene mutation pathogen and host response and cancer 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 Expression profiling has already been successfully applied to the partial genome sequence of P falciparum and has been used to characterize the role of previously unannotated genes 15 16 17 Here we present the design and assembly of a long oligonucleotide P falciparum gene specific microarray using the currently available genomic sequence generated by the Malaria Genome Consortium 18 19 20 During the course of this work we have developed software improved by experimental data and an open source policy for rapidly selecting unique sequences from predicted ORFs of any genome Subsequently we constructed a long oligonucleotide based P falciparum microarray which we used to evaluate changes in the global expression profile between two distinct stages of P falciparum erythrocytic stage asexual development mid trophozoite and mid schizont The large number of differentially expressed genes detected in this analysis suggests that extensive transcriptional regulation has a major role in the functional specialization of parasite development Results and discussion P falciparumORF predictions At the outset of these studies a total of 27 6 Mbp of P falciparum genomic sequence was obtained from the publicly available sources presented by the Malaria Genome Consortium 18 19 20 in October 2000 The sequence comprised two completely assembled chromosomes the complete mitochondrial and plastid genomes and the sum of all the partial contigs from the remaining chromosomes ORF predictions were carried out using GlimmerM a gene finding tool trained with P falciparum specific sequences 21 22 Using default parameters GlimmerM frequently yielded a large number of overlapping predictions competing gene models and thus additional filtering of the initial prediction output was required As slight overprediction of ORFs is generally desirable for the purpose of expression array building the post prediction filtering of the GlimmerM output was modified with respect to the process used by the Malaria Genome Consortium 21 Briefly individual predictions that overlapped and were on opposite strands or in different reading frames were retained For competing predictions within a given GlimmerM gene model ORFs that were extended downstream by at least 300 bp and were within 300 bp of the total size compared to the size of the largest prediction were chosen In all other cases the largest predicted ORF was selected This selection method resulted in 290 ORF predictions for chromosome 2 whereas the Malaria Genome Consortium selected 210 for the same chromosome 21 The first round of predictions carried out on the publicly available genomic sequence as of August 2000 yielded 8 008 putative ORFs The predicted ORFs are available as additional data with the online version of this paper see Additional data files and from 23 As a first step to annotation the translation of all predicted ORFs were used to search the Astral SwissProt and non redundant NR databases for sequence similarities using the Smith Waterman algorithm 24 In addition all ORF predictions were linked to their counterparts in PlasmoDB 5 6 ArrayOligoSelector array element design To construct a gene specific microarray of the P falciparum genome we designed 70 mer oligonucleotide array elements We chose this length for a number of reasons Long oligonucleotides are a highly sensitive alternative to PCR products and provide a means to readily distinguish between genes with high degrees of sequence similarity 25 In addition the presence of various types of repetitive sequences and highly homologous gene families in the AT rich P falciparum genome contributes to a high rate of PCR failure 17 and J L D unpublished results A software program ArrayOligoSelector was developed specifically for the purpose of systematically selecting gene specific long oligonucleotide probes for entire genomes The latest version and complete source code for ArrayOligoSelector is freely available at 26 For each ORF the program optimizes the oligonucleotide selection on the basis of several parameters including uniqueness in the genome sequence complexity lack of self binding and GC content Figure 1 Similar approaches to oligonucleotide design have previously been described but the exact algorithms source code and or accompanying hybridization data are not available 25 27 28 ArrayOligoSelector helps ensure complete genome coverage and optimal array hybridization while avoiding several potential problems originating from the peculiar characteristics of the P falciparum genome The algorithm attempts to minimize cross hybridization between the oligonucleotide and other regions of the genome To evaluate the potential for cross hybridization early versions of ArrayOligoSelector used a simple BLASTN alignment identity 29 Although this method prevents the selection of troublesome sequences it does not take into account the effect of mismatch distribution or base composition Subsequent versions of ArrayOligoSelector were improved by calculating a theoretical energy of binding between the oligonucleotide and its most probable cross hybridization target in the genome second best target The binding energy kcal mol is calculated using a nearest neighbor model using established thermodynamic parameters 30 31 32 33 34 35 Thus a sequence with high cross hybridization potential will have a more stable binding energy with a larger absolute value In contrast a sequence unique in the genome will yield a smaller absolute value for the binding energy A representative plot of the calculated binding energies for all possible 70 bp oligonucleotides from a putative var gene PlasmoDB v4 0 annotated gene ID PF08_0140 is shown in Figure 2a An important aspect of oligonucleotide design for microarray hybridization is avoiding secondary structures within the oligonucleotide as these are likely to be detrimental to hybridization performance To avoid selecting oligonucleotides with secondary complex structure ArrayOligoSelector uses the Smith Waterman algorithm with the PAM47 DNA matrix to calculate the optimal alignment score between the candidate oligonucleotide sequence and the reverse complement of that sequence 24 A high Smith Waterman score indicates the potential to create secondary structures Figure 2b The presence of low complexity sequence could also result in significant nonspecific cross hybridization For example the P falciparum genome contains a large number of low complexity sequence elements as a result of a high frequency of continuous stretches of A and T nucleotides in both the non coding and the coding regions ArrayOligoSelector automatically detects such sequences by subjecting candidate oligonucleotide sequences to a lossless compression 36 The compression score calculated as the difference in bytes between the original sequence and the compressed version is inversely proportional to complexity Figure 2c Using this score repeats of essentially any nature are detected in a computationally efficient manner In addition in order to avoid specific sequence features ArrayOligoSelector supports filtering based on user defined patterns This feature can be used to implement filtering rules based on empirically derived data Finally the melting temperature of an oligonucleotide is largely determined by its GC content As is the case with most ORFs there exists a large range of GC values 10 to 60 over a 70 bp window Figure 2d For this reason a user defined GC target range is used by ArrayOligoSelector such that the majority of the array elements will share a similar base composition and hybridization properties across the array Given the above parameters ArrayOligoSelector evaluates every 70 mer sequence within an ORF and chooses an optimal set on the following criteria The uniqueness filter requires oligonucleotides to satisfy two simultaneous threshold criteria based on the calculation of the binding energy to their second best target the best target is itself First the oligonucleotide must rank among the top 5 of the unique or almost unique 70 mers in the entire ORF Second its binding energy must be within 5 kcal mol of the best candidate for the ORF In addition an optional user defined energy threshold can operate in conjunction with the default threshold Initial settings for the low complexity and the self binding terms allow the top scoring 33 of 70 mers to pass to the next selection step Finally an optional user defined sequence filter simply eliminates the 70 mer candidates containing the defined sequences These four filters operate on the entire set of 70 mer candidates for a particular ORF and generate four independent output sets The intersection of the four outputs is then subjected to the final selection If no common oligonucleotide is identified in the first intersection the self binding and complexity filters are incrementally relaxed until an intersection becomes available The final selection of candidate oligonucleotides depends upon the GC filter and 3 end proximity ranking Initially oligonucleotides are allowed to pass if they meet the user specified GC If no oligonucleotide with the desired GC content is found the target GC range is relaxed by one percentage point in each direction until one or more oligonucleotides pass As a final step a single candidate closest to the 3 end of the gene is chosen Finally ArrayOligoSelector generates an output file containing the oligonucleotide selections for each putative ORF From our initial set of predictions a total of 6 272 70 mer oligonucleotides were selected and synthesized For our first pass of malaria oligonucleotide selections the earlier version of ArrayOligoSelector utilizing the BLASTN based identity threshold was used The identity cutoff was adjusted to a very conservative value of 30 bp of identity The initial setting of the GC content filter was set to 28 GC 73 C T m Subsequently with the release of additional sequence information a new set of predictions was generated in April 2002 and an additional 1 025 oligonucleotides were selected using the upgraded version of ArrayOligoSelector In this selection the user defined uniqueness threshold was set at 35 kcal mol the value at which cross hybridization is essentially eliminated Figure 3 The GC content target was set at 28 The sequence and location of each oligonucleotide is available online 23 The experiments described in the following section were conducted with the first set of predictions only As additional annotations become available for the whole genome sequence additional oligonucleotides will be selected and added to the existing collection We expect the final set to contain approximately 8 500 oligonucleotides Oligonucleotide performance Hughes et al 25 showed that 60 mer oligonucleotides make highly sensitive specific microarray elements for expression profiling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae 25 The oligonucleotides used in that study were synthesized in situ using ink jet technology whereas the oligonucleotides used in our study were commercially synthesized and subsequently printed using mechanical deposition Similarly to the experiments of Hughes et al we wished to test experimentally the effect of mismatches on sensitivity and specificity of 70 mer oligonucleotides in the context of a complex hybridization mixture P falciparum total RNA Ten separate malaria ORF predictions were arbitrarily selected for analysis and for each of these ORFs a set of ten oligonucleotides were synthesized The first oligonucleotide in each set represents the original 70 mer selection from ArrayOligoSelector Each successive oligonucleotide within a set contains an increasing number of mutations made in increments of 10 Thus the second oligonucleotide in each set had seven bases 10 altered while the last oligonucleotide had 63 bases 90 mutated For the first set of five ORFs Figure 4a 4b 4c 4d 4e which is referred to as the distributed set both the position and the identity of each mutation was random For the second set of five ORFs Figure 4g 4h 4i 4j 4k referred to as the anchored set the mutations in each oligonucleotide were limited to the ends of the sequence In this manner a contiguous stretch of perfectly matched bases was always preserved in the center of each oligonucleotide Figure 4summarizes normalized hybridization intensities of control oligonucleotides obtained from the global gene expression comparisons between trophozoite and schizont stages The results originate from the six microarray hybridizations presented in Figure 5and 10 additional hybridizations available as additional data files 23 The resulting hybridization intensity measurements for each oligonucleotide were averaged across all hybridizations and scaled as a fraction of the average intensity of the perfect match oligonucleotide for each set As is evident from Figure 4a 4b 4c 4d 4e the presence of internal mismatches bubbles and bulges had a large effect on hybridization performance oligonucleotides with 10 mismatches 7 bases suffered an average reduction of 64 in hybridization intensity when compared to the perfect match while oligonucleotides with 20 14 bases or more mismatches were reduced by an average of 97 Figure 4f For the anchored set Figure 4 4g 4h 4i 4j 4k a more gradual hybridization trend was observed Mutating the terminal 14 bases 7 bases at each end resulted in an average loss of 49 of the maximal hybridization intensity Not until 42 bases had been mutated 21 bases at each end did the relative intensity of hybridization drop by an average of 97 5 Figure 4l In agreement with the findings of Hughes et al 25 the data from the anchored set of oligonucleotides reveal a strong relationship between the length of contiguous match the equivalent of oligonucleotide length and overall hybridization performance To measure the extent to which the energy calculation implemented in ArrayOligoSelector matches reality we have plotted in Figure 3the calculated energy of the 100 control oligos shown in Figure 4and their relative intensities of hybridization The calculated energy and relative intensity of hybridization correlate at r 0 91 For comparison the relative intensity of hybridization and number of nucleotide identities correlate at r 0 72 This indicates that a calculated binding energy approach may be used to estimate the potential for cross hybridization for any sequence relative to the rest of the genome The specificity for each oligonucleotide is uniquely and computationally determined and expressed as a binding energy kcal mol To further address the question of specificity of oligonucleotide hybridization to their targets in a complex sample we introduced a set of probes targeting a set of 19 non repetitive sequences from S cerevisiae to the microarray To control for the nucleotide bias of the malaria genome relative to yeast the selection criteria for this set were identical to selection of the plasmodial microarray elements The average GC content of the S cerevisiae oligonucleotides was 31 5 whereas the average GC content of plasmodial oligonucleotides is 32 5 The average signal to background ratios across all hybridizations for these negative control spots was less than twofold which is well below the conservative fivefold signal to background threshold used to filter data see Materials and methods In addition a series of 10 hybridizations was carried out where total RNA from an asynchronous parasite culture was hybridized against PCR products corresponding to the negative control S cerevisiae sequences In these hybridizations the yeast PCR fragment hybridized strictly to its cognate sequence while the average signal to background value for plasmodial elements in the same channel was 1 17 0 05 In no individual case did a plasmodial element yield a signal greater than 2 3 of the target hydridization signal intensity The results of these microarray hybridizations are available as additional data files 23 To assess whether separate oligonucleotides designed to represent the same target gene perform in a similar manner we examined three distinct situations elements dispersed over a long single exon ORF Figure 6a overlapping oligonucleotides Figure 6b and oligonucleotides representing multiple exons of a single gene Figure 6c In each case we observed consistent oligonucleotide performance Gene expression profiling of trophozoites and schizonts We chose a direct comparison of the trophozoite and schizont stages of the P falciparum asexual intraerythrocytic life cycle as a first step toward comprehensively profiling all life cycle stages of this parasite The trophozoite and schizont represent two distinct developmental stages within the 48 hour plasmodial erythrocytic life cycle These stages vary greatly in morphology biochemical properties and transcriptional activity reviewed in 15 37 The mid trophozoite stage 18 24 hours post invasion contains a highly transcriptionally active nucleus with abundant euchromatin In addition trophozoites are characterized by massive hemoglobin ingestion intake of nutrients from the surrounding medium increasing concentration of cytoplasmic ribosomes and rapid formation of organelles In contrast the mid schizonts at 36 42 hours post invasion are characterized by DNA replication 16 32 copies and compaction into newly formed nuclei In addition maturation of merozoite cells begins at the schizont stage and is characterized by the appearance of merozoite organelles such as the rhoptry and dense granules The several trophozoite and schizont specific genes identified previously provide an excellent source of positive controls for the experiments described below For microarray hybridization total RNA was prepared from synchronized in vitro P falciparum cultures representing the trophozoite stage and the schizont stage see Materials and methods Six independent hybridizations were carried out in three the trophozoite derived cDNA was labeled with Cy3 and the schizont derived cDNA with Cy5 In the other three hybridizations the fluorophore assignment was reversed Of the genes assayed 854 features displayed a differential expression greater than twofold Figure 5 525 showed higher relative transcript abundance in trophozoites than in schizonts whereas 326 had greater relative transcript abundance in schizonts Linear regression ratios were calculated for each possible pair of microarray hybridizations using the filtered dataset The correlation between hybridizations with the same Cy3 Cy5 assignment was r 0 94 0 02 while correlation of hybridizations with the opposite Cy3 Cy5 order was r 0 89 0 03 Northern blot hybridizations To confirm the microarray results we examined six genes by northern blot analysis In the microarray hybridization the expression levels of two of the selected genes were unchanged 2 fold while four additional genes showed a differential expression between the trophozoite and schizont stage 2 fold An equal mass of total RNA from both the trophozoite and schizont stages was hybridized with PCR generated DNA probes corresponding to the selected genes Subsequently each northern blot was stripped and rehybridized with a probe specific for the 41 kD antigen p41 fructose bisphosphate aldolase PfALDO PlasmoDB v4 0 ID PF14_0425 Oligo ID M11919_1 38 as a loading control While the relative amount of PfALDO transcript differs by more than twofold between trophozoite and schizont stages when equal masses of total RNA are blotted we found that the relative amount of PfALDO to be essentially equivalent when equal masses of poly A RNA were used for the northern blot Figure 7a The discrepancy between northern blots with total RNA and poly A mRNA are probably due to changes in the relative amounts of mRNA and ribosomal RNA during the intraerythrocytic life cycle The poly A northern blot measurements agree well with the replicate array hybridizations in which PfALDO was consistently less than 1 5 fold differentially expressed Figure 7b To make northern blot measurements comparable to the normalized expression array ratios the ratio between the two stages was measured using a phosphoimager and divided by the ratio obtained for the PfALDO control in each case The normalized ratios of the radiolabel signal were highly consistent with the averaged ratios from the six microarray hybridizations Figure 7b Biological significance of the gene expression results Trophozoite genes The predominant group of features with elevated expression in the trophozoite stage comprised genes encoding various components of the eukaryotic translation machinery This group contained 24 and 33 proteins of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits RPS and RPL respectively In addition nine orthologs of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases and 10 initiation and seven elongation translation factors were detected among trophozoite specific genes Several previously identified plasmodial genes were present in this group including Asp tRNA synthetase two plasmodial elongation factors PfEF1A and PfEF2 and one ribosome releasing factor PfRF1 21 39 Consistent with our findings PfEF 1A has been previously shown to have peak expression during the trophozoite stage 40 Two additional gene groups whose functions are linked to the process of protein synthesis were present among the trophozoite genes five DEAD box RNA helicases including a close homolog of P cynomolgi RNA helicases 1 41 and 23 molecular chaperone like molecules including two P falciparum heat shock proteins such as PfHSP70 GenBank accession number M19753 and PfHSP86 accession number L34028 and a homolog of a DnaJ domain containing protein family DNJ1 SIS1 homolog 42 These data agree with previous studies that found a group of DEAD box RNA helicases to be overexpressed during the trophozoite stage in P cynomolgi 41 Along with the genes for the translation machinery a number of genes involved in various steps of RNA synthesis and processing were located among the trophozoite genes including 16 ORFs belonging to various RNA polymerase complexes and 11 splicing factors Figure 5 Two previously identified plasmodial RNA polymerase components were found in this group including the largest subunit of P falciparum RNA polymerase II PfRNApolIIA M73770 and a homolog RNApolK 14 kD 39 The expression characteristics revealed are also consistent with several previous studies that suggested that the plasmodial transcription and translation machinery is active through the late ring and early trophozoite stage before decaying during the late schizont stage 15 40 Another functional group of genes that encode enzymes of cellular biosynthetic pathways was distinguished within the trophozoite category This gene set includes 16 enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism 10 ORFs likely to be involved in nucleotide metabolism and 11 ORFs involved in the biosynthetic pathways of several amino acids Several well characterized plasmodial genes were identified in this metabolic collection including P falciparum lactate dehydrogenase PfLDH 027743 enolase U00152 triose phosphate isomerase PfTPI L01654 glucose 6 phosphate isomerase PfG6PI J05544 hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase PfHGPRT X16279 and dihydropteroate synthetase PfDHPS U07706 In addition a group of 11 proteolytic enzymes potentially involved in hemoglobin degradation was detected among the trophozoite genes these include a cysteine protease falcipain 2 AF251193 a metalloprotease falcilysine AF123458 and a member of an aspartic protease family plasmepsin 2 L10740 Falcipain 2 and plasmepsin 2 have been the targets of recent drug discovery research 43 44 Overall the emergent gene clusters suggest that the trophozoite stage a central phase of plasmodial intraerythrocytic development is characterized by the activation of general cellular growth functions such as transcription translation and hemoglobin degradation and biosynthesis of basic metabolites Schizont genes A large number of ORFs found in the schizont expressed category correspond to genes previously associated with the various steps by which newly released merozoites invade new host cells The initial step of this process adhesion of the merozoite to the surface of an erythrocyte is facilitated by several classes of proteins exposed on the surface of the parasite Eighteen ORFs identical or homologous to proteins associated with the merozoite surface were present among the schizont enriched genes This group included four merozoite surface proteins MSP MSP1 M19753 MSP4 MSP5 AF033037 and MSP6 AY007721 Additional members of this group include two ORFs containing Duffy like binding domains erythrocyte binding antigen EBA 175 L07755 a putative erythrocyte binding protein EBL1 AF131999 and proteins known to be delivered to the surface from apical organelles including apical membrane antigen AMA1 U65407 and finally two rhoptry associated proteins RAP1 U20985 and RAP2 Initial attachment of the merozoite is followed by reorientation of the parasite cell with its apical part toward the erythrocyte membrane followed by invagination of the membrane Previous studies suggested that both steps are facilitated by the action of actomyosin which requires ATP hydrolysis 45 Consistent with these findings we found five proteins previously associated with this process pf actinI M19146 pf myoA AF255909 and merozoite cap protein 1 U14189 and two subtilisin like proteases PfSUB1 and PfSUB2 AJ132422 differentially enriched in schizonts Interestingly one additional homolog of PfSUB1 was identified among the schizont genes Moreover the expression levels of a set of plasmodial protein kinases were previously found to be augmented during the late stages of the malarial erythrocytic life cycle 15 Our findings confirm and extend this report 26 unique ORFs sharing a high to medium level of homology with protein kinases and phosphorylases had elevated mRNA levels during the schizont stage Figure 5 Two previously identified representatives were present in this set a cAMP dependent protein kinase PfPKAc AF126719 and a plasmodial serine threonine protein phosphatase PfPPJ AF126719 A second functional group of genes with increased expression in schizonts encodes proteins that are thought to function on the periphery of a newly infected erythrocyte at the early stages of asexual development Representatives include the genes for ring infected erythrocyte surface antigen RESA X04572 and several close RESA homologs CLAG9 AF055476 the related gene CLAG3 1 and two members of the serine repeat rich protein SERA family 21 In addition to these well characterized surface proteins the schizont enriched set of transcripts contained a number of ORFs identical or homologous to proteins recognized by antibodies present in plasmodium immune sera obtained either from model organisms 46 or from acute and or convalescent patients 47 In summary the schizont stage of plasmodial development featured genes predominantly occupied with the process of merozoite function as well as the advance synthesis of transcripts for proteins that facilitate parasite establishment within the newly infected erythrocyte Taken together these results suggest that the parasite cell in the trophozoite stage is dedicated to cell growth and the predominant function of the mid late schizont stage is maturation of the next generation of merozoites Of particular interest is the large number of ORFs within both categories 39 in trophozoite and 61 in schizonts with no putative functions assigned These ORFs have little to no homology to any other known genes and may possibly represent highly specialized functions not likely to be shared outside this family of parasites Conclusions In this study we present a P falciparum ORF specific microarray utilizing 70 mer oligonucleotides as individual microarray elements This approach helped to overcome potential problems originating from low PCR amplification and allowed us to select probes with a high specificity thereby minimizing potential cross hybridization Moreover the oligonucleotide selection algorithm allowed a balanced GC content around 28 across the entire microarray set which is significantly higher than the plasmodial genome average which is 19 4 with 23 7 in coding regions 4 Application of the ArrayOligoSelector is not restricted to the P falciparum genome but is broadly useful for the automated selection of hybridization probes for a range of species The flexibility of the selection parameters controlling stringency of uniqueness self binding complexity user defined filters and GC content allows the selection of oligonucleotides appropriate for any genome Evaluation of results from derivative control oligonucleotides showed that long oligonucleotides could tolerate 10 mismatches however alteration of the target sequence by more then 20 eliminated most of the hybridization signal Therefore small sequencing errors and natural variation among isolates are not likely to impact on sensitivity These performance characteristics imply that the array design for this effort can accommodate the study of essentially any P falciparum strain with a high degree of specificity At present the P falciparum microarray used in this study consists of approximately 6 000 gene specific elements corresponding to the majority of the total coding content predicted for the P falciparum genome As new sequence and improved gene predictions arise additional elements will be added to this evolving platform Moreover the present oligonucleotide representation could be further extended for investigation of several unusual P falciparum genetic and transcriptional phenomena including antisense mRNA transcription 48 and alternative splicing and or transcriptional initiation 49 50 This may be achieved by designing exon specific array features as well as antisense oligonucleotides The oligonucleotide collection could also be expanded by sequences corresponding to intergenic genomic regions Inclusion of such elements was found to be extremely useful for identifying protein binding DNA regions by chromatin immunoprecipitation as well as genes not detected by automated gene prediction algorithms 51 Within both the trophozoite and schizont categories large numbers of genes belong to functionally related processes These include genes encoding ribosomal subunits multiple factors for transcription and translation enzymes of biosynthetic and catabolic pathways or merozoite adherence and invasion machinery These results are consistent with predictions that a large number of plasmodial genes undergo strict stage specific transcriptional regulation and that such co regulation is shared among functionally related genes 15 52 Naturally a fine resolution global gene expression profile including the different steps of the plasmodial life cycle for multiple divergent strains will be necessary to characterize fully the intraerythrocytic life of the parasite At present our laboratory is analyzing a global gene expression profile of the 48 hour erythrocytic life cycle with 1 hour resolution for three strains of P falciparum In a number of model organisms high resolution gene expression maps have served as extremely powerful tools for discovery and characterization of novel genes as well as exploration of multiple cellular functions 9 11 The gene expression maps typically comprise genome wide expression profiles at a number of different stages of cellular development profiles of multiple strains and genetic variants and global expression responses to number of growth perturbations and growth inhibitory drugs Following a similar approach in P falciparum is most likely to provide substantial information about the many ORFs that lack functional annotation Further understanding of cellular physiology of this parasite including basic metabolic functions and the intricate interactions between the parasite cell and human host immune system will be a key step in uncovering new targets for antimalarial drug discoveries and vaccine development Materials and methods Microarray fabrication The 70 bp oligonucleotides were synthesized Operon Technologies CA resuspended in 3 SSC

treatments and harvested at the subsequent trophozoite stage 18 24 h post invasion and schizont stage 36 42 h post invasion For the trophozoite stage collection visual inspection of the Giemsa stains show a nearly pure trophozoite population with less than 1 schizonts For the schizont stage collection we estimate the amount of ring contamination to be around 3 The cells were harvested in prewarmed
