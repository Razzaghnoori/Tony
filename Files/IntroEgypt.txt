 Egypt and the Egyptians E gypt s long and illustrious history seems to hold the modern world spellbound The ancient Empire that flourished here from 2500 b c until just before the dawn of Christianity was arguably the greatest civilization that the world has ever seen Two hundred years ago after Napoleon sent his army officers to explore the land and bring back the first hand drawn impressions of half buried statues and columns the world couldn t get enough When Howard Carter peered through the dusty air of Tutankhamun s tomb in 1922 and in his own words wonderful things met his eyes he confirmed the immeasurable wealth of the Pharaohs and when the backer of the dig Lord Carnarvon died suddenly only a few months later vox populi blamed it on the curse of the Pharaohs mummy and Hollywood was quick to feed our fantasies Today pseudo scientific theories about the origin and purpose of the pyramids fill the stands of bookshops and the listings on documentary channels Our interest and curiosity about Egypt is it seems insatiable Due to this unprecedented attention people travel to Egypt with preconceived ideas in addition to a sense of excitement and anticipation But when it comes to the reality of the archaeological sites nothing prepares you for their beauty scale and magnificence The colossal statues are overwhelming the delicate grace of the tomb paintings breathtaking the pyramids prodigious and the huge temple complexes positively Herculean One can see how archaeologists arrive for one season and never leave the ruins and artifacts like the enigmatic smile of the Sphinx pose more questions than we have answers There s no doubt that the mysteries of the ancient are the lure that attracts most visitors yet there is much to be said of modern Egypt the archaeological sites do not sit in a geographical or cultural vacuum Twenty first century Egypt is a land of contrasts but some things never change Just as in ancient times without the River Nile Egypt could not exist The longest river in the world brings abundant water from the heart of Africa to irrigate a narrow verdant valley snaking its way through the hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of parched desert that constitute the modern state Its flow is constant never suffocated by the all pervading sand or evaporated by the oppressive heat of the sun All along its length small villages of modest mud brick houses sit surrounded by verdant crops You ll see gaggles of geese and ducks waddling along the riverbanks burdened donkeys treading steadfastly homeward and oxen compliantly tilling the fields The people of Egypt give thanks to the Nile but they worship Allah and the haunting intonations of the muezzin drift across city and farmland calling the faithful to prayer It is however the most liberal Muslim state in the Middle East with a constitution and judiciary based on western democratic models not shariah Muslim law The country also has a small but well integrated Christian community who worship the tenets of St Mark The Copts as they are known have brought forth many influential individuals including Boutros Boutros Ghali former Secretary General of the United Nations These interesting amalgams help to make Egypt such a fascinating destination to visit So many seemingly contrary and opposing factors combine to make it unique Over 90 percent of its land is uninhabited contrasting with great centers of population including the capital Cairo which is the largest city in Africa a dusty noisy sprawling neon lit crowded metropolis of more than fourteen million people The majority of its population is urban dwelling yet it has family groups of Berber and Bedouin nomads who spend their entire lives in their barren desert homeland Office workers function by the tick of the clock watching the minutes pass while farmers live by the season marking time with the twice yearly harvests Though most of its people claim descent from the ancient Egyptians modern religious practices and social protocols are totally divorced from those of their ancestors In a country where tradition plays an overriding part of everyday life one third of its energy comes from the ultra modern source of hydroelectricity It may be Egypt s position at the meeting point of three cultures Africa Europe and the Middle East that accounts for its complexity It has long been influenced by their differing traits and has assimilated their various customs and practices African gold brought wealth in ancient times and the darker skinned Nubians became invaluable trading partners to the ancient Egyptians living around Aswan in the south they remain close to their roots and their strong musical traditions When the Arabs took the country from the east they brought a new religion art and society that swept away much of what had come before In the 18th and 19th centuries the Europeans arrived one legacy of which is the English and French spoken by a good number of native Egyptians and the khedives of Egypt stole their ideas on administration and organization to help them run the country Cairo not Thebes is the focus of today s Egypt It was the pre eminent city of the early Muslim era and the historic legacy of that time is a district of medieval Islamic architecture unrivaled anywhere in the world The powerhouse of the modern economy it is the city s role as a venue for peace talks a focus for the Arab countries of the near east and home of the Arab Council that is invaluable in these diplomatically uncertain times But tourism is the country s modern lifeblood and not just as a result of our insatiable thirst for history The seas that lap Egypt s arid shores hide pristine marine ecosystems that have lured scuba divers from the inception of the sport Package tourists soon followed and today the coastline of Egypt is turning into a year round playground With daytime temperatures rarely dropping below the high sixties and almost continuous sunshine it makes a welcome retreat from the drab northern European winters and a scorching alternative to temperate summers The authorities have been quick to respond allowing hotels and other facilities to develop though care must be taken not to blight the delicate environment in the rush to turn the resorts into Euroland Not everything in the garden is rosy of course With poverty and unemployment rising along with foreign debt and Islamic fundamentalists spurning negotiation and resorting to violence Hosny Mubarak the nation s president since 1980 has enormous problems to solve But with a foot in so many camps past and present east and west religious and secular Egypt should be well placed to withstand the vagaries of modern life and grow in wealth and influence in the coming years The kingdom of the Pharaohs has many more eras of history to add yet
