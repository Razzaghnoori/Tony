 Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Be Fruity and Multiply Be Fruitful and Multiply by Steven E Landsburg makes no sense He argues that refraining from having a child may impoverish those who would have been your child s friends and mates But that wouldn t be the case if the parents of those potential children also refrained from reproducing Also there are over 5 billion people on earth surely more than enough to provide everyone with potential friends And one does not tend to encounter small acts of kindness between strangers in overcrowded cities Chris Ryan Make Love Make War The article Be Fruitful and Multiply by Steven E Landsburg explores a key area in the search for new directions in economics the connection to biology Unfortunately it is likely to sow considerable confusion by suggesting that an individual could or should add value to humankind through additional reproduction Reproduction is not guided by a moral imperative toward humanity as a whole but by a competitive struggle to pass on genes This includes the effort to give one s progeny the power to pass genes even further hence family names mansions and monuments But as the species grows to fill its biological space nature itself provides limiting forces like single lifestyles wars and famines Paul Kailor Steven E Landsburg replies Chris Ryan thinks that among the 5 billion people on earth he has more than enough friends Good for him Surely he s aware that there are others less fortunate Among all his many friends is there none for example who has had difficulty finding a friend who will make a suitable marriage partner Paul Kailor says that reproduction is not guided by a moral imperative toward humanity That was exactly my point If they were guided by moral imperatives people would have more children than they do In the absence of those moral imperatives there s a case for subsidizing reproduction FashionSense 2 0 I was greatly encouraged to see Michael Goff s proposal of a Microsoft fashion upgrade strategy titled Dressing Up the Nerds The development of Microsoft FashionSense 2 0 is long overdue and I for one would like to offer my services as a volunteer beta tester I agree that your initial ramp up strategy of having everyone wear more black is an excellent starting point It will be especially helpful to inexperienced FashionSense users many of whom are likely to encounter usability issues related to the color coordination decision making process You may want to clarify however that polar fleece is not a recognized attribute of FashionSense in any color As you move through your first product cycle you may also want to consider some of the following additional features or revisions 1 As Microsoft employee time is at a premium and offsites are quite expensive you may wish to consider having Barneys perform weekly on site seminars instead Preferably these would be held between 9 and 11 p m to accommodate everyday activities such as feature cutting server breakdowns office moves cross divisional re orgs and the like Right before ship dates these seminars could be held between 11 p m and midnight to provide additional convenience for employees attempting to finish their daily tasks 2 You might want to add Birkenstocks to your list of footwear banned between Labor Day and Memorial Day Wearing Birkenstocks with dresses should be prohibited at all times 3 Small VR glasses headsets would make both a chic high tech alternative to sunglasses and provide users with something additional to do during discussions of SQL server and ODBC connection failures 4 Increased revenue potential may also be realized by leveraging existing Microsoft Money technologies to create direct debit relationships between approved fashion vendors and Microsoft employees stock accounts Thank you for your attention to these suggestions I look forward to further status reports of this product s development and am certain that you will do a fine job in your implementation Kerry Carnahan Toot Liu I was impressed with Eric Liu s article on Asian Americans Feng Shui America With the current demonization of Asian Americans it was refreshing to find an informed Asian American voice here After having lived in Hong Kong for five years I was shocked upon my recent arrival in New York While Asian influences are being bandied about there is clearly a backlash against Asian Americans especially the Chinese Also all Asian Americans like Latin Americans are effectively lumped into one group by mainstream America It s as blinding as saying that French German English and Spanish cultures are all alike I welcome more of what Slate has offered thought provoking and unsung viewpoints Andrew Ingkavet Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com
