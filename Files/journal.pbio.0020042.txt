                            During the last few years we have seen enormous strides in our abilities to sequence        genomes and the information that has poured out of these sequences is quite astonishing        With more than  complete genome sequences now available and many laboratories rushing        into microarray analysis proteomic initiatives and even systems biology it seems an        appropriate time to consider not just the opportunities those sequences present but also        their shortcomings By far the most serious problem is the quality and degree of        completeness of the annotation of those genomes Most troublesome are the large numbers of        open reading frames that have been identified by computer programs but remain labeled as a        conserved hypothetical protein when they occur in more than one genome or simply a        hypothetical protein when they appear unique to the genome in question Between them        these two categories of annotated open reading frames often represent more than half of the        potential proteincoding regions of a genome        These annotations highlight just one portion of our ignorance about the information        content of genomes and our lack of fundamental knowledge about the function of so many of        the building blocks of cells Unless we rectify this situation it is likely to undermine        many of the other omic efforts currently underway Here I advocate a rather        straightforward approach to address this problemfocused initially on the bacterial        genomes In contrast to the numerous proposals for big science initiatives to understand        the fundamental workings of biological organisms I propose a small science relatively        lowtech approach that could have a dramatic pay off A relatively small investment could        yield a massive amount of information that would greatly enhance our current efforts to use        genomic approaches to study life                    Initial Proposal        The initial proposal is directed at deciphering the role of the hypothetical proteins        encoded in the microbial genomes and would involve a communitywide approach to determine        the function of these hypotheticals based on solid oldfashioned biochemistry The essence        of the idea is to undertake an interdisciplinary effort that couples our current        bioinformatics capabilities to predict protein function with a directed exploration by        experimental laboratories to test those predictions I would encourage a consortium of        bioinformaticians to produce a list of all of the conserved hypothetical proteins that are        found in multiple genomes to carry out the best possible bioinformatics analysis and then        to offer those proteins to the biochemical community as potential targets for research into        their function To energize laboratories with appropriate expertise to participate in this        communitywide effort I suggest that a special program be set up by one or more of the        funding agencies so that laboratories undertaking the investigation of any particular        protein receive a small grant upfront as a supplement to an existing grant Upon completion        of the project and the identification of the function they would receive a further        supplement to that grant as a reward In this way one might hope to rally some of the best        biochemical talent and apply it to this problem of determining function for a wide range of        new proteins The cost of such an operation could be quite minimal and the bureaucracy and        review process could be equally simple Here is a case where a modest infusion of funds        could greatly enhance our ability to annotate both existing and new genome sequences and        ensure that our current investments in genomic sequences yield the richest biological        harvest possible There are two key steps in the proposed plan                    Key Steps        The first step is to encourage some bioinformaticians with appropriate expertise in the        functional annotation of genomes to form a consortium and undertake the assembly of a list        of prime targets for which an experimental demonstration of function would be most        valuable Three general classes of such genes come to mind  The conserved hypothetical        genes These belong to the set of genes that have orthologs in many other genomes but for        which no function has been experimentally determined in any case A recent success among        such genes is illustrated in Box   The hypothetical genes These form the set of genes        that are predicted to be protein coding but that lack similar genes in any other organism        in GenBank They too have no assigned function  The misannotated genes These genes        are ones for which a function has been assigned but for which there is a good reason to        believe the annotation is incorrect        These sets of targets would be combined and arranged into a prioritized list in which        each was accompanied by the best assessment of potential function The priorities would be        based on which genes were most likely to prove broadly informative For instance a        conserved hypothetical gene that occurred in most genomes would be of higher priority than        one that had only two orthologs The list would be on a public Web site where these targets        and the predicted functions could be examined and modified by alternative or additional        predictions from other groups to guide future experimentation As function was derived        that information could be presented and the target removed from the main list        The second step would be to invite experimentalists to peruse the list and find those        potential genes whose protein products might lie within their realm of expertise so that        they could use their experimental knowledge and reagents to quickly test for function        Initially I would advocate allowing laboratory teams to pick and choose among the list and        sign up to study just one of these open reading frames I would recommend allowing one        laboratory per open reading frame in the initial stages A laboratory wishing to sign up        would generate a short document highlighting why its expertise might be suitable for a        particular protein A onepage proposal should suffice with no experimental plan demanded        At this point a small panel could choose among competing efforts and the laboratory chosen        would be given a small grant and up to six months to carry out its analysis If it was        successful in delineating the function of their target protein a paper would be written        and submitted for peer review If the paper was accepted for publication then an        additional sum would be allocated as a supplement to the laboratorys existing grant If        after six months a laboratory had not managed to delineate the function it would submit a        short report describing the approaches that have been tried with the results of its        analyses This would be posted on the public Web site and that target would then become        open for analysis by other laboratories under the same conditions as before        While the initial list of target genes should probably be based on a wellstudied and        experimentally tractable organism such as         Escherichia coli  I would not demand that the biochemical        experiments be done on the         E coli gene Any of the orthologs would do so long as the        similarity was sufficiently strong to give high expectations that function would be        conserved In fact for a laboratory that happened to be already working on one of the        homologs this program might provide an added bonus and greatly speed its work I would        also encourage both biochemical and genetic approaches since one can never be certain when        one method might be better than another The list would of course also include conserved        genes not found in         E coli  but commonly distributed in other genomes In        particular I would make a pitch for including all genes in         Mycoplasma genitalium  which as the freeliving organism with        the fewest genes might be the most suitable as a model system for indepth understanding        of its biology                    The Importance of Community        This proposal for experimental attack on hypothetical genes is really a very traditional        approach that becomes largescale simply because of the parallel nature of the        implementation It resembles the successful approach used by the Europeans to achieve the        complete sequence of the         Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome Goffeau et al  The        results would significantly increase our functional knowledge of the genes within the        microbial genomes thus far sequenced Such annotation would be immediately applicable        across orthologs and could dramatically improve the value of the sequenced genomes This        in turn would facilitate our ability to annotate new genomes as they appear The proposal        also reinforces the notion that the overwhelming value of bioinformatics is to generate        hypotheses that can be tested experimentally By enabling the community to join in this        effort we would also demonstrate that science really is the collaborative enterprise that        requires all of our contributions not just a select few Finally if this initiative        succeeds it would serve as a suitable model from which to begin the more daunting task of        trying to annotate the functions of the complex eukaryotic genomes such as the human        genome
