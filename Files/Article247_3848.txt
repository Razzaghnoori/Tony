                                 Write Two Pages and Call Me in the Morning                        Good morning Jesse            An article from the Chicago Tribune  reprinted in the San JoseMercury News  refers to a study reported in the Journal of the AmericanMedical Association that concludes writing may be beneficial for yourhealth Now thats what I call news According to JAMA  physiciansconducting the study asked subjects suffering from acute asthma or fromrheumatoid arthritis to write for  minutes a day for three consecutive daysThey were asked not to concern themselves with the niceties of spellingpunctuation and so on They were told instead just write and write and writewhat we call in the profession freewriting I suppose            A significant number of study subjects reported that their symptoms improvedwith writing This of course is good news But even better is the prospect thatfuture studies may go on to show that writing may actually cure much of whatails us except for writinginduced ailments like carpal tunnel syndrome or ifyoure still using a pencil writers bumpthat unsightly callus on your indexfinger caused by holding a writing implement            Im not sure what the controls were for the JAMA study Were an equalnumber of volunteers asked to not write for  minutes for three consecutivedays Did their symptoms then worsen or remain the same I know my ownsymptoms would worsen if I were told not to write since I write all the timeBut lets look at this                   Slate                discussion for an example ofhealthful praxis Im writing for more than  minutes twice a day for whatwill be four days Should I be taking my pulse and blood pressure regularlyShould I not use my inhaler Actually I do have an inhaler but seldom needto use it What should I expect to see happening To whom do I report theresults Will my HMO cover this            OK you get my drift Im not convinced that writing holds promise as aprophylactic There have been a number of scientific studies like this onethat deal with languagerelated subjects but that are not really linguisticstudies A few years back hey this is still on topicIm an English teacherso I should know there was some discussion in the press about the discoveryof a grammar gene by neurologists This was based on a study of an extendedMontreal family many of whose members exhibited certain curiosities in theirgrammar They could not form certain kinds of sentences couldnt answerquestions couldnt write clearly and so on It was held in these popularreports that the discovery of the shared defective gene seen to cause thesymptoms would eventually lead to a cure not only for dyslexia but for freshmancompositionperhaps even for government prose Guess what folks It didnthappen It seems that writing and grammar are too complex to be controlled bya single gene And disease is too complex Im guessing to be palliated byjournal writing            That is not to say that people dont or wont find writing to be beneficialAs an English teacher and a linguist and a writer Ive been advocatingwriting as good mental exercise for as long as I can remember Of course I wasa sickly child and one who wrote all the time What does that tell us Nothingabout writing or health actually            But once people read about the physical benefits that accrue from writingIm sure that writing clinics will spring up in California land of all goodfads or if the JAMA study is discredited and writing clinics areoutlawed then they will spring up in Mexico I predict that the sick will makea pilgrimage to these clinics perhaps even swarming to our own writersworkshop where student writers get help with their termpaper assignmentsWill writing become a remedy of the desperate like grapefruit diets coffeeenemas Krebiozen copper braceletsor does it work more like meditationprayer or even beta carotenes Will the FDA start controlling writing Willthere be minimum recommended doses Warning labels on keyboards            I guess Im satisfied that writing is good for you wont cure a thing andanyway writers seem not to have a choice in the matter To paraphrase thewords of Gene Kelly we just gotta write gotta write             BestDennis
