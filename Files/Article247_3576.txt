 Journalistic Integrity and Other Oxymorons I ll do you one better Let s pose as guidebook writers and get someone else to pick up the tab for our visit to Niagara I ll impersonate the Lonely Planet writer and recommend seeing the Falls the authentic way by barrel It s true that listening to a guidebook s cheerleading gets tiresome But a travel guide full of panned restaurants is useless If a book doesn t like a place they shouldn t list it The exception of course is in small towns or isolated locales e g Liberty Island where a forgettable restaurant or hotel might be the only option Another factor that discourages negative reviews is the risk of a libel suit The real problem is that none of the guides sift through all the stuff and tell you what s right for whom Even in a general guidebook there s room for specialization the best green spots the best museums and galleries etc Fodor s has suggested itineraries Access and Frommer s have rating systems but it still seems that you ve got to read the entire book to make sure you re not missing something that you d enjoy and that can be wearisome no matter how well they re written When I worked for Let s Go editors cobbled together a list of restaurants hostels and hotels and sent them complimentary service vouchers which they would sign and return Researchers could then visit the establishments anonymously and present the voucher when the bill arrived This method does prevent preferential treatment but I do think that a free lunch can compromise your review whether your employer or the restaurant pays footing the bill is an integral part of the dining experience and it s harder if only slightly to rate the value of a meal someone else buys In general though I ve found travel writers to be honorable folk And even the unscrupulous are more interested in eating for free in restaurants they have no intention of listing than in taking kickbacks from low quality establishments in exchange for inclusion One way or another the interests of the readership are served It s wrong to say that these guides don t take reader feedback into account Lonely Planet and Let s Go usually acknowledge the readers who wrote them helpful letters in the back pages of the book This feature is strangely absent from my New York Lonely Planet but the most recent edition of LP s India book has four pages of readers names Zagat s may be good for finding a culinary sure thing but you ll have to stand on line with the rest of New York or in line with the rest of Chicago And I think it s na ve to use their ratings as an absolute measure of restaurant quality Locals have different interests attitudes and palates than tourists and would be accordingly harsher on theme restaurants And before taking Fodor s to task for praising Michael Jordan s chops admit it You ve got to look pretty hard to find a bad steak in Chicago As for theme restaurants in general they re merely indicative of the fact that a lot of people travel with their children The theme restaurant as a pacifier is a stroke of genius The overdone d cor gives the short of attention plenty to gawk at The food is bland enough for even the most finicky adolescent palate And celebrity sponsorship is a behavioral modification technique rivaling Santa Claus Kids shape up quick if you can con them into thinking that Michael Jordan or Sly Stallone might show up at any minute Mediocre food at inflated prices is I imagine a small price to pay for the respite these restaurants provide for the harried parent and guidebook writers feel duty bound to include them All the same Lonely Planet gets extra credit for noting that the Harley Davidson Caf is so commercial the menu s available for sale at 10 Having spent so much time defending my former colleagues I m afraid I ve left you little new to work with I d still like an explanation Why are Frommer s New York titles multiplying when the Web should be pushing them into extinction Jodi I doubt that I ve done much to advance the science of travel guide writing but I ve thoroughly enjoyed our discussion Rumor has it that Walter Cronkite is opening his own theme restaurant on West 57th Street We ll toast your safe return to New York with a Sloe gin That s the way it fizz complimentary I hope
