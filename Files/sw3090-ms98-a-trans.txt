                okay um well do you uh keep a family budget or or do you have some   no i dont use a family budget my father whos very old has kept one his entire life and i probably rebelled rebelled against it and probably should have kept one he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out   uhhuh     oh interesting   on a very strict percentage   yes well um we sort of started doing it years and years ago and my husband started graduate school when we were first married and i sort of just got in the habit i guess and you know and never have gotten out of it i cant really say that its a formal budget its more just a a pretty um a fairly uh accurate accurate um recording of what i spend and what i think im going to have to spend and   right   i think it makes much more sense and ive recently uh   yeah   gotten out of debt and everything and ill probably keeping start keeping a little better track of it i just uh   yeah yeah   spent whatever came in and and uh didnt never knew what came in what went out but uh just you know like about like the government runs   right yeah  sounds real similar   huh so i think its probably better to have some sort of a a at least a record but my dads was so precise that i mean if it said to spend eleven percent on something thats what it was spent and   um oh my yeah   that was put over there and i mean uh of course hes from the depression and uh   yes   so uh you know its his life but uh i i would i think itd be smart if somebody would keep uh   sure   some sort of a plan that works for them   yeah i think youre right um well it it whats been sort of interesting to us is to um it because since i have uh pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years i guess i can go back and look and its real fun to just see what how things have changed over the years uh for instance   yeah it is  im a historian and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty seven and   my goodness   but he burned the ones from twenty seven to fifty i couldnt believe he did that but then so i took the ones from fifty two on to the present but   oh dear yes   to look to have looked back into the twenties and thirties and forties it would have been fantastic to see that but uh   oh yes well as a matter of fact uh my mother was going through some things uh not long long ago i guess its been a couple of years ago  in an old trunk that she had and she came upon a budget a budget book that shed had back in the thirties uh when they it was the late well i guess it would have been i take that back it must have been the forties because they had been married uh probably fifteen years at the time   umhum   and it was just fascinating uh fascinating to see how little things cost i mean it was it was just almost laughable in some instances that you know of course its all relative of course but   oh i know right right   uh never the less it was fun to see those figures next to you know for a price pair of shoes was uh like five dollars and   i know well even in nineteen sixty three i found a a record that i had  had traveled in Europe a lot and i what id paid for hotels   um   and a similar hotel in Paris is two hundred dollars a night now and i paid uh oh between four and five dollars in nineteen sixty and thats really crazy because thats about thirty years ago   oh oh isnt that something really oh that is that is really really something   oh but but of course its just what the marketll bear and if people if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten you know yeah   thats true yeah thats good thats right thats exactly thats just good old economics working   right right that   well uh weve tried to uh instill some sense some sense of uh of budgeting in our kids but our two children are just uh as um unlike as night night and day and our son could care less about a budget and our daughter watches her pennies so closely that   umhum   she almost she almost just sounds like your father i mean she has everything planned so closely closely that if something goes wrong it just throws her for a loop   umhum umhum yeah well then you never know how theyll one they they may switch flip flop when they get to be uh older well older the other one may be very careful and   yes right yes yes   she may marry somebody and of course itd be good because if you marry somebody a little loose then shell have that stability of watching uh you should have one in the in the in the house and i think   yeah i think thats true i and and its i kind of think thats sort of what happened in our house because i think my husband was not quite as uh good at saving and so on before we got married and i was i was really diligent about that i always putting money aside and when before i was married you know when i was working in and out of college and   yeah   uh that really paid off because when it time came for him to go back to graduate school we were in in in fairly good good shape financially as far as not having many major debts and   yeah thats about the way it is here if it hadnt been for my wife i would have probably been in debtors prison if we had one   yeah     so but uh what does you husband do now   well uh he is an engineer hes uh an electrical engineer and in fact went through uh many years of graduate school and got his PhD so we had a a lot of lot of years of budgeting   oh um oh yeah you have to do it when youre in school my wifes still in school getting her doctorate and so i it it and ive got   and you know yeah when you uh yes well im working im working on my masters degree now so in fact this last year we had three two both of the children were in college our son has a year left our daughter graduated this year and im uh just about ready to finish my masters degree so   um um   weve had uh once again you know some really a real lean year for us   oh i i know we had three in college plus my wife so that was four so were both in the same   but uh yep yeah you know exactly what its what its like then and its uh   yeah yeah   which you learn i guess you figure that thats an investment that is um really a invaluable invaluable umhum yeah and   thats the best one yeah with education you cant take that away from you   thats right so its its one that you can live through and i think that thats way we looked at it in our beginnings when my husband was in graduate school is that there was a light at the end of that tunnel you know that   right sure   that it was worth it to save and then not have uh something and uh in return know that something  better was going to be at the end of it so uh it really makes it easier but uh well ive enjoyed talking with you Jay   yeah thats true yeah i have enjoyed talking wit h you Kathy   and i i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life because that sounds really fascinating to me im interested in that   well if i had your address id send you i am also in the travel business i do tours and i can take some real great tours to Europe so uh if you   oh oh wow well my my husband and i just were there last year um actually we didnt take a tour we we were in England and and uh went to Ireland and Scotland and just rented cars and and did it on our own but   yeah   um i uh that sounds interesting do is your business in Dallas then   yeah its in Dallas its here in
