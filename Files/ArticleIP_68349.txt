 Gore Takes Round 1 Al Gore and Bill Bradley faced off Wednesday night in the first debate of 2000 Here s a play by play analysis of the debate s key themes and exchanges 1 Ball control In football your opponent can t score unless he has the ball Therefore the longer you keep possession of the ball the more likely you are to win the game Gore is killing Bradley in this department by staying on the attack Let s look at three plays from the debate a Moderator Peter Jennings asks each man whether his opponent has ever taken a vote of yours or a quote out of context Bradley says yes Gore dances around the question I haven t complained about any I won t accuse him of that then finally says no Bradley gives the honest answer but Gore gives the smart one Normally when you re invited to accuse your opponent of something the smart course is to accept the offer But look more closely Jennings is inviting you to accuse your opponent of accusing you of something You re the one ultimately being accused Suppose you say you re angry that your opponent has accused you of kicking your dog Some viewers after turning off their televisions will think your opponent is a vicious liar But most will wonder whether you kick your dog By saying no Gore avoids this trap Bradley however walks into it He faults Gore for suggesting that I was going to hurt African Americans and Latinos with my health care program and that I am going to destroy Medicaid without saying what it is going to be replaced with Bradley explains why Gore s charge is unfair but Gore gets to repeat and elaborate on the accusation Medicaid is eliminated and they re given instead a little 150 a month voucher Not a single health plan can be purchased for anything close to 150 a month Bradley explains that his 150 is a weighted average not a cap But Gore tells a joke making fun of weighted average as a nerdy weasel word Gore is lying about the cap and the voucher But politically he wins the round because both men end up spending several minutes discussing the principal charge against Bradley without discussing any of the charges against Gore b Another panelist asks each candidate whether you have ever had to make a difficult decision that you knew would hurt you politically Bradley picks a vote on which he differed from most of my Democratic colleagues Gore however picks two votes on which he differed specifically from Bradley President Reagan s budget cuts I wish that Bill had stood up to that one and the authorization to use force in the Persian Gulf on which Bradley voted no Bradley answers the question at face value Gore uses it to land two good punches c Each candidate is invited to ask a question of the other Bradley asks Gore why he isn t proposing universal health insurance coverage Gore neutralizes the question and turns it on Bradley Both of us have proposed the same goal high quality health care for all says Gore I devoted 374 billion to the solvency of Medicare You have not devoted one penny to ensuring the solvency of Medicare And my question to you is Why not Bradley complains that it s not Gore s time to ask questions But Jennings replies that Gore can ask the question and Bradley never gets off a solid answer to it 2 Gore s credibility problem Gore makes lots of allegations about Bradley s past votes and future plans To sustain those allegations Gore needs to husband his credibility The best way to do this is to admit the truth when it s disadvantageous to him He begins by making such a concession about the 1996 Democratic fund raising scandal It was wrong And I think that the phone calls that I made were a mistake But as the debate goes on Gore repeatedly strains credulity He asks New Hampshire voters to give me a come from behind upset victory here and then after Bradley points out the absurdity of Gore s plea Al your underdog pitch brings tears to my eyes Gore repeats his claim that it would be an upset victory Yes if Gore wins New Hampshire he could argue that it s an upset And yes he needs the media to buy into that assumption But saying it so baldly and then repeating it is counterproductive Gore does this all the time risky tax scheme no controlling legal authority etc and seems incapable of controlling the habit The problem is not that he comes off as a talking points robot which he does but that he insults everyone s intelligence He looks like a suck up student who thinks he can get a good grade by parroting the professor s buzzwords When he calls Republican tax cuts a tax scheme and calls his hypothetical New Hampshire victory an upset you get the feeling not only that he s twisting the truth but also that he thinks you re too stupid to realize it And the deeper that feeling sinks in the less attention voters will pay to anything Gore says 3 Bradley s arrogance problem If Gore s flaw is dishonesty Bradley s flaw is moral and intellectual vanity Bradley began the campaign determined to convey his virtue and wisdom and he succeeded Now his problem is that he can t turn it off The more he equates his candidacy with goodness and enlightenment and the more condescendingly he dismisses Gore Let me explain to you Al how the private sector works I can say that in much shorter words the more voters wonder whether Bradley knows his limits and is capable of learning from his mistakes Gore recognizing this Achilles heel goes after it with a crowbar Reciting Bradley s votes for the Reagan budget cuts against welfare reform and against the use force in the Persian Gulf Gore asks Would you vote differently on any of those three votes if you had it to do over again Were they mistakes Bradley replies that they weren t and Gore pounces on this answer I think all three were mistakes but I m not going to debate the details My point is beyond that Bill In all those words about the three different votes one word I didn t hear was the word mistake And here s why I think that is important I think our country deserves a president who when he makes a mistake is willing to acknowledge it and willing to learn from it because I believe that the presidency is not an academic exercise It s not an extended seminar on theory If I make a mistake I ll do my best to own up to it and then to learn from it and learn from you the audience about how we can deal with the reality as we find it Eventually Bradley remembers something he admits was a mistake I voted against Alan Greenspan the first time and everybody laughs But Gore has found a big chink in Bradley s armor He has found three votes on which Bradley took unpopular positions and he has found that when pressed about those votes Bradley exposes a character trait that puts off many voters If history is any guide Gore will exploit that dilemma for the rest of the campaign But if Gore doesn t learn to stop talking like a used car salesman nobody s going to be listening
