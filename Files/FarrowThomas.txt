 One of my first memories uh occurred when I was about four years old I was living uh right outside of St Louis between Jefferson City and St Louis MO Um my parents had a small house on a very friendly suburban street and ah one summer day I remember going out to the back of our yard which seemed really big then Uh I reached into my parents small garden it had quite a few tomatoes in it and I just started lobbing the tomatoes over the fence and I kept lobbing the tomatoes over the fence and then my next door neighbor who was probably about four my playmate at the time he rode his Big Wheel down the down the hill there and came and started throwing the tomatoes with me and we were just having a great time not thinking about anything laughing having a lot of fun Then dad had to spoil it all He came he opened the door and I remember looking back and seeing the expression on his face and I could tell that he was disappointed He wasn t happy with me but I wasn t I wasn t really sure if what I had done was really really wrong I just knew that he wasn t very happy about what was going on by the way he opened the door and by the way he told me I needed to come into the house and I I came over there and I stepped up and I didn t even say Bye to my friend and was probably not into that kind of thing I didn t really notice at that time probably I just went into the house And Dad said he had noticed he had seen me throwing tomatoes in Mrs Faulk s yard so he told me that I was in trouble and I was going to get a spanking and um I was kind of uh uh looking for an out so I was smart enough to say Hey Dad Before you give me a spanking why don t you just let me have one big glass of chocolate milk first So anyway Dad goes and makes this nice big glass of chocolate milk for me I m not even sure why he did it but I spent so much time drinking that chocolate milk it was I must have had that chocolate milk to my face for 20 minutes and for some reason you know Dad was telling me you know talking to me about uh you know what what I had done and you know how it was wrong I remember yeah I remember that based on later conversations that I with him about it but at the time I guess I really wasn t sure what it was about but I knew that when it all came down to the bottom of it I knew that what I had done was the wrong thing to do and he told me that I m going to probably have to go down there and help Mrs Faulk pick up the tomatoes when it s all said and done and I remember being a little bit nervous about that I didn t really know Mrs Faulk very well she was about 80 and ah she was a nice person I had seen her a few times but I was really nervous about that It was probably the first thing I remember from being a little kid about ah especially about something that I d done wrong Ah another thing that happened there that I thought was interesting was one of the first memories of my sister and that was in that very same backyard There was a ah a rose garden back there and my sister it s ironic her middle name is Rose Her name is Christy Rose Farrow and she was back there with me and we re going back and seeing these roses and Christy was smelling the roses and she started to put the petals up her nose and I remember watching her put the petals up there and I remember watching her put the petals up her nose and I wasn t really sure why she was doing it I didn t really ask any questions I just thought it was interesting that she was putting the petals up her nose and it kind of became fun to kind of cheer her into keep doing it so I was like keeping going keep going Yes This is great you know and she s stuffing the petals up there and I didn t really know of any consequences I don t think I was just kind of I was about four or four and a half and I remember stuffing those petals up her nose and I thought it was great and then Mom comes down and she was really disappointed in both of us I think she was most unhappy with me because you know ah ah Christy was only one or one and a half or two and I was the big brother so from there I guess I remembered mom being upset with me because ah Christy had all those petals up her nose and it took a long time to take them out there was a lot of them up there but ah later on as I grew older we moved around a lot when I was a kid I remember the first day I woke up and there was a moving truck One day I woke up and there was a moving truck in my in my yard and I woke up to this sound of that and I looked out the window and there s this moving truck and there s people moving stuff in and I got up and I said Mom they re taking our stuff and I was and she was like Yes we re moving today and I was about four going on five at the time and so they re taking our stuff out so anyway we moved and they took all our stuff out and moved and she said you know I told you we re moving You must have forgot and I must have because it totally took me by surprise and we ended up at a new place and I remember this this new house that we were at and ah in a pretty area and it had a much bigger yard than the one I remembered a long driveway and it was surrounded by woods it was really nice area in Arnold MO and um basically it was such a shock because when we first got there Mom said Today s your first day of school and apparently I had forgot about that too and I started to get really nervous about that We were watching something on TV I can t remember what it was but I suddenly got really nervous that I was about to go to school for the first time and that was probably the most stressful day of my life I had forgotten that I was moving to a new place and I had forgotten that I was uh going to be going to school That was that was a pretty scary day Um then we moved to a new house Ah oops I m covering the same stuff Ah fourth grade was a lot of fun I like to laugh I was probably just laugh about anything I remember some of my friends I remember one time when I went to lunch and I always had this Pac Man lunchbox pull out this Pac Man lunchbox and I would that I was so proud of and you know do my thing and I would be talking so much and laughing about the stupidest things that I wouldn t even I wouldn t even eat my lunch I would just laugh the whole time and one time I did it so much that I never even opened my lunch out of the bag and it was like a minute before a minute before lunch was over and the teacher the P E teacher came up to me and he said Look this is horrible Thomas This is just you know Look you re in trouble You re not eating your lunch come with him so I went he I had to follow him and remember being really nervous and he sat me down a corner and he told me I had to sit there until I ate all my lunch and I remember um crying for a long time and I think that basically what happened there was that was just an amazing mood swing because I went from being extremely happy and I was extremely sad It was an amazing mood swing I think that s why I remember that Um when I was young we used to go on a lot of yearly vacations Every year we d go from whether it be MO to IL or IO to IL or KS to IL the whole time I was growing up because in IL that s where my grandparents lived and every year we d go up there and spend about a week with them in the summer and we d also go down there for Christmas too but mostly I remember going down there every year um for the summer and it was ah a lot of arguing in the car and I remember sitting next to my uh I had two sisters so the middle one was always in the middle for some reason She was she was uh the middle one s always in the middle What I mean by that is that she s the next down she was like two two years younger that me then the other one is three years younger than me so uh basically you know you know she would always sit next to me and we d get so mad I remember my dad swinging directly behind him at us all the time because we d always be fighting One thing that she really had as a great defense Was she would eat peanut butter cups and she knows that I hate the smell of peanut butter so she would actually eat the peanut butter cup and then breathe in my face and there wasn t really any way for me to defend against that because I couldn t think of any food that she really thought stunk and you know it was like it was it was untouchable there wasn t anything I could do about that so I would I would get really mad at that and I d say Mom Mom and she would say you know She s just breathing so there was really no way out of it so I remember a lot of that So when I was in when I was at grandma and grandpa s house we used to have a great time just fishing and hanging out with grandpa and my cousins would go there and every Fourth of July we d do fireworks Um it was on the river and it was ah it was very peaceful Um my grandparents were always very very loving people and some of my parents were and we d just have a great time down there And some of my best memories were um at the Fox River in IL with my grandparents Um um another memory with my family that I have is that we had a lot of weddings ah and these weddings were always really big weddings and I ve always been told the reason why they re so big is because basically it s Polish you know Half of my family s Polish so Polish we have big weddings and I remember at my cousin s wedding I was like 12 years old going to it and I had a my cousin Tim and he was about 10 and ah we went to this wedding and it has like 200 people My uncle he s a great guy He s also really big into the Hell s Angels and he brought about 50 of his friends to it and the wedding took place in a hotel one of those classic areas where you have you have the weddings and it was ah basically a really stormy night real stormy and the power went out and it was open bar so now we ve got ah 50 Hell s Angels no power and it s the middle a summer so it is getting really hot in there you know there s there s no lights so you know there s a few emergency power lights that people brought ah and they had some sort of battery they were using for the ah for the radio system and it was it was getting really crazy in there because we had Hell s Angels running around without shirts on uh people highly intoxicated I remember by 10 year old cousin saying Bottom s up Thomas Bottoms up and the reason it was bottoms up was because was they serve champagne to everybody in these weddings that s something I can never figure out and if you re a kid you get champagne if you re an adult you get champagne Everybody gets champagne and some people don t drink it so what s left the kids drink so we were going around drinking all this champagne And before you know it it s time for the kids Hula Hoop contest and they ve got a stage of course there they do it s one of those huge areas and ah we get up there and they re playing this tune I can t remember what it was and Tim and I were up there and Tim my 10 year old cousin is really drunk and he fell completely off the stage I remember that being somewhat embarrassing but looking back on it I think it s really pretty funny um it was uh it was a really neat experience
