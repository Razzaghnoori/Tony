 Madeira and the Madeirans A mere speck in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean Madeira has all the elements of a mysterious dream world The volcanic island is thickly draped with vegetation a colorful riot of flowers and fruit trees Rugged mountains peek through the clouds and microclimates hover over isolated villages Spectacular cliffs crash hundreds of feet below to the deep blue surf Even though foreign invaders stormed Portugal around 2000 b c Madeira was discovered only a few decades before Columbus made his way to America Though part of the Portuguese empire since the great expedition teams of the 15th century claimed it for King Jo o I Madeira is nearer to Africa than Lisbon It lies 600 km 375 miles off the coast of Morocco and nearly 1 000 km 600 miles southwest of the Portuguese capital Formed from volcanic eruptions many millions of years ago Madeira like the Canary Islands is an archipelago The land is like an iceberg massive mountains poke through the clouds forming the mere tip of a submerged mass Only one other island in the small group is inhabited the little known arid and much flatter holiday hideaway of Porto Santo Christopher Columbus visited Porto Santo in the second half of the 15th century marrying the local governor s daughter Few places on earth can rival Madeira s wealth of natural gifts especially in so small an area The island is blanketed with flowers birds of paradise their beak like flowers bright orange blossom in open fields Fragrant hydrangeas line walking paths skirting the edges of mountain terraces Private and public gardens burst with orchids bougainvillea and jacarandas while orchards heave with mangoes passion fruit watermelons and avocados In the mountains water streams down from unseen springs a one hour walk might take you past half a dozen waterfalls The cold waters around the island once prime whaling territory are today a marine sanctuary for whales dolphins and seals And all of this in year round sub tropical spring weather with a southerly breeze and temperatures averaging 22 C in summer and 17 C in winter Madeira seems much larger than its diminutive size just 57 km 35 miles long and 22 km 13 miles wide The terrain is so mountainous and its roads so tortuous that distances are magnified in terms of both time and effort This can breed insularity some villagers have never been as far as Funchal and the thought of making the long trip to the mainland is even more remote Yet young and upwardly mobile islanders do go off in search of fortune and the most successful return from Brazil Venezuela or South Africa to build sumptuous villas overlooking the Bay of Funchal Madeira alas is no simple portrait of a Gauguin like tropical paradise With a history of emigration and return of welcoming visiting merchants and seafarers and during a brief period of occupation a garrison of British troops islanders are a cosmopolitan mix The populace is an engaging stew of dark North African complexions and blonde blue eyed northern Europeans Funchal the island s capital major harbor and only city of any note merely hints at Madeira s riches The capital s white houses and tile roofs are clustered on picturesque hills sloping down to a steep bay which makes for a pretty picture The city is undeniably pleasant but its noise and traffic don t seem so far removed from the more conveniently located places most people come here to avoid Almost half of Madeira s 270 000 people live in Funchal pronounced foon shawl and cruise ship passengers stride ashore daily for a frenzied flurry of sightseeing and shopping Other visitors kick back in luxury hotels crowding the city s western seafront In recent years a gleaming new high rise zona turista has sprung up to confront the old world hotels and distinguished quintas rural estates of Madeira s more peaceful past Funchal is less the sum of Ma deira though than a gateway to the rest of the island whose real charms begin in the hillsides just a few minutes outside of town Spectac ular gardens like the Botanic Garden and Quinta do Palheiro are only a short bus or taxi ride from the capital Small scale agriculture dominates the island s land scape employing about a fifth of the people De pend ing on the altitude and wheth er you happen to be on the warm south coast or the marginally cooler north coast you will see terraces of bananas and vines that produce the grapes for fortified Madeira wine There are windswept mountain peaks craggy cliffs that plummet to the sea and emerald valleys that could be stand ins for Ireland or Scotland From strategically situated lookout points mira douros you can take in these magical panoramas and look down upon villages carved out of the mountains at least one so isolated it only began to receive TV signals in the late 1980s Driving a car along the hairpin curves on mountain roads and coastal lanes getting sprayed by waterfalls and constantly rewarded with spectacular vistas can be an exhilarating experience but Madeira is best viewed by getting out of the car or bus and exploring on two feet The island is heaven for anyone who enjoys being outside whether your taste runs to gentle walks or hardcore hiking Madeira s system of irrigation channels known as levadas carries water down from the mountains on gentle gradients and provides a ready made system of trails The canals more than 1 300 miles of them crisscross the island have level footpaths running along their entire length Walkers of all ages and abilities need only find a levada to take in some of the finest countryside anywhere Several of these walks which will be discussed in this book are among the highlights of Madeira With such rapturous scenery and a climate that is consistently delightful perhaps it would be unfair to expect nature to have bestowed the island with miles of perfect sands as well Madeira has no beaches to speak of though the day when an enterprising hotel builds its own man made beach can t be too far off In the meantime if a lounge chair by the pool just can t compare you ll have to follow in the wake of Columbus and dock on the neighboring island of Porto Santo a popular day trip The only other inhabited island in the archipelago Porto Santo has a 9 km long beach running the length of its south coast but few other attractions While some surely would find the notion of an island vacation with no beach time an unusual prospect indeed perhaps it isn t at all a tragedy that Madeira s shoreline crashes so violently into the ocean A Madeira with sandy beaches and direct flights from Great Britain and other points in Europe and beginning in late 2000 North America would surely not have been capable of staving off the mass tourist market as it has thus far Lack of sand has kept Madeira from modeling itself after Mallorca For decades Madeira has instead attracted a genteel even anachronistic form of island tourism Afternoon tea and black tie dinners are still served at the most elegant hotels The typical visitor is still older and wealthier than in most holiday destinations but times are beginning to change as they are across Portugal no longer the forgotten backwater of Europe Funchal s new tourist zone testifies to local travel industry ambitions Today Madeira is being discovered by younger travelers who might also indulge in the spas and dining that world class hotels offer but are just as likely to seek out the modest inns up in the mountains and strap on their boots for serious hiking Madeirans like most Portuguese are a generally quiet and reserved people Add to this geographical isolation and the difficulties for most of a harsh agricultural existence where few have the machinery to help in the tiny terraced fields and you might forgive the islanders if they seemed less than welcoming Instead you will find friendly people who in spite of a 12 month season that for decades has deposited tourists from wealthier nations on their shores are refreshingly hospitable They are proud of the scenic beauty delectable wines and exquisite hand embroidery that their tiny island has become rightly famous for The tourism ante is being upped by hoteliers entre pren eurs and government officials eager to broaden Madeira s offerings and appeal But the allure of Madeira remains its absence of man made attractions and abundance of natural ones Some people still suggest that Madeira is part of the lost continent of Atlantis and though it has become easier and easier to get there the island still seems otherworldly
