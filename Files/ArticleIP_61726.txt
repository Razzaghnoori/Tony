 Raising McCain Every presidential candidate who does well enough to attract media scrutiny is doomed to have a bad story written about him Al Gore A phony career politician Bill Bradley A do nothing lecturer George W Bush A Clintonesque playboy Now John McCain faces the same ritual Rather than resist it McCain has turned it to his advantage He has chosen his own bad story He s an angry Vietnam veteran It s an ingenious choice a good story disguised as a bad one It advances McCain s campaign themes integrity and fearless independence while sating reporters who imagine that their questions about his temper amount to tough minded scrutiny McCain s anger is supposed to be bad because he can t control it and therefore can t work with Congress and can t be trusted with nuclear weapons To refute this charge all he has to do is restrain his temper in a few highly visible situations Journalists unwittingly oblige him Bent on making news they bombard him with questions designed to provoke an explosion Why is it that those who know you best seem to like you the least debate co moderator Karen Brown asked him at last week s debate in New Hampshire Responding to such questions McCain always smiles thanks his interrogators praises his opponents and deflects the challenge with a self mocking joke A comment like that really makes me mad he quipped during the debate But McCain understands that while voters want a president who can control his temper they also want one with a sense of outrage He flaunts his anger at HMOs trial lawyers agribusiness conglomerates and defense contractors who feed on corporate welfare It s important to have passion and to get angry when you see injustice he argued on Larry King Live On Face the Nation he boasted Sure I get angry I get angry at this last bill that we just passed that is an outrageous waste of taxpayers money In the New Hampshire debate McCain vowed From time to time those of us who stand in an independent fashion are going to break some china It is very clear to all the lobbyists and the special influence people that run Washington now that if John McCain is president of the United States things are going to be a lot different McCain s enemies make this spin an easy sell Who s spreading the rumor that he s too volatile to be president Republican Senate leaders Newsweek supplies their motive Many senators despise McCain for his crusade in favor of campaign finance reform and McCain s campaign manager affirms that they re out to stop him because John s shaken up the establishment by talking about strong conservative reform On Face the Nation panelist Gloria Borger asked McCain The entire Senate leadership is against you Is there a sense perhaps that you are too much of a maverick to really become president and govern Too much of a maverick The question was practically a campaign contribution In particular McCain asserts his anger on behalf of soldiers This combines two good stories his principled outrage and his war record Do I feel passionately about issues Absolutely he conceded in the debate When I see wasteful pork barrel spending while we have 12 000 enlisted families brave men and women on food stamps yeah I get angry On Meet the Press McCain defended a 1992 shouting match with a fellow senator over the fate of Vietnam POWs I took strong exception to his allegations that somehow I was ignoring important evidence McCain explained We re talking about an issue of literally life and death Such patriotic outbursts have captivated the media McCain is best when he is angry swoons Time He blazes with indignation that 12 000 military families are on food stamps McCain s cleverest strategy has been to associate the anger story with his POW ordeal This week citing nasty rumors that his torture and imprisonment in Vietnam had left him emotionally unbalanced his campaign released medical records indicating that he had never been mentally ill The records did more than kill a bad story They revived a good one McCain got to tour the TV studios retelling his heroic saga In every interview he alluded to his wounds calling his medical records an orthopedic surgeon s dream The New York Times discussed his major fractures and solitary confinement The Associated Press recalled his 1973 testimony that he had survived through faith in country the Navy family and God NBC s David Bloom recounting how McCain had been brutally and repeatedly tortured quoted a commander who said of McCain There was no tougher resister among POWs The Vietnam angle doesn t just help McCain It hurts Bush When stories about McCain s temper first began to circulate McCain told reporters I guess the memo from the Bush campaign has come out to attack John McCain McCain has since backed away grudgingly from that allegation I was speaking metaphorically he says but his aides have kept it alive by publicly urging the Bush campaign to make sure its agents aren t spreading the rumors By framing these rumors in the context of Vietnam McCain s surrogates create the impression that Bush who joined the National Guard to avoid Vietnam is using McCain s war record against him There s no evidence to support this insinuation but since Bush can t prove the negative that no one associated with his campaign has ever said any such thing the insinuation sticks Front pages and Sunday political shows continue to discuss the anti McCain whisper campaign a phrase concocted by McCain s aides It s going to be next to impossible to finger anyone in the Bush campaign for fomenting anti McCain sentiment lamented Newsweek Vietnam veterans in the Senate called the trauma rumors disgraceful Pundits called them disgusting and despicable A POW expert told NBC that those who were spreading the rumors had spit in the face of every Vietnam veteran Now McCain is being asked whether he s angry about the rumors about his anger Again he gets to impress everyone by turning the other cheek It doesn t matter to me he shrugged on Meet the Press We need to move forward When asked about reports that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott had circulated the rumors McCain defended him Trent Lott has been a personal friend of mine for many many years McCain has won the fight the best way invisibly by framing the orientation of the questions Everyone asks him about the whisper campaign against him No one asks him about the pro McCain whisper campaign about the whisper campaign Everyone expects Bush to halt the anti McCain whispers No one expects McCain to halt the whispers that Bush is behind the anti McCain whispers Pundits can t believe McCain would fan and exploit rumors about his anger Even if you handle it right you still don t want this kind of thing out there argued Susan Estrich on Fox News Sunday There s some people who only hear a piece of it and say to themselves is something wrong with John McCain Estrich misses the point Voters are already asking whether something is wrong with McCain They approach a presidential candidate the way a woman approaches a date First they want to know what s attractive about him Second if he passes that test they want to know what s wrong with him They won t be satisfied and won t relax until they ve identified his flaws Third they want to observe those flaws examine them discuss them and figure out whether they re manageable Every candidate has many flaws some of which are worse than others A candidate s best strategy therefore is to show the media and the voters his most manageable flaw in the hope that they will focus on that flaw and stop looking for others This is precisely what the anger story has accomplished By consuming the media it has overshadowed and smothered more dangerous anti McCain stories With few exceptions reporters aren t pressing McCain about his role in the Keating Five campaign finance scandal They aren t asking him to explain to Republican voters how his crusades for campaign finance restrictions and a half trillion dollar tobacco tax square with conservative principles They aren t asking him to explain to independents why he opposes the Brady Bill and Roe vs Wade Reporters aren t trying to protect McCain they just think his mental stability is a more damaging issue It goes beyond accusing McCain of hypocrisy on campaign finance says Newsweek For McCain this illusion is felicitous The anger story has distracted the media because it looks so much worse than it is Above all the story of McCain s anger has obscured what his quarrels have been about By focusing attention on tone it has deflected attention from content When reports about McCain s bad temper first emerged out of Arizona this fall they indicated that he had muscled rebuked punished and cowed fellow Republicans in order to squelch dissent Those reports could have generated discussion about whether McCain s tirades against entrenched power in Washington are hypocritical Instead they have been reduced to discussion about whether he is prone to tirades Likewise Sen Mitch McConnell R Ky has tried to focus scrutiny on McCain s tobacco and campaign finance crusades I don t think John McCain s personality is the issue McConnell pleaded on television two weeks ago For me it s been a policy difference over big taxes and putting the government in charge of everybody s political speech But the anger story has overwhelmed McConnell s critique Reporters aren t interested in the clash of ideas They re interested in the clash of personalities Is John McCain too crazy to be president The question answers itself A man who can use that issue to obscure his more serious weaknesses underscore his strengths and besmirch his opponent can t be accused of showing too little rationality and discipline The better question is whether he has shown too much
