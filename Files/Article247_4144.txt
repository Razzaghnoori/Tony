 George W s Smirk A Chatterbox Investigation George W Bush s smirk has become a hot political story On C Span Bill Kristol revealed that Bush s funny little grin almost a smirk that comes across his face occasionally at inappropriate times had occasioned perplexed discussion among staffers at the cutting edge conservative Weekly Standard which Kristol edits Brian Williams and the Boston Globe s David Nyhan also noted the Smirk Problem on MSNBC and CNN respectively prompting a superbly detailed Dec 3 article by the Wall Street Journal s Jackie Calmes Calmes described the following eerie scene At a campaign stop in Dubuque Iowa Mr Bush toured a Christian pregnancy counseling center to promote his antiabortion views and support for faith based social services As he sat at a table with two female workers there he continuously wore a sort of smile as he listened to each woman One of the women a counselor for post abortion trauma told how she had become pregnant at 20 helplessly felt she had no alternative but abortion and for 15 years suffered in silence Still the right side of Mr Bush s mouth seemed frozen in a half smile The smirk resurfaced at last week s New Hampshire debate according to The New Yorker s Joe Klein who in the Dec 13 issue writes that Bush will squinny his eyes raise his chin lift an eyebrow and curl his lip slightly his face seems to be involved in a somewhat painful quasi involuntary struggle to prevent itself from erupting into a broad self satisfied smile This facial skirmish is often accompanied by a slight forward bend at the waist and a what me worry shrug and they often occur after the Governor has delivered a line particularly well or thinks he has The smirk is causing much justifiable worry in Republican circles I hear some saying that his friendly outgoing personality on TV is mistaken for a smirk and smugness a senior Republican official was quoted as saying in the Dec 8 Boston Globe A few have said to me He has to make sure that charm is not mistaken for arrogance Presumably Bush himself got the message his smirk was not much in evidence at this week s Arizona debate Click here to see for yourself Clearly though the smirk will return and when it does political spinmeisters will try to define it away as an image problem a mere matter of faulty subjective analysis by pundits and voters A far more interesting question than how Bush s smirk is interpreted however is What does it mean Calmes quotes C Span s Brian Lamb as saying in effect that it s just a cruel trick of genetic physiognomy His father has the same thing it s just not as pronounced as it is with W But since personality is also to some extent genetically based and moreover can be passed environmentally from one generation to the next particularly when father and son share not only the same home but also a few institutional influences e g Andover and Yale it is conceivable that the shared smirk signifies a shared arrogance Klein quite rightly warns us not to be too hasty in reaching this conclusion It would be easy to mistake such elaborate body language for arrogance as more than a few observers have whereas the true meaning of the tic may be the exact opposite It may just signify relief that he has successfully managed to jump another public hurdle without embarrassing himself Or it may mean nothing at all Concluding that the matter of Bush s smirk was too weighty to be left in the hands of nonscientists Chatterbox e mailed Paul Ekman professor of psychology at the University of California at San Francisco According to the Orlando Sentinel Tribune Ekman is the nation s leading smile researcher His academic writings on how to interpret facial expressions have been used by lawyers to figure out which potential jurors to eject during voir dire and by gamblers to figure out the giveaway signs of a card player s bluff If anyone could explain the meaning of George W s troubling smirk it was Ekman But Ekman made clear in a response to Chatterbox s note that he wouldn t play I watch George W and have many thoughts about it But I have a policy about never talking about anyone who is in office or running for office or is in litigation So I can t help you I don t know anyone responsible and knowledgeable who can Undaunted Chatterbox marched off to a nearby bookstore and purchased What the Face Reveals Basic and Applied Studies of Spontaneous Expression Using the Facial Action Coding System FACS edited by Ekman and Erika Rosenberg He then burrowed in for a long read Chatterbox learned that the science of studying facial expressions is relatively new Before the 1960s apparently it was deemed a useless enterprise This consensus changed as a result of work done by Silvan Tomkins Ekman and a few others In 1971 for example Ekman and W V Friesen examined the facial expressions of Japanese and American students as they watched stressful films When they watched these films alone the Japanese and the Americans had similar distressed expressions on their faces When they watched these films in the presence of an authority figure however the Americans facial expressions were essentially the same as when they watched the films alone whereas the Japanese showed much less negative affect smiled sometimes and actually masked negative emotion with smiling behavior Conclusion Americans are less guarded in letting facial expressions show what they re feeling A reassuring finding in light of the question before us During the 1970s Ekman developed a method called the Facial Action Coding System FACS to measure all visually discernible facial movement The building blocks of FACS are 46 action units AUs such as a wrinkling of the nose a puffing of the cheeks dilation of the nostrils squinting and so on These AUs usually identified by the facial muscles that perform these various tasks are the tools used in What the Face Reveals To look at a few examples click here and here Sadly there is no chapter on smirking per se in Ekman and Rosenberg s book In a 1992 report to the National Science Foundation Ekman and several co authors reject the term smirk on the grounds that it s too coarse and imprecise ignoring differences between a variety of different muscular actions to which it may refer and mixing description with inferences about meaning or the message which it may convey But there are three chapters in the book that may nonetheless be relevant to the smirking question Let s start with a chapter by Ekman and Joseph G Hager titled The Asymmetry of Facial Actions George W s smirk is asymmetrical is it not The chapter describes an experiment in which 33 right handed Caucasian women ages 18 to 53 were exposed to various mildly unpleasant experiences and asked to smile Then they were asked Now that this is done aren t you glad it s over This inspired spontaneous smiles Ekman and Hager found that the smiles on demand were less symmetrical than the spontaneous smiles This might mean George W s apparent smirk is merely a forced smile not a smug or mean or even dishonest one Another interpretation is suggested in a chapter by Ekman and several others titled Type A Behavior Pattern Here the authors argue that the group of people most likely to suffer heart attacks are more apt than others to glare and show facial signs of disgust George W doesn t glare much as far as Chatterbox can tell but his smirk may be an expression of disgust If that s true he would seem to face a heightened risk of heart disease The most provocative chapter in the book by Ekman Wallace V Friesen and Maureen O Sullivan is titled Smiles When Lying According to Ekman Friesen and O Sullivan there is a clear distinction between felt happy smiles and masking smiles intended to hide some other emotion The subject doesn t actually have to be telling a lie rather the facial expression itself is the lie Felt happy smiles are defined as the action of the zygomatic major lip and orbicularis oculi pars lateralis eye muscles Masking smiles use a whole bunch of other facial muscles associated with fear disgust contempt sadness and anger One such muscle is the triangularis which judging from an illustrative photograph on Page 208 pulls the corner of the lip down in an expression that Chatterbox would call a smirk Chatterbox will refrain from endorsing any of these three hypotheses forced smile susceptibility to heart attack falsity to explain George W s smirk Rather he calls on Ekman or some other expert to tell us which if any is correct
