 Introduction Advances in transplant based therapy for type 1 diabetes mellitus 1 and a dearth of cadaveric pancreatic islets of Langerhans have focused interest on developing renewable sources of transplant ready islet replacement tissues Pancreatic islets derive from embryonic endoderm but display features of neurons including a shared set of cell autonomous developmental regulators 2 Islets are the principal source of insulin in humans but in some invertebrate species such as Drosophila brain neurons are the main source of circulating insulin 3 4 The similarities between islet cells and neurons are further underscored by the demonstration of insulin gene transcription in the vertebrate brain 5 although it remains unclear whether these vertebrate neurons produce or secrete insulin protein 6 Moreover recent studies also suggest that in some settings mouse pancreatic epithelial cells can engender neuron like cells 7 8 These and other findings 2 suggest that common ancient developmental programs may govern the differentiation of islet cells and neurons Methods promoting neural differentiation by embryonic stem ES cells have been adapted 9 10 11 12 13 to derive insulin producing cells IPCs but it remains unclear whether such IPCs were derived from neural progenitors or whether a neural based strategy can generate transplantable human IPCs Neural cells derive from multipotent progenitor cells and recently clonal human neural progenitor cells that remained multipotent and karyotypically stable through at least 15 passages were purified by flow cytometry based methods 14 The availability of human neural progenitor cells allowed us to investigate whether inductive signals involved in normal pathways of islet development could direct these neural progenitors to develop into glucose responsive IPCs Here we describe experimental strategies for developing IPCs directly from human neural stem cells Methods All studies were performed in accordance with appropriate human participants approval according to Stanford University Institutional Review Board guidelines Cell Lines and Culture Conditions The human neurosphere NS cell lines line numbers 1651 1664 and 1673 were established following enrichment for AC133 cells as previously described 14 although none of the cell lines was expanded from a single cell and they are therefore not clonal The different cell lines were from distinct donors and karyotypically normal They gave comparable results but line 1664 produced less insulin by stage 4 in our protocol than the other cell lines Following cell thaw NSs were expanded in suspension culture and in each case were used between passages 5 and 7 Undifferentiated human NS cells stage 1 were cultured and expanded in medium containing X VIVO15

supplemented with 2 M all trans retinoic acid RA Sigma and had a final glucose concentration of either 5 or 17 mM At stage 4 cells were cultured in N2 medium 10 supplemented with 10 mM nicotinamide Sigma and 10 nM insulin like growth factor 1 R D Systems for up to 6 d Stage 4 medium included 17 3 mM glucose During stage 3 and 4 medium was changed every other day To examine the effect of Sonic hedgehog Shh R D Systems we added 300 nM mouse Shh in PBS every other day during stage 4 To quantify neurite outgrowths per cluster 20 Shh treated or control stage 4 IPC clusters were photographed

obtain representative results all quantification of immunostaining was performed by counting numbers of positive stained cells and dividing by the area of total tissues using a standard 10 10

sections Appropriately stained cells were counted in a minimum of ten random microscopic fields obtained from at least ten cell clusters per condition In Situ Hybridization We used human insulin cDNA

hybridization with IPC cluster sections as described 16 and used DIG Nucleic Acid Detection Kit Roche Indianapolis Indiana United States for development according to the manufacturer s instructions Insulin C Peptide Quantification and In Vitro Insulin Secretion Assay At each stage 300 NS or IPC clusters were handpicked washed with PBS and homogenized then intracellular C peptide content was measured with a C peptide ELISA kit American Laboratory Products Company Windham New Hampshire United States Stage 4 IPC clusters were cultured in glucose free RPMI Invitrogen supplemented with 2 8 mM glucose 20 mM HEPES and 10 newborn calf serum Invitrogen for at least 2 3 h At the end of these washes no insulin was detectable in the wash supernatant using an ELISA kit American Laboratory Products Company Fifty IPC clusters were handpicked transferred to a 24 well plate and incubated for 2 h at 37 C in the presence of 2 8 mM glucose 25 mM glucose or 25 mM sucrose Supernatants were then harvested for enzyme linked immunosorption assay ELISA based quantification of released insulin IPC Transplantation and Physiologic Tests All animal studies were performed in accordance with Stanford University Animal Care and Use Guidelines Under general anesthesia 9 to 10 wk old male NOD scid mice purchased from Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor Maine United States were engrafted with 1 000 handpicked IPC clusters in the right and left subcapsular renal space 500 IPC clusters each or received a sham transplant of saline solution Transplantation of more IPC clusters in a renal graft site was not feasible because of the size of the clusters Two weeks after IPC cluster transplantation we subjected mice to an overnight fast Then we measured serum human C peptide before and 30 min after intraperitoneal injection with 3 g of glucose per kilogram of body weight using a human C peptide ELISA kit When stage 4 IPC clusters were transplanted tumors were not observed 4 wk after engraftment the maximum period of observation n 5 All data represent the average from the indicated number of samples standard error of the mean Two tailed t tests were conducted to determine statistical significance Results Glucose Restriction Initiates IPC Development Culture media with high glucose concentrations have been useful for isolating and maintaining progenitor cell populations from the central and peripheral nervous systems 14 17 and for permitting differentiation by neurogenic cells 18 We routinely expanded NS cultures in medium containing 37 mM glucose a level 5 to 6 fold higher than physiologic glucose concentration Isolated human neural progenitors spontaneously aggregate in these conditions to produce a cell cluster called a NS and 85 90 of NS cells produce the intermediary filament Nestin Figures 1 and 2 a putative marker of neural stem and progenitor cells 19 Prolonged exposure to high glucose levels can also severely reduce insulin expression in pancreatic cells 20 Thus we postulated that glucose reduction might blunt neurogenic programs by NSs and promote alternate fates including development of IPCs Therefore we switched NS culture conditions from high glucose 37 mM stage 1 to low glucose 5 mM stage 2 see Figure 1A to initiate development To assess developmental changes resulting from glucose reduction and later culture modifications we examined NS cell composition and expression of gene products known to regulate or define in vivo fates of embryonic neural or islet cells A tubulin III isoform produced in differentiating neurons was not detected in stage 1 cells whereas expression of Ki67 an S phase associated nuclear antigen was expressed in the majority of stage 1 cells see Figure 2 Genes specifying transcription factors essential for in vivo differentiation of lineage restricted neural progenitors and their differentiated progeny 21 22 23 including En1 Hb9 Isl1 Hoxc6 NRSF REST and Nkx6 1 were expressed at low or undetectable levels in stage 1 see Figure 1B 1C consistent with the reported multipotency of proliferating NSs grown in high glucose 14 After 2 wk at stage 2 NS derived cells remained in clusters see Figure 1A but Nestin and Ki67 were expressed in fewer than 35 of cells see Figure 2 indicating possible differentiation of cells toward lineage restricted fates Consistent with this view we detected increased expression of Nkx6 1 NRSF REST and tubulin III see Figures 1B and 2 We also detected increased expression of Neurogenin3 ngn3 see Figure 1C a transcription factor expressed in differentiating neurons and required for development of pancreatic islet progenitor cells 24 25 26 Nkx6 1 and ngn3 expression were never observed in NS cultures maintained in 37 mM glucose see Figure 1B data not shown These data suggest that glucose restriction initiates developmental programs known to promote differentiation of mammalian neural and neuroendocrine cells As shown below insulin expression in NS derived cells required culture in low glucose medium at stage 2 but we did not consistently detect insulin cells by immunohistochemistry until stage 4 RA Promotes IPC Development RA induces development of primitive endodermal cells from a subset of embryonal carcinoma cell lines and is an endogenous signal that directs development of posterior organs like the pancreas from embryonic endoderm 27 28 In vivo exposure to RA is sufficient to induce ectopic development of insulin expressing tissue in the anterior foregut 27 Moreover stage 2 NS derived cells expressed RA receptors including RAR and RAR see Figure 1C indicating competence for RA signals To investigate whether RA could stimulate development of NS derived cells toward an IPC fate we measured expression of Pdx1 Cdx1 and FoxA3 transcription factors that regulate gastrointestinal organ development 29 30 Pdx1 Cdx1 and FoxA3 expression was induced in stage 3 when cell clusters were allowed to adhere to pre coated wells at a density of 40 80 NSs cm 2 and cultured in low glucose medium with 2 M RA for 2 wk see Figure 1A and 1C We then tested other concentrations of RA and other plating densities NS cells exposed to 100 nM RA at 20 40 or 80 NSs cm 2 and NS cells exposed to 2 M RA at a plating density of 20 NSs cm 2 did not express these markers or insulin at a later stage stage 4 Figure 3A data not shown Thus higher doses of RA induced markers of posterior fate in NS derived cells a dosage response like that seen during RA patterning of posterior gut development in vivo Moreover this response was sensitive to plating density revealing that additional cell non autonomous factors may regulate this response Mesoderm develops in close association with gastrointestinal endoderm both in vivo and in vitro 31 32 Thus detection of gut markers like Pdx1 and FoxA3 in NS derived cell cultures raised the possibility that mesodermal cells might co develop However we did not detect expression of known markers of mesoderm formation including brachyury flk 1 myosin light chain 2 and globin at any stage in our cultures see Figure 1B By contrast mesoderm development invariably accompanies endoderm development in embryoid bodies derived from human ES cells or embryonic germ cells 31 32 33 In stage 3 cultures Nestin and Ki67 expression was nearly extinguished see Figure 2 while expression of En1 ngn3 and Hb9 increased see Figure 1B and 1C While their numbers increased slightly during stage 3 tubulin III cells composed fewer than 10 of cells in NS derived clusters see Figure 2 suggesting that the majority of differentiated cells had acquired non neural fates Consistent with this interpretation we also did not detect expression of homeodomain proteins Hoxc6 or Hoxb9 see Figure 1B data not shown which are induced by RA in spinal cord neuronal precursor cells 21 RA can activate signaling through the Hedgehog Hh pathway and recent studies show that Hh signals control development of embryonic pancreatic islets in vivo 16 34 To elucidate the mechanisms underlying RA induced expression of markers like FoxA3 and Pdx1 we examined Hh signaling during IPC development We detected expression of the Hedgehog receptors Patched Ptc and Smoothened Smo at all stages Figure 3B consistent with the possibility that NS derived cells are competent for Hh signaling However we did not detect NS expression of genes encoding Hh ligands like Shh Figure 3B similar to previous studies 19 Increased Ptc transcription is a known consequence of Shh signaling but we did not detect changes of Ptc expression during stages 1 4 consistent with the absence of detectable expression of Hh ligands To test directly whether the absence of Hh signaling was required for expression of endodermal or islet markers including FoxA3 Pdx1 and insulin we added Shh protein to stage 4 cultures which do not express Shh or genes encoding other Hh ligands like Desert hedgehog or Indian hedgehog Figure 3C At 300 nM a dose used to induce neuronal development in ES cell cultures 21 Shh produced a significant increase in neurite outgrowth in NS derived cells Figure 3D and 3E see Methods and resulted in increased Ptc expression Figure 3F Moreover Shh treatment during stage 4 eliminated expression of Pdx1 FoxA3 and insulin Figure 3F These data are reminiscent of prior studies demonstrating that excess endodermal Shh signaling disrupts pancreas development in vivo 16 34 Thus in contrast to the response of ES cells 21 RA treatment of NS derived cells does not stimulate endogenous Hh signaling The lack of Hh signals in NS derived cells blunts neural differentiation and permits differentiation toward endocrine like cell fates Insulin Expression by IPCs ngn3 Pdx1 and Hb9 are essential factors for mammalian cell development 22 and their expression in stage 3 suggested the potential for deriving IPCs Insulin expression has not to our knowledge been reported in NS derived cells 19 35 Moderate hyperglycemia is a potent stimulus for cell differentiation and expansion in vivo and in utero 20 so we tested whether exposure of stage 3 cells to elevated glucose levels could induce insulin expression Semi quantitative RT PCR measures of insulin mRNA expression showed that exposure of cultures grown in 5 mM glucose at stage 3 to 17 mM glucose at stage 4 induced insulin expression Figure 3A Growth of cells at stage 2 in 5 mM glucose followed by exposure in stages 3 and 4 to 17 mM glucose also resulted in insulin expression at stage 4 but at lower levels By contrast no insulin was expressed by cultures maintained in 5 mM glucose or 17 mM glucose throughout stages 2 4 Figure 3A Thus reduction of glucose in stage 2 growth medium followed by a later increase in glucose at stage 3 or 4 was essential for development of IPCs Insulin like growth factor 1 may promote insulin secretion and prevent apoptosis of cells in vivo 36 and addition of this factor at stage 4 reduced apoptosis approximately 10 fold see Figure 1A data not shown Nicotinamide which can stimulate in vivo pancreatic endocrine cell differentiation 37 did not affect cell survival but did increase insulin C peptide expression approximately 1 5 to 2 fold data not shown Thus simultaneous exposure to high glucose levels insulin like growth factor 1 and nicotinamide optimized insulin expression at stage 4 Comparable results were obtained with three independently derived NS lines Coinciding with the onset of high insulin expression levels in mouse islets ngn3 expression is virtually extinguished 25 while expression of Pdx1 FoxA3 Isl1 and Nkx6 1 in islet cells is maintained or increased 22 Similarly we noted that IPC maturation from stage 3 to 4 was accompanied by increased insulin expression reduced ngn3 expression and increased or maintained levels of Isl1 FoxA3 and Pdx1 expression see Figure 1B and 1C Thus tissues derived from neural progenitor cells express insulin Pdx1 and FoxA3 markers typically co expressed in foregut derived tissues Expression of these markers suggests differentiation of some neural progenitor cells toward an endoderm like fate We were unable to detect expression of Pdx1 and FoxA3 using immunohistochemical methods in stage 4 IPCs data not shown We also did not detect expression of Nkx6 1 or islet amyloid polypeptide markers of mature pancreatic cells see Figure 1C data not shown Thus the sequence of gene expression accompanying formation of IPCs from NSs was similar but not identical to that described for differentiating pancreatic cells and further molecular studies are required to determine the degree of endoderm like differentiation of cells in IPCs We detected expression of insulin protein by immunohistochemistry in 90 of stage 4 cell clusters Figure 4 An average of 26 of cells in stage 4 clusters were insulin and appeared healthy with abundant cytoplasm and a well defined nucleus delineated by the nuclear stain 7AAD Figure 4A Of the cells composing stage 4 clusters 45 were tubulin III none of which contained insulin Figure 5A 5C Insulin cells showed little or no co expression of neural stem cell markers like Nestin see Figure 1 or other markers of neural lineages known to develop from human neural progenitors like MAP2 differentiated neurons Figure 5D 5F Olig2 multipotent precursors bipotent glial precursors and oligodendrocytes Figure 5J 5L see 38 or myelin basic protein data not shown Occasional rare insulin cells expressed detectable GFAP a marker of astrocytes Figure 5G 5I Thus while we cannot completely rule out the possibility that some neural cell types expressed insulin these data suggest that nearly all insulin cells produced in stage 4 cultures were non neuronal Nuclei in insulin cells were not stained by an antibody to Ki67 see Figures 2 and 4B suggesting that insulin cells at stage 4 are post mitotic like mature pancreatic cells Immunostaining with specific antibodies revealed proinsulin and C peptide an internal portion of the proinsulin translation product in the cytoplasm of all insulin cells see Figure 4D 4G and 4O supporting our conclusion that insulin protein was produced in stage 4 IPCs In situ hybridization with antisense riboprobes specific for human insulin mRNA labeled 25 30 of stage 4 cells see Figure 4H 4J providing further evidence of insulin production We observed only rare insulin cells stained by antibodies specific for activated caspase 3 0 3 see Figure 4K or TUNEL assay data not shown In stage 4 cell clusters we did not consistently detect expression of glucagon see Figure 4L pancreatic polypeptide or somatostatin by immunohistochemistry The absence of glucagon gene expression in our IPC cultures was further confirmed by RT PCR data not shown Thus like in pancreatic islets insulin was the principal hormone produced by IPCs However the composition of IPCs was distinct from that of pancreatic islets and further studies are required to determine the basis for this difference To quantify insulin expression in IPCs we used a human insulin C peptide specific ELISA see Figure 4P By ELISA we did not detect C peptide in stage 3 or stage 4 culture media which contained supplementary bovine insulin Thus use of a C peptide assay did not detect medium derived bovine insulin in measures of IPC insulin content 39 C peptide levels at stages 1 3 were low or undetectable see Figure 4P consistent with the lack of immunostainable insulin see Figure 2 in cells at these earlier stages Similarly in cultures maintained in 17 mM glucose during stages 1 4 HHHH C peptide levels were not detectable see Figure 4P In cell clusters exposed to 5 mM glucose in stages 2 3 then switched to 17 mM glucose at stage 4 HLLH insulin C peptide levels were 0 36 fmol per cluster and the average number of C peptide cells per cluster was 200 Thus we estimate 0 0018 fmol C peptide per NS derived IPC A single cell contains approximately 0 6 fmol C peptide and insulin 40 so we calculate that insulin C peptide content in one stage 4 IPC is approximately 0 3 of the level in isolated human cells Collectively these experiments confirm that IPCs transcribe and translate insulin and rule out that insulin measured in IPCs is derived from medium as shown in another system 39 IPCs Are Glucose Responsive Glucokinase and glucose transporters like Glut 2 are essential regulators of glucose responses in pancreatic cells and expression of these regulators in stage 4 insulin cells see Figures 1C 4M and 4N suggested that IPCs could sense and respond to glucose To test whether IPCs respond appropriately to glucose stimulation we measured insulin release in static batch in vitro assays We found that IPC insulin release increased markedly following a step increase of glucose from 2 8 to 25 mM see Figure 4Q To examine whether IPCs are similarly responsive to glucose stimulation in vivo we performed a series of IPC grafting experiments in immunocompromised recipient mice Two weeks following engraftment 1 000 IPC containing clusters mouse recipient mice and sham transplanted controls were fasted overnight and human C peptide levels measured Human C peptide was undetectable in mouse sera prior to glucose challenge or following glucose challenge of sham transplanted controls see Figure 4R In contrast 30 min after intraperitoneal glucose challenge of IPC recipients we detected 6 1 1 2 pmol l human C peptide p 0 001 approximately 0 5 1 of serum C peptide levels observed following engraftment of 2 000 human islet equivalents in a prior study 41 Thus IPCs respond to glucose challenge in vivo by releasing insulin C peptide Analysis of IPC graft sites 4 wk after transplantation revealed nests of transplanted cells without obvious tumor formation Histologic analysis and immunohistochemical detection revealed that C peptide expressing cells persisted in the graft site see Figure 4S and 4T Thus engrafted IPCs remained differentiated and survived up to a month following transplantation Discussion There is widespread interest in developing tissue replacement strategies for treatment of human disorders like diabetes mellitus and Parkinson disease While much attention has been focused on the promise of ES cells for tissue replacement recent work suggests that neural stem cells like ES cells may have an unusually broad differentiation potential For example Gage and colleagues demonstrated the conversion of mouse neural stem cells to the endothelial lineage indicating that plasticity is a bona fide property of cultured neural stem cells 42 These results were also unexpected because endothelial cells and neuronal cells normally derive respectively from mesoderm and ectoderm distinct embryonic germ layers Here we show that human neural stem cells have a similarly broad differentiation potential and that specific in vitro culture conditions can divert neural stem derived cells from neural lineages toward a fate with endocrine and endodermal characteristics Our study shows that application of endogenous signals governing pancreas development to human neural progenitor cells can generate glucose responsive IPCs Systematic variation of the identity concentration and sequence of these signals led to discovery of methods culminating in IPC formation However there are limitations to our findings that should be noted First our molecular analysis of differentiating IPCs showed that they remain distinct from mature pancreatic islet cells in other words the insulin cells derived by our methods are not mature cells For example reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction confirmed that IPCs were enriched for a combination of gene products that approximate those expressed in developing pancreatic islet cells However the temporal sequence of expression of some of these products like glucokinase Glut 2 and Pdx1 does not precisely recapitulate that observed in the embryonic pancreas reviewed in 22 and transcription of other genes typically expressed in cells like Nkx6 1 was not detected in later stage IPCs see Figure 1 Thus the insulin cells derived in this study are not bona fide cells Further experimentation may elucidate the basis for these differences revealing the extent of neural progenitor cell development toward an endocrine cell fate Recent studies suggest that neural cells can be derived from adult pancreatic epithelium 7 8 adding to a growing body of data demonstrating numerous similarities in neural and pancreatic endocrine development reviewed in 43 In light of these similarities we speculate that methods leading to the production of cell factors like Nkx6 1 in stage 4 clusters may enhance the cell like qualities of neural progenitor derived insulin cells and thereby permit differentiation of tissues that more closely resemble endoderm derived islet cells Second our immunohistochemical analysis shows that stage 4 insulin expressing cells do not express markers like Nestin tubulin III MAP2 or Olig2 suggesting that these insulin cells are non neuronal but we cannot formally rule out the alternate possibility that our methods produced neural cells capable of secreting insulin Third we have not demonstrated fully that the stimulus secretion coupling apparatus in IPCs is similar to that in pancreatic islets While insulin release by IPCs produced here appears to be glucose sensitive both in vitro and in vivo future work should elaborate whether IPC insulin is stored in dense core secretory vesicles and whether secretogogues or secretion potentiators other than glucose like amino acids or sulfonylureas stimulate insulin release by IPCs like in pancreatic islets Lastly we have not ameliorated glucose regulation in diabetic animal models with the human IPCs described here Serum levels of insulin C peptide expression achieved following IPC transplantation in glucose challenged mice were less than 1 of normal see Figure 4 Thus we did not attempt IPC transplantations in overtly diabetic animals since prior studies suggest that insulin production at 10 of normal or greater may be required to improve glucose regulation in diabetic patients and animal models 10 41 Additional studies to test the impact of transplanted IPCs in animal models of diabetes therefore await production of IPCs capable of insulin secretion at levels higher than achieved here Nevertheless compared to other methods for IPC development from human stem cells 13 44 our methods produced insulin at the highest levels yet achieved from an expandable human stem cell derived tissue Multiple experimental approaches were taken to demonstrate that these IPCs transcribe translate and secrete insulin and to rule out the possibility that insulin measured in IPCs derived from the culture media In vitro studies demonstrate that IPCs release insulin in a glucose responsive manner like islets Moreover IPCs transplanted into mice remained differentiated and released circulating human insulin in a glucose dependent manner Thus for the first time we demonstrate moderately efficient production of glucose responsive IPCs from an expandable population of human stem cells Current islet transplantation methods require an estimated 5 10 8 to 10 9 cells per recipient 45 From 10 6 cells at stage 2 we produced an average of 200 400 clusters with approximately 2 000 cells per cluster approximately 25 of these cells are C peptide and release 0 5 1 of C peptide secreted by cells Based strictly on these yields we would need to expand IPC production approximately 10 5 fold to meet the need for one transplantation Undifferentiated NSs can be readily expanded through at least a dozen passages 14 suggesting sufficient cell numbers could be generated to scale up this protocol for transplant based therapies We did not exhaust all possible factor combinations in our study we speculate that further method refinements may improve the efficiency of NS conversion into IPCs as well as IPC insulin synthesis and stimulus secretion coupling the hallmark functions of mature cells If so then human neural stem cells may serve as a valuable model for elucidating the mechanisms and factors that regulate neuroendocrine cell differentiation For instance addition of glucagon like peptide 1 TGF ligands or other factors that potentiate cell maturation growth and insulin secretion 46 47 48 may improve the methods described here Because our method is based solely on extracellular factor modulation in the absence of genetic manipulations it could serve as the basis for developing replacement islets from a wide range of human stem cells including neural stem cells and ES cells Supporting Information Accession Numbers The National Center
