 It s Time To Keelhaul U Haul Like all superheroes worthy of the title the Shopping Avenger has an Achilles heel In the case of the Shopping Avenger his Achilles heel is not animal vegetable or mineral but something less tangible An explanation Last week the magazine you are currently reading forced the Shopping Avenger at gunpoint to read a series of treacle filled self help books and then to The Shopping Avenger who can withstand radiation extreme heat and cold hail bear attacks and Eyes Wide Shut almost succumbed to terminal jejuneness after reading these books Except for one thing One of the books The Art of Happiness which collects and simplifies the Dalai Lama s philosophy got the Shopping Avenger to thinking This in a way is the Shopping Avenger s Achilles heel thinking Perhaps it is wrong the Shopping Avenger thought to complain about the petty insults and inconveniences of life in the materialistic 90s The Shopping Avenger felt that perhaps he should counsel those who write seeking help to meditate to accept bad service the way one accepts the change of seasons and to extend a compassionate hand of forgiveness to those who provide poor customer care But then the Shopping Avenger sat down and the feeling passed The Shopping Avenger does not make light of the Dalai Lama or of the notion that there is more to life than the impatient acquisition of material goods If the Shopping Avenger were not for a superhero extremely nonjudgmental as opposed to his alter ego who is considered insufferably judgmental by his alter ego s wife the Shopping Avenger would tell the occasional correspondent to let go of his petty grievance and get a life But the Shopping Avenger also believes that the Dalai Lama has never tried to rent a truck from U Haul If he had tried to rent from U Haul he never would have escaped from Tibet For the complete back story see Shopping Avenger column and one The complaints about U Haul s nonreservation reservation policy continue to pour in through the electronic mail One correspondent B R wrote in with this cautionary tale Last weekend I went to San Francisco to help my brother and his family move into their first house My brother had reserved a moving truck with U Haul for the big day I warned my brother about U Haul s not really a reservation per se policy that I learned from the Shopping Avenger He didn t believe such a thing would happen to him so he didn t act on my warning B R continues as if you don t know what happened already I went to U Haul with my brother to get our reserved truck The store had many customers standing around looking frustrated When we got to the front of the line the clerk informed us that our reserved truck had not yet been returned We asked if we could rent one of the many trucks sitting idle in the parking lot The clerk laughed and said the keys to those trucks were lost B R and his chastened brother the Shopping Avenger is resisting the urge to gloat went to Ryder Ryder had a truck available for us The gentleman who helped us at Ryder said Ryder prides itself on being everything U Haul is not The Shopping Avenger has still not received a call from U Haul spokeswoman Johna Burke explaining why U Haul refuses to provide trucks to people who reserve trucks but the Shopping Avenger is pleased to note that several correspondents have written in over the past month saying that based on what they have read in this column they will be taking their business to Ryder or Budget or elsewhere The Shopping Avenger will undoubtedly return to the sorry state of affairs at U Haul in the next episode but now on to this month s airline debacle Before we begin though the Shopping Avenger nearly forgot to announce the winner of last month s contest in which readers were asked to answer the question What s the difference between pests and airlines The winner is one Tom Morgan who wrote You can hire someone to kill pests Tom is the winner of a year s supply of Turtle Wax and he will receive his prize just as soon as the Shopping Avenger figures out how much Turtle Wax actually constitutes a year s supply The new contest question How much Turtle Wax comprises a year s supply of Turtle Wax This month s airline in the spotlight is Southwest Loyal readers will recall that last month the Shopping Avenger praised Southwest Airlines for its sterling customer service This brought forth a small number of articulate dissensions The most articulate and the most troubling came from M who wrote Last year flying from Baltimore to Chicago with my entire family two really little kids included we set down at Midway in a rainstorm And waited for our bags And waited for bags And waited for bags An hour later M says the bags showed up soaked through We took them to baggage services at SW and were faced with the most complicated unclear and confusing mechanism for filing a claim we experienced flyers have ever seen When they arrived at their destination M and her family made a terrible discovery We discovered that our clothes were soaked through the top clothes were so wet that the dye had bled through down to the lower levels destroying lots of other clothes Obviously our bags had just been sitting out on the runway in the rain To this day I ve never heard a thing from SW despite calls and letters This of course is where Shopping Avenger steps in Shopping Avenger knows that Southwest is different from the average airline in that it doesn t go out of its way to infuriate its paying customers see so I expected a quick and generous resolution to M s problem What I got at first though was a load of corporate hoo ha The airline s policy which is consistent with all contracts of carriage at all airlines requires that passengers file a report in person for lost or damaged luggage within four hours of arrival at their destination a Southwest spokeswoman Linda Rutherford e mailed me M indicates she called for a few days but did not file a report in person until April 12 three days later Southwest as a courtesy took her report anyway and asked for follow up information and written inventory of the damage Rutherford said that M should have submitted detailed receipts and photographs of the damage in order to make a claim Harrumph the Shopping Avenger says It is a bad hair day at Southwest when its officials defend themselves by comparing their airline to other airlines I forwarded this message to M who replied Wow Well of course I didn t file it at the airport on the 9 th because I didn t know the clothes were ruined at the airport I didn t know until I opened the baggage at my hotel and saw the ruined stuff And it s worth noting that we had already waited for about an hour for our luggage with two little kids and impatient in laws nipping at our heels She goes on I did call that evening and was told that that sufficed This is the first time I ve been told that I had to file a complaint in person within four hours When I filed on the 12 th I was never told that I needed any receipts or photos or other type of documentation The baggage folks seemed pretty uninterested in all of this They know that the type of evidence they want is impossible to obtain They also know that on April 9 they screwed up the luggage retrieval and left bags out in the rain a long time Southwest s response actually served to anger M more than the original problem Before they had a mildly annoyed but loyal customer who would have been placated by an apology and thrilled with some modest token of their regret Now they have a pissed off customer Things do look bad for Southwest don t they The Shopping Avenger sent M s response to Rutherford who e mailed back saying she thought the Shopping Avenger was asking for policy information The Shopping Avenger e mailed back again stressing to Rutherford that the Great Court of Consumer Justice would if this case were brought to trial undoubtedly find for the plaintiff the Shopping Avenger serves as prosecutor judge and jury in the Great Court of Consumer Justice defendants are represented by the president of U Haul and that Southwest was precipitously close to feeling the sword of retribution at its neck But then she came through provisionally Yep you can be sure if M will call me we will get everything squared away I m sorry it s taken this long for her to get someone who can help but we will take care of it from here Stay tuned shoppers to hear whether Southwest makes good it promise to compensate M and apologize to her for her troubles The story of M reminds the Shopping Avenger of a central truth of consumer service It s not the crime it s the cover up Take the case of K who found himself waiting in vain for Circuit City to repair his television Televisions break even 1 year old televisions as is the case with K s But Circuit City where he bought the television gave him a terrible runaround The Shopping Avenger

City employee that he really would like to get his television back the employee K says asked him Don t you have another television in your house More than a month later after hours and hours and hours of telephone calls and days missed at work K received his television back Mistakes happen but not Tad the Deputy Avenger found out at Circuit City The case K was told by a Circuit City official was handled perfectly Another official Morgan Stewart in public relations assured Deputy Avenger Tad that We got to be a big and successful company by treating customers better than the other guy The
