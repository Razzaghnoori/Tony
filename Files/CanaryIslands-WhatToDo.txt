fashioned Canaries sailing rigs with triangular sails race against each other on Saturday afternoons and Sunday mornings at Las Palmas and Puerto Rico on Gran Canaria between April and September Other Activities Folklore The folk music of the Canaries stands as a reminder that the archipelago has always been a bridge between Spain and the New World While most local songs sound Spanish others would be perfectly at home in South America Many can be traced far back into the islands history Carnaval For ten days each year Carnaval is the time when thousands of Canarios celebrate the spring Shops and businesses close and young and old flood the streets in fancy dress dancing to pulsating Latin rhythms Villages and groups of one kind or another dress according to chosen themes with magnificent and often outrageous costumes that can take a whole year to put together Bands and dancers mingle with the elaborate floats Tourists are treated with good natured humor and many don masks and costumes to join in the fun The music and dancing continue until late with parties everywhere Carnaval is biggest and best in Santa Cruz and Puerto de la Cruz on Tenerife and in Las Palmas on Gran Canaria where it has all the razzmatazz of Rio s Carnaval and the Mardi Gras of New Orleans Visitors come from all over the world for these events and hotels are often full so book well ahead if you plan to visit at this time of year Corpus Christi After Carnaval this is the most spectacular celebration on the islands though it is of a completely different nature As an act of devotion at this religious time colored volcanic sand colored salt or flower petals are painstakingly arranged on central paved areas to make up enormous artworks in the form of either elaborate abstract patterns or religious pictures possibly copied from an Old Master The most extravagant are to be seen in La Orotava and La Laguna on Tenerife but Las Palmas on Gran Canaria and many other towns and villages throughout the islands also participate The pictures are ruined sometimes in a matter of moments by the feet of the ensuing procession and certainly by the first rainfall Only photographs preserve the memory of months of hard work Colorful fiestas of song and dance food and wine known as Romer as follow hard on the heels of Corpus Christi to redress the sobriety For Children With almost guaranteed sunshine

Puerto Col n Playa de Am ricas Tenerife Peurto de Mog n Gran Canaria and Puerto Calero Lanzarote Shopping In 1852 the Canary Islands were declared a duty free zone in order to stimulate the development of the archipelago and its ports as an Atlantic staging base The plan worked and the islands still boast some of the largest busiest seaports in the whole of Spain In recent years the duty free zone has been transformed into a trade free zone into which goods are imported without restrictions from all over the world and the luxury tax is lower than in most countries Many shops in the main resorts stock cameras calculators watches perfume jewelry leather goods spirits and tobacco in fact all the things that you can buy in airport duty free shops Aside from spirits and local tobacco however there are few real bargains Best Buys Spirits and tobacco are the best bargains Local brands of spirits are the cheapest though rarely of high quality and most international brands are also bargains Local cigarettes are fairly rough but cigar smokers can find both price and quality The cigars of La Palma in particular draw high praise For the really keen shopper uncut gems silver jewelry silks leatherwear and furs may be of interest Indian Bazaars Many of the shops selling luxury goods are owned by Indian entrepreneurs Generally prices are flexible and haggling is accepted as part of the shopping process You may assume that this is the case in any shop where prices are not marked Mercados The most colorful shopping opportunities in the Canaries are at the open air markets usually held on Sunday mornings The Sunday morning rastro flea market near the port in Las Palmas is particularly good and the Mercado de Nuestra Se ora de Africa at Santa Cruz de Tenerife is recommended at any time Many provincial towns and villages hold Sunday markets where haggling is of course all part of the fun Island Products The most celebrated local handicraft is embroidery Many excursions visit craft workshops where local girls are engaged in delicate needlework on bedspreads towels and napkins and lace makers work on doilies tablecloths and other items The beauty of these places is that you can see that what you are getting is authentic Your purchase will also help keep the island s unique craft industry alive Do not expect great bargains however If you are offered lace or embroidery cheap in the street it was probably made on a machine in the Far East Pottery is another possibility albeit a more weighty one There are several charmingly primitive styles practiced in the Canaries Centras artesan as is a small chain of state subsidized crafts shops on Tenerife selling pottery wood carvings jewelry and paintings Last Day Special A few days before you are due to fly home order some strelitzias Bird of Paradise flowers Compared with the price of exotic flora elsewhere these really are a bargain even when packed into an air freight box that makes them very easy to transport home Nightlife In the main tourist centers of the Canaries you can find almost any style of nightlife you require from extravagant and formal floorshows to cheap and rowdy karaoke bars Cabaret Most of
