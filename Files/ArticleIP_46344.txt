 Fight Clubbed Fight Club a movie about a fictional organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp has provoked more than its share of media hand wringing particularly diatribes about Hollywood s infatuation with violence and Faludi esque ruminations about the emasculated American male Fight Club however has not sparked an iota of interest in a real organization of men who strip down and beat each other to pulp the Ultimate Fighting Championship UFC s flameout from national sensation to total irrelevance is a tragedy of American sports a cautionary tale of prudishness heavy handed politics and cultural myopia UFC began in 1993 as a locker room fantasy What would happen if a kickboxer fought a wrestler A karate champion fought a sumo champion Promoters built an octagonal chain link cage invited eight top martial artists and set them loose in no holds barred bare knuckles fights There are no rules bragged an early press release Contestants would fight till knockout submission doctor s intervention or death UFC allowed even promoted all notions of bad sportsmanship kicking a man when he s down hitting him in the groin choking Four hundred pound men were sent into the Octagon to maul guys half their size Only biting and eye gouging were forbidden The gimmick entranced thousands of people well men What happens when a 620 pound sumo champion fights a 200 pound kickboxer Answer The kickboxer knocks him silly in 35 seconds They tuned in for bloodshed the damage as fans like to call it UFC fights could be horrifying Tank Abbott an ill tempered 270 pound street fighter knocks out hapless opponent John Matua in 15 seconds Then before the ref can intervene Abbott belts the unconscious Matua in the head sending him into a fit limbs quivering uncontrollably blood spurting from his mouth Abbott naturally became a cult hero and won a guest spot on Friends Matua walked out of the ring Soon UFC was selling out huge arenas and drawing 300 000 pay per view subscribers for its quarterly competitions But a subtle sport was emerging from the gimmicks and carnage My passion for ultimate fighting which is also called extreme or no holds barred fighting began when I saw the finals of UFC IV Royce Gracie a 180 pound Brazilian jujitsu specialist was matched against a 275 pound beast named Dan Severn one of the top heavyweight wrestlers in the world and a national champion many times over In 30 seconds Severn had grabbed Gracie flung him to the canvas and mounted him For the next 15 minutes Severn pummeled and elbowed and head butted the smaller man Gracie s face grew drawn and he squirmed wildly to avoid Severn s bombardment Then all of sudden Gracie still lying on his back saw an opening wrapped his arms and legs around Severn like a python and choked the giant into submission UFC s caged matches revolutionized the idea of fighting Nursed on boxing and Hollywood Americans imagine fights as choreography a dance of elegant combinations roundhouse kicks clean knockouts The UFC punctured this Boxers floundered Experts in striking martial arts such as karate and tae kwon do who fancied themselves the world s greatest fighters found themselves pretzeled by jujitsu masters who pulled them to the ground and slowly choked or leg locked them UFC immediately debunked a lot of myths of fighting of boxing karate kung fu It showed the reality of what works in an actual fight says Dave Meltzer editor of Wrestling Observer Instead of being carnivals of gore UFC fights looked strangely like sex Almost all fights ended on the ground one man mounting the other in missionary position the pair of them wiggling mysteriously along the canvas for five 10 even 30 minutes There were few spectacular knockouts The referee yes there was always a referee stopped many bouts and in most others fighters tapped out surrendering to mild looking but agonizing chokes and joint locks It was not barbarism It was science The UFC spawned a new breed of mixed martial artists World class wrestlers learned to kickbox Champion kickboxers learned to grapple The karate experts learned to stay home They became without doubt the best fighters in the world Click for more about the fighters Mike Tyson wouldn t last 30 seconds in an ultimate fighting match When Olympic gold medal wrestler Kevin Jackson came to the UFC a fighter named Frank Shamrock KO d him with a submission hold in 16 seconds Ultimate fighting schools began sprouting up all over the country replacing the stylized gestures of the Eastern martial arts with techniques that actually work UFC s promoters predicted that it would supplant boxing as America s martial art Instead it fell apart The collapse began in 1996 when Sen John McCain R Ariz saw a UFC tape McCain a lifelong boxing fan was horrified at the ground fighting kicks and head butts It was barbaric he said It was not a sport He sent letters to all 50 governors asking them to ban ultimate fighting The outcry against human cockfighting became a crusade and like many crusades it was founded on misunderstanding UFC fell victim to cultural determinism about what a fight is In countries such as Brazil and Japan where no holds barred fighting has a long history it is popular and uncontroversial But Americans adhere to the Marquis of Queensbury rules A fight consists of an exchange of upper body blows that halts when one fighter falls Any blood sport can be barbaric whether it s boxing or wrestling or ultimate fighting It is impossible to draw a bright line between ultimate fighting and boxing If anything ultimate fighting is safer and less cruel than America s blood sport For example critics pilloried ultimate fighting because competitors fought with bare knuckles To a nation accustomed to boxing gloves this seemed revolting an invitation to brain damage But it s just the reverse The purpose of boxing gloves is not to cushion the head but to shield the knuckles Without gloves a boxer would break his hands after a couple of punches to the skull That s why ultimate fighters won t throw multiple skull punches As a result they avoid the concussive head wounds that kill boxers and the long term neurological damage that cripples them Similarly the chain link fence surrounding the octagon looks grotesque Critics have demanded that UFC install ropes instead But ropes are a major cause of death and injury in boxing Fighters hyperextend their necks when they are punched against the ropes because nothing stops their heads from snapping back The chain link fence prevents hyperextension When I tell people I m an ultimate fighting fan they invariably respond Don t people get killed all the time doing that But no one has ever been killed at the UFC though boxers are killed every year No one has even been seriously injured at the UFC On the rare occasions when a bout has ended with a bloody knockout the loser has always walked out of the ring But this does not impress boxing fans who are the most vigorous opponents of extreme fighting McCain sat ringside at a boxing match where a fighter was killed When I asked him to explain the moral distinction between boxing and ultimate fighting he exploded at me If you can t see the moral distinction then we have nothing to talk about Then he cut our interview short and stormed out of his office But logic has not served the UFC well Where McCain led a prudish nation followed George Will opined against UFC The American Medical Association recommended a ban New York state outlawed ultimate fighting as did other states The Nevada Athletic Commission refused to sanction UFC bouts barring the UFC from the lucrative casino market One public TV station refused a UFC sponsorship ad The only other organization the station ever rejected was the Ku Klux Klan Lawsuits blocked or delayed UFC events all over the country forcing the promoters to spend millions in legal fees The UFC was exiled from mega arenas to ever smaller venues in ever more out of the way states Louisiana Iowa and Alabama The match I attended in October 1997 was held in the parking lot of a small Mississippi casino The cable TV industry struck the fatal blow In early 1997 McCain became chairman of the commerce committee which oversees the cable industry In April 1997 the president of the National Cable Television Association warned that UFC broadcasts could jeopardize the cable industry s influence in Washington Time Warner TCI Request Cablevision Systems Viewer s Choice and other major operators stopped airing UFC events saying they were too violent for children Never mind that 1 UFC only aired on pay per view so children could not see it unless their parents paid for it and 2 the same cable outfits carried boxing matches R and NC 17 movies and professional wrestling shows far more violent than UFC The UFC s addressable audience the potential number of PPV subscribers shrank from 35 million at its peak to 7 5 million today It was a very cheap way for the cable companies to portray themselves as anti violence It did not cost them much and it made them look good in Washington says Carol Klenfner spokeswoman for UFC s parent company SEG The ultimate fighting industry did little to help its own cause The UFC promoted itself less as a serious sport than as a circus of carnage Its early ads emphasized extreme fighting s potential for death UFC folks accused McCain without any evidence of opposing the sport as a favor to campaign contributors Extreme fighting was tarnished when fighters from the other ultimate fighting operation the now defunct Battlecade were arrested for violating Canadian prizefighting laws when they fought on an Indian reservation outside Montreal In the past two years an increasingly desperate UFC has been trying to assuage its critics The competition which had been gradually adding safety rules since the first fight imposed even more It institued rounds and a 10 point must scoring system It banned head butts and groin strikes You can no longer kick a downed man or elbow someone in the back of the head Fighters are required to wear thin martial arts gloves a purely cosmetic change The UFC imposed weight classes ending the David and Goliath mismatches that made early fights so compelling None of this soothed the cable operators who have kept UFC off the air The pay per view audience has plunged from 300 000 per show to 15 000 UFC can no longer afford its best fighters Some are fighting overseas Others notably Ken Shamrock Frank s brother have become pro wrestlers Fights have deteriorated UFC is limping along but it has been reduced to scheduling events in Japan and Brazil Sports fans want to grow with the sport says former UFC fighter David Beneteau They want to recognize the athletes They want to see the same fighters come back When you compare UFC now to what it was the fighters are not the same the rules are not the same The fans have no story to follow Even as it disappears from public view ultimate fighting is returning to its roots Away from the scrutiny of the major media state legislators and McCain kids are still learning mixed martial arts techniques and small time promoters are quietly staging events You can see Kage Kombat competitions at Dancing Waters nightclub in San Pedro Calif You can watch the Warrior s Challenge at a small Indian casino outside Sacramento Texans compete in Houston s Dungal All Styles Fighting Championship Tribal casinos in Northern Idaho are hosting small Pankration tournaments The Extreme Fighting Challenge is popular in Iowa The money is low the crowds are small and there s not a TV camera in sight Ultimate fighting should have become boxing Instead it has gone underground It has become Fight Club
