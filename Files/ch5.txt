Chapter A Physics of Semanticsach of the chapters of Investigations broaches new territory Each is tentative and incomplete pointing but not fully adequate Yet I persistently hope it is better to light one candle againstwhat the darkness the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before There are grounds reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries to doubt a physics of semantics We are on shaky ground Yet when the first hard frost comes when the birches have been swung their crimson leaves scattered carelessly when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn longlegged knowing how winter is thin when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where perhaps something new is to be foundWe have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady powerful flight The egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom and perhaps more than the vaunted quark But autonomous agents we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf we to whom intentionality and purpose are so inevitably attributed by our common languages we are by my definition of autonomous agents also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties If the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more a properdefinition of life itself then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where purpose is ascribed by all of us to one anotherSemantics enters with purpose For this to be true it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose say the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient be consciousI hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work then do extract work propagating work and constraint construction from their environmentKnowhowBring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal materialI want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had individually and collectively the embodied knowhow to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world Indeed as I have emphasized before a biosphere is a selfconsistent coconstruction of autonomous agents ways of making a living and the search procedures mutation recombination as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents Those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of jobs that were widely filled the abundant niches of the biosphere There is in this whole selfconstructing system a wider knowhow beyond the knowhow of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment Yet clearly the knowhow is distributed There is no autonomous agent no one who knows how the whole system works any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions deals steals hopes and frustrationsWhat in the world is knowhow Philosophers distinguish between knowhow and know that I know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums Know that concerns propositions most conveniently human propositions I know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese I know that the earth circles the sun that the earth is roughly spherical that chairs are used to sit on Know that brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world Perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can know that with respect to propositionsUnlike know that knowhow does not involve propositions about the world Knowhow involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world The cheetah streaking after the wildebeest the athletic genius high jumping have the knowhow to do itDoes a bacterium know how to make a living in its world I certainly want to say yes without attributing consciousness in any way Watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes metabolic switching mechanical twitching sensing of glucose gradient swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations It knows how all right even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business But then try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attentionThank God for knowhow Know that is a thin veneer on a fourbillionyearold knowhow skill abundant in the biosphere But any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents it would seem is also graced by the selfsame knowhow If we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on themThe knowhow is in these terms nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis work tasks sensing recording and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents The knowhow is not outside that propagating organization The knowhow is the propagating organizationSemanticsAll of which brings us inevitably to the brink of semanticsIt is simple at its roots you see An incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is i food ii poison iii a signal iv neutral v something else Once there is an autonomous agent there is a semantics from its privileged point of view The incoming molecule is yuck or yum I think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent And I think we have roughly the Darwinian criteria in mind If yum then there will probably be more of this type of agent osprings of the first If yuck it is not so likely this lineage will prosperOnce yuck and yum we are not far from C S Pierces meaningladen semiotic triad sign signified significans Like it or not the glucose gradient is a sign a predictor of more glucose that way Granted the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain In this restricted sense signs are causally correlated with that which is signified By contrast the relation between the word chair and that which it signifies and on which I am now sitting is arbitrary But can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view If so can mere chemicals be signs in the full Piercean senseI believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words Consider first the famous genetic code Triplets of nucleotides in an RNA molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein The detailed causal machinery involves transfer RNA molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer RNA with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids the binding of the charged transfer RNAs anticodon site to the proper RNA code word triplet the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer RNA molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm tethered by the ribosome to the messenger RNA molecule as it is translatedThe arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer RNA molecules which translate a given messenger RNA code word triplet into a dierent amino acid As J Monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis The same is true of the transfer RNA where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site Because of this which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer RNA is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer RNA Both of these can be altered without altering the anticodoncodon matching mechanism In short chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relationsIt seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign signified and significans to the genetic code It seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling chemical and otherwise within and between autonomous agents as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that warns other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive antiinsect secondary metabolitesThe calculus that is Claude Shannons elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols Nowhere in the core of Shannons work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning or semantics of the information enter This is no criticism and is widely known and appreciated There is however just a hint of semantics in Shannons view that the semantics resides in the decoderI cannot buy Shannons view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent If not then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of waterfilled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways The patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decodingBut if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbolsign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner that sequence of events seems laden with semantics If only the bacterium could tell us Did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me Ive run into that one before I ducked under a boulder and he never sensed me I made it home Pass me some more glucose please MarthaI will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories for I will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and therefore cannot deduce that which will unfold Thus among other things we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds Do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing I too know the risks including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from intentional talk to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question But patience Not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk let alone from legal talk of Henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about soundwave forms monitored and masses at spacetime lines as a descriptionThen lets just be naive for the moment The semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied knowhow of that agent in making a living or failing to make a living in its world The semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered contextdependent set of causal implications of the event or signal in questionFor want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost and for want of the horse the rider was lost more or less said Benjamin Franklin The semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered contextdependent set of implications of the event or signal in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving systemIt seems hard to ascribe purpose in the sense of acting on its own behalf to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga Of course there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological After all I began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf Now five chapters later it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter energy and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf My definition is a definitional circleOn the other hand while the definition is circular like F  MA and Darwins natural selection and fitness that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world Stones and chairs are not by my definition autonomous agents All living cells are And the stunning fact directly before us every day is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf Watch a pair of nesting birds build their nestIn short once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphereKnowingWhat about knowingDaniel Dennett in his fine book Darwins Dangerous Idea advances a hierarchy of forms of knowing if I may use that term that have arisen in evolution by Darwinian means I find his hierarchy congenial and informative Dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higherorder entities via variation and natural selectionI do not disagree although I have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of selforganization in evolution Here in Investigations I am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy detect those sources of energy create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further I wonder in short at the naturalness and selfgeneraticity of Dennetts cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres perhaps planetary geologies and beyondBut back to the past Dennett distinguishes Darwinian creatures Pavlovian creatures Popperian creatures and Gregorian creatures A simple autonomous agent say a bacterium is a Darwinian creature In its simplest version the creature evolves by mutation also recombination and natural selection For the moment no behavioral learning is to be considered So one or a colony or an ecosystem of Darwinian creatures adapts more or less as Darwin told usAt the next level up say aplysia a nervous system is present and the creature is capable of stimulusresponse learning  la Pavlov Indeed aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in expectation of foodAt the next level Dennett perhaps properly reserves this for us vertebrates is the Popperian creature Popperian creatures in Dennetts fine phrase have internal models of their world and can run the internal model with the clutch disengaged rather than running the model in real time in the real world This allows us lucky Popperian creatures to allow our hypotheses to die in our stead I love that imageBeyond the Popperian is the Gregorian creaturenamely at least humans Dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives arrows digging sticks machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes This enlarged shared world gives us more knowhow and more know that Cultural evolution at some point begins to burst outofbounds Hard rock music jangles the minarets of Iran Who knows what new cultural forms will blossom Chinese cooking lands in Cuba and CubanChinese cuisine is invented Whats next under the sun Who can sayI very much like Dennetts ladder of knowhow and eventual know that Without invoking consciousness not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems even without evoking nerve cellsI would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations For example bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of Pavlovian learning already for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level This is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus but I can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter As neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus why not envision a complex chemistry say very complex carbohydratesynthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism Such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a selfsustaining web linking the carbohydrates the enzymes and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops The image is not too far from how it is imagined that idiotype and antiidiotype immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen In such networks for which there is modestly good evidence a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences called the idiotype of the first antibody In turn the second antiidiotype antibody stimulates a third which stimulates a fourth But this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody hence the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space It is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response systemPopperian creatures Why cannot the molecularsensing and hypothesistesting churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor or not such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by Are nerves necessary Plants as noted are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade There are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified Not bad for nerveless nonvertebratesI do get stuck at Gregorian creatures Even here the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language wherever new sentences can be created is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole If the conversation we recent twolegged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive so too is the chemical conversation in any fullfledged ecosystem where we are all instrumental in the lives of one anotherI suppose I am naively driven to consider that the biosphere with its urgent diversity in which emboldened by all our knowhow we do get on with a very rich conversation may very early already have harbored all the levels of which Dennett speaks We humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and email I guess Smart place a biosphere lots to talk about Four billion years of yammering Slapstick comedy may have started a long time agoEthicsAnd what of ethics Does a whi of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents Yuck or yum from my point of view if I am an autonomous agent There are deep reasons for caution Hume told us long ago about the naturalistic fallacy One cannot deduce ought from is From the fact that mothers care for their young we cannot deduce that they ought to do so Hume argued From the fact that Hitler set out to conquer Europe and more and to kill Jewry we cannot deduce that he ought to have done soIndeed Humes injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements We scientists find the facts You citizens across the globe can argue the ethics But if Hume warns us not to deduce ought from is where do values come from at all Humes injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category oughtThe eorts following Hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long twisted arduous Following the dictates of the logical positivists of the Vienna Circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful philosophers as famous as G E Moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances It is wrong to kill Becomes Agggah Does the positivist argument seem persuasive It has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful is itself not empirically verifiable One is reminded of something about hoisting and petards John Rawls of Harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all contractually agree to were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments Thus equality before the law is one contract that Rawls commends to us Equality before the law is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium The emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issueI will content myself with wondering where value and the rudiments of intentionality come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts Where is the place of value in a world of fact So a short soliloquy Facts are knowthat statements But knowhow preceded know that While fully aware of Humes injunction I think that from the autonomous agents perspective yuck or yum is primary unavoidable and of the deepest importance to that agent I suppose we apply the Darwinian criteria Too much yuck this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere Without attributing consciousness to an E coli or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future I cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are aroundAnd again without attributing consciousness once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present If so another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid Ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible You are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control To act ethically you must first be able to act at allBut what are acts in the first place Daniel Yamins is a brilliant young mathematician Now entering Harvard Dan spent a summer with me at the Santa Fe Institute before he learned to drive after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of Jack Szostak at Harvard where at age fourteen Dan was learning to evolve RNA molecules to bind arbitrary ligands Dan and I struggled that summer to make the distinction between the doings of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent Note we say the E coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner But all sorts of molecular vibrational rotational and translational motions are occurring What are actions and what are mere happeningsI do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics But I sense that the distinction between doings and happenings Dans happy phrasing is relevant for E coli tigers us trees and autonomous agents in general We will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organismStrange and interesting is it not that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise Granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier yet I do truly think that the rudiments of semantics intentionality value and ethics arise with autonomous agents I do not think those rudiments suce to jump over Humes naturalistic fallacy We cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context but I think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents
