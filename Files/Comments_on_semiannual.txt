year 2002 grants competition are to refine the Request for Proposal RFP simplify the applicant process for competing for LSC grants and obtain applicant information essential to maintaining a quality legal services delivery system Several refinements have been incorporated into the RFP for 2002 funding including questions on applicant staff diversity staff recruitment and retention strategies staff training and applicant strategic planning RFP inquiries on technology are streamlined and incorporated into the RFP form for technology which allows LSC to assess the technological capacities of the delivery system The RFP was also modified to obtain more comprehensive information on sub grantees that receive twenty five percent 25 or more of the LSC grant award and sub grantees that deliver a full range of services to a specific geographic area within the applicant s service area Evaluation weights assigned to RFP topics have been restructured to correspond with the modifications made to the RFP LSC continues to make the most use of available technology The RFP is fully electronic and is available from the Internet at www ain lsc gov The technology used to capture and evaluate information in response to the RFP permits LSC to compile and assess key information about the delivery system at the program state regional and national level LSC continues to provide technical assistance to grantees in many areas of state planning including but not limited to development and implementation of state plans resource development and mergers During this reporting period LSC retained consultants to assist planning efforts in Florida North Carolina New York Missouri Ohio South Carolina and Wisconsin Technical assistance contracts supported resource development activities in Alabama Louisiana Nebraska and the District of Columbia In March LSC organized and sponsored a national 2 day training on mergers attended by 90 participants These efforts have resulted in the development of additional resources for civil legal services new and more efficient ways of providing legal information and advice to low income persons and more effective and economical structures to assure equal justice to greater numbers of Americans Technology Efforts LSC is in the process of reviewing and awarding its second round of Technology Initiative Grants TIGs It has received 95 applications with total grant requests of over 19 million for projects totaling 36 million Twenty three of these requests are for implementation of statewide web site templates developed in the FY

are scheduled for June two are scheduled for July and one is scheduled for September Dates for three additional visits will be selected in the near future The Results Project The Results Project is aimed at gauging for the first time the type and volume of work other than the handling of cases in which LSC funded programs engage LSC has long noted that its programs provide referrals and community legal education engage in outreach and work cooperatively with other groups to address the needs of the LSC client community LSC recognizes that this work entails great effort and produces significant results The Results Project will enable LSC to describe and quantify that work LSC has endeavored to minimize the burden on programs in the collection of this information through the design of a carefully developed data collection instrument the collection of information only once a year and through efforts to modify existing case management systems to allow for collection of this information The project attempts to identify the number of people served by the following types of work and obtain descriptions of programs efforts and of successes Referrals Community legal education presentations Community legal education materials articles and web sites Pro se clinics distribution of pro se materials including the technologically enhanced approaches Indirect services such as training to other lay service providers and collaborative service delivery models and Other services such as mediation and alternative dispute resolution work The draft of the instrument to collect this information was tested by 22 programs LSC is in the process of reviewing the test results in order to make appropriate improvements Regular data collection is scheduled to begin July 1 2001 Diversity To better serve clients and strengthen program staff and leadership sensitivity to client communities LSC has convened a series of conferences on diversity These conferences will enable program staff to examine the degree to which gender race ethnicity and age have adversely affected the ability of some clients to obtain critical legal services from LSC recipients The first conference was held on March 31 2001 in conjunction with the 2001 Equal Justice Conference and others are planned later in 2001 Client Conference In April 2001 just beyond the reporting period LSC held a three day conference in Hershey Pennsylvania entitled Creating Client Centered State Communities of Justice The conference provided a forum for the exchange of ideas about methods by which the legal services community can better empower strengthen and enhance the lives of legal services clients It convened client and community advocates as well as legal services staff who embrace the concept of client centered legal services Sixteen 16 conference papers were written by legal services leaders across the country on topics that enhanced and enlightened the conference discussions The conference was attended by a diverse group of more than seventy 70 individuals comprised of clients and client advocates members of the bench and the academic community LSC board members and staff and national partners Conference participants reflected a true cross section of the country with clients and advocates attending from more than twenty eight 28 states As part of the participant solicitation process applicants were asked to commit to lead and participate in at least one statewide activity that will promote positive lasting change in the client community LSC will publish a report on the conference in June 2001 The report will capture the ideas recommendations and strategies from the conference and serve as a possible guide to help clients and advocates facilitate client centered legal services delivery in their communities Characteristics of Model Intake Systems As a part of its effort to encourage and promote innovative procedures LSC is producing a listing of draft characteristics of ideal telephone intake advice and referral systems LSC and its OIG have for many years been committed to promoting these systems In arriving at the draft characteristics LSC staff considered a variety of documents describing standards for intake systems including those published by the ABA and AARP LSC also solicited input from leaders in the area of intake systems and presented the draft characteristics during a workshop on Best Practices at the March ABA NLADA Equal Justice Conference In early May 2001 shortly beyond the reporting period LSC s Office of Program Performance OPP notified programs that it was accepting comments to draft characteristics of a telephone intake advice and referral system The Draft Characteristics were posted on the LSC Recipient Information Network and were sent to all program directors via electronic mail After considering comments from recipients and advocates OPP intends to publish the characteristics in a Program Letter and use them as the best practice standard when evaluating programs intake systems Program Mergers Consolidations In anticipation of many program mergers or consolidations due to the reconfiguration of service areas for 2002 LSC along with the National Legal Aid and Defender Association and the Management Information Exchange sponsored a Making Mergers Work workshop during the March ABA NLADA Equal Justice Conference Approximately 70 participants examined the practicalities of mergers and consolidations considered ways in which new service area configurations can better serve clients prepared for the challenges of joining different program cultures and emerging with an effective larger organization and talked with peers about the specific opportunities and problems they face LSC staff presented a session on LSC program requirements for mergers and consolidations The Office of Program Performance has revised internal procedures for handling program mergers consolidations LSC grant conditions require that programs obtain LSC approval of a merger or consolidation before LSC will allow the transfer of the grant from one program to another LSC s internal procedures for clearing mergers and consolidations involve the work of several offices within LSC including the Executive Office the Office of Inspector General the Office of Compliance and Enforcement the Office of Legal Affairs and the Office of Information Management with the Office of Program Performance having primary responsibility for the clearance process Shortly beyond the reporting period in May 2001 the Office of Program Performance held a special telephonic conference for 2002 grant applicants involved in mergers consolidations This session focused on how programs should complete grant applications and the new grant application requirements for applicants which anticipate sub granting part of the LSC grant during the grant year Rulemaking Activities During the reporting period LSC issued a revised final rule on recipient fund balances 44 CFR Part 1628 Under the final rule published on November 7 2000 recipients will be permitted to carry over fund balances of 10 or less will be able to seek LSC approval for carryover balances of between 10 and 25 and will be generally prohibited from retaining fund balances of over 25 except in three very limited and especially compelling circumstances The exceptions would be where the fund balance overage results from the receipt of insurance proceeds real estate sale proceeds or proceeds received as a result of a lawsuit in which the recipient was a party The new rule became effective on December 7 2000 In addition LSC has begun conducting a thorough review of LSC s regulations This project is consistent with the five year strategic plan LSC Strategic Directions 2000 2005 which among other things requires reviewing LSC s regulatory compliance requirements for efficiency unnecessary duplication and burden and implications for the delivery of high quality appropriate legal services As part of this project LSC solicited public comment via notices published in the Federal Register and on the LSC Website in November 2000 The review effort is still underway and a final report is expected to be presented to the LSC Board for consideration in June 2001 TABLE 1 Management Report on Office of Inspector
