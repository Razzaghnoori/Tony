 Why Clinton Screws Around Asking why President Clinton would have sex with all the women he is alleged to have had sex with is like asking why a hungry man would want to eat How many 50 year old men would refuse oral service from attractive 21 year olds if they could get away with it Yet Clinton s circumstances are a little different Every indiscretion puts his presidency at stake Here s a roundup of the top theories on why Clinton would sleep around 1 He s Schmucko According to this theory the affair exposes Clinton s legendary capacity for empathy as a front for his fundamental rottenness He has a bad habit of using people and discarding them Gloria Borger U S News World Report Meanwhile right wing conspiracy theorists like the British reporter Ambrose Evans Pritchard gloat that they have sounded the alarm about Clinton s basic wickedness Whitewater the Vince Foster murder etc from the start See Slate s International Papers for Evans Pritchard s latest 2 He s psycho The Wall Street Journal editorial page speculated that the president suffers from an anti social personality disorder before concluding that in Mr Clinton s case a strict diagnosis does not hold Clinton has no compunction about his multiple sexual relations or the lies he tells about them Like a serial killer he s so self obsessed that he s lost his sense of shame and can t comprehend his culture s mores 3 He s stupid Disappointed Clinton supporters embrace this argument His rampant infidelity is caused by his idiocy Anyone who is that dumb should obviously not be President of the United States Russell Baker the New York Times 4 He s a misogynist Monica Lewinsky s lawyer William Ginsburg advances this view as do several right wing women Seeing women as sex objects Clinton has no qualms about coercing and bribing them into servicing him Thus goes this theory he sexually harasses women who work for him Paula Jones and Kathleen Willey trades jobs for sex Gennifer Flowers and has affairs with subordinates Lewinsky 5 He s a sexaholic The American Psychiatric Association doesn t classify sex addiction as a medical condition but that doesn t prevent the pundits from making the diagnosis Newsweek s Jonathan Alter blames Clinton s alleged sexcapades on the rush that some addictive personalities experience from the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine during sex The New York Post reports a Lewinsky claim that the president boasted of bedding hundreds of women over the course of his marriage If this is true he s either a Don Juan or a sex maniac It would also explain why he allegedly falls back on phone sex when he can t have the real thing The president s family tends toward addictive behavior Mother Virginia Kelley loved gambling brother Roger got hooked on coke and grandmother Edith had a morphine problem Corollary theory The risks of getting caught with Lewinsky added to the thrill and kept him coming back for more Alter says that he may even get off on the brush es with political death that his adultery precipitates 6 He s self deluded Or as Monica Lewinsky put it he s in denial Some say Clinton learned to compartmentalize misdeeds in his Hot Springs Ark childhood Many of his neighbors were devout Baptists despite running the resort town s illegal gambling industry the largest in the South His mother also admitted to habitually blocking out problems by denying their existence 7 He learned it in Arkansas According to biographer David Maraniss Clinton picked up his promiscuous ways early from Hot Springs men who got away with whatever they wanted to Clinton also picked up lax attitudes about sex from his mother who dressed provocatively in short shorts and tube tops and his biological father allegedly a bigamist 8 He needs love Another wounded child theory Clinton craves the affection that his abusive alcoholic stepfather and abused fun loving mother didn t provide him as a child This explains his love of campaigning and his wishy washy please everyone political agenda as well as his many girlfriends An Oedipal permutation of this theory blames his affairs specifically on an early deficit of motherly attention and notes that many of his alleged lovers bear a resemblance to Virginia 9 He s a hippie in a suit Some conservatives including reporters at the New York Post and Washington Times blame Clinton s philandering on the 60s free love attitudes he adopted as an anti war radical and never jettisoned 10 He s a boy man He remains the kid in the candy store without control over his appetites for sex and food Time s Lance Morrow says Clinton constantly pushes the envelope to see what he can get away with like a 2 year old who tests the limits of his independence by toddling off 11 This is a midlife crisis Instead of buying a motorcycle or taking up bungee jumping the graying Clinton paired off with a 21 year old to affirm his youth and virility 12 The Clintons is a marriage of convenience There are several versions of this 1 Hillary knows her husband is a sexaholic but overlooks his infidelity to advance her own political career 2 Hillary is a prude forcing Clinton to satisfy his sexual needs elsewhere 3 The Dick Morris angle Hillary may not be into regular sex with men forcing Clinton to sate his sexual appetite elsewhere 13 Presidents are egomaniacs The best estimates are that 13 out of 42 presidents cheated on their wives Presidents are surrounded by servile sycophants who convince them they are invincible and forgive their sins and this paves the way for sexual affairs Men of presidential quality tend to be arrogant with a sense of entitlement and lordly expectation David Remnick The New Yorker The best example of presidential bravura ever When told of John F Kennedy s womanizing Lyndon Johnson responded God damn it I had more women by accident than he ever had by design 14 Presidents are alpha male studs Evolutionary psychologists explain presidential philandering as an atavistic impulse left over from the early days of the human race Natural selection rewarded men who clawed their way to positions of power with many sex partners i e gave them many chances to reproduce their genes Proponents of this theory recall ancient rulers such as the Pharaoh Ramses II and Aztec King Nezahualpilli both of whom sired more than 100 children Click here to read Robert Wright s explication 15 Power is the ultimate aphrodisiac Women throw themselves at powerful men and powerful men are too weak to resist The star struck Lewinsky appears to have instigated a relationship with Clinton According to her friends she had long fantasized about sleeping with the president in the Oval Office 16 Miserable childhoods bring lovers together This is the most pleasant spin on the whole affair which ascribes no deviant intentions to the president or Lewinsky They were simply two lonely souls who bonded over their shared experience of abusive parents This theory initially emanated from the White House 17 We re his enablers The public s capacity for forgiveness only encourages Clinton s rogue ways We don t make him pay the price for his dalliances thereby convincing him that the risk is worth it
