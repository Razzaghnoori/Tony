 Diagnosis Totally Sane There was a time back in the 60s when psychiatry appeared to loom over vulnerable minds with a kind of menacing grandeur White coats seemed scarcely less ominous than white hoods and fervid anti psychiatrists like Szasz and Foucault inflamed lovers of freedom against the depredations of nosology Nowadays though news of a freshly minted mental disorder or better yet a new edition of the American Psychiatric Association s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders containing many such novelties tends to be an occasion for merriment The DSM now in its fourth edition is the reference book which details all the mental disorders currently acknowledged by the APA As such it provides comic material for a certain contemporary genre of psychiatry criticism that finds it laughable rather than sinister that psychiatry appears to be expanding its territory from real craziness to everyday life coining diseases like premenstrual dysphoric disorder PMS and caffeine induced sleep disorder Countless articles in this vein have been published in the past few years the recent controversial New York Times piece on the absurdity of the diagnosis road rage for instance You re Not Bad You re Sick It s in the Book or L J Davis sweeping stumbling caricature in last February s Harper s The Encyclopedia of Insanity A Psychiatric Handbook Lists a Madness for Everyone Herb Kutchins and Stuart Kirk professors of social work and social welfare respectively have in their second joint effort Making Us Crazy their first was called The Selling of DSM combined the paranoid and the snooty modes of critique to produce a book about the DSM that s more reproving than suspicious and more earnest than parodic Its criticisms are typical of any number of articles attacking the DSM and can be summed up in four of the most common contra psychiatric fallacies bandied about today To wit 1 If you ever do something that s listed in the DSM as a symptom it means psychiatrists think you re cuckoo This is the most common criticism of the DSM Once upon a time the argument goes crazy people were crazy people They were the ones barking like dogs and thinking they were Napoleon The rest of us meanwhile suffered only from ordinary problems of living There is a growing tendency in our society to medicalize problems that are not medical to find psychopathology where there is only pathos complain Kutchins and Kirk The psychiatric bible has been making us crazy when we are just human The problem with this reasoning is that the concept crazy is entirely foreign to the DSM Insanity is a legal and literary notion now not a psychiatric one Mental disorders in the DSM tend to differ from ordinary problems less in quality than in quantity and context Checking to see if your oven is off is not a sign of mental disorder feeling compelled to check it 50 times every time you leave your apartment probably is Which is not to say that someone who checks their oven 50 times is crazy whatever that means but rather that if he should apply to a psychiatrist for help he would find that the psychiatrist would produce a name for his behavior would assure him that other people engage in it also and might offer him drugs to help him stop 2 The DSM changes its mind about what it s going to call mental disorders every few years so obviously we can t trust it as a guide to what mental disorders really are It is certainly the ambition of the biologically oriented majority of psychiatrists to produce a manual of mental disorders which as the saying goes carves nature at its joints one which lists diseases that are each traceable to a unique identifiable malfunction in the brain The DSM as it now stands however has no pretensions to being such a manual The DSM is neutral as regards etiology which is to say that its disorders are grouped according to observable symptoms rather than presumed cause If you look up a disorder in the DSM you will find that it s defined by a list of problems such as impaired motor activity or feeling numb and empty a certain number of which qualify a person as having the disease To maintain then as do Kutchins and Kirk that having an operational procedure for determining whether a phenomenon belongs in a class such as the checklist of symptoms in DSM does not substantiate what that construct or class is is to completely misunderstand how the DSM works Arguing that Antisocial Personality Disorder is not really what the DSM says it is is like arguing that Madame Bovary didn t really do all those things Flaubert said she did Antisocial Personality Disorder is its DSM description Kutchins and Kirk like to refer to the DSM as psychiatry s bible implying that it inspires reverence and is in need of suspicious interpretation but the DSM is better described as psychiatry s dictionary It is periodically revised in response to arguments about usage and usefulness but new disorders do not represent claims to fresh biological knowledge Which is to say that yes a particular mental disorder is whatever the DSM says it is 3 Unbeknownst to the credulous public the DSM is not truly a scientific document but the product of crude politicking and cynical compromises In 1974 after a series of heated and embarrassingly public quarrels on the topic the APA decided to resolve the question of whether or not homosexuality should be called a mental disorder by means of a ballot mailed out to its members The majority of those responding felt that homosexuality was not a mental disorder and the APA accordingly removed it from the DSM s next published edition This incident was unusual and yet not so very different from the APA s standard modus operandi Each edition of the DSM is the product of arguments negotiations and compromises Kutchins and Kirk cite a particularly amusing example of such disputes Robert Spitzer the man in charge of DSM III was sitting down with a committee that included his wife in the process of composing a criteria set for Masochistic Personality Disorder a disease that was suggested for but never made it into the DSM III R a revised edition In response to one of the proposed symptoms Spitzer s wife protested I do that sometimes and Spitzer responded OK take it out To Kutchins and Kirk this kind of ad hoc list making is not science but politics But it s not clear that any science is so pure that it s exempt from committee decisions about what s to be considered valid research Kutchins and Kirk claim that the DSM isn t a true account of mental illness because it s informed by particular social values But of course the DSM is informed by social values Medicine is informed by social values To declare something a disease rather than simply a part of life is to declare it unacceptable and in need of treatment by doctors When is a person too unhappy When does eccentricity become psychosis or political suspicion paranoia How much pain is pathological Under what circumstances should a person s death be described as natural and attributed to old age rather than described as premature and the result of a disease Social questions all 4 The DSM insults the victims of traumas and societal injustice by calling their problems mental disorders thus implying that the victims are wacko and have brought their problems on themselves It s always entertaining to go back and read about the racist inanities of psychiatrists past Take Samuel Cartwright for instance who in 1851 coined two ingenious new diagnoses to be applied to slaves drapetomania or running away recommended treatment whipping and dysaesthesia aethiopis whose symptoms were sloth and a tendency to break things recommended treatment whipping Yes there can be no doubt that psychiatry has been and continues to be used for very dubious purposes and that diagnosis is always inflected by the politics of its creators To assume though as do Kutchins Kirk and many other left oriented critics that psychiatry is an inherently sinister enterprise and that diagnosis labeling people is mean is to ignore many of the ways psychiatry is used Take Posttraumatic Stress Disorder for instance This diagnosis which describes the delayed aftereffects of extremely unpleasant experiences made it into the DSM III as a result of lobbying by Vietnam veterans who wanted their continued suffering symbolically and financially recognized PTSD has since been applied to all sorts of people from the victims of domestic violence to the consumers of excessive numbers of Twinkies It has become one of the DSM s most popular disorders in part because it is so very useful to its diagnosees It makes them eligible for insurance reimbursed therapy for instance and it can bolster an insanity defense Paradoxically though while it s often used as part of insanity pleas PTSD implies not that its victims are crazy but rather that they aren t Before PTSD became a recognized disorder after all a Vietnam veteran suffering from hallucinatory flashbacks and wild mood swings looked to the benighted layperson at least nuts But now his behavior seems ordinary even to be expected Kutchins and Kirk appear to believe that attaching diagnoses to victims must necessarily be in the service of evil conservatism but pathologizing misfortune is a technique more often employed by the left than the right by those that is to say who want to mitigate responsibility by drawing attention to its causes rather than those who want to assign blame As long as psychiatry is in the business of forced institutionalization and it still is though less so than in the 60s it seems clear that the diagnoses that license dragging people off the street can hardly be subject to enough old fashioned suspicious scrutiny But with regard to the vast majority of psychiatric encounters which involve adults showing up in offices and asking for help railing against the men in white coats is mostly beside the point Labels can be reassuring Drugs can be our friends Subtler tools are necessary
