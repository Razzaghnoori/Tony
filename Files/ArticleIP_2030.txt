 The Perfect Tax The expansion of government is limited by the consent of the governed Once upon a time that consent was harder to come by In 1776 American colonists took up arms against a government far less oppressive than the one that now spends 40 percent of our incomes We re more docile now but the threat of revolution or at least mass dissatisfaction remains an important force for good We can harness that force by designing laws and institutions that require each new government burden to be widely shared Politicians are less likely to risk annoying 60 percent of the electorate than 10 percent That wisdom underlies the takings clause in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which says in effect that the government can t take your front lawn and turn it into a park without paying you for it The takings clause forces taxpayers to share in the cost of any taking and so ensures that frivolous takings will meet broad opposition Inspired by the same logic I propose a constitutional amendment capping everyone s tax bill at say five times the average Thus if the average American pays 10 000 in taxes some year no American could be required to pay more than 50 000 that year That would force many taxpayers to share the cost of any new government spending and so ensure broad opposition to the growth of government It s traditional to evaluate tax proposals according to the twin standards of equity and efficiency Before I subject my own proposal to those standards let s talk a bit about the standards themselves A tax system is inefficient when it discourages beneficial economic activities By discouraging working saving and investment the United States tax code like any tax system meets that standard with ease The only completely efficient tax would be one that does not depend on anything the taxpayer can control such as a head tax of 5 000 per year If your behavior can t affect your tax bill your tax bill won t affect your behavior That kind of head tax is interesting not as a realistic policy proposal but as a benchmark for comparison Economists like to say that a head tax has the advantage of being perfectly efficient it does not discourage any economic activity but the disadvantage of being perfectly inequitable the rich and the poor pay equal amounts But those economists are wrong on both counts Let s talk first about equity It is an act of violence against the English language to describe as inequitable a tax that charges everyone an equal amount In the rhetoric of tax policy the word inequitable almost never means inequitable rather it means something like less redistributionist than the speaker would prefer But I don t want to dismiss a substantive concern just because people frequently choose the wrong word to describe it Instead let me make a substantive response Even if you believe that the tax system should be used to iron out income differentials it s still perfectly easy to devise a head tax that is consistent with your redistributionist philosophy The key is to make taxes dependent on variables that are good predictors of income but entirely outside the taxpayer s control For example whites on average earn more than blacks do A direct tax on income might discourage work But taxing whiteness would not discourage anything while still redistributing income on average from the relatively rich to the relatively poor A tax of 10 000 per year if you re white and 5 000 per year if you re black is a perfectly On similar grounds we could tax people for being male or tall or beautiful all these traits are positively correlated with income In the case of beauty though we d have to be careful to tax only natural beauty Otherwise we d discourage expenditure on shampoo cosmetics and dentistry In fact if we enjoy having beautiful neighbors we might want to subsidize beauty rather than tax it you can t always pursue two goals in this case income redistribution and an attractive population simultaneously Regardless of what you mean by equity therefore you can always adjust the head tax system to conform to your philosophy Thus inequity or more accurately insufficient redistributive power is not a good But just as the alleged inequity of head taxes is no vice so may their vaunted efficiency be no virtue The problem with an efficient tax system is that it provides no built in brake on the government s avarice A government that takes 10 000 from everybody this year could decide to take 20 000 or 30 000 next year That is much less likely under an inefficient tax system The income tax for example is gloriously inefficient The higher the tax rate the less people work If the government raised the income tax rate to 100 percent we d all stop working and tax revenue would be zero To convince us to earn an income worth taxing the government is forced to let us The challenge is to make taxes more efficient without making them too easy to raise This brings me back to my proposed constitutional amendment capping individual taxes and tying the cap to the average tax bill Adding a cap to the current system would improve efficiency there would be no disincentive to earn income beyond a certain level while maintaining the natural safeguards against confiscatory government that are built into the income tax In fact those safeguards would be strengthened by the fact that any tax increase would have to be quite broad based As a bonus a cap would bring the income tax closer to being equitable in the true sense of the word The offsetting disadvantages None as far as I can see
