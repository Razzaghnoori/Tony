 Movies True Crime Warner Bros Clint Eastwood in his 21 st directorial effort is a decrepit newspaper reporter rushing to save an innocent man on death row The A list critics who usually puff the star offer only bland praise this time The film is assembled with loving care says Michael Wilmington in the Chicago Tribune It s a wickedly effective thriller writes the Chicago Sun Times Roger Ebert And the New York Times Janet Maslin finds it a quietly poignant involving thriller The naysayers toss spit wads The film is a hopelessly cliched newspaper yarn I kept waiting for someone to scream into the phone Baby get me re write Chris Kaltenbach the Baltimore Sun Says Kenneth Turan in the Los Angeles Times It s a gritty story made in the director s more elegiacal mode a confusion of style and content that is not in the film s best interests No one comments on the movie s most notable feature that here Eastwood crusades on behalf of a character he would have summarily dispatched vigilante style in previous films Check out David Edelstein s Slate review and read a review of Eastwood s Mission Ranch Restaurant in Carmel Calif here The King and I Warner Bros This animated effort kiddifies the classic Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The Chicago Sun Times Ebert says the themes about defying class and convention don t work kids aren t much tuned into that Trying to make the story interesting the creators ladle in wacky animals an evil royal counselor and a hot air balloon action scene and refuse to let the king die in the end The result is an above average Saturday morning TV show says Kaltenbach in the Baltimore Sun The animation gets mixed reviews The cartoon characters faces and body language aren t doing much of an acting job says the New York Times Anita Gates To Robert Koehler in Daily Variety the animation is a curious hodgepodge of awkward human movement tired nature effects and fine painterly backgrounds and detail work Discuss the real version of the musical with other stage nuts in the forum at Musicals net Forces of Nature DreamWorks SKG Reviews for the Ben Affleck Sandra Bullock romance are all over the place Some like Affleck some like Bullock others like neither The soppy plot wedding bound strait laced guy gets waylaid by wild girl produces severely mixed reaction as well Turan in the Los Angeles Times is captivated Besides being smartly written and directed with a lively intelligence the film has several surprises in its repertoire and most but not all of them make this a most pleasant and diverting venture he says The Village Voice isn t buying the overuptight Affleck You can t have screwball comedy if only one party desperately wants to screw writes Justine Elias Richard Corliss in Time hates the whole thing Well it had to come sometime this is DreamWorks first reprehensible fiasco A subtext to the reviews is outrage at the ending which critics try not to give away but still bridle at Forces of Nature is less about the anarchic powers of love and sex than it is about the bond between a man a woman and two nonrefundable first class airline tickets concludes Elias Ebert is beside himself It s not even clever enough to give us the right happy ending It gives us the wrong happy ending he writes in the Chicago Sun Times The Affleck Store part of the official Affleck site has to be seen to be believed Television The Oscars March 21 ABC Raspberries for Whoopi Goldberg s hosting performance at the 71 st Academy Awards Reviewers say she wasn t funny and spent too much time congratulating herself Los Angeles Times TV critic Harold Rosenberg scored her gratuitously coarse language and one liners and cheap political jokes The Boston Globe s Jay Carr hit Goldberg s habit of being her own best audience Goldberg spent too much time laughing at her one liners often she laughed alone Otherwise everyone expressed dismay at the epic record length four hours plus and a dance number strange even by Oscar standards it included what were apparently interpretive steps to World War II but marveled at Roberto Benigni s irrepressible speeches and Shakespeare in Love s upset win Second day stories in the Los Angeles Times and New York Times let the Hollywood establishment lash out at Miramax capo Harvey Weinstein who had the temerity to take the Best Picture Oscar away from Steven Spielberg Weinstein s costly promotional campaigns had paid off more handsomely than expected writes Bernard Weinraub in the New York Times The big spending is seen both as the roots of Shakespeare s win and as portentous of Normandy scale campaigns on everyone s part next year Everything you wanted to know about the Oscars is here Book Years of Renewal by Henry Kissinger Simon Schuster Henry Kissinger who was not gets hosannas for the third volume of his White House memoirs These were the boring Ford years but Kissinger is given credit for masterful analysis trenchant characterizations and vivid storytelling In an almost prostrate review on the front page of the New York Times arts section Richard Bernstein writes Mr Kissinger s history of his own time in office is a work whose breadth clarity of vision and historical scope amply justify its size It is an event a likely classic of its genre Kirkus Reviews agrees A brilliant masterly even seminal book The Wall Street Journal puts things a bit more into perspective Years of Renewal is an engrossing book truly hard to put down at least for aficionados of U S foreign policy writes Josef Joffe You can read Time s excerpt here Find a movie playing near
