 Introduction Synovial tissues isolated from patients with rheumatoid arthritis RA display biologic properties that differ from normal synovium and there is a rapidly expanding catalogue of biochemical and molecular changes that underlie this phenotype 1 We have investigated the feasibility of using Moloney murine leukemia virus MoMLV based vectors to constitutively express cloned genes in primary human fibroblast like synovial cells FLS with the long term objective of defining the contributions of specific signaling pathways and inflammatory mediators to the destructive phenotype of FLS in RA Prior studies have suggested that MoMLV based vectors transduced FLS with relatively low efficiency 2 3 4 5 We designed experiments to determine if viral titer influenced FLS transduction by concentration of retrovirus In these experiments we used a modified MoMLV vector pRET2 designed to improve transcriptional stability in primary cells We also employed the enhanced green fluorescent protein EGFP as a virally encoded transgene to optimize a rapid and efficient superspeed centrifugation technique for concentration of viral supernatant Viral particles were concentrated to 10 8colony forming units cfu ml by superspeed centrifugation at 20 000 g for four hours Up to 50 of primary human FLS were transduced in vitro following a single exposure to concentrated viral supernatant Materials and methods Cell Culture Murine fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells amphotropic PA317 packaging cells and Phoenix E ecotropic packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco s modified Eagle s medium DMEM high glucose GIBCO BRL Grand island NY USA supplemented with 10 heat inactivated fetal bovine serum GIBCO BRL Grand island NY USA 100 U ml penicillin 100 g ml streptomycin and 200 mM L glutamine The FLS cultures were established from synovial tissues obtained during joint replacement surgery in RA patients 6 The FLS were cultured in DMEM plus 10 heat inactivated human AB serum BioWhittaker Walkersville MD USA 10 fetal bovine serum penicillin streptomycin and L glutamine The FLS were used between the third and tenth passage Construction of retroviral vector and producer cells The EGFP cDNA was PCR amplified from pEGFP 1 Clontech Palo Alto CA USA and subcloned into pRET2 a modified version of the MoMLV based MFG retroviral vector designed to optimize gene expression in primary cell lines The pRET2 incorporates long terminal repeats from the myeloproliferative sarcoma virus 7 and a point mutation in the primer binding site 8 A vector expressing the human cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 cDNA was constructed in the same backbone pRET2 COX2 Amphotropic viral producers were established in PA317 cells see Supplementary Material Concentration of viral supernatant by superspeed centrifugation Fresh medium was added to subconfluent producer cell monolayers collected 24 hours later and filtered 0 45 M prior to use Centrifugation was performed at 4 C in a Sorval RC 5B centrifuge using SS 34 or GSA rotors Following centrifugation the supernatant was aspirated and saved for analysis The viral pellet was resuspended in fresh medium by gentle pipetting Quantitation of viral RNA by slot blot hybridization Viral RNA was quantitated using a slot blot hybridization technique See Supplementary Material for full details Quantitation of retroviral titer by flow cytometry based expression analysis for EGFP We developed a flow cytometry assay to rapidly measure the titer of infectious viral particles Fig 1 This assay takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of the EGFP transgene A total of 2 10 5NIH 3T3 cells were transduced with serial dilutions of supernatant The transduction efficiency was measured by flow cytometry and viral titer was calculated at limiting dilution according to the following formula Titer cfu ml 2 10 5target cells EGFP cells volume of supernatant ml See Supplementary Material for full details Transduction of primary human FLS The FLS were plated in 6 well dishes at 2 10 5cells well FLS were cultured with viral supernatant plus protamine sulfate 5 g ml for 24 hours Cells were analyzed for transgene expression 72 hours after infection Results Concentration of viral supernatant To determine if viral titer influenced the transduction efficiency of FLS we optimized a superspeed centrifugation protocol for concentration of viral supernatant Prior studies reported improved transduction of primary cells with retro virus concentrated by centrifugation at 6000 g for 16 hours 9 10 11 We systematically evaluated different centrifugation parameters to minimize the time required for maximal concentration while preserving viral infectivity A virally encoded EGFP transgene 12 13 14 was used to monitor viral concentration and infectious titer We concentrated viral supernatant 100 fold in as few as four hours by centrifugation at 20 000 g with complete recovery of infectious viral particles This data is presented in the Supplementary Material Supplementary Figs s1 s2 s3 and s4 Retroviral transduction of primary human synoviocytes Concentrated virus was tested for its ability to transduce primary FLS As shown in Figure 2and Table 1 concentration of viral supernatant increased FLS transduction We found that 14 2 8 2 of FLS expressed EGFP following transduction with unconcentrated supernatant compared with 41 3 14 7 for 10X concentrated supernatant P 0 01 compared with unconcentrated supernatant and 47 3 14 8 for 100X concentrated supernatant P 0 01 compared with unconcentrated supernatant To provide confirmation that improved transduction of FLS was associated with an increase in the intracellular expression of a virally encoded transgene FLS were transduced with a vector encoding human COX 2 pRET2 COX2 The expression of COX 2 was measured by western blot on whole cell lysates 6 A substantial increase in net COX 2 expression was observed following transduction with both 10X and 100X concentrated viral supernatant Fig 3 Discussion We are characterizing molecular pathways involved in synovial pathophysiology by overexpression of biologically relevant transgenes and dominant negative inhibitors in FLS The limited expansion potential of FLS combined with the low efficiency of existing methods stimulated a systematic examination of various transduction techniques to identify a rapid and efficient method for stable genetic modification of FLS In this manuscript we report a retroviral vector system and transduction protocol with the capacity to express a viral transgene in 50 or more of primary human FLS after a single exposure to virus We have subsequently used this methodology to successfully express a panel of transgenes in FLS L Crofford and K McDonagh unpublished observations We believe this approach will be of value to investigators addressing similar mechanistic questions in FLS Previous studies exploring the use of recombinant MoMLV vectors concluded that FLS were relatively resistant to transduction 2 3 4 5 limiting enthusiasm for this approach The basis for this resistance was unclear but could be attributable to many factors including vector design viral titer or biologic features inherent to FLS Our experiments differ from prior studies of retroviral gene transfer to FLS in several important respects that may impact on the observed results First our viral backbone is a modified MoMLV vector that incorporates genetic elements myeloproliferative sarcoma virus long terminal repeats and B2 mutation associated with resistance to transcriptional silencing following proviral integration in primary cells 7 8 While we did not perform a detailed comparison of EGFP expression in FLS using the modified and unmodified vector backbones preliminary experiments suggested that the modified vector was superior J Yang unpublished observations A similar modified MoMLV vector has been used to stably express EGFP in human marrow stromal cells 15 another fibroblast like primary cell type A second distinction is the use of EGFP as a transgene whereas prior studies relied on lacZ or beta galactosidase The expression of EGFP is readily detectable in living cells by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry and expression can be monitored serially over time in a single culture In contrast to staining for lacZ which is often complicated by background staining from endogenous galactosidase activity there is no significant background staining with EGFP We do not know if analysis of EGFP expression is more or less sensitive than analysis for lacZ expression although we believe it provides more reproducible and quantitative data due to the absence of background staining Using this vector system we observed a low ex vivo transduction efficiency 14 2 8 2 of FLS with unconcentrated supernatant titer of 10 6cfu ml that was roughly comparable to prior reports Centrifugal concentration of viral supernatant by 10 to 100 fold significantly increased the efficiency of viral transduction with 50 or more of FLS expressing EGFP in several independent experiments using FLS lines from separate donors Concentration of supernatant to viral titers exceeding 10 7cfu ml appeared to have the greatest quantitative impact on improving transduction efficiency Increasing viral titer to 10 8cfu ml yielded an additional increase in transduction efficiency in some but not all experiments This observation suggests that factors in addition to viral titer may limit the maximum number of transduced FLS observed using these culture conditions Lentiviral vectors have the capacity to transduce nonreplicating cells 16 and may represent an alternative to MoMLV based vectors for some applications Conclusion We report a retroviral vector system and transduction methodology that achieve stable transgene expression in primary human FLS with efficiencies of approximately 50 These results establish the feasibility of using widely available retroviral gene transfer techniques to study the biologic impact of overexpression of specific regulatory and inflammatory molecules in primary FLS Supplementary material Supplementary Introduction Synovial cells play a central role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory arthritis Much of our understanding of this biology has been derived from the study of primary fibroblast like synovial cells cultured from arthritic joints after arthroscopic biopsy or surgery Stable genetic modification of primary synovial cells is an approach that may be useful in defining the roles that specific signaling pathways or inflammatory mediators play in the joint destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis As our understanding of this biology improves investigators have also proposed that gene transfer to primary synovial cells could be developed as a therapeutic approach to the treatment of patients with inflammatory arthritis 2 3 Recombinant retroviral vectors are widely used in the laboratory and in experimental clinical applications to introduce new genetic material into the host genome in a stable form Retroviral packaging cells routinely yield viral supernatants with titers in the range of 10 5to 10 6cfu ml or higher and titers of up to 10 7cfu ml may be achieved in some cases Physical methods to concentrate viral supernatants have been pursued with mixed results Ultracentrifugation can be used to physically concentrate MoMLV based retroviral particles but viral infectivity is impaired secondary to damage to the envelope protein Pseudotyped retroviruses containing the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein are more robust and can be concentrated more than 100 fold by ultracentrifugation without significant loss of viral infectivity However because of the toxicity of the vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein only transient methods of virus production have been described S1 S2 Bowles et al previously reported a superspeed centrifugation technique for concentration of recombinant retrovirus 9 A MoMLV based recombinant retrovirus was concentrated over 100 fold by centrifugation at 6000 g for 16 hours Supplementary Materials and methods Cell culture The murine fibroblast NIH 3T3 cell line CCL 92 and the amphotropic retroviral packaging cell line PA317 CRL 9078 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection Rockville MD USA The Phoenix E ecotropic packaging cell line was obtained from Dr Gary Nolan Stanford University USA Isolation of amphotropic producer cells A transinfection technique was used to rapidly establish a polyclonal amphotropic producer line of moderate to high titer The pRET2 EGFP or pRET2 COX2 plasmids were transfected into ecotropic Phoenix E packaging cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using the ProFection kit Promega Madison WI USA Retroviral supernatant was collected 48 hours after transfection filtered through a 0 45 M filter Nalgene Rochester NY USA supplemented with 5 g ml protamine sulfate Elkins Sinn Inc Cherry Hill NJ USA and incubated with amphotropic PA317 packaging cells for 24 hours The transinfection procedure was repeated twice Following transinfection with ecotropic viral supernatant 100 of the PA317 cells were transduced with the pRET2 EGFP vector as determined by fluorescence microscopy The successful transinfection of pRET2 COX2 into PA317 was confirmed by G418 selection These polyclonal populations of PA317 producer cells were used as the source of viral supernatant for subsequent viral transduction and concentration experiments The presence of replication competent retrovirus was excluded by PCR for viral envelope coding sequence in genomic DNA isolated from virally transduced NIH 3T3 target cells primers 5 AAG GTGGTAAACCAGGGGGATC 3 and 5 TGAGCAGCT TCATGCCGCTATC 3 Quantitation of viral RNA by slot blot hybridization A nylon transfer membrane Micron Separations Inc Westborough MA USA was soaked in 10X SSC for 10 min and inserted into a BRL convertible filtration manifold system BRL Life Technologies Inc Gaithersburg MD USA Each well was washed twice with 200 l of 10X SSC immediately before sample loading Retroviral supernatant samples were directly loaded onto the membrane without further preparation After application of the sample to the membrane the wells were washed three times with 200 l of 10X SSC The membrane was cross linked with UV light Stratalinker 1800 Stratagene La Jolla CA USA and stored for analysis by hybridization An EGFP probe fragment 800 base pairs was prepared by PCR and labeled with 32P dCTP Amersham Life Science Inc Arlington Heights IL USA using a kit Prime It RmT Stratagene La Jolla CA USA The membrane was prehybridized for 2 hours at 42 C in 10 ml of hybridization buffer final concentrations 50 formamide 5X Denhardt s solution 0 1 SDS 5X SSPE 150 g ml denatured herring sperm DNA and hybridized with the denatured probe overnight in 5 ml of hybridization buffer at 42 C The membrane was washed twice with 2X SSPE at room temperature for 10 min three times with 0 1X SSPE 0 5 SDS at 55 C for 30 min and twice with 0 1X SSPE at room temperature for 10 min The autoradiograph was visualized by exposing the membrane to X ray film at 80 C with an intensifying screen Quantitation of retroviral titer by FACS based expression analysis for EGFP The NIH 3T3 cells were plated in 6 well tissue culture dishes at a density of 10 5cells per well The following day the medium was replaced with 2 ml of fresh medium containing a defined volume of viral supernatant supplemented with protamine sulfate 5 g ml After exposure to viral supernatant for 24 hours the medium was replaced with fresh virus free medium and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 hours At the conclusion of the experiment the cells were trypsinized and analyzed by flow cytometry on an EPICS XL excited by 488 nm light using a 530 15 nm bandpass filter to detect the signal on FL1 to determine the percentage of cells expressing EGFP In all cases serial dilutions of viral supernatant were tested Supplementary Results Optimization of the centrifugation protocol Duration of centrifugation Supernatant collected from the RET2 EGFP producer cells was centrifuged at 6000 g for time periods varying between 1 and 20 hours After centrifugation the supernatant was collected and saved for quantitation of residual viral particles The viral pellets were resuspended in a thirtieth of the original volume of the supernatant As measured on NIH 3T3 cells by flow cytometry viral titer increased 14 fold after four hours of centrifugation and appeared to plateau after 12 hours of centrifugation at 1 34 10 7cfu ml Supplementary Fig 1 There was a proportional decline in the viral titer of the postcentrifugation supernatant Even following concentration for as long as 20 hours the infectivity of the recombinant virus was preserved To confirm the viral titer derived by expression analysis we performed slot blot hybridization analysis on viral RNA in the postcentrifugation supernatant and the resuspended viral pellet Supplementary Fig 2 Following centrifugation at 6000 g for four hours most retroviral RNA was concentrated in the viral pellet Almost no retroviral RNA remained in the postcentrifugation supernatant after centrifugation for 12 hours Relative centrifugal force To further optimize the concentration procedure we examined a range of relative centrifugal force RCF The time of centrifugation was fixed at four hours and the RCF was varied in a range from 6000 to 30 000 g Following centrifugation the viral pellet was resuspended in a hundredth of the original volume Viral titer was quantitated by expression studies in NIH 3T3 cells Supplementary Fig 3 and slot blot hybridization analysis Supplementary Fig 4 We observed a progressive rise in viral titer as RCF was increased from 6000 to 20 000 g At a RCF of 20 000 g the titer of the resuspended pellet reached a plateau value of 1 3 10 8cfu ml Further concentration of viral particles was not achieved by increasing RCF above 20 000 g Viral particles were not detectable by expression assay or by slot blot hybridization analysis in the post centrifugation supernatant at an RCF of 20 000 g or higher The expression data also suggested that centrifugation at a RCF as high as 30 000 g for four hours did not affect viability of the recombinant retrovirus Supplementary Discussion The FLS are the principal cell type of sublining synovial tissue Proliferation of FLS is observed in RA a debilitating condition that affects as many as 1 2 of adult individuals worldwide Primary FLS cultures can be established following arthroscopic biopsy or surgical resection of synovium from the joint Protease digested synovial tissues placed in culture rapidly yield fibroblast like cells After three passages these primary cultures are depleted of macrophage like type A synoviocytes S3 Doubling time is stable between the third and the tenth passages but marked reduction in proliferation rate occurs in later passage cells S4 Retroviral mediated gene transfer is a commonly used technique to stably introduce genes into primary cells The titer of retroviral supernatant is one of several factors that influence transduction efficiency A variety of strategies have been employed to physically concentrate retroviral particles in an attempt to further increase viral titer and improve the efficiency of target cell transduction Centrifugation of retroviral supernatant is a potentially attractive approach to viral concentration because of the wide availability of centrifuge equipment the simplicity of the technique and the theoretical potential for rapid processing of large sample volumes Concentrated recombinant retrovirus generated by super speed centrifugation of retroviral supernatant has been used to improve the transduction efficiency of primary cells including hepatocytes 9 and endothelial cells 11 In these prior reports concentration was accomplished by centrifugation for 16 hours at a RCF of 6000 g We used a recombinant retrovirus encoding the green fluorescent protein to optimize a protocol to rapidly and efficiently concentrate retrovirus by superspeed centrifugation Our studies indicate that the time necessary to recover essentially all viral particles can be reduced to four hours by increasing the RCF to 20 000 g The protocol does not appear to adversely affect the infectivity of the viral preparation as the functional viral titer on NIH 3T3 cells closely matched the titer that was predicted by the degree of concentration Although it has been reported that centrifugation may result in concurrent concentration of noninfectious viral particles or inhibitors of viral transduction S5 we have been able to substantially increase the transduction efficiency of primary FLS using concentrated viral supernatant produced by our protocol This optimized technique may be useful in generating high titer retroviral supernatants from production lots of relatively modest titer We anticipate that this method will be effective in concentrating other pseudotyped MoMLV vectors and lentivirus based vectors though additional testing will be required to evaluate its suitability for each vector system While our studies were not initiated with the objective of developing a therapeutic protocol these results may also have implications for clinical studies The ex vivo genetic modification of FLS has been proposed as a potential approach to the treatment of arthritis S6 S7 In these studies FLS are cultured from synovial tissue obtained by synovectomy transduced with retroviral supernatant ex vivo and injected into another joint of the same individual Approval for these clinical studies was based on ex vivo transduction data in preclinical animal models S8 S9 Essentially all data on transduction efficiency of FLS was derived using retroviral vectors that express lacZ or beta galactosidase Although most authors have obtained ex vivo transduction efficiencies of cultured FLS in the range of 1 5 some have reported transduction efficiencies up to 20 Preactivation of FLS with tumor necrosis factor however may increase transduction efficiency
