 Movies Payback Paramount Pictures Mel Gibson plays a hard boiled bad guy intent on recovering some stolen money in this adaptation of Richard Stark s novel The Hunter which was also the basis for John Boorman s acclaimed modern noir Point Blank in 1967 This version is directed by L A Confidential writer Brian Helgeland and most critics pan it The film is utterly devoid of narrative ingenuity and visual and dramatic flair What one word might best describe Payback How about Loathsome Stephen Holden the New York Times Complaints 1 The violence is over the top Watching it is like riding a roller coaster through a meat grinder 2 Gibson is too chipper for a noir hero H e s like a chipmunk with a Smith Wesson Stephen Hunter the Washington Post Slate s David Edelstein calls it inflated

Edelstein s review Simply Irresistible 20 th Century Fox Negative reviews for this Like Water for Chocolate style magical food romance Buffy the Vampire Slayer s Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as a cook in love and in trouble Critics blast the sappy romance as well as the dismayingly formulaic view of enchantment Magic is signified by levitating people la Mary Poppins playing wind chimes on the soundtrack or flooding a scene with dry ice Desson Howe the Washington Post Roger Ebert who manages to work the odd sexual euphemism the old rumpy pumpy into his review for the second time in three

dissenters have surfaced including the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern and Slate s David Edelstein who says the writers spend a lot of time patting themselves on the back for being aggressively unconventional Watch a clip from the movie here and read the rest of Edelstein s review Dry Cleaning Strand Releasing Critics call this French farce remarkably tame and wonder if an industry known for its cheerful sex romps has lost its edge The story follows a bourgeois small town couple with a dry cleaning business whose lives are turned upside down after a young drag performer they meet in a club ends up moving in with them This sounds like racy stuff but critics say the story has the structure and implacable momentum of a stern moral fable Holden the New York Times and is more interested
