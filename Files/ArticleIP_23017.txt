 The Phantom Menace The B 2 stealth bomber had barely touched down after its first ever combat mission last week when two of its most loyal allies staged a press conference to claim vindication Standing before one of the sleek black aircraft on the tarmac at Missouri s Whitman Air Force Base Democratic Reps Ike Skelton of Missouri and Norm Dicks of Washington scorned skeptics who had doubted the 2 billion each airplane We have seen this type of criticism on every major weapons system said Dicks and when they go to war they work Inside the same media moment footage of Serbian villagers frolicking beside the wreckage of a downed F 117 stealth fighter punctured the technology s invincibility and rekindled the debate over U S reliance on high tech weaponry In 1981 at the dawn of the stealth era James Fallows warned in National Defense that airplanes tanks ships and missiles have grown too complex expensive and delicate to be useful in warfare or credible for deterrent purposes Fallows argued in vain that the United States should instead spend its defense budget on cheap and simple armaments and the military pumped around 50 billion into stealth programs alone Then a decade ago as the military redefined the B 2 s mission from an H bomb taxi to a deliverer of conventional bombs a Republican senator from Maine articulated the silliness of the concept It s the equivalent of saying we re going to send a Rolls Royce down into a combat zone to pick up groceries Today as secretary of defense William Cohen sends the B 2 out on Balkans milk runs Although the B 2 stealth bomber manufactured by Northrop Grumman Corp and the F 117 stealth fighter built by Lockheed Martin are based on different underlying technologies their names conceal a little appreciated similarity They re both bombers The F 117 was originally imagined as an invisible dogfighter but the Pentagon reframed the plane s mission when the geniuses at the aircraft skunkworks failed to push the technology far enough While not a fighter the 45 million F 117 ain t no sissy either It carries a pair of 2 000 pound bombs into combat but it s slow and hard to maneuver The 56 plane fleet only flies at night which explains why it s painted black because it has no air to air combat capabilities If an enemy fighter spots and engages the F 117 it s toast Very expensive black toast At least the stealth bomber begins to live up to its name Designed as a long range weapon that would penetrate deep into the Soviet Union to wage nuclear war today it subsists on a no nukes diet carrying 16 satellite guided one ton bombs or eight 5 000 pounders into battle Editorial writers love to note that ounce for ounce the B 2 is five times pricier than gold Its incredible cost stems from endless development snafus and such mind bending design features as a surface smoothness measurable to 1 10 000 th of an inch The Air Force defends the cost by saying that one B 2 with its heavy payload can do the work of several conventional bombers risking fewer pilots in a safer plane But even the hawks who considered the B 2 s sticker price a bargain when the game was nuclear deterrence grudgingly admit that nobody would ever build such a device to drop conventional bombs on Serbian factories With its subtle curves smooth surface and intimidating bat wings the B 2 is the cooler big brother of the two planes But the smaller F 117 s boxy and angular look gives it a nerdy cachet The two designs represent different strategies for evading radar The B 2 absorbs enemy radar waves the F 117 s awkward geometry mostly scatters them Neither design is flawless It s commonly assumed that stealth planes are invisible to radar They re not they re just very difficult to see And sometimes they re not hard to see at all Stealth technology is vulnerable to older long wave radars and well coordinated radar systems Also the planes are exponentially easier to spot when they open their bomb bay doors even during simple bank turns For those reasons the Pentagon has abandoned its original boasts that stealth planes would be truly invisible The previous watershed for stealth technology was the 1991 Gulf War in which the F 117 pounded Baghdad with impunity and apparent precision The General Accounting Office however later downgraded by half the Pentagon s claim that stealth fighters had scored an 80 percent mission success rate Naysayers continue to heap scorn on the two stealth bombers insisting that the weapons have yet to be truly battle tested because the Serbs and the Iraqis who have faced the technology have put up no more than a token resistance Even so the anecdotal success of the Balkans adventure has refueled the high tech crusade Despite the B 2 s piddling role over Serbia so far two missions involving a total of four planes the Wall Street Journal s Paul Gigot thumbed his nose last Friday at Democrats who had opposed the bomber cracking wise about B 2 Bill and suggesting the Pentagon could use 40 more of the machines The stealth war news comes at a critical moment for the Pentagon which is pushing for the production of a new generation stealth fighter the F 22 Raptor This one really is a fighter The cost About 60 billion to build more than 300 F 22s at 187 million apiece That s nowhere near five times the F 22 s weight in gold but still 10 times dearer than an F 16 The national love affair with stealthy weapons will endure for several reasons Although decades old the technology is perennially futuristic it was the Romulans of Star Trek after all who first invented cloaking and it advances the ethos of American can doism Planes acquire an added allure whenever they re developed in secret The military didn t even confirm the F 117 s existence until 1988 after 40 were built and flying And then there s something perversely sexy about the vehicles max tech black sheen something peeping tom kinky about the planes advertised invisibility something magical about striking without being struck back Despite their technological limitations stealth weapons appeal to us because they indulge our fear of commitment And this is what ultimately makes them pose their own kind of stealthy threat to us As we ve seen stealth weapons blind the risk averse public and policy makers to the genuine perils of combat in the opening days of any military engagement turning war into an out of sight out of mind proposition They encourage the view that there s nothing from Iraqi germ weapons programs to Serbian atrocities that a few invisible planes can t fix Enticing us into believing that wars can be won with Futurama technology and without American blood being shed the seductive charms of stealth weapons ultimately evaporate into nothingness We are left unfulfilled by their limitations and cheated by their costs
