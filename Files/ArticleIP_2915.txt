 Objects of Beauty Still life that most humble of the classical genres traces its origins to a legendary painting contest Around 400 B C the Greek painter Zeuxis was said to have painted grapes so lifelike that birds came to peck at them His rival Parrhasios secretly painted a curtain over the panel of grapes Zeuxis tried to lift the curtain and lost the contest Teasingly realistic grapes and drapes have figured in still lifes ever since Some of the most spectacular examples of the genre which got its name in 17 th century Holland depict great mounds of fruit and fabric that fool the eye trompe l oeil so completely that we can practically smell them and feel them Still life the portrayal of familiar inanimate objects is as the name suggests a paradoxical genre Its French name nature morte dead nature points up the paradox even more acutely If the Dutch banquet pieces suggest endless beauty Holland in the 17 th century was so rich it didn t know what to do with its money there s a darker side to still life that warns of the brevity of earthly pleasures The ancient Egyptians painted images of food and personal effects in their tombs images that were to accompany the dead on their last journey and a rich tradition of European still life painting slips little reminders of mortality skulls and flickering candles among the apples and pears and peeled lemons Still life then is caught between the timeless vision and the ticking clock When you enter the current show at the Museum of Modern Art titled Objects of Desire The Modern Still Life you find yourself in a small white room with only one painting on the wall C zanne s Still Life With a Ginger Jar and Eggplants 1890 94 This is the timeless vision The effect is that of a hushed chapel and on the altar is this gorgeous riddle of a painting with its tilted plate of ripe pears its pendulous eggplants its great blue black bedspread draped across the lower half of the painting and its round wicker wound ginger jar carefully placed in the middle Every form finds an echo elsewhere in the painting and none of the depicted objects calls attention to the historical moment It s a dazzling opening this great C zanne and much of the explosion of Cubist work in the next room builds on C zanne s achievement The gravity defying sepia swirls of Picasso and Braque with their fragments of guitars and violins a fiddlehead here an S curve there a couple of quarter notes waltzing off a table edge somewhere else have a kindred formal harmony Then you turn a corner and enter a different world where the immediacy of modern life of the ticking clock is everywhere palpable Here in a glass case is Man Ray s Gift 1921 a clothes iron painted black with a row of 13 tacks glued headfirst into the face Next to it is Marcel Duchamp s bizarre Why Not Sneeze Rose S lavy 1921 a metal bird cage painted white containing 151 marble cubes a thermometer and a piece of cuttlebone the internal shell of a squid like creature used according to the dictionary as a dietary supplement for caged birds Such objects with their elliptical wit return us to the dark side of still life these bones and cages and tacks and thermometers offer a deadpan answer to what life is C est la vie These ready mades as Duchamp called them pose in a new way the oldest still life question Is it real or is it art Instead of birds pecking at painted grapes we have objects that are real and art Andy Warhol s carefully constructed and painted Brillo Boxes 1964 stacked on the floor look an awful lot like Brillo boxes stacked on the floor Backtracking I found myself wondering what these things had to do with C zanne and the answer is not much For alongside C zanne s timeless forms in subtle harmony another modern still life tradition has flourished more in tune with pop culture advertising and the disposable culture of the 20 th century MoMA which does so well by the scions of C zanne is less instructive about this hybrid line of descent There was space in that little white chapel at the start of the show to include an example of the trompe l oeil American masters William Harnett and John Peto contemporaries of C zanne s who are just as much founders of modern still life as C zanne and whose more playful spirit is just as tangible in the works at MoMA After all the title of the show perfectly fits the objects Harnett and Peto assembled dollar bills snapshots of loved ones jewel studded pistols As one ventures deeper into the 20 th century from Dadaism to Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art it is Harnett one thinks of more often than C zanne Harnett s practice of inserting newspaper headlines among his tacked up objects turns up in Braque and Juan Gris their way of asserting both the up to dateness of their art and the background noise of World War I One aim of Objects of Desire is to show how the same objects in the limited repertory of still life wine bottles and fruits pipes and shaving kits take on very different meanings public and private over time The show succeeds spectacularly in this regard Gerald Murphy s Razor 1924 is alert to consumerist art during the 1920s the so called golden age of advertising The razor crossed with the fountain pen surmounted by a box of matches reminds those in the know that Murphy the model for the hero of F Scott Fitzgerald s Tender Is the Night gave up painting to run the family business Mark Cross pens When a trompe l oeil shaving brush and a match turn up later in the show in Magritte s Personal Values 1952 they have an oneiric suggestiveness quite in contrast to Murphy s flat factuality Superimposed against a blue sky Magritte s comb seems to be lying on clouds of shaving cream a painter s dream while the match lies asleep on the floor Still life objects that have figured for centuries as reminders of mortality can take on new urgency under the pressure of history In Max Beckmann s Still Life With Three Skulls 1945 the greenish skulls on the table look fresh as indeed they were in that harrowing year like not quite ripe fruit Warhol s Skull 1976 now reads unavoidably as a premonition of AIDS Passing through the final rooms of the show one feels the pressure of an argument beginning to emerge Painting gives way increasingly to 3 D sculpted still lifes such as Jasper Johns brace of cast bronze Ballantine Ale cans Painted Bronze 1960 and found objects Those dueling Greek painters return in a new guise as Mario Merz in the Zeuxis role covers a glass table with an array of fresh vegetables and fruit changed daily by a New York caterer Spiral Table 1982 while Christo playing Parrhasios conceals the familiar C zannesque shapes wine bottle vase etc under a drapery of canvas Package on a Table 1961 We re meant to feel that we re coming to the end of the line an impression confirmed in Domenico Gnoli s painting of an empty table covered with a lace tablecloth Without a Still Life 1966 placed toward the end of the show and chosen for the cover of the catalog The still life objects have escaped leaving the bare table the bare canvas MoMA s story of modern art beginning with C zanne and ending with abstraction has been confirmed but at a cost The final rooms feel like classrooms with lessons hammered home The show ends as it began in a small white room holding one object This time the altarpiece is a plain white block of marble centered on the floor Wolfgang Laib s Milkstone 1988 A wall panel explains that a film of milk covers the top of the marble so that a living substance milk has been stilled thus embodying the quintessential definition of the still life Such heavy handed conceptual humor is a far cry from Duchamp s mercurial wit or from the visceral delight of Meret Oppenheim s Object 1936 the famous fur lined teacup Now that s a living object stilled
