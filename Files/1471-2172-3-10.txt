 Background The ZAS gene family is an emerging family of important transcriptional proteins that have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression of the HIV 1 long terminal repeat 1 and genes encoding A crystallin 2 somatostatin receptor type II 3 the small calcium binding protein S100A4 mts1 4 and type II collagen 5 via specific promoter or enhancer elements Three human genes HIVEP1 Mbp1 PRDII BF1 6 7 8 9 HIVEP2 Mbp2 10 11 12 and HIVEP3 13 and their respective mouse counterparts ACRYBP1 2 MIBP1 3 and KRC 14 15 as well as rat AGIE BP1 MIBP1 16 17 have been cloned and characterized In addition a distant relative Schnurri Shn has been identified in Drosophila 18 19 20 Although little is known about the physiological functions of the mammalian ZAS proteins Shn has been shown to be an important transcription regulator during embryonic development Shn modulates transcription by relieving the repression of the nuclear protein Brinker and in association with SMAD mediates transcription response of the decapentaplegic pathway 21 22 Each ZAS gene encodes large sequence specific DNA binding proteins with Mr 250 000 that contain two widely separated of C 2 H 2 type zinc finger pairs Smaller protein isoforms with a single zinc finger pair or with no zinc finger pairs can be generated by alternative RNA splicing 23 24 The amino acid sequence and relative location of the two zinc finger pairs are highly conserved among ZAS proteins from invertebrate to vertebrate Reviewed in 25 Although the zinc finger is a major structural motif involved in protein nucleic acid interactions and is present in the largest superfamily of transcription factors few proteins contain separate zinc finger pairs The ZAS proteins with two zinc finger pairs tramtrack with one finger pair and basonuclin with three finger pairs constitute a unique class of C 2 H 2 zinc finger transcription factors Reviewed in 26 In addition each ZAS protein contains a sequence similar to the serine stripe present in basonuclin in which eight serines are located on one side of a putative helix 13 27 The ZAS domain is a protein structure unique to the ZAS protein family A ZAS domain denotes a composite protein structure consisting of a pair of C 2 H 2 z inc fingers an a cidic region and a s erine threonine rich sequence 15 25 Here we name the amino DNA binding domain ZAS N and the carboxyl DNA binding domain ZAS C The DNA binding specificity of the ZAS N or ZAS C domains from several ZAS members have been characterized by electrophoretic mobility shift assays methylation interference experiments and DNAse I footprinting experiments The cumulative data show that individual ZAS domains bind a B like consensus sequence GGGN 4 5 CC 25 However mouse KRC ACRYBP1 and mouse MIBP1 have also been shown to bind distinct DNA sequences KRC binds to the signal sequences of V D J recombination RSS 14 28 ACRYBP1 binds to a sequence in the type II collagen gene enhancer 5 MIBP1 binds to a TC rich element present in the somatostatin type II receptor gene enhancer 3 This is the first study to evaluate DNA targets of both ZAS domains from a single protein independently We used site selection amplification binding assays to select specific DNA targets recognized by KRC fusion proteins containing ZAS N or ZAS C from an initial oligonucleotide pool containing degenerate 25 mers After cloning and DNA sequencing the KRC selected sequence datasets were analyzed by the computer program Multiple Expectation Maximum for Motif Elicitation MEME version 3 0 to generate sets of position specific scoring matrices PSSMs or motifs 30 When the program was set to identify wider sequences 9 nucleotides the PSSMs were homologous to Sb 29 the B motif 31 and the canonical heptamer and nonamer elements of the RSS 32 However shortening the width of the motifs to 5 nucleotides the target length for the C 2 H 2 zinc finger pairs of the tramtrack 33 the ZAS N dataset yielded two motifs GGTAT and T T C TT T G G and the ZAS C dataset yielded a single motif TGTGG Juxtaposition of the two pentamers of ZAS N forms a sequence homologous to the canonical RSS nonamer GGTTTTTGT Similarly the ZAS C pentamer together with its complement form the canonical RSS heptamer palindrome CACTGTG The computer program Multiple Alignment Sequence Tool MAST version 3 0 34 was used to search human and mouse genome databases for DNA elements matching the KRC selected PSSMs The hits included sequence matching DNA regions located within or close to mobile genetic elements including the diversity D gene segments of the variable region of the immunoglobulin Ig heavy chain 35 and break points of chromosomal translocation between Ig DH2 2 and the B cell lymphoma 1 BCL 1 gene 36 and between the ENL MLLT1 LTG19 gene and myeloid lymphoid leukemia MLL gene 37 Results Amplification of KRC s DNA targets with a site selection amplification binding assay In this study sequences bound by the DNA binding domains of KRC were identified in a site selection PCR amplification DNA binding assay KRC ZAS N or KRC ZAS C 100 g each Fig 1A were initially incubated with an pool of 32P labeled degenerate oligonucleotides and non specific competitor DNA poly dI dC 10 g DNA protein complexes and unbound DNA were then resolved on a 5 polyacrylamide gel and the protein bound DNA was purified and amplified The oligonucleotides in the degenerate pool were composed of twenty five random nucleotides 25 mer in the middle flanked by a specific sequence BSS1 at one end and the complementary sequence of BSS2 at the other end Subsequently the primer set BSS1 and BSS2 was used to amplify the recovered oligonucleotides by PCR The sequence of binding selection and amplification was repeated several times before protein selected oligonucleotides were cloned sequenced and analyzed To select optimal binding sequences the stringency of succeeding rounds of the selection procedures was increased by using successively less 0 5 fusion proteins and more 4 non specific competitor DNA in each round The formation of protein DNA complexes was monitored throughout the site selection experiments Fig 1Band Fig Analytical EMSAs were performed under more stringent conditions than in EMSAs used to purify protein bound oligonucleotides in the site selection experiments using much less fusion protein 0 1 to 0 5 g and an excess non specific DNA poly dI dC 10 g Initially the DNA protein complexes formed between the degenerate oligonucleotide pool and KRC ZAS N or KRC ZAS C were barely detectable indicating that both fusion proteins bound DNA selectively Figs 1Band 1C lane 1 In the subsequent rounds the yield of the DNA protein complexes increased suggesting successful enrichment of KRC binding sites in the recovered oligonucleotides during the selection procedures After the fourth rounds of selection and amplification no further increase in the amount of DNA protein binding complexes was observed The experiment therefore was stopped at the fifth round for both fusion proteins Furthermore in rounds four and five a cluster of close migrating DNA protein complexes were observed for KRC ZAS N Fig 1B lanes 4 and 5 In EMSA the gel mobility of DNA protein complexes depends on the overall mass of the binding proteins 38 and on the possible protein induced bending angle of DNA 39 Since a single fusion protein was used in each binding reaction the slight variation in the gel mobility of the DNA protein complexes may reflect that KRC has more than one target or that the targets were located at different positions within the 25 mer DNA Similarly two closely migrating DNA protein complexes were clearly seen for KRC ZAS C at rounds three through five labeled C Fig 1C lanes 3 4 and 5 In addition another complex labeled C which was minor and had significantly slower gel mobility was observed in round four and round five Fig 1C lanes 4 and 5 Previously we showed that KRC ZAS C bound DNA as dimers tetramers and multiple of tetramers 28 The significant difference in the gel mobility between complex C and complex C suggested that they were likely composed of KRC ZAS C dimer and tetramer respectively These data show that the site selection amplification binding assays using both KRC DNA binding domains were efficient in selecting KRC targets and that KRC ZAS C readily formed highly ordered DNA protein structures DNA oligonucleotides recovered from the fifth rounds of site selections were cloned into plasmid vectors We obtained fifty three KRC ZAS N selected sequences and forty nine KRC ZAS C selected sequences The 25 mer sequences of individual site selected sequences from each fusion protein are shown in the BSS1 N 25 BSS2 orientation Figure 2 These sequences were named tentatively after ZAS N or ZAS C correspondingly and a suffix a number given in the order of plasmid DNA preparation Gaps in the numberings represented clones with empty vectors and therefore were excluded from Figure 2as they most likely resulted from cloning artifacts Among the protein selected sequences 6 out of 53 ZAS N sequences ZAS N 9 and ZAS N 10 ZAS N 11 and ZAS N 16 and ZAS N 39 and ZAS N 40 and 2 out of 49 ZAS C selected sequences ZAS C 44 and ZAS C 45 were identical The redundancy observed during DNA amplification appeared to be minimal and therefore the complexity of the protein selected DNA sequences in the datasets should be high Motif discovery by MEME 6 W 25 nucleotides The fifty three KRC ZAS N selected sequences ZAS N dataset and 49 KRC ZAS C selected sequences ZAS C dataset were first analyzed by the Motif Expectation Maximum for Motif Elicitation MEME computer program MEME analyzes input sequences for similarities and produces a PSSM or motif for each pattern it discovers 30 We set the parameters of MEME as follows i zero or one occurrences of a single motif per sequence ii five as the maximum number of motifs to identify iii 5 to 25 nucleotides as the range of motif size and iv both DNA strands as input The first pass of MEME for 6 W 25 nucleotides generated a single 25 mer TG rich motif found in all 53 sequences in the ZAS N dataset Fig 3 The log likelihood ratio llr the logarithm of the ratio of the probability of the occurrences of the motif given the motif model likelihood given the motif versus their probability given the background model likelihood given the null model was calculated to be 370 The E value which is an estimate of the expected number of motifs with the given log likelihood ratio and with the same width and number of occurrences that one would find in a similarly sized set of random sequences was calculated to be 1 1e 90 The llr and E value scores suggested that the PSSMs discovered were statistically significant Using the ZAS C dataset a similar pass of MEME also generated a TG rich motif with llr of 222 and an E value of 2 3e 37 Fig 4 A sequence comparison showed that the ZAS N PSSM was generally homologous to that of the ZAS C PSSM with 2 3 guanines at both ends and a T rich sequence in the middle In fact when the two datasets were combined for a pass of MEME a 25 mer motif with llr of 526 and an E value of 2 9e 134was obtained data not shown suggesting ZAS N and ZAS C have similar DNA targets Furthermore we were able to align the B motif the Sb sequence the RSS nonamer and part of the RSS heptamer TGTG with both PSSMs Figs 3and 4 As a control several sets of 50 random 25 mers were generated by a random number generator G 1 A 2 T 3 C 4 and none yielded any statistically significant PSSMs where E values 1 0 when analyzed by MEME under the same settings data not shown Motif discovery by MEME 6 W 15 nucleotides A motif of 25 nucleotides was obtained in the above MEME analysis when widths of 6 W 25 nucleotides were set This is longer than known transcription factor binding sites In addition the information content measured in bits which reflects the degree of conservation of each column or position in those PSSMs was relatively low ranging from 0 to 1 7 with an overall average 0 5 per position Figs 3and 4 To elucidate more biologically relevant motifs with higher information content a second pass of MEME was performed with motif widths set to shorter lengths ranging from 6 to 15 nucleotides The PSSMs discovered for each width all had significantly higher overall bits per position and obtained a TG rich core sequence data not shown Representative results of passes of MEME with W 9 nucleotides are presented in Figures 5 6 7 8 9 In those passes two PSSMs were discovered in the ZAS N dataset One motif with a consensus sequence G T G T A A T T T T T G T G was found in 50 of the 53 sequences of the ZAS N dataset with a llr of 276 and an E value of 1 5e 18 This PSSM was more conserved than the 25 mer PSSM described above with bits for all positions ranging from 0 2 to 1 9 and an average bits position of 0 9 Figure 5 We were able to align the canonical RSS nonamer and Sb with this PSSM The second motif GGTTGTTC was found only in two input sequences had a llr of 26 and E value of 9 6e 3 and was similar to the B motif Figure 6 A similar pass of MEME discovered three motifs in the ZAS C dataset The major motif had a consensus sequence A T T T A T T G T G G with a llr of 125 and an E value of 1 5e 2 Figure 7 This consensus sequence aligns with canonical RSS nonamer Notably the terminal 5 nucleotides T G T G G each had an information content of 1 5 bits and were nearly invariant in that sequence alignment With respect to the heptamer canonical sequence CACAGTG the CAC sequence bordering the recombination site is the most conserved segment of the sequence 32 and mutation of these nucleotides has been found to decrease V D J joining in transfection assays using recombination substrates 40 Because the sequence of the canonical RSS heptamer is palindrome we speculate that the TGTG sequence may be sufficient for KRC ZAS C binding A second motif also contained a TGTG core sequence Figure 8 A third sequence was homologous to the RSS nonamer B or Sb sequences Figure 9 In general PSSMs generated from MEME passes looking for shorter motifs yielded more conserved sequences Motif discovery by MEME W 5 nucleotides KRC and tramtrack TTK share the same class of C 2 H 2 zinc finger pairs The crystal structure of the zinc finger pairs of tramtrack DNA duplex revealed that the two fingers together contacted 5 base pairs A 1G 2G 3A 4T 5 in the major groove of DNA The first finger interacts with A 1G 2G 3while the second finger interacts with G 3A 4T 5 33 By inference each zinc finger pair of KRC might also bind to a pentamer To test this hypothesis a pass of MEME was performed with a fixed width of 5 nucleotides Two PSSMs were obtained for the ZAS N dataset One motif was an invariant GGTAT Figure 10 and the other was T T G T T G G Figure 11 Both motifs when superimposed form a sequence that is homologous to the RSS nonamer GGTTTTTGT It is possible that two KRC molecules may be needed to interact with an RSS nonamer one protein whose ZAS N domains may bind to the 5 half of an RSS nonamer while a second protein s ZAS N domain may bind to the 3 half of an RSS For the ZAS C dataset a single motif TGTG G T was obtained Figure 12 Since the RSS heptamer is a palindrome it is possible for two KRC molecules to bind to an RSS heptamer with one ZAS C binding to the top strand and the other ZAS C binding to the bottom strand This notion is consistent with previous observation that two molecules of KRC ZAS C are required for DNA binding 28 Further passes of MEME with W 3 were too short to generate statistically significant motifs data not shown These data suggest that with respect to the RSS canonical elements KRC ZAS N binds the nonamer more efficiently while KRC ZAS C binds the heptamer more efficiently and that two KRC molecules may be needed to bind a single RSS element MAST analysis The human and mouse genomes in the GenBank databases were searched with the KRC bound sequences identified as PSSMs by the MEME program with the Multiple Alignment Search Tool MAST MAST is a program designed to search biological sequence databases for sequences that contain one or more of a group of known motifs 34 Of a total of 923 310 sequences analyzed only a total of 15 hits were obtained 5 hits for KRC ZAS N Figure 13 and 10hits for KRC ZAS C Figure 14 Significantly 20 and 40 of the hits derived from KRC ZAS N and KRC ZAS C respectively came from the D gene segments of the variable region of human or mouse Ig heavy chains For example the KRC ZAS C consensus sequence ATTTTGTGG matches completely with 6 nucleotides of the RSS nonamer and 3 flanking nucleotides of the human IgH D1 D2 D3 and D4 gene segments 35 Furthermore the MAST search identified KRC selected motifs near two chromosomal breakpoints between a t 11 14 translocation of the Ig DH2 2 gene segment and the B cell lymphoma 1 BCL 1 gene in a mantle cell lymphoma 36 and at a t 11 19 translocation of the myeloid lymphoid leukemia MLL gene and the ENL MLLT1 LTG19 gene in a T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia 37 The other hits were derived from loci of cellular genes pseduogenes or DNA fragments 41 42 43 44 The expression of those genes has not been shown to be regulated by KRC or other family members therefore the biological significance of those MAST results is unknown The result of the MAST analysis identifies probable endogenous KRC targets and suggests that KRC might interact with genetic elements involved in legitimate or illegitimate V D J recombination KRC bound sequences match RSS elements within endogenous antigen receptor gene segments Although RSS are evolutionarily conserved the sequences of individual nonamer and heptamers vary 32 40 To further determine the physiological significance of KRC s DNA binding we compared the datasets with known endogenous RSSs of Ig and TCR loci The mouse TCR chain J gene segments TCRAJ and the human Ig light chain genes IgV were analyzed taking advantage of the fact that both loci have been sequenced and the location and sequence of their RSSs have been characterized 45 46 Of the 97 IgV gene segments listed 42 43 have a nonamer a heptamer or both matching a sequence within the datasets Figure 15 Similarly 20 out of 59 34 of the TCRAJ RSS elements matched one or more sequences in the datasets Figure 15 As controls only 0 1 5 of random sequences from several data sets matched the endogenous RSS sequences data not shown Potentially the DNA binding domains of KRC might interact with the range of heptamer and nonamer sequences found in endogenous antigen receptor loci Discussion KRC was independently cloned due to its ability to bind the RSS 14 and the B 4 motifs Subsequently sequence analysis identified KRC as a member of the ZAS family of proteins which share the ability to bind B like motifs 15 DNA competition analysis showed that KRC fusion proteins containing the ZAS C domain bind specifically to both the RSS and to the B motif 14 28 DNA footprinting analysis further showed that KRC ZAS C binds to specific nucleotides within the B and the heptamer of the RSS 14 In this study using a PCR based DNA binding site selection and amplification procedure we demonstrated that both the N terminal ZAS N and the C terminal ZAS C domains are able to bind GT rich DNA sequences and confirmed that the RSS and B motifs are the high affinity targets of KRC In the site selection experiment the increasing yield of DNA protein complexes in successive rounds of DNA amplification and purification suggest that KRC ZAS N and KRC ZAS C bound DNA specifically Conceivably repetitive binding selection and amplification should have selected increasingly specific KRC targets as increasingly stringent binding conditions were established As far as we know this is the first DNA site selection study to employ the MEME program to identify target consensus sequence The program has been conventionally used to identify conserved motifs in proteins It was chosen as a DNA motif search tool in this study due to its flexibility in recognizing several patterns within a set of sequences It was able to identify multiple motifs that could not be recognized by other alignment programs such as Pileup GCG Software Package 47 or Clustal W 48 which have been used in other site selection experiments to identify a single consensus sequence The oligonucleotide pool presented in this study was composed of a random 25 mer flanked by specific primers A relatively large target was used to accommodate ligands with a range of potential sizes and also to minimize the influence of flanking primer sequences Inspection of the sequence alignments shows that all of the KRC bound oligonucleotides align in the orientation suggesting that orientation of binding may have been influenced by the flanking sequence However the flanking sequences were constant throughout the oligonucleotide pool which should have controlled for their relative contribution to consensus sequence Using the ZAS N and ZAS C selected DNA sequences as input the MEME program discovered motifs containing sequences similar to the B or Sb transcriptional enhancer motifs as well as the conserved heptamer or nonamer elements of the RSS Generally the significance of the llr and E values scores of a motif generated by MEME increased with its length whereas the information content per nucleotide position decreased Figures 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 These are statistical values showing different parameters of a motif llr and E values reflect the likelihood of a motif being generated at random whereas the information content represents the degree of conservation In our analysis passes of MEME where the width was not set to a fixed length but to a given range of nucleotides always yielded the longest motif The MEME program aims at generating motifs with the most probable occurrence and the length of a motif may override other parameters in the algorithm MEME is a useful tool with which to discover the best motif among DNA sequences provided the length is specified and determined experimentally Given that the crystal structure of the DNA protein complex revealed that the C 2 H 2 zinc finger pair of TTK like the first two zinc fingers of DNA Zif268 binds five base pairs 27 we hypothesize that each zinc finger pair of KRC may also interact with five base pairs Passes of MEME for pentameric motifs yielded homologous TG rich sequences for the KRC ZAS N and KRC ZAS C datasets T T G T T G G and GGTAT for KRC ZAS N and TGTGG T for KRC ZAS C We had previously shown by methylation interference analysis that KRC ZAS C bound specifically to the sequence TGTGG within the context of the canonical RSS heptamer plus the immediately flanking guanine 14 Because the pentamer motif for KRC ZAS C predicted by MEME completely matched with the empirical results we conclude that the two pentameric motifs discovered by MEME are likely authentic binding sites for KRC ZAS N as well The putative DNA binding sequences of the ZAS N and ZAS C domains as determined by MEME width 5 were homologous Specific DNA binding of separate paired C 2 H 2 zinc fingers depends on the amino acid sequences of the finger domains the linker sequence between fingers and the higher ordered structure of fingers The structure of individual C 2 H 2 fingers as determined by 2D NMR methods has shown that each zinc finger consists of two N terminal short anti parallel sheets followed by an helix The amino acid residues at position 1 2 3 and 6 of the helix form base contacts with DNA Reviewed in 49 The amino acid sequences of the zinc finger pairs among the ZAS proteins are highly conserved Reviewed in 25 The conservation of the zinc fingers from invertebrate to vertebrate species and their common DNA binding target sequences suggest that these proteins may play similar physiological roles in diverse organisms While the overall sequence identity between human and mouse KRC is 80 their corresponding zinc finger pairs are completely identical 25 Figure 16 Notably for those critical amino acid residues within the helical regions of the finger described above they are identical at all corresponding positions between the first and second zinc fingers of the ZAS N and ZAS C domains except at position 3 of the first zinc finger Val in ZAS N Met in ZAS C and at position 2 of the second zinc finger Ser in ZAS N Gly in ZAS C Because Val and Met are both non polar amino acids and Ser and Gly are both polar and uncharged amino acids those amino acid substitutions between ZAS N and ZAS C may result in minor changes in the tertiary structure of the zinc fingers which account for the subtle differences in the DNA binding properties of the ZAS N and ZAS C domains The differences in the linker regions TGERP for ZAS N and TDVRP for ZAS C which presumably interact with the sugar phosphate backbone of DNA and the observation that KRC ZAS C more readily forms higher ordered structures with DNA than KRC ZAS N may also contribute to the differences in the DNA binding of ZAS N and ZAS C Based on the results here we hypothesize that each DNA binding domain of KRC binds to pentameric TG rich sequences Two KRC binding sites when put together can form some longer known KRC targets For example a copy of GGTTT and its complement can form a sequence GG N 5 6 CC fulfilling the minimal DNA binding requirement for the ZAS proteins other than a lack of the 5 guanine 25 Similarly the GT rich RSS nonamer and the palindromic RSS heptamer can serve as binding sites of KRC Furthermore our hypothesis can explain why half sites but not complete KRC targets were frequently found in the protein selected datasets Although previous results of protein titration experiments suggested that KRC ZAS C binds DNA in a cooperative manner for a given oligonucleotide the presence of multiple binding sites might not be favored over a single site in our site selection assay which used a degenerate pool of oligonucleotides and limited rounds of amplification The data suggest that both DNA binding domains of KRC are potentially capable of binding to either RSS heptamer or nonamer Because the pentameric motifs derived from the KRC ZAS N dataset more closely resemble the canonical RSS nonamer and the motif derived from the KRC ZAS C dataset more closely resemble the canonical RSS heptamer and a canonical sequence was derived from the majority of sequences we propose that the ZAS N domain of KRC binds RSS nonamers more frequently than the ZAS C domain and vice versa for the RSS heptamer in vivo Conclusions Our results suggest that KRC binds with individual endogenous RSS elements and transcriptional enhancer motifs As the most abundant RSS binding species detected in thymus 50 it is intriguing to propose a role for KRC in regulation of the V D J recombination process Several studies have shown that the RSS themselves may act as cis acting elements which influence recombination frequency 51 52 53 54 55 56 Furthermore affinity of KRC for the RSS has been shown to vary inversely with activation of the catalytic components of the V D J recombinase RAG1 and RAG2 57 It is possible that differential affinity of KRC for individual RSS influences RSS utilization by the recombinase allowing differential recombination of gene segments Our finding that KRC binds to the RSS as well as the B motif may also provide a link between transcription and recombination in the context of the accessibility model 58 59 Enhancer or promoter elements are important for the recombination process in cell lines and animal models 60 Similarly expression of transcription factors in conjunction with the recombination activating genes has been shown to induce V D J recombination in non lymphoid tissues by rendering RSS accessible to the recombinase 61 The B motif first found in the Ig light chain 62 and later in the TCR 2 locus 31 has been shown to promote V D J recombination by modulating locus accessibility 63 In addition to influencing recombination by binding of RSS KRC binding of the B motif may modulate accessibility and transcription of target loci The ability of KRC to promote transcription of target genes has been demonstrated for the S100 mts1 gene by binding at the Sb enhancer motif 4 Similarly binding of B like motifs by other ZAS proteins has also been implicated in transcriptional regulation 1 2 3 17 Considering KRC s target sequences the B motif and the RSS the two binding domains on a single KRC protein could theoretically bring together cis acting DNA elements for gene regulation V D J recombination or both Such a molecule could coordinate transcription of individual promoter or enhancer elements and or could physically connect different cellular machineries via distinct DNA elements KRC could provide a link between the fundamental processes of DNA transcription and V D J recombination Methods Oligonucleotides Oligonucleotides were synthesized chemically Life Technologies

hours DNAs were purified by phenol chloroform extraction followed by alcohol precipitation then were amplified by PCR using the BSS1 and BSS2 primer set Subsequently a portion of the DNA was labeled with 32P dCTP and used for the next round of site selection After the first round the stringency of each succeeding round of site selection was increased by using successively less 0 5 fusion proteins
