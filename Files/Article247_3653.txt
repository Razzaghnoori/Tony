 British Airways Unfriendly Skies Over the years advertisers have tried all kinds of tactics to attract customers and more recently those tactics have seemed to cover the full spectrum of the possible including the utterly oblique Infiniti s first campaign the willfully tacky Mentos the memorable for memorability s sake Outpost com s flying gerbils and ravenous wolves and the self loathing Sega s Japanese ads for Dreamcast which I wrote about here last week But in one of its new ads British Airways of all companies seems to be pioneering a still relatively uncharted strategy mocking its own customers and its most lucrative customers at that The ad is set in an elementary school or whatever the British call elementary school classroom where the kids are engaged in a furious game of musical chairs Its basic premise is that certain kinds of people end up doing certain kinds of jobs when they grow up which is certainly an unsurprising enough premise And for the first 20 seconds or so of the ad as different children find seats in different ways and thereby demonstrate their eventual fates as the camera zooms in on the individual kids their eventual professions appear on screen the ad too is unsurprising Then a boy with curly hair and glasses I think though I ve seen the ad only a couple of times realizes that he s been frozen out that all the seats have been taken and he s lost His response is to throw a tantrum and he stomps around complaining presumably at the top of his lungs though the ad is silent except for the announcer s voice over at this unjust turn of events And on screen appears the word CEO The camera pans down the occupied seats to alight upon a fresh scrubbed English lass who stands up and lets the peevish boy sit down much to his self satisfied delight The ad closes with the girl in the foreground smiling at the camera because she is of course the perfect future British Airways flight attendant The our flight attendants are generous souls who will sacrifice anything for the pleasure and comfort of their charges message is not odd here But the CEOs are spoiled children whose main talent consists of yelling and screaming until they get what they want even at the cost of others well being is strange particularly since all the children in the game who have got seats appear to have got them by dint of hard work and or sharp tactics The CEO has failed because he s not very good and succeeds only by crying The only way the ad could have painted a less savory picture of corporate chieftains would have been if the teacher had forced one of the other students to stand up But then that would have defeated the whole flight attendants are angels part of the ad What s especially interesting about this is that British Airways is in the midst of a well publicized slimming down figurative and literal since BA is going to be flying smaller planes that s designed to make high end customers a larger percentage of the airline s business This ad with its faintly populist air doesn t seem to fit the new strategy all that well But who knows Maybe BA has figured out that what CEOs really want is for someone to see them as they truly are and then say Hey it s OK After all in the end the spoiled kid does get the chair and a smile from the pretty girl
