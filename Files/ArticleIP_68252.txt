 A Maze in Grace Subject New Age Isn t So New From Max Re Date Tue Jan 4 Another Fraygrant wrote There is a very beautiful cathedral in France I believe in Chartres that has a huge labyrinth on the floor It was covered until recently when a new more liberal Bishop took over the area It was interesting to see something New Agey in such an old institution I have seen these old mazes on church floors and they are beautiful Too bad Culturebox used the words New Age in the column If she had simply said spirituality then everyone would be much calmer in their criticism It seems to me that this maze idea is simply a focusing device like a rosary or lighting a candle which symbolizes something significant to us It s just a thing we use to help us feel closer to God Why all the hub bub Personally I feel closer to God when I m gardening and tending His planet Is that wrong too To reply click here Subject Pundit Central vs Bob Novak From Brian Re Date Mon Jan 3 Why is Robert Novak s indisputably accurate assessment on the effects of centralized government in the 20 th century labeled self parody How can the Pundit Central hack imply that centralized government has been a huge net plus when millions have died directly at its hands and when common freedoms and civic involvement have been declining in liberal democracies as a direct result of this conglomeration of power Sounds like the usual liberal tactic of attempting desperately to deride what you can t really disprove To reply click here Subject Re Pundit Central vs Bob Novak From Michael Brus Re Date Tue Jan 4 Obviously totalitarian governments both right and left have killed millions this century And surely government in the United States today is too large or at least inefficient Jonathan Rauch s new book Government s End documents this quite well But Novak s absurdity lies in linking totalitarian programs of extermination to onerous regulations in contemporary Europe and the United States Surely there is a qualitative difference between a police state and a sclerotic republic Do you really think it s just a slippery slope from Sweden to North Korea Remember Shields asked him to name the greatest catastrophes of the 20 th century Novak responded with a conservative buzzword big government and tried to use real catastrophe to further his own agenda To reply click here Michael Brus writes Pundit Central and is Slate s Fraymaster Subject The Dog Who Ate Peanuts From Steve Miller Re Date Thu Dec 30 Another Fraygrant wrote Mark Alan Stamaty is to be forgiven for rejecting Jean Shepherd s critique that Snoopy ruined Peanuts as a cartoonist Stamaty has been influenced on a much deeper level by Schulz than the average reader I found his paean to the strip very moving Indeed Christopher Caldwell in his brilliant piece in last week s N Y Press contends that it was Schulz s calamitous artistic misjudgment that allowed Snoopy and cuteness to overwhelm the left field magic that characterized the early strip I think that once the billion dollar merchandizing juggernaut was well underway Schulz got fat and happy Snoopy and Woodstock unlike Charlie Brown and Lucy represent the relatively banal inner life of a successful middle age man As Schulz s own angst disappeared his strip s meaningfulness did too To reply click here Subject Fish s Frivilous Pen From Terry Clark Re Date Mon Jan 3 Stanley Fish is a fun writer but don t take him too seriously He s the Robin Williams of literature an inspired gabber who couldn t turn off his inspirations to save his life If he wanted to Fish could talk biscuits and gravy into a thrilling subject we would all take sides on Professor Fish is simply a good talker who writes well That s his gift He s like the lawyer in Walden who amazed the Indian because while he worked hard at making baskets and blankets and yet remained poor the lawyer had only to weave arguments and by some magic wealth and standing followed Fish is that lawyer and most of the rest of us are the Indian Now words can have powerful effects on us Indians the more so if you have a serious talker and a serious subject Then again words aren t everything as Fish cheekily delights in pointing out Sometimes when I read Fish his frightening Mission Impossible essay for example I get swept up by his great gift and am ready to move the family to the woods to avoid the end of the world But then I smell the Fish Ah Stan It s just you and your words again To reply click here Subject Hollywood s Opening Night Strategy From David Snow Re Date Wed Dec 29 I just happened to have finished Monster Living Off the Big Screen by John Gregory Dunne when I read this article The author is a screenwriter He makes the following point The reason that opening weekend grosses are so important is that the distributing studio bases the advertising budget on the opening weekend grosses Thus a feature that opens poorly doesn t get advertised as much as one that does well It s the criterion they use to keep themselves from throwing money at something that is likely to fail Although word of mouth sometimes works for a feature to do well in the long run it almost always needs advertising Thus a poor opening gross is a self fulfilling prediction of failure To reply click here
