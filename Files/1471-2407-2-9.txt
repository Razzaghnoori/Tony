 Background Although a number of recently introduced chemotherapeutic agents have demonstrated significant anti tumor activity in advanced colorectal cancer 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 standard therapy for patients with metastatic disease remains 5 fluorouracil 5 FU based chemotherapy 10 A vast series of pre clinical and clinical studies have suggested 5 FU is a more active anti tumor agent when modulated by a host of compounds including leucovorin 11 12 13 methotrexate 14 folinic acid 15 16 N phosphonacetyl L aspartic acid PALA 17 18 19 20 21 22 and recombinant interferon alfa 2a IFNa 2a 23 24 Protracted venous infusion PVI 5 FU regimens have also resulted in increased response rates in some studies but only results in a modest benefit in median survival 25 26 Oral fluoropyrimidines and oral regimens using prodrugs of 5 FU or inhibitors of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase DPD which pharmacologically simulate the intravenous continuous infusion administration of 5 FU are currently under clinical evaluation Although these studies are important and may demonstrate equivalency it is not clear these oral compounds will result in a significant improvement compared to the intravenous infusion of 5 FU 27 Potentiation of the anti tumor activity of 5 FU by methotrexate MTX and leucovorin LV requires careful scheduling to achieve the most favorable interactions between these 3 drugs In vitro and in vivo studies have both suggested a synergistic as well as antagonistic effect when 5 FU MTX and LV are used in combination 28 29 30 31 32 In this report two modulators of 5 FU were used in a sequential manner anticipating an enhancement of the efficacy of 5 FU before the development of 5 FU resistance and subsequent disease progression The order of administration of the three agents was chosen to optimally exploit the reported differing mechanisms of biochemical modulation The objectives of this phase II study were to determine the activity and toxicity of MTX LV 5 FU in patients with advanced colorectal cancer Patients and Methods Treatment Plan Consistent with the traditional design of phase II studies all patients received therapy as outlined in the treatment schema in figure 1 Methotrexate was administered at a dose of 30 mg m 2orally every 6 hours on an empty stomach for 6 doses At hour 36 a 2 hour intravenous infusion of leucovorin was administered at a dose of 500 mg m 2 Midway through the leucovorin infusion 5 FU at a dose of 600 mg m 2was given as a 30 minute intravenous bolus infusion This represented a course of therapy and was repeated every two weeks Dose modifications for hematologic toxicity were made on the basis of counts on the day of treatment For a white blood count 3 500 cells ul or a platelet count 100 000 platelets ul patients received full doses of all three drugs as described above For a white blood count between 3 000 and 3 500 cells ul and a platelet count 100 000 platelets ul a 50 dose reduction of all three drugs was performed For white blood counts less than 3 000 cells ul and a platelet count 100 000 platelets ul all therapy was held until the counts had fully recovered white blood count 3 500 cells ul and a platelet count 100 000 Patients experiencing a white blood count 2 000 and or a platelet count 75 000 any time during therapy subsequently received 50 of the calculated dose even if the counts fully recovered Weekly complete blood counts including platelet counts and white blood count differentials were conducted to determine the level of myelosuppresion Before every other cycle of treatment q 4 weeks a chest x ray and complete chemistry panel including electrolytes and serum creatinine were obtained All lesions were measured bidimensionally and assessed for changes by either an imaging study computed tomography chest x ray ultrasound or by clinical examination to determine response to therapy Treatment was continued until disease progression became evident or side effects became intolerable Statistical Methods This study was planned to recruit 50 evaluable patients allowing us to estimate objective tumor response to within 15 with 95 confidence Additional patients were subsequently accrued to increase the precision of our estimates of response and survival The trial was conducted with one interim analysis after nine evaluable patients If no patient had experienced an objective tumor response the study would have been terminated The two stage design used in this study was first proposed by Ed Gehan in 1961 Gehan E A The determination of the number of patients required in a preliminary and a follow up trial of a new chemotherapeutic agent J Chron Dis 13 346 353 1961 The probability of observing no responses was less than 5 if the true response was 30 or greater Progression free survival was defined as the time from study entry to the first observation of disease progression or death as a result of any cancer Survival was defined as the time of study entry until death as a result of any cause These time to event parameters were summarized using Kaplan Meier product limit estimates Log rank tests were used to assess which factors were univariately predictive of the time to progression and survival and the Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to assess which factors were jointly predictive of these outcomes The statistical analysis was performed using the SAS package version 6 12 SAS Institute Cary NC Results Treatment and Response A total of 1257 cycles of treatment were delivered during the trial median 9 cycles range 0 to 41 cycles Table 2reflects the average percent of ideal dose given at each selected cycle of treatment Even after 25 cycles of therapy at least 75 of the ideal doses for all drugs were being administered Ninety three of the 95 eligible patients enrolled onto the study were assessable for toxicity Mucositis nausea vomiting and diarrhea were the most commonly observed toxicities and are listed in table 3 The hematologic toxicities are also shown in table 3and in general were infrequently observed Overall the regimen was well tolerated Of the 90 patients evaluable for response ten patients 11 demonstrated a complete response of their disease median response duration 14 3 months Remarkably 3 of the 10 patients remain alive 2 without evidence of disease with 51 73 and 138 months of follow up respectively An additional 18 patients 20 attained partial responses 16 have died of progressive disease while 2 patients are alive and without disease progression Table 4reflects the overall best response for the entire patient cohort The overall estimated median time to progression was 5 6 months The estimated progression free survival at 12 months was 25 5 standard error 4 5 The overall estimated median survival time was 13 0 months The estimated survival rate at 12 months was 53 7 standard error 5 1 Table 5reflects overall survival for various subgroups of patients The prognostic factors found to be significant on univariate analysis were ECOG performance score gender and number of metastatic sites Female patients patients with fewer metastatic sites and patients with an ECOG performance 0 had a statistically significant improved survival Survival by metastatic site is shown in Table 6 Those patients without lung metastasis and those without intra abdominal metastasis had longer survival times In the multivariate analysis presence of lymph nodes lower LDH levels female sex better performance status and fewer metastatic sites were statistically predictive of longer survival Data not shown Discussion The rationale at least in part for this phase II study comes from pre clinical data suggesting MTX and LV potentiate the anti tumor activity of 5 FU The cytotoxic effects of 5 FU are mediated through inhibition of DNA and or RNA synthesis 33 DNA synthesis inhibition is mediated by the binding of the active 5 FU metabolite 5 fluoro 2 deoxyuridine 5 monophosphate F dUMP to the enzyme thymidylate synthetase TS This binding is enhanced by high concentrations of reduced folate cofactors 34 Although this ternary complex is covalent it dissociates with a half life of 2 3 hours in the absence of excess 5 10 methylene tetrahydrofolate Thus high levels of 5 10 methylene tetrahydrofolate derived from LV not only allows optimum ternary complex formation but also prevents subsequent breakdown of the complex 35 Additional in vitro studies suggest cells may need prolonged exposure to reduced folates in order to obtain maximum inhibition of TS by FdUMP 36 A second observed means of potentiating the cytotoxic effects of 5 FU is through the pre treatment of cells with MTX MTX induced enhancement of 5 phosphoribosyl 1 pyrophosphate PRPP pools with subsequent increased synthesis of 5 FU nucleotides and incorporation of 5 fluoriuridine 5 triphosphate FUTP into RNA has been proposed as the basis for this biochemical modulation 37 38 39 Subsequent in vivo studies using fluorine 19 magnetic resonance spectroscopy confirmed a three fold increase in 5 fluoronucleotide FNuct the active 5 FU metabolite following the pre treatment of animals with MTX 32 These observed changes in 5 FU catabolism resulted in a greater anti tumor activity than MTX given alone or MTX given after 5 FU Consistent with these pre clinical studies the design of this phase II trial involved a fluorouracil infusion that was initiated one hour into the 2 hour high dose infusion of LV and 36 hours after the initial methotrexate dosing Our phase II study provides long term efficacy and safety data for sequential MTX LV 5 FU chemotherapy administered on a 14 day cycle The 31 response rate and median survival duration median 13 0 months observed in this trial are slightly improved when compared to the results reported for intravenous 5 FU therapy Overall treatment with sequential MTX LV 5 FU was very well tolerated Grade III diarrhea was seen in only 8 of patients grade III and IV mucositis in 8 and 1 of patients respectively and grade III and IV nausea vomiting in 11 and 1 of patients respectively The most common hematologic toxicity observed was grade II and III anemia in 18 and 4 of patients respectively Other similar studies have shown comparable results in terms of the efficacy and safety of MTX LV 5 FU for patients with advanced colorectal cancer 44 45 46 47 48 In a meta analysis of eight randomized trials of 5 FU MTX versus 5 FU alone the complete and partial response rates for the 5 FU patient cohort was 10 compared with 19 for patients receiving MTX 5 FU 14 In addition the median survival was improved for patients receiving MTX 5 FU 10 7 months versus 9 1 months for patients receiving 5 FU alone p 024 Marsh et al in a randomized trial reported a statistical improvement in response time to progression 9 9 months versus 5 9 months and median survival 15 3 months versus 11 4 months when the interval between the MTX and 5 FU infusion was increased from 1 hour to 24 hours Conclusions We suggest our results and the pre clinical and clinical data discussed indicate the sequence of administration of 5 FU with MTX and LV is important Future studies combining 5 FU with other cytotoxic biologic compounds should consider the mechanism of the interaction and incorporate that information into the design of the trial
