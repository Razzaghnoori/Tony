        to uh  trial by jury and whether it works or not is     hey i like the current system   yeah i expect its um  about as good as one can expect um i suppose you get an illogical verdict now and then but uh   yeah yeah i figure the answer to that is to educate the consumers or the uh   the the jurors you mean the people   right  just   yeah i just got called to my first jury duty uhhuh i never been on a jury how about you   hey two weeks ago first time i was ever called   and were you did you did you show up and do it or whatever it was   oh yeah i showed up but uh the case settled before they could uh make us uh actually listen to anything so i have no idea what the case was about or uh you know i didnt get to do anything   my brother was on some real complex business case where they were um decide to asked to decide the exact amount to the penny of fraud in some credit card case you know   wait so the jury had to like go over       ledgers and financial records and   well they went over it in the trial but they didnt give the stuff to the jury afterward it was really bizarre uh   wait a second dont dont they have to enter that in as evidence and cant the jury request any piece of it   yeah but they have to ask for it and then the the bailiff brings it and they can look at it then the bailiff takes it away again its not like they can just spread it out in their jury room and then you know get out a bunch of calculators and pocket computers and add it all up it was   right the the jurors request an IBM three seventy   yeah right would you give me an IDMS IDMS system or something like that  dear judge       you know it was it was a very peculiar case i guess that one was didnt work very well um uh but   whoa that im not sure thats the jurys fault   no no i dont think so either um   but i dont know what else they couldve done   yeah yeah um i guess i guess nothing else but uh   TI suggests just giving it to the judge but uh   well for sentencing i dont know does that make any sense i mean it depends on what i i dont know what the offense is i guess thats why we have juries is to take each case on a case by case basis and thats fine anyway um   no i mean the jury theres problems with it as far as finding jurors as far as weird verdicts as far as just the timing the timing you know it takes a lot of time but uh you know i like it because i think you dont have the abuse or its a sort of a check if you have one guy doing something he can sort of go out of control and its a long time before he gets reigned in   yeah or if its an organizational problem you know where where you know the   and he can do a lot of damage   you know its possible to imagine a corrupt judicial system where you know all the judges are are part of the system i guess that happened in Chicago once huh   yeah yeah       or just even one guy just before you get a chance to uh you know to uh purge him he could do a lot of damage   yeah yeah i guess they do anyway i guess the only trouble with the jury system i see is its really darned darned expensive and and you know time consuming and you know and and all these systems of where you can like ask a jury ask each juror what they think about something then kick them out and you know i guess they can manipulate it a little   you know maybe some of the uh like the hype needs to be cut out but you mention expense   yeah   i think you get what you pay for   yeah its true no lie   you know if you want a cheap legal system youre youre gonna get that kind of Kmart service or uh well Kmarts not all that bad       theres got to be some sort of cheap whats the epitome of cheap these days   beats me um yeah in in Massachusetts its the judicial system their buildings are all falling down       well i guess that gets them the sample good night sir   all right good luck   take it easy
