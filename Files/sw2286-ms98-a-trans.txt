                anyway uh uh   do you work for a large corporation corporation   well i did uh and im currently uh consulting now so im with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are   uhhuh   pretty basic uh medical um i dont get any profit sharing and stuff like that so   i uh i work with a medium size company and we dont have profit sharing but i would enjoy it since we uh its a service based organization so   yeah   it would be nice but   yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh   that would be nice   they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits so it sounds like theyre going to get very more flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives   well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no ive got a family two children   yeah are you single okay uh   yeah alright do you have children are you single   but no i im uh single im uh         never been married so   you are i   no i said ive never been married im only im only twenty six so   oh you never have oh yeah thats theres still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but um     i still got a few years   we uh weve we just kind of started young in life  but uh uh we uh my husbands still with the same company for ten years and as a result   and   it has worked out so hes got a real nice benefit package but um its uh its nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess   so what are the most important benefits to you   oh the hospitalization um is the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because its a good well rounded program its you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductibles reasonable i think its three fifty a year for the family   uhhuh   whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductibles i think five hundred a year and it costs a lot more im with a smaller company though   the but the medical stuff itself uh   so   the health plan youre with it only it only covers fifty percent   thats right   ouch       thats the worst ive ever heard   yeah its not very good   its usually the eighty basic eighty twenty   yeah   besides your initial deductible thats what varies the most i guess uh   yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month   ha um   and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah copayments thats what they are   yeah copayments type stuff yeah       well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or its the most important   umhum   uh coverage uh of the you know you may not even go in to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you you know to get covered is important   umhum   um   well if we one of our children is just is just turned two and her first eighteen months of life God well she had one operation shes been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean shes shes just expensive the other one wasnt nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those   yeah   kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents   uhhuh how about any matching programs       you ever you know what i mean where they contribute contribute contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a K   no  oh yeah yeah my husbands got that available thats great   is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent   i think its fifty percent up to four percent or maybe its fifty percent up to eighty percent   okay yeah   im not exactly sure   but that thats a nice i think thats an important benefit   yeah thats great   uh i dont get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i didnt make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave       so   yeah its nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is   but uh   money that you can touch but its tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CDs and gets life its a its a term life policy also   uhhuh with an annuity   yeah yeah yeah thats what it is you know about insurance i didnt know anything about insurance until i had got until i had children   yeah   i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is when i was in school still   uhhuh   i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which arent very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could   really   and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh   uhhuh   they would uh you know analyze it the persons current policy and get a computerized computerized you know statement of uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the term life with annuity and the whole life   uhhuh   was you know theres fairly big discrepancies discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but you know i dont know what i get out maybe twenty thousands or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh im not worried about that i dont have anybody to to     until you get your dependents it just doesnt matter   yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you dont want to be a burden to anybody else uh   yeah right right   and uh   but as far as being able to really leave anything   so i think yeah i mean im not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount and you know thats fine but uh uh you know to get that coverage and know that ill get you know uh you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i havent made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh   are your family   see ive ive kind of moved around from my home originally and  um and my familys out in Florida now most of my family and im out here in Phoenix so   oh     but uh anyway as far as benefits um what else is important important uh obviously i think uh a profit sharing is is uh is uh is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term   ive never yeah   um   ive my husbands company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesnt and id really like it if my company did  they turn quite a profit at times but its not part of uh whats available so   yeah smaller the the companies its either the smaller company you you youre in to into the consulting side and theyll youll finish up a project and youll get the little bonus that type of thing   umhum umhum   um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing um but um most you know most medium or small probably dont do that much profit sharing and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so   it didnt help any to share   yeah  they couldnt share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but   yeah   i wasnt qualified qualified for my first year something you know after   yeah   so   so have you have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah   little over three years now   yeah at uh it uh quite a different world isnt it  versus being life before real world life in college   versus what
