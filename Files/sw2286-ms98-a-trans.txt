 anyway uh uh do you work for a large corporation corporation well i did uh and i m currently uh consulting now so i m with this you know a smaller organization um so my benefits are uh huh pretty basic uh medical um i don t get any profit sharing and stuff like that so i uh i work with a medium size company and we don t have profit sharing but i would enjoy it since we uh it s a service based organization so yeah it would be nice but yeah what uh the current climate is i saw a little flyer and uh i thought it was interesting uh is they are now offering you know flex flexible benefits where you have more control and allocate uh like you can uh pay for uh vacation time if you want to take more vacation you can just buy them out or something like that so i can can do other things and uh that would be nice they actually have a software package that sounds like where you can manipulate different things to see what it costs to you for those benefits so it sounds like they re going to get very more flexible to meet individual needs which i think is the most important thing because everybody is got quite a few different objectives well people with families have different objectives than single people or no no i ve got a family two children yeah are you single okay uh yeah alright do you have children are you single but no i i m uh single i m uh never been married so you are i no i said i ve never been married i m only i m only twenty six so oh you never have oh yeah that s there s still a lot of time for that i had already been married and had one child by that time but um i still got a few years we uh we ve we just kind of started young in life but uh uh we uh my husband s still with the same company for ten years and as a result and it has worked out so he s got a real nice benefit package but um it s uh it s nice to be with a big company for that reason i guess so what are the most important benefits to you oh the hospitalization um is the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it s a good well rounded program it s you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible s reasonable i think it s three fifty a year for the family uh huh whereas with my company they pay fifty percent and the deductible s i think five hundred a year and it costs a lot more i m with a smaller company though the but the medical stuff itself uh so the health plan you re with it only it only covers fifty percent that s right ouch that s the worst i ve ever heard yeah it s not very good it s usually the eighty basic eighty twenty yeah besides your initial deductible that s what varies the most i guess uh yeah yeah or you can go with a HMO you know Health Maintenance Organization where you pay a certain amount a month ha um and then five dollars every time that you go in or two dollars everytime yeah co payments that s what they are yeah co payments type stuff yeah well i think uh obviously i think the the medical is the most expensive or it s the most important um hum uh coverage uh of the you know you may not even go in to the doctor for a long time but you know if something came up obviously you you know to get covered is important um hum um well if we one of our children is just is just turned two and her first eighteen months of life God well she had one operation she s been to the emergency room a couple of times i mean she s she s just expensive the other one wasn t nearly that expensive but the but the baby just one of those yeah kind of sickly kids that has a lot of accidents uh huh how about any matching programs you ever you know what i mean where they contribute contribute contribute like a hundred percent of up to four percent of you salary into a 401K no oh yeah yeah my husband s got that available that s great is it is it a hundred percent or is it fifty percent i think it s fifty percent up to four percent or maybe it s fifty percent up to eighty percent okay yeah i m not exactly sure but that that s a nice i think that s an important benefit yeah that s great uh i don t get that option i i i was at a company that had that and i didn t make enough to to be able to put anything in it so i had to leave so yeah it s nice we uh we we do a lot of our savings in that manner and then the rest of it through a universal life policy which is but uh money that you can touch but it s tax deferred and yields a higher rate in general than what we can get in CD s and gets life it s a it s a term life policy also uh huh with an annuity yeah yeah yeah that s what it is you know about insurance i didn t know anything about insurance until i had got until i had children yeah i i the only reason i know a little bit about that is when i was in school still uh huh i was down in Florida working and uh during during the summer some how i got a hold of involved in a a marketing organization that marketed uh replacing those uh whole life policies which aren t very good insurance policies people are losing you know and it losing money or not doing as well as they could really and uh the whole organization was targeting to replace whole life policies with a term life with annuity an annuity and uh uh huh they would uh you know analyze it the person s current policy and get a computerized computerized you know statement of uh what would happen you know at this age this age this age you know uh what your benefits would be and uh the difference between you know the term life with annuity and the whole life uh huh was you know there s fairly big discrepancies discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end and picked it up but i never did tell anyone back at school and i never i never uh did anything with it but uh so i know a little about uh the right now i just do a little basic life thing on my benefits but you know i don t know what i get out maybe twenty thousands or something just to cover me and cover some expenses and maybe fly people out that i know you know some family that but uh i m not worried about that i don t have anybody to to until you get your dependents it just doesn t matter yeah well i like the idea of having that chunk of money uh to help anybody cover my end you know you don t want to be a burden to anybody else uh yeah right right and uh but as far as being able to really leave anything so i think yeah i mean i m not looking to to leave anything there may be a a certain amount and you know that s fine but uh uh you know to get that coverage and know that i ll get you know uh you know flown to wherever i need you know already i need to go i guess i haven t made any decisions like that i guess you know my family and father would do that but uh are your family see i ve i ve kind of moved around from my home originally and um and my family s out in Florida now most of my family and i m out here in Phoenix so oh but uh anyway as far as benefits um what else is important important uh obviously i think uh a profit sharing is is uh is uh is a important benefit especially in the long run for the long term i ve never yeah um i ve my husband s company does a little bit of profit sharing but my company doesn t and i d really like it if my company did they turn quite a profit at times but it s not part of uh what s available so yeah smaller the the companies it s either the smaller company you you you re in to into the consulting side and they ll you ll finish up a project and you ll get the little bonus that type of thing um hum um hum um i guess you could technically consider that profit sharing um but um most you know most medium or small probably don t do that much profit sharing and while i was at this other corporation they never had any profit so it didn t help any to share yeah they couldn t share any and i guess they had a little bit one year but yeah i wasn t qualified qualified for my first year something you know after yeah so so have you have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah little over three years now yeah at uh it uh quite a different world isn t it versus being life before real world life in college versus what
