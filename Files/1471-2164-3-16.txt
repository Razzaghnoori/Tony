 Background Cancer is a progressive genetic disease that involves the accumulation of multiple and heterogeneous genetic and epigenetic changes Among the 30 000 40 000 human genes 1 2 an expanding list of genes has been shown to be involved in cancer development and progression Recently developed technologies including cDNA microarrays allow cancer researchers to screen thousands of genes simultaneously to identify genes that show abnormal expression in cancers 3 4 5 6 Cancer researchers face a serious challenge when trying to apply these tools to clinical cancer specimens First cancers are often detected at a late stage in development after multiple genetic and epigenetic changes have rendered the cancer metastatic and highly refractory even to harsh treatment Multiple clones in the same tumor mass which can often be distinguished by morphological features would yield more information if they could be microdissected and analyzed separately Second tumor tissues invariably include a mixture of different cells such as inflammatory cells stromal cells vascular cells and others Each type of cells may contribute to a unique aspect of the cancer phenotype and may serve as a target for treatment Therefore there is a need to dissect those cells for separate study For example it was found that tumor vascular cells have distinct gene expression profiles from those of normal vascular cells 7 and the genes that are uniquely expressed on the surface of tumor endothelium cells can serve as targets for specific cancer therapy Finally a key breakthrough in cancer treatment would come from early detection and diagnosis of cancer and the study of molecular events in the early stages of cancer progression A difficulty in studying cancer at early stages is that the tumor size is small and only limited material can be obtained through means such as fine needle aspiration Identification of the genetic changes in such a small sample is especially challenging because only limited assays can be performed using conventional approaches It is obvious that the full potential of genomic technologies will only be realized if they can be applied to minute amounts of biological material For a typical gene expression profiling experiment carried out on a glass microarray where thousands of cDNA probes are deposited in an orderly manner RNA is first isolated from the biological material under study The mRNA 1 5 of total RNA is reverse transcribed to cDNA during which process fluorescent dyes Cy3 or Cy5 are incorporated The labeled cDNAs are hybridized to the microarray and after washing the fluorescent signals are detected by a laser scanner Current protocols typically require more than 50 g of total RNA for consistent microarray hybridization Several hundred milligrams of tumor tissues are often needed to obtain this much RNA which is simply unavailable in many situations Thus it is crucial to develop a more sensitive and reliable procedure that requires less RNA Several molecular biology approaches such as T7 in vitro transcription and PCR based assays have been attempted 8 9 10 However only cursory analysis has been carried out to validate the assays and limited confirmation experiments have been performed to evaluate the validity of the amplification results In this study we performed and analyzed a set of nine microarray experiments to evaluate an amplification protocol adopted from Wang et al 9 Focusing primarily on the ability to identify differentially expressed genes we developed the following criteria for a successful amplification protocol 1 Because amplification may enhance the signal of genes expressed at low copy numbers more genes should be detected by an amplification protocol than by a regular protocol 2 Most genes detected as differentially expressed using a regular protocol should also be detected using an amplification protocol In other words the two protocols should reveal similar patterns of differential expression 3 An amplification protocol should generate signal intensity profiles as reproducibly and reliably as a regular protocol 4 Microarray results obtained from an amplification protocol should match data obtained from other molecular biology approaches such as northern blotting western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay Our results showed that our amplification protocol produced reproducible reliable microarray data that was consistent with the regular protocol We also confirmed that our amplification protocol revealed accurate information about the differential expression of low copy number genes that failed to give sufficient signal intensities using the regular protocol Therefore many clinical experiments for which only a minute amount of material is available can be pursued using this protocol Results Enhancement of signal intensity for genes expressed at a low copy number We expected the amplification protocol to increase the signal intensity of low expressing genes in other words the number of genes having measurable signal intensity above background levels from using the amplification protocol should be higher than that using the regular protocol We used S N 2 0 to determine if a gene has measurable signal intensity on an array i e if the difference between signal intensity and background intensity is greater than 2 0 SD of the local background then the gene gives adequate signal intensity We assessed all 9 arrays the results are summarized in Table 2 The results showed that the number of genes whose S N ratio exceeds 2 SD of background is consistently higher in both channels when using the amplification protocol The signal intensities of low expressors indeed are improved so that more genes turned out to be detectable Our result also showed that the PCR step 1 or 3 cycles before aRNA amplification had no detectable effect on the final results Consistent patterns of differential gene expression Finding differentially expressed genes is one of the goals of microarray technology Ideally both the regular and amplification protocols would identify the same list of differentially expressed genes We did not expect to see identical lists of differentially expressed genes generated from the two protocols since we may not even achieve that goal using the same protocol twice due to the variability associated with microarray experiments 12 13 14 However we do want to see most differentially expressed genes appearing on both lists To identify differentially expressed genes we computed smooth t statistics To apply this method we first computed the mean log intensity and the standard deviation for the replicated spots within each channel Since the standard deviation varies systematically with the mean we then fit a smooth curve representing the standard deviation as a function of the mean After pooling the smooth estimates of standard deviation from the two channels we used the pooled estimates to compute a t statistic for each gene 13 15 These smooth t statistics can also be viewed as studentized log ratios i e as log ratios between channels that have been rescaled to account for the intrinsic variability We found that the consistency and reproducibility of smooth t statistics between experiments is high regardless of the protocol being used We quantified the reproducibility using the concordance coefficient which is analogous to the correlation coefficient but measures how well a set of points matches the identity line 16 17 18 The concordance between experiments using the regular protocol ranged from 0 574 to 0 835 with a median of 0 739 The concordance using the amplification protocol ranged from 0 843 to 0 894 with a median of 0 873 The concordance between the experiments using different protocols ranged from 0 562 to 0 796 with a median of 0 652 Using data from all experiments performed with the regular protocol we computed a combined set of smooth t statistics We computed a similar set of t statistics using data from all experiments performed with the amplification protocol Genes are viewed as differentially expressed if the smooth t statistic exceeds some threshold for this study we chose genes with smooth t statistic greater than four in absolute value Using this criterion we found that the regular protocol identified 21 genes that were differentially expressed between U251 and LN229 cell lines and the amplification protocol identified 28 differentially expressed genes Fifteen genes were common to both lists Thirteen genes were found using the amplification protocol but not the regular protocol the smooth t statistics for these genes ranged in absolute value from 1 19 to 3 96 with a median of 2 23 Six genes were found using the regular protocol but not the amplification protocol the smooth t statistics for these genes using the amplification protocol ranged in absolute value from 3 16 to 3 97 with a median of 3 42 In every case the sign of the t scores was the same using the different protocols indicating that the same cell line overexpressed the gene Reproducibility and reliability of signal intensity To evaluate whether the amplification protocol preserved signals that were seen using the regular protocol we first found all the spots in each channel U251 or LN229 that consistently had S N 2 0 in all five experiments using the regular protocol We then computed the percentage of those genes that also had S N 2 0 on each of the arrays using the amplification protocol We found that 95 to 100 of the genes that are consistently found to be expressed using the regular protocol were also found to be expressed using the amplification protocol For U251 on four amplified arrays the percentages are 100 99 98 and 100 for LN229 100 96 95 and 98 Confirmation of the results from amplification experiments A key criterion for the validity of microarray experiments is whether the results are real and can be confirmed by other approaches In order to obtain representative information rather than noise from nonspecific binding of targets to the DNA probes in a microarray experiment the hybridization has to be specific To demonstrate the hybridization specificity in our microarray experiments we selectively labeled a specific target such as actin or GAPDH with one dye and hybridized to the microarray Our results showed that the specific target only hybridized to its corresponding spots on the array 19 Second in order to confirm the results the clones printed on the microarray have to be correct and error free This is an important issue because most clone libraries used for making microarrays contain significant errors To surmount this problem all the clones printed on our microarrays were sequence verified before printing 20 Because of those quality control measures we expected that our microarray results should be confirmed as long as the amplification is stable and consistent among different experiments From the results of comparison between U251 and LN229 we selected six genes that showed differential expression either using both the regular and the amplification procedures or only using the amplification procedure Among these four genes were detected by both protocols and two genes were only detected by the amplification protocol Figure 1 Genes that belong to the latter case are most likely expressed at very low levels that fall below the threshold of detection by the regular protocol These genes were then tested by other molecular methodologies We first selected two genes S100 and GFAP that are common markers for glial cells Among U251 and LN229 cells the microarray results from both protocols showed that S100 was expressed at higher levels in LN229 cells and GFAP at higher levels in U251 cells U251 and LN229 cells were embedded in paraffin blocks and sectioned The sections were stained with antibodies for those two antigens The immunohistochemistry results showed that S100 is expressed at higher levels in LN229 cells and GFAP at higher levels in U251 cells Fig 2A Two additional genes HLA DR alpha and SNRP B that were also obtained using the two protocols were confirmed by northern blotting Fig 2A We mentioned that some low expressing genes could only be detected by the amplification protocol and not by the regular protocol To confirm whether the new information by this approach is reliable we randomly picked up two differentially expressed genes IGFBP2 and integrin beta 4 that were identified by the amplification protocol but not by the regular protocol for confirmation using western blotting northern blotting and immunohistochemistry assays The results from these experiments showed that all the two genes were expressed at higher levels in U251 cells Figure 2B as obtained by the microarray data It should be noted that for the low expressed genes that could only be detected by the amplification protocol longer exposure time for the northern blotting is needed and the signal intensity is much lower than that generated from the high expressed genes that could be detected by both protocols Figure 2B In summary we have carried out a series of confirmation experiments using northern blotting western blotting and immunohistochemistry assay and all six differentially expressed genes revealed from the microarray experiments have been confirmed Discussion A major difficulty in the study of cancer is that cancer cells are extremely elusive and the genetic mutation events are continuously occurring temporally and spatially The development of high throughput genomic technologies enables us to screen thousands of genes simultaneously for the informative genes yet the power of these technologies is greatly attenuated when inappropriate samples are studied Generally speaking the most biologically appropriate materials obtained from clinical samples are small in quantity This observation motivates the development of experimental protocols that allow application of genomic technologies to minute amounts of biological materials In this manuscript we have described such a method that allows us to use cDNA microarrays with only 1 microgram of total RNA The initial evaluation of the methodology is based on the detection of fluorescent signals on the microarray after hybridization Although we could see bright spots with the amplification protocols this apparent success does not mean the information so acquired is reliable False positives are often the result of side effects during amplification We set out to assess the accuracy and reliability using both statistical and experimental approaches Both approaches supported the validity of our protocol in the identification of differentially expressed genes in two cell populations This demonstrates that the same genes are amplified to the same extent in different cell populations However in our results the amount of amplification varies from gene to gene Therefore the amplification process is not balanced and changes the relative transcript levels in a given cell population Thus from the amplified results one cannot infer the relative expression levels of different genes in a single sample However in most biological studies identification of differentially expressed genes among different samples is the main aim These genes can serve as useful markers for diagnosis for prediction of therapeutic response and perhaps as a target for developing new drugs Thus we have developed an assay that will enable us to approach a series of important clinical issues given a limited amount of material This assay has been used in several ongoing studies and useful information has been obtained Conclusion We have confirmed a powerful and consistent cDNA microarray procedure that can be used to study minute amounts of biological tissue Materials and Methods Microarray production A total of 2 304 known human cDNAs were

s Ontario Canada and values were recorded for spot intensity local background intensity and signal to noise S N ratio Spot intensity was computed as the integrated optical density or volume in a fixed size circle background intensity was computed as the median pixel value of four diamond shaped regions at the corners of each spot Background corrected intensity was computed by subtracting local background from spot intensity The S N ratio was computed by dividing the background corrected intensity by the standard deviation SD of the background pixels Data normalization Data from all microarrays was imported into S plus Insightful Corp Seattle WA for further analysis For each microarray the background corrected spot intensities were normalized by setting the 75th percentile equal to 1000 This procedure brings the median log ratio between channels close to 1 for expressed spots and it also permits us to compare individual channels across arrays After normalization any spot whose normalized intensity remained below the threshold value of 150 was considered to be undetectable and its value was replaced by the threshold value In our arrays a normalized value of 150 corresponds roughly to a spot whose S N ratio equals 1 and thus any spot whose background corrected intensity falls below this threshold cannot be reliably distinguished from background noise Finally the background corrected normalized signal intensities were log transformed base two for further analysis Northern blotting analysis The sequencing verified cDNAs used to print the microarrays were
