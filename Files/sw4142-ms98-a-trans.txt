                so is your tax situation pretty straightforward or not straightforward at all     yeah actually actually uh mines real straightforward um basically uh you know i take my standard deductions um on my house which i have a mortgage on   umhum   and uh thats usually the big the big payoff part of the year for me because i get a couple thousand dollars back usually   oh thats nice   but uh actually i uh i dont really begrudge uh the uh the government their due i do i do think that uh probably just like just almost anybody else that you know theres a lot of inefficiency in how they distribute taxes   right   and i dont think that they uh they do a very good job of distributing them to the people who really need them  but uh   umhum   generally i think theyre pretty necessary and life would probably be a lot worse if they didnt have taxation so   right i dont have any problem at all with income tax some of the property taxes are well i dont know if theyre unfair theyre confusing and i there seems to be less ability to get those all together   yeah we actually we actually had a situation here where uh our house was appraised you know every year by the county   umhum   and we have to uh pay taxes on the basis of what that appraisal was   umhum   and first year we owned the house um that appraisal was something like twenty five thousand dollars higher than we had just bought the house for   really   and so uh despite you know a lot of kibitzing by our neighbors and stuff i decided to go in to uh talk to the Board of Equalization   right   uh in Prince William County and make sure that you know a mistake hadnt been made and all that kind of stuff and so i just sort of made my case on the basis of um you know analogy to other to other houses around us that were similar in terms of   you just bought it right   square footage you know and size all and and you know general property size and things like that and just just showed that you know our obvious for some reason our property had been valued much higher   right   and uh they bought it they actually reduced the uh reduced the appraisal   really they didnt raise the they canceled your neighbors taxes   uh they didnt raise my neighbors yeah they actually reduced mine to be in line with uh a more reasonable appraisal   thats really great   so i you you know i I realized well the you know few instances you can fight city hall on things like property taxes but uh   thats wonderful   yeah it was it was an interesting experience because the guy before me went in and he had a really kind of poorly organized discussion you know i mean he was sort of mad at the world and uh he he had sort of that that mad at the world attitude right off the bat which you could you know see a mile away   right umhum   and then he uh then he started talking about all the things that were wrong with this property you know like you know the leaves hadnt been cleaned out in two years and the gutters are falling off and you know a lot of really minor stuff   right   that just didnt impress these guys at all and they sort of gave him a hard time       but uh you know when i pointed out that that our house was appraised at this and all these similar houses in the subdivision were appraised at you know twenty five thousand dollars less i mean   right and you just bought yours thats the best argument i think   yeah so it it it worked it was actually pretty uh pretty satisfying satisfying  experience   thats wonderful   but it was it was kind of like going up to the Pope though you know i mean they they uh were sitting in these you know at these giant judges tables you know like   i bet umhum oh it was a it was a   it was like a judges chambers that that you   really wow it wasnt it wasnt the county council   it was the it was the county but it wasnt the council they have different people on this Board of Equalization i dont know i dont even know how they get on it you know i im just guessing theyre appointed   umhum   uh one of the guys is actually a kind of a well known realtor around here so you know i I figured if anybody gave me a hard time itd be him you   umhum right well he did he probably knows it really well the real estate market     yeah   so that was probably help   but other than that uh i havent had too much too much problem with taxes actually when i was in grad school i lived in Virginia also i went to school down at uh Charlottesville and uh   uhhuh   uh i had a you know one of these graduate fellowships   right   and fortunately it was not taxable at that time   right now it is   but they actually they actually hassled me over it though   right   and i had to i had to go to some length you know i actually got one of these letters that that said you know you got to show up at the local you know IRS office and explain   oh you got audited wow   yeah and actually explain you know what was going on and you know  i just i said hey i mean its tax free i mean thats my understanding of things so anyway eventually they they accepted that that it was but actually work i work with a guy now whos i I i guess he was right
