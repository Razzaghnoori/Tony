1996 IIRIRA governing expedited and regular removal proceedings handling asylum claims and other activities involving the apprehension detention hearing of claims and ultimately the removal of inadmissible and deportable aliens GAO OGC 97 32 The interim rule has an effective date of April 1 1997 which is less than the 60 day delay in a major rule s effective date required by the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 SBREFA In establishing the effective date INS and EOIR state in the preamble to the interim rule that they find good cause to make the rule effective April 1 1997 in order to meet the statutory deadline imposed by the IIRIRA The preamble states that the statutory deadline necessitated the 30 day comment period in the notice of proposed rulemaking because of the time needed to draft the rule coordinate with interested agencies and complete the required Office of Management and Budget review process Enclosed is our assessment of INS and EOIR s compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that INS and EOIR with the exception of the delay in the effective date complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this report please contact James Vickers Assistant General Counsel at 202 512 8210 The official responsible

Naturalization Service INS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review EOIR have prepared a cost analysis of the impact on their budgets of the interim rule INS estimates that the cost to enforce the requirement to detain all criminal aliens will be at least 205 million consisting of 65 284 000 for personnel and nonpersonnel costs of 139 732 000 The nonpersonnel figure includes 82 782 000 for bed space and related alien custody requirements 3 600 beds at 63 00 per day 36 000 000 increase for alien travel expenses 3 600 removals at 1 000 each and an additional 20 950 000 for detention vehicle expenses INS is currently attempting to estimate the increased budgetary impact of detaining all aliens with administratively final orders of deportation pending their removal Also INS estimates training employees on the new provisions of the law will be 2 977 500 and 2 000 000 for additional forms and changes needed to current forms The EOIR states that the provisions of the interim rule will require additional immigration judges Immigration Court presence at existing INS detention centers and construction of new Immigration Courts at new detention facilities While there are several unknown variables which could effect the total cost EOIR estimates that the annual cost could be as high as 25 000 000 including 21 300 000 for hiring new immigration judges and legal support staff ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Attorney General has certified that the interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it only affects the federal government operations regarding examination detention and removal of aliens from the United States GAO OGC 97 32 iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 The interim rule does not impose any federal mandates under title II of the act on state

S C 551 et seq The interim rule was issued under the notice and comment procedures of 5 U S C 553 INS published the proposed rule on January 3 1997 in the Federal Register 62 Fed Reg 444 The proposed rule only allowed 30 days for comment in view of the statutory deadline of April 1 1997 for implementing the changes required by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 The proposed rule s request for comments resulted in 124 comments being received which the preamble to the interim rule discusses along with the actions taken by INS and the EOIR as a result of the comments In addition the interim rule contains a request for additional comments to be submitted in a 120 day comment period Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 The information collection requirements of the interim rule have been previously reviewed and approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act and OMB control numbers have been issued We have been advised by an official at INS that the Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal Form INS Form I 589 OMB Control No 1115 0086 was resubmitted to OMB for approval because of minor revisions necessary to comply with the provisions of the interim rule However the revisions did not impact the burden hours previously approved by OMB Statutory authorization for the rule The interim

reviewed under Executive Order No 12612 Federalism and it has been determined that there are insufficient federalism implications to warrant to the preparation of a Federalism Assessment Executive

Subcommittee on National Economic Growth Natural Resources and Regulatory Affairs Committee on Government Reform and Oversight House of Representatives Dear Mr Chairman This is in reply to your inquiry regarding our Office s March 28 1997 Congressional Review Act report on a major rule concerning the inspection and expedited removal of aliens issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS and the Executive Office for Immigration Review of the Department of Justice GAO OGC 97 32 Your inquiry seeks clarification of INS compliance with the 60 day delay in the effective date of a major rule from the latter of the date of publication or receipt in Congress required by section 801 a 3 of title 5 of the United States Code As was pointed out in our March 28 1997 report while the rule was published in the Federal Register on March 6 1997 and was received in our Office and Congress on March 14 1997 the rule stated that it was effective on April 1 1997 However because none of the statutory exceptions apply to toll the 60 day delay in the effectiveness of the INS rule 5 U S C 801 a 3 required that it take effect no earlier than May 13 1997 The INS stated that it found good cause to make the rule effective on April 1 1997 because of the statutory deadline imposed by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act IIRIRA of 1996 But the good cause exception to the 60 day delay provision found at 5 U S C 808 2 only applies if the agency finds with good cause that notice and public procedure thereon are impracticable unnecessary or contrary to the public interest Thus it is not available when notice and comment procedures have been used Our report on the Health Care Financing Administration Medicare Program Major Rule B 275549 B 275552 December 9 1996 discusses the good cause exception at length Here INS published a notice of proposed rulemaking on January 3 1997 and received comments for 30 days and therefore the good cause exception was not properly invoked Moreover as discussed in our Medicare Program Major Rule Report referred to above the mere existence of the April 1 statutory deadline established by the IIRIRA which was enacted September 30 1996 did not provide a basis for failing to comply with the 60 day delay provision We trust this answers your inquiry Sincerely yours Robert P Murphy General Counsel cc
