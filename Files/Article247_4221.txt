                                 Cinematic Morals                        Dear David            As to whether Pauline Kael you and I or anyone should support a filmsimply because it might do humanity some good my argument is All good filmsdo humanity some good and no bad films do So I will not give a movie a passbecause its heart is in the right place and voted thumbs down on such as ASoldiers Story  Besieged  Buena Vista Social Club greatmusic bad direction terrible story sense too much Ry Cooder Jakob theLiar  and The Other Sister             In writing approvingly about The Green Mile  I was not endorsing itfor political reasons but for personal ones Aware although I was of thebroadness of the John Coffey character I genuinely liked the moviefound itabsorbing careful storytelling Reports from theaters indicate audiences byand large love it and are moved by it it may emerge as the seasons biggesthit            If I have saddled myself with political responsibilities it has not beenconsciously but I dont think that would be a bad thing for any critic to doat least when a film makes it appropriate My intense dislike for Very BadThings and the second half of Fight Club reflected political ormoral outrage among other things And should have Anyone who can find racismin The Green Mile but not fascism in Fight Club is lookingthrough a very specialized filter            But I hope you dont believe I would praise or attack a movie I didntactually likehate just because of a political agenda As for the damnJarJar picture that one is an excellent example of a film so quicklydismissed by fastdraw gossip that many critics I am not including you mayhave been ashamed to say they liked it It could have been the lost footagefrom Magnificent Ambersons and if presented by George Lucas in thatclimate would have been shot down It is always a little sad when critics tunetheir strings with Page Six When Janet Maslin announced she was leaving thetimes the New York Observer headline said quoting from memory LikedPhantom Menace  Hated Gummo  As if nuff said My thoughtwas So                        As for JarJar what was the matter with him Didnt like his accentThought his movements were too alien or not alien enough Aliens in movies areroutinely made understandable likable comprehensible Or monsters Can theynot also be goofy and very odd            Are the common man and woman capable of responding to works of complexitySometimes Depends on the work But you cite Being John Malkovich Three Kings  and South Park as your examples and I can onlyobserve that the first did disappointingly at the box office the second onlyfairly well and while South Park made piles of money my own guesshaving attended a public screening is that its fans did not respond to it withcomplexity but embraced its vulgarity while the irony whizzed rightoverhead            Some of the reviews of that film were hilarious in the way they praised itfor accomplishments that had no remote connection I suspect to the way it wasseen perceived enjoyed and understood by most audiences They liked thedirty jokes the homophobia and racism and the shit jokes period Thefunction of that material as liberating irony and reverse criticism etc waslimited to an elite minority within the audience I believe I was too hard onthe movie in my original review and doubled back a little in a later TVprogram on animation but the notion that most audience members picked up inits complexities strikes me as optimistic                           South Park s cheerfully blatant racism was praised as satiricalantiracism by some of the same critics who found racism in The GreenMile  a film its makers intended to be antiracist My best guess is Alarge majority of the audience for South Park processed the racism onits primary level and missed the irony and a large majority of the audiencefor The Green Mile will see no racism and if their attitudes areinfluenced by the movie it will make them less racist not more The criticaldiscussion of the racial content of those two movies has been too clever byhalf            BestR
