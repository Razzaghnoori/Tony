 Cinematic Morals Dear David As to whether Pauline Kael you and I or anyone should support a film simply because it might do humanity some good my argument is All good films do humanity some good and no bad films do So I will not give a movie a pass because its heart is in the right place and voted thumbs down on such as A Soldier s Story Besieged Buena Vista Social Club great music bad direction terrible story sense too much Ry Cooder Jakob the Liar and The Other Sister In writing approvingly about The Green Mile I was not endorsing it for political reasons but for personal ones Aware although I was of the broadness of the John Coffey character I genuinely liked the movie found it absorbing careful storytelling Reports from theaters indicate audiences by and large love it and are moved by it it may emerge as the season s biggest hit If I have saddled myself with political responsibilities it has not been consciously but I don t think that would be a bad thing for any critic to do at least when a film makes it appropriate My intense dislike for Very Bad Things and the second half of Fight Club reflected political or moral outrage among other things And should have Anyone who can find racism in The Green Mile but not fascism in Fight Club is looking through a very specialized filter But I hope you don t believe I would praise or attack a movie I didn t actually like hate just because of a political agenda As for the damn Jar Jar picture that one is an excellent example of a film so quickly dismissed by fast draw gossip that many critics I am not including you may have been ashamed to say they liked it It could have been the lost footage from Magnificent Ambersons and if presented by George Lucas in that climate would have been shot down It is always a little sad when critics tune their strings with Page Six When Janet Maslin announced she was leaving the times the New York Observer headline said quoting from memory Liked Phantom Menace Hated Gummo As if nuff said My thought was So As for Jar Jar what was the matter with him Didn t like his accent Thought his movements were too alien or not alien enough Aliens in movies are routinely made understandable likable comprehensible Or monsters Can they not also be goofy and very odd Are the common man and woman capable of responding to works of complexity Sometimes Depends on the work But you cite Being John Malkovich Three Kings and South Park as your examples and I can only observe that the first did disappointingly at the box office the second only fairly well and while South Park made piles of money my own guess having attended a public screening is that its fans did not respond to it with complexity but embraced its vulgarity while the irony whizzed right overhead Some of the reviews of that film were hilarious in the way they praised it for accomplishments that had no remote connection I suspect to the way it was seen perceived enjoyed and understood by most audiences They liked the dirty jokes the homophobia and racism and the shit jokes period The function of that material as liberating irony and reverse criticism etc was limited to an elite minority within the audience I believe I was too hard on the movie in my original review and doubled back a little in a later TV program on animation but the notion that most audience members picked up in its complexities strikes me as optimistic South Park s cheerfully blatant racism was praised as satirical anti racism by some of the same critics who found racism in The Green Mile a film its makers intended to be anti racist My best guess is A large majority of the audience for South Park processed the racism on its primary level and missed the irony and a large majority of the audience for The Green Mile will see no racism and if their attitudes are influenced by the movie it will make them less racist not more The critical discussion of the racial content of those two movies has been too clever by half Best R
