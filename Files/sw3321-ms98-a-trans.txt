                oh do you have a do you have a personal computer   yes i do ive had one ever since uh like oh nineteen seventy four i had several since then uh i built my first one from a kit   oh A two or one of those L two   uh it was an  a S  bus uh model   oh okay   uh yeah i dont know if you remember the old uh MIPS computers   yes   uh well   is out of San Antonio originally wasnt it   uh San were they out of San Antonio i thought they were i thought they were out of uh uh New Mexico   i really it it   anyway   i may be confused on that but i remember seeing the ads in Popular Science uh i bought my first one in nineteen eighty   yeah umhum   uh what kind do you have now   uh now i have uh just a regular PC clone   oh   its the  uh its an old one ive had it for oh i guess five years now   well uh   kind do you what kind do you have   well actually im between PCs right now i put my i i had an old one and i kind of got put it up on the shelf and i bought one for uh for the family use and ive given that one to my son its a two eighty six a two eighty six clone uh an AT clone and ive given that to him and he has it up in his room which means i can still use it but uh   thats right umhum   its not readily available so i usually end up bringing home a we have a little portable in the office and when i need to do something i usually bring that one home   umhum is that the laptop type or the yeah those are real convenient   a laptop yes they uh theyre real convenient but sometimes theyre kind of heavy to carry around because you get   you know you get kind of tired if you have to walk a whole lot and i guess its uh its all what we get used to its certainly better than to have a whole machine to take apart my first machine was um a Tandy model one or an old Radio Shack model one and   umhum yes   that was like moving to take that apart     yes sir its still lighter bust box   yes   uh yeah uh i i sold model one uh model threes i guess for a while in my store   oh did you   yes i had a personal computer computer store for a while   oh you did   umhum   well that at the time that was a good business i think now its pretty cut throat isnt it   its extremely cut throat now yeah i was uh you know it was sort of uh just before the uh IBM PC came out   ah well i know uh my model one i put a lots of you know lots of hours on it but it was obsolete fairly quickly it became nothing but a word processor for me so i could do uh you know do letters and things like that at home and uh you know i had lets see i think i had about twenty seven hundred dollars in that little system because i had uh several the floppy drives and all of that   right   and you know twenty seven hundred dollars today will buy you a pretty well equipped four eighty six   uh thats about right yes you can get a a real screamer for twenty seven hundred now its amazing   yes   its  you look at the computer power that the you know the personal computers put on our desk compare it you know with the you know i guess the the first computer i used with a a  or something like that and uh i mean you this is the you know you have more sitting in your desk than the whole building then   yes um my little model one is a thirty two K and i made the great advancement of of uh kicking it up to forty eight K memory and uh you know that was just a big deal in those days   my first computer came uh i had a four K memory board with with yeah its four K   four K oh did you ever wonder what youd do all with all the four K   well at that time i was programming an assembly language right uh and and i had a cassette tape for my memory   yes   for my storage i didnt have a floppy and uh it was uh you know you you there was you there was still a press to have more memory i mean grew went from four to sixteen and it made a big jump to thirty two and you know   yes i uh i think i paid what did i pay i paid a a pretty good chunk of money something like thirty or forty dollars just to buy the chips to upgrade mine of course they it already had sockets on the boards because they had already uh   umhum   you know they they had the board set up with the sockets in it so it it wasnt that bad but   yeah yeah   you know now uh machine i bring home has two megabytes two megabytes of RAM and
