        well i think that theres uh a few things i would like to see um in the work environment that could improve things and number one is um       health benefits things like uh insurance for number one but another would be like um  facilities or the ease some easy way to go out and exercise or something like that if you felt like it in the middle the day   i i definitely agree on that um im working for a law firm right now the benefits are not bad the only thing i think that theyre desperately missing is we have no dental plan whatsoever   um yeah same here   um but as far as what id really like to see is i live close enough to the city that i would be able to bicycle in if i could   um   if there was some sort of provided provided facility for that um maybe a locker area a shower area to change to take a shower before work   yeah yeah   and some place to lock the bicycles up and ive heard of a lot of other companies providing that that would be something to look forward to um   lets see   another one id like to see would be in flexible scheduling of hours   well a lot depends on the job though   yeah   what do you do   well right now im still in school im still a student but the ability to   oh okay   you know kind of have a little bit of freedom over that to schedule your work from day to day from week to week so every once in a while you can slip in a three day weekend without having to use a day vacation or or just something like that   right   feel like taking a class at night and you just come in earlier for a while or something like that   yeah that would be nice   and   i suppose that does depend on the type of job type of environment youre in   yeah   um  im right now also a full time student       and uh but i work in the evenings for the law firm       so its a rather yeah its a rather interesting uh rather interesting interesting set up  work full time go to school full time   yeah that can be rough yeah i did that for about a year and had my fill of that       swore to never do it again   but   i think another thing um would be nice i guess this is more of an overall really nebulous kind of thing would be consideration of um  like the family in some in somebodys in the way that somebody relates to the work place   how so   um well an example would be in the military they give a whole lot of allowances for family people they even get paid more they get um allowances for um you know have being married or having children i dont really think that that is fair i think uh equal work equal pay for equal work ought to be applied in that case   well they do   but um they get housing and stuff like that   yeah yeah i have friends that are in the military and they do get quite a lot of perks   and other considerations as well you know their the duty is a little bit different and stuff like that   right right   but that you know recently there was some kind of documentary on some station i dont know what and some guy was on there he was a middle level manager and he was talking about how you know here hed spent all these years putting in fifty hour weeks um you know for these various places hed worked at now you know here he was totally unemployed and been unemployed for nine months and it got him absolutely nothing some kind of consideration there would be nice as well i dont know what would be the solution i suppose uh not foolishly giving an extra ten hours a week to some place   right   if theyre just gonna pork you in the end   um what a lot what a lot of companies do is far as far as their health benefits are concerned the insurance provides um coverage for the spouse and or family in a lot of cases i know thats the case in my office at least   yeah yeah   theyll provide minimum benefits for your spouse and dependent codependent children not like the case applies to me but um it is nice that they offer it   yeah its a good consideration for families thats absolute necessity in todays world and price   definitely and health insurance costs   man theyre getting so expensive right now i dont have any health insurance its kind of disturbing unless you   you youre not still covered under your parents   no im gonna be thirty this year but   oh wow  when you said you were going to school full time   and yeah im working on my PhD   oh thats different   its a long road  but the insurance they have at school is kind of uh theyve got a really minimum plan and itll cover you you know and as a student you dont need a whole lot if   umhum   if you lose a leg or something like that you just need the skin folded over you know you know just something to keep you alive till you graduate and make some money and i suppose can go out and get it fixed then       right what school is this   Georgia Tech in Atlanta   oh wow   but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that   wow   and so this this is that year that was four hundred i just wasnt prepared to pay for it im not too sure what im gonna do about that right now theres still another six months to go and its not a pleasant feeling worrying about that   right now right now the company that my company that picks up the insurance they pay i think its thirty dollars a month so thatll be at three sixty a year   hm   and thats basic uh group health coverage   is there any deductible with that or anything like   no
