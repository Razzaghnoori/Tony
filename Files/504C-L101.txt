 February 1993 Dear Herron Friends Herron students excel again Not only are they winning awards around town but many will be presented with scholarships or gift certificates on April 30th at the annual Awards Honors Ceremony Faculty members select outstanding students in each area to receive funds that come from annual donations and the interest from endowed scholarships The funds go directly to the students tuition The gift certificates are most typically from art bookstores and art supply stores Winning an award is a tremendous honor for a Herron student It exemplifies the support and encouragement that the faculty and community provides For many it s the extra boost they need to continue their studies toward a productive career in the visual arts Please consider making a donation to this rewarding program Come that evening and see your student shine as he or she goes to the stage to accept the award Your involvement will be greatly appreciated Sincerely William J Voos Dean
