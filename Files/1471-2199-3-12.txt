 Background Numerous diseases require treatment by systemic delivery of a therapeutic protein Repetitive or continuous injections are the only delivery method used in daily practice As a mean of reducing the inconvenience of multiple injections or implantation of mini pumps gene transfer technology may offer certain advantages In order to achieve a high plasma concentration whatever the vector used the transfection of a large tissue mass is required e g liver or muscle In rodents intravenous injection of a non targeted vector viruses or plasmid preparations induces mainly transfection in the liver and the spleen 1 2 As of today transfection of other large organs by viral vectors has not been accomplished in by way of systemic delivery 3 The main inconveniences of intravenous administration of first generation adenoviral vectors are their immunogenicity 4 and hepatic toxicity 5 6 The muscle as a large tissue mass is a candidate for production of recombinant protein but the transfection is limited to the injection site Intra muscular administration is an attractive option as it avoids liver damage but the levels reached are not satisfactory 7 An alternative to transfection with adenoviral vector is the injection of naked DNA into the muscle followed by electroporation The electroporation setting that induced high blood levels of excreted encoded proteins were defined by Bettan et al 8 and Mir et al 9 10 This setting of 8 pulses of 20 ms and 200 V cm at a frequency of 1 Hz increased the plasmid expression up to 2 logs in the C57Bl 6 mice In this study first generation adenovirus transfection and plasmid electroporation of the muscle were compared to determine which one is the most suitable for obtaining high plasma levels of two proteins of interest namely mhATF BPTI and endostatin mhATF BPTI is a newly designed chimeric protein that has angiostatic properties and endostatin is an angiostatic undergoing clinical trials that was used for comparison As these two proteins are interfering with tissue healing the luciferase gene was used to study the local tissue damage caused by the two transfection methods Another application of electroporation is the transfection of tumours Human as well as rodent tumours vary greatly in expressing the surface receptors for adenovirus Consequently the gene transfer with adenoviral vectors is very low in tumours that poorly express those receptors Plasmid DNA alone is not very efficient transfectant therefore the electroporation offers a possibility to transfect tumours resistant to viral infection 11 12 In this study the electroporation of a non permissive adenocarcinoma of the lung is compared to the adenoviral vector Results Electroporation enhances plasmid gene expression in muscle The luciferase activity in C57Bl 6 mice muscle was compared when transfected with plasmid alone or with plasmid followed by electroporation at various voltage As depicted on Fig 1electroporation increased transfection to a maximum of 2 logs which was attained at 180 V cm There was no more enhancing effect when the voltage was lowered to 100 V cm It remained to be determined if the 2 log increase in transgene expression was enough to obtain high blood levels of a secreted transgenic protein Therefore plasmids encoding mhATF BPTI or human endostatin were injected into the muscle with and without electroporation and the plasma level of the encoded protein was monitored To verify that the injection had been properly performed an equal amount of pAdapt Luc was added to the plasmid preparation and the mixture was injected in a separate group of animals Both groups with and without pLuc showing similar expression levels of the secreted encoded protein were pooled As shown in Fig 2the injection of plasmid alone pATF BPTI or pEndostatin did not lead to blood levels above the background In contrast plasmid injection followed by electroporation resulted in detectable blood levels of mhATF BPTI 5 ng ml and of hEndostatin 25 ng ml These concentrations are however far below what one can achieve with low dose adenovirus 10 9iu injected intravenously which results in protein production by the liver Plasmid electroporation does not compete with adenoviral vectors The volume of injection limits the quantity of adenovirus or plasmid that can be injected into the gastrocnemius of a mouse without overflow The maximal volume of 50 L and the highest concentrations of the available batches of either recombinant adenovirus 10 10iu 50 l or plasmid 50 g 50 l were employed to compare the two gene transfer methods The following electroporation conditions i e 200 V cm 8 pulses of 20 ms at a frequency of 1 Hz were employed The luciferase activity was measured in the gastrocnemius muscle of C57BL 6 mice 2 days after the gene delivery As depicted on figure 3transgene expression was roughly the same with adenoviral vector as with plasmid electroporation The leakage of adenovirus out of the muscle induces a significant luciferase activity in the liver and in the spleen This level corresponds to an intravenous virus dose that is far below that found to be toxic for the liver In contrast the electroporation of the muscle was not accompanied by any transgene expression in the liver but a few mice showed a very low luciferase activity in the spleen It is noteworthy that the background of luciferase is higher in the muscle than in the liver This was always observed and considered to be inherent to the detection method To further investigate the secretion capacity of the muscle 10 10iu Ad Adapt mhAB were injected in the gastrocnemius of mice The plasma levels of mhAB monitored for 3 weeks after the injection showed a peak at 10 4 ng ml on day 10 after administration In view of the variation transduction of the muscle with first generation Ad 5 is not significantly more efficient that with electroporation Local injury caused by muscle electroporation The damage induced by the electroporation was assessed by clinical observation histological examination of muscle sections and determination of creatine kinase in the plasma Clinical symptoms were not observed in any of the mice during the observation period of 2 weeks At autopsy practiced 2 7 and 14 days after the electroporation macroscopic examination of the treated areas showed local abnormalities and an oedema of the whole gastrocnemius muscle On day 2 the muscles were just a bit pale whereas at day 7 and 14 the site of electroporation was white creamy and felt hard upon palpation fig 4 Microscopic examination revealed severe muscle necrosis fig 5 that was accompanied by a severe polynuclear eosinophilic and mast cell infiltration The quantification of the pathological changes was assessed by determining the percentage of necrotic fibers on transversal sections of the muscle at the site of electroporation as well as by measuring the creatine kinase CK concentration in the blood Histological scoring confirmed that the muscle damage was maximal at 7 days after the electroporation Fig 6 Since the creatine kinase levels are not decreasing within the first week after electroporation the muscle lesions must have continued over several days In contrast after an acute muscle injury like an ischemic infarction the peak of CK occurs within few hours This first peak may have occurred after the electroporation but was not monitored Thus the elevation of the CK between day 7 and 14 probably reflect the slow necrosis of the muscle fiber occurring during the first week More importantly the electric pulse delivery caused on its own a severe rhabdomyolysis and the prior injection of saline significantly increased the muscle damage but the addition of naked DNA did not influence the muscle injury Other investigators showed that protein expression from injected DNA was correlated with the voltage intensity up to 250 v cm Thus to determine a therapeutic window for the electroporation procedure the voltage intensity was gradually diminished and the corresponding muscle damage assessed as previously Fig 7 The degree of necrosis was indeed correlated with the voltage intensity and decreased to background at 50 100 V cm Unfortunately the luciferase expression levels decreased as fast as the muscle damage and no therapeutic window could be found with these settings Intra tumoral electroporation as compared to transfection with adenovirus The permissiveness to adenoviral vectors of rodent as well as of human tumours varies within a range of 3 logs One of the reasons is that viral vectors are dependant on membrane receptors to enter the cells Adenoviral transfection can be dramatically impaired in tumours that lack the appropriate receptors Therefore transfection of naked DNA using electroporation might offer a possibility to transfect adenoviral resistant tumours The L44 bronchial adenocarcinoma was selected from among ten rat tumours of different histological origin as being very poorly permissive to adenovirus The standard plasmid electroporation was compared to adenoviral gene delivery in subcutaneously growing tumours As depicted on fig 8the electroporation of 50 g pAdapt Luc and the injection of 5 10 9iu Ad Adapt Luc induce roughly similar luciferase expression However a non negligible proportion of adenoviruses leaks out of the tumour and reaches the liver Such leakage is 600 times higher with intra tumoral delivery than after intra muscular injection as judged by the luciferase activity measured in the liver In contrast there is no leakage of the luciferase activity from the tumour after plasmid electroporation In order to assess the toxicity associated with the viral leakage to the liver graded doses of luciferase and empty vectors were injected iv in Brown Norway rats The intravenous route was chosen on basis of its consistent reproducibility The luciferase activity in the liver was measured and pathological changes were scored in liver sections To avoid interference by the transgene the liver damage were determined in animals injected with an empty vector Figure 9shows that the leakage associated with the intra tumoral injection of 5 10 9iu and 10 10iu is in the range of vector doses that induce a mild to moderate liver damage In an attempt to assess the therapeutic window of the adenoviral vector in this poorly permissive tumour the number of transduced cells in the tumour was determined by injection of vectors encoding the galactosidase gene Table 1 It is assumed that no significant effect is expected from a therapeutic transgene e g thymidin kinase mhATF BPTI or endostatin if the percentage of transduced tumour tissue is below 5 The intra tumoral injection of 10 10iu adenovirus resulted in the transduction of only 1 2 of the tumour cells mostly limited around the needle track Table 1 This vector dose of 10 10iu is already toxic for the liver Fig 9 Thus the margin between efficacy and toxicity of the adenovirus in non permissive tumour is not wide enough for therapeutic applications Discussion Several investigators have used electroporation procedures to increase the gene expression of naked DNA injected in rodents muscles or in tumours 13 14 There are basically two types of muscle electroporation protocols 1 high voltage short pulses and 2 low voltage long pulses The highest plasma levels of an encoded protein were obtained with low voltage 200 V cm long pulses 20 ms and 8 pulses at a frequency of 1 Hz i e the blood concentration of human secreted alkaline phosphatase reached values around 2 g ml 8 The plasmid preparations described by others are most of the time endotoxin free and the transgene is under a CMV promoter without any nuclear transport signal Using these settings and the BTX electroporation device the transgene expression after intra muscular plasmid injection could be enhanced by a factor 100 This led to plasma serum levels of endostatin around 10 50 ng ml The dose of plasmid per injected muscle could not be easily increased for technical reasons Given the maximal achievable plasmid concentration the injection volume would have become too large for the muscle Bettan et al have shown that increasing the dose from 30 g to 300 g by multiple injections resulted in 7 to 10 fold higher plasma levels Thus the intra muscular injection of naked DNA followed by electroporation is considered by some as a means to obtain therapeutic plasma levels of proteins However this range of plasma concentration can also be achieved by intramuscular or systemic administration of first generation Ad5 vectors The toxicity of these vectors is well documented 6 5 Systemic delivery of adenovirus vectors induces mild liver damage at low dose 10 9iu in mice and severe hepatitis and bone marrow necrosis at high dose 10 11iu in a mice Intramuscular injection of 10 10iu induces moderate local inflammation 15 However the local and systemic toxicity of the adenoviruses can be dramatically reduced by using gutless viruses 16 Notably we observed severe muscle damage after the electric pulse delivery which was worsened by the pre injection of saline but was not influenced by the presence of plasmid Most authors dealing with electroporation gene transfer did not investigate the toxicity of electroporation All differences between those published protocols and our parameters were tested to verify if they were responsible for the toxicity observed in our hands but that was not the case Similar damage occurred after using a simple anaesthesia hypnorm or in combination with muscle relaxants during electroporation Different positions of the leg between the electrodes were tested with no influence on the toxicity No difference in muscle damage was observed between male and female mice The influence of the type of electrodes needle or calliper was not tested in our experiments However there are indications from previous publications that both electrodes would induce similar muscle damage Indeed Gehl et al established that the toxicity of electroporation was correlated with the degree of cell permeabilisation 17 and that these was similar when using needles or calliper 18 Thus it may be assumed that the electrode type is not of crucial influence on the toxicity induced by the electroporation Therefore we conclude that the rhabdomyolysis developed in those mice was not influenced by other parameters than the electric pulse settings and the pre injection of buffer Only two investigators have reported muscle damage after plasmid electroporation Mathiesen described muscle necrosis after plasmid electroporation that increased with the cumulative duration of the pulses and that the necrotic fibers never expressed the reporter gene Hartikka et al attributed the muscle necrosis to the presence of plasmid but this conclusion is difficult to interpret since the elevation of serum CPK was not influenced by the plasmid The lesions described by these authors and us have much in common with those induced by electrocution chocks For instance Block et al 19 in an attempt to mimic non thermally mediated muscle injury in electrical trauma used similar electric field strength and pulse length as for plasmid electroporation This resulted in quantitatively and qualitatively very similar muscle damage to what we found with the electroporation procedure Thus there is strong evidence that muscle electroporation as it usually performed is severely damaging and reduces plasmid expression to the survival cells Furthermore even if electrical injuries generally involve much higher field strength 20 it is noteworthy that some pathologic changes found after electric shock resemble the one observed in muscle after electroporation i e the decolouration in bands of the muscle fibbers described by Morita et al 21 Bureau et al have made attempts to improve the electroporation protocol by introducing new settings consisting in the combination of high voltage and low voltages pulses that are inducing less permeabilisation of the myocytes 22 Even if these combined protocols seems to be slightly less toxic there is still much improvement needed to compete with the new generations of adenoviral vectors as a method to transfect muscle in patients In contrast to intramuscular delivery the electroporation of tumours seems to offer a wider therapeutic window In case of tumours that are poorly permissive to adenovirus it is difficult to transduce a large number of tumour cells with adenoviral vectors without inducing severe liver damage In contrast the systemic toxicity is not a risk with plasmid electroporation as it is with adenoviral transfection The possible damage induced by the electroporation could not be easily determined due to the high background of necrosis in the tumour tissue but if it occurs it could only add to the therapeutic effect In our experiments the concentration of plasmid preparations limited the maximal dose that could be delivered into the tumour but If this technical obstacle of producing highly concentrated plasmid was solved electroporation would offer an applicable transfection technique for viral resistant tumours that are accessible with an electroporation device i e head and neck or skin cancers Methods Animals Pathogen free inbred male C57Bl 6 mice weighing 20 to 30 gr and Brown Norway rats weighing 300 to 350 gr were purchased from Harlan The Netherlands All animals were fed ad

Adenoviral vectors Recombinant adenovirus vectors were generated in PER C6 cells by homologous recombination between an adapter plasmid pAdapt and the E1 deleted Ad 5 DNA plasmid as described elsewhere 23 As a result of the absence of sequence overlap between the Adapt plasmid and the Ad5 E1 sequences integrated into the genome of PER C6 the vector stocks used in this study did not contain replicative competent adenovirus RCA 25 All vectors were produced on PER C6 using standard procedures 25 Infectious units iu ml were determined by end point cytopathogenic effect CPE assay on 911
