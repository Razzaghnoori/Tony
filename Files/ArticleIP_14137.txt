1992 keynote speech to the national board meeting of the Council of Conservative Citizens the retro successor to the Klannish White Citizens Councils Despite frequent appearances at its meetings and

Garment workers and human rights organizations filed suit Wednesday against 18 companies charging that their clothing is manufactured in appalling Saipan sweatshops But apparently it was all a merry mix up judging by the response of the companies involved THE GAP does not tolerate this type of conduct in the factories where we do business I m convinced WAL MART has a zero tolerance position with
