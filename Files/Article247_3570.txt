 Tough Questions and Throwaway Gestures Hey Brent Now you re confusing things I m all for paying respect to minority groups I m all for equal access I m committed to the goal of better race relations And I resent the insinuation that I might not be If I ve devoted myself to anything in my life as a journalist it s to advocating what I call integration I still use that old fashioned word because I think it best captures what I believe in the still distant ideal of a truly shared interracial community Check out my book or just about anything else I ve written in the past decade It s all about figuring out how to make what you call the browning of the nation a smoother happier process But paying respect and pandering are not the same thing and what the presidential candidates are doing is pandering pure and simple The hard questions on all these issues are about means in my view not ends I know there are still plenty of bigots out there lots of people who think the black check out clerk won t do as good a job as the white one next to her and some though a much smaller number I think who actually wish black people ill and would go out of their way to harm them But most Americans I m convinced have come around by now to accepting the goal of racial equality Just about everybody thinks there should be a healthy share of blacks at top colleges Most whites know there must be black politicians black judges black generals and black corporate chiefs And I don t think most whites want to step in the way of anyone black white or brown who s qualified What s hard is figuring out how best to achieve these ends and that s where I think the candidates and lots of the rest of us are ducking the issues C mon Brent you can t think George W s pass at the Unity convention amounted to anything serious I m pretty enthusiastic about his candidacy and even I saw that as a throwaway gesture This is what I mean when I say the fault s not in the candidates but in ourselves We ve got to ask more of these people on race and all the other issues that we care about I don t think the answers are easy far from it But all the more reason why we need some leadership that can face up to the tough questions Surely you and I can agree on that All best Tamar
