                            It is becoming increasingly apparent that the vast blue expanse of oceanthe last        frontieris not as inexhaustible as it once seemed While we have yet to fully explore the        reaches of the sea technology has granted humans the ability to harvest its wealth We can        now fish anywhere at any depth for any species Like the American frontier ranges bison        and wolf populations brought to the brink of extinction swordfish and sharks are the        oceans most pursued prizes The disadvantages associated with the depth and dimensions of        this open range however have long obscured the real consequences of fishing Indeed        scientists have the formidable challenge of assessing the status of species whose home        covers over  of the earth        Three recent highly publicized papersa trifecta detailing troubled waterscall        attention to overfishings contributions to the dramatic declines in global fisheries        Delving into the past Jeremy Jackson and colleagues  combined local historic records        with current estimates to detail the ecological impacts of overfishing Reg Watson and        Daniel Pauly  drew attention to distortions of global catches and Ransom Myers and        Boris Worm  highlighted the depletion of the majority of the largest ocean predators        While some have valid criticisms of the assumptions and aggregation of historic data used        to assess the global situation few disagree with the overriding conclusion that humans        have drastically altered not only fish biodiversity but increasingly the ocean        itself        Recent reports by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization FAO which        maintains the worlds most complete global fisheries database appear to validate the        conclusions of these studies The most recent FAO report states that  of global stocks        are significantly depleted or overexploited and  are either fully exploited or meet the        target maximum sustainable yield Only  of global stocks are either under or moderately        exploited As the sea is increasingly harvested many ecologists wonder how the ecosystem        will continue to function Jackson et al  Although economic and social        considerations often supercede scientific assessments science will continuously be called        upon to deliver management options that will straddle the needs for conservation and        production even in areas where there is only subsistence fishing Box  As scientists        debate the details of global fisheries assessment they are also including studies of the        longterm ecosystem effects and options for recovery efforts Like was done on the open        range shall we conserve or farm the seaor both                    Catches Collapses and Controversies        The FAO began keeping fisheries records in  Unfortunately an enormous amount of        data comes directly from each countrys fishing industry which is often biased as a result        of unreported discarding illegal fishing and the misreporting of harvests For example        midlevel Chinese government officials seeking promotions systematically enhanced Chinas        fisheries numbers in recent yearswhich inflated and skewed international catch rates        The FAO data show that catches excluding a recent surge in anchoveta and Chinas        suspect numbers reached a peak of  million metric tons in the late s and have since        begun to decline Regional studies validate these trends Most of the line fish around the        coast of South Africa are depleted to  of pristine levels says George Branch a        marine biologist from the University of Cape Town Cape Town South Africa Meryl        Williams Director General of WorldFish in Penang Malaysia notes that the Asiaspecific        database called TrawlBase wwwworldfishcenterorgtrawl confirms that the regions        commercial species have been depleted to  of what they were  years ago        Obtaining accurate information on highly migratory species is challenging to say the        least It is not hard to imagine that data quality is the biggest disadvantage to any        scientific assessment Of the  managed stocks in the northeast Atlantic Oceanincluding        invertebrates sport fishes and major commercial finfishdata are kept on only onefifth        of the species There are  fish species in the region but only  species are of        commercial interest and merit inquiry We know next to nothing about noncommercially        fished species notes Jeff Hutchings a conservation biologist at Dalhousie University        Halifax Nova Scotia Canada And that is where fisheries have adequate access to current        monitoring programs With the recent expansion of the Taiwanese and Chinese fleets we        dont have the kind of sampling programs needed for those kinds of fisheries says Rick        Deriso a fisheries scientist with the InterAmerican Tropical Tuna Commission IATTC La        Jolla California United States        Couple these inadequacies with previously unknown bycatch rates ie the fish caught        in addition to the target catch and illegal catches and it is easy to see that the task        is formidable The FAO estimates that roughly onequarter of the marine commercial catch        destined for human consumptionsome  million metric tons of fishis thrown back in the        sea a harvested catch that is never utilized or counted It is estimated that the illegal        unreported and unregulated IUU fisheries surpass allowed fishing quotas by  IUU        fishers operate in areas where fishing is not permitted use banned technologies or        outlawed net types or underreport catches The IUU fishery for Patagonian toothfish        expanded rapidly in the mids likely on the order of  vessels says Andrew        Constable an ecological modeler at the Australian Antarctic Division Kingston        Australia who also works with the Scientific Committee of the Commission for the        Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources Hobart Australia These rates of IUU        fishing could reduce stocks to threshold levels in some areas in two to five years he        adds        Often overlooked is the inescapable fact that even sustainable harvest rates reduce fish        populations quickly If the goal is a productive fishery were automatically talking        about up to a  decline in population across the board says Deriso The FAOs Chief of        Marine Resource Services Jorge Csirke states that from a stock point of view there is        no way to preserve integrity of wild stocks and exploit them at the same time Indeed the        United States National Marine Fisheries Service NMFS considers optimal harvest rates to        be between  of virgin levels But once fish populations dip below the  mark        declines are of serious concern        Atlantic cod in Canadian waters suffered a total population collapse and are now on        Canadas endangered species list Figure  From  billion breeding individuals in the        s Atlantic cod populations have declined by almost  according to Hutchings While        advisors called attention to declining cod stocks Constable notes that by the time a        significant declining trend has been detected by traditional catch assessments stocks are        likely to be in poor shape if not already depleted        Given the task of compiling data on only the economically important species fisheries        biologists developed a singlespecies management approach in the s which assumed that        fisheries affect each species in isolation This approach although now rife with problems        served the community and the politicians well during the decades of abundant resources        They brought the approach of singlespecies management to nearperfection says Boris        Worm a marine ecologist at the Institute for Marine Science in Kiel Germany A growing        discontent with the model in addition to greater awareness of ecological interactions        however prompted Worm and his Dalhousie University colleague Ransom Myers to question the        sustainability of the singlespecies approach Attempting a comprehensive assessment their        widely cited recent paper Myers and Worm  indicated that the global ocean has lost        more than  of large predatory fishes such as marlin sharks and rays        However this new approach to assess fish stocks is not without its critics Fisheries        biologists point out that the nuances of management contained in fisheries datasuch as        altered fisher behavior the variable catchability of individual species and altered        gear usewere discounted in the Myers and Worm  assessment and led to        misinterpretations for some species notably tropical tunas Figure  A number of tuna        biologists have expressed concern that these omissions have left the mistaken impression        that all tuna species are among the list of declining predators Hampton et al  Worm        acknowledges that his approach can be improved but says The whole point of our paper was        to aggregate species to communities to see what the overall ecosystem is doing                    Ecosystem Sustainability        Despite the controversy most agree that the large predators particularly sharks        skates rays and marlin are in the most dire straits Unlike other lowertrophic order        species the wholesale removal of top predators has enormous effects on the rest of the        ecosystem One consequence is that overall reproduction rates can potentially suffer Fish        size gender and age at maturity have a substantial impact on individual species        reproduction rates Since larger fish are the most susceptible to fishing the populations        age structure can shift as individuals particularly females are fished out For example        a inch cm female vermilion rockfish can produce  times the young of a inch        cm fish Given uncertainties with population dynamics the fact that basic biological        data are missing makes the job even harder While knowledge of these components is still        quite spotty tuna inventories for example have started collecting gender data on        catches        Daniel Pauly a fisheries biologist at the University of Vancouver Vancouver British        Columbia Canada has shown that increased fishing has caused the industry to fish down        the food web or systematically move to lower trophic levels over time as higher ones were        depleted Pauly et al  The impact to ecosystems is only beginning to be uncovered        If you fish out an abundant predator the species that it was eating or competing with        will increase says Worm The problem is that the ecosystem may change in such a way that        recovery is inhibited because a species niche space is taken or altered        Fisheries science has taken steps to increase the quality of data in recent years        Traditional fishery models assumed that a fishery was a homogenous thinglike bacteria in        a bottlerather than a spatially diverse system says Pierre Kleiber a fisheries        biologist with the Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center of the NMFS Honolulu Hawaii        United States He adds that recent work accounts for spatial diversity In addition        fisheries are now dealing with the inherent uncertainty of their work and are factoring        that into models and decisionmaking Uncertainty didnt used to be dealt with at all in        formulating fishery management advice confirms Keith Sainsbury a marine ecologist with        the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation CSIRO Clayton South        Victoria Australia adding that its absence gave rise to an awful lot of troubles        Traditional models tended to assume perfect data with no holes in it says Kleiber Now        weve tried to craft a model to fit the realities of missing data        As well as incorporating spatial diversity and uncertainty researchers are beginning to        comprehend the ecological damage caused by different types of fishing gear Indeed        trawling the bottom of the seafloor for groundfish can destroy a halfacre footprint of        habitat Figure  Detailed reports document that depending on the habitats stability        bottom trawling can not only remove fish from seafloor habitats but alter bottom relief        such that it compromises the ability of other fish to survive NRC  In Australia        for example lingcod rely on undisturbed bottom relief to lay their eggs while other        groundfish species depend on complex seafloor habitats for the majority of their food        Science is getting more realistic but it is getting more difficult says Branch        Ecological models are far more complex than traditional fisheries models says Csirke        adding that more model variables make it more difficult to apply to fisheries an industry        whose focus is understandably not conservation Despite its incorporation into national        fisheries policies ecosystembased management remains a loosely defined term It is not a        welldefined concept because it is not possible to optimize every species says Deriso        An additional concern to scientists is that of biomass resilience in the face of        environmental changes Francisco Chavez a biologist with the Monterey Bay Aquarium        Research Institute Moss Landing California United States recently demonstrated that        over a year period warmer and cooler Pacific waters tilt the distribution of anchoveta        versus sardines both openocean dwellers Chavez et al  Indeed El Nio influenced        the crash of the heavily fished Peruvian anchoveta industry in the late s These        examples illustrate how susceptible fisheries are to environmental fluctuations When the        biomass of a population is reduced it is much more sensitive to environmental change We        do not know how environmental fluctuations like these will affect the natural production of        young fish says Kleiber expressing the concern that without a better understanding of        climate fisheries scientists end up trying to estimate moving targets        In the end many scientists have their doubts about the influence of science on        decisionmaking My personal view is that its nave to think that modifying and improving        models will necessarily lead to improved natural resource management says Simon Jennings        a fisheries biologist with the United Kingdoms Centre for Environment Fisheries and        Aquaculture Science in Lowestoft Indeed the International Council for the Exploration of        the Seas Copenhagen Denmark recently recommended a total ban on North Sea and Irish Sea        cod stocks based on singlespecies assessment Although the more intensive ecosystembased        models could not have produced a more stringent recommendation politicians allowed        harvests at roughly half of last years catch                    To Conserve or to Farm        While lowering fisheries effort seems the most logical approach to the recovery of        depleted fisheries social and economic concerns often stymie political action Yet demand        for seafood continues Therefore scientists also are investigating both conservation and        alternative production options        Given the social economic and political problems associated with that managers have        often used closures to help a hardhit species recover In many cases however the        recovery time for exploited species is longer than once thought Hutchings  Based on        the available information it is not unusual for fish populations to show no or little        recovery even after  years says Hutchings All else being equal we predict the        earlier the age of maturity the faster the rate of recovery he adds And that depends on        environmental conditions as well In the case of Antarctic species some overexploited        populations remain at less than  preexploitation abundance after  years says        Constable        One management strategy to recover species is to create marine protected areas MPAs        zones that restrict all removal of marine life Box  A number of marine ecologists are        staunch supporters of MPAs for both conservation and fisherys recovery What looked like        sustainability in the past were fisheries out of our reachnaturally protected areassays        Pauly adding that our increasing ability to harvest fisheries necessitates the creation of        MPAs now In theory these areas are refugia for fishes to reproduce spilling over not        only healthy adults but also potentially transporting thousands of viable youngseeding        surrounding waters To date less than  of the oceans area is protected which hinders        the ability to conclusively determine if spillover rates have the predicted impact on        fisherys recovery        A review of  studies of MPAs by Ben Halpern a student at the University of        California Santa Barbara Santa Barbara California United States demonstrated that the        average number of fish inside a reserve increases between  and  Halpern  In        addition  of the sites had increased diversity While the numbers inside the reserves        look good the crucial condition of larval spillover has yet to be proven Most scientists        involved in the debate agree that MPAs should be one component in an overall management        scheme but worry that until the crucial element of fishing effort is resolved MPAs may        just displace the vast industrial fleets        In terms of simply producing fish for global food needs aquaculture also known as fish        farming is another increasingly popular option In  the European Union produced         of total fisherys production via aquaculture These numbers are projected to steadily        increase but some question whether aquaculture would be sufficient to supply what has been        lost by overexploited fisheries        Concentrated in coastal areas aquaculture has aroused numerous concerns Indeed in        developed countries most operations grow carnivorous fish which necessitates growing fish        to feed fish While the process has become more efficient in recent years due in part to a        growing reliance on vegetarian diets it still takes about  pounds  kg of fish to        create  pounds  kg of desirable meat Aldhous  Yet the total catch of food        fish continues to grow as do concerns about nutrient runoff and estuary pollution        resulting from aquaculture Increasingly coastal residents often complain about the        aesthetics of such activities and there is also new research that indicates that        farmraised fish harbor more cancercausing pollutants than wild species Hites et al                To alleviate many of these concerns openocean aquaculture is now being considered        Indeed the NMFS is set to propose a Code of Conduct for Offshore Aquaculture which would        open up the mile km United States Exclusive Economic Zone to net pens seaward of        coastal state boundaries and authorities The Sea Grant program in conjunction with        interested business is also currently assessing the carrying capacity of openwater pens        as well as their potential environmental impact Given increased industrial interest and        unchanging demand for seafood many think farming the sea may be around the corner        Undoubtedly scientific effort will continue to inform both conservationists and        industry about fisheries capacity and potential recovery options As attitudes towards        fisheries continue to change increased understanding of the ecological underpinnings        should help strike a more informed balance between fisheries conservation and production        The big mistake is suggesting that you can manage fish stocks says Niels Daan a        biologist with the Netherlands Institute for Fisheries Research IJmuiden The        Netherlands In my opinion we can only manage human activity
