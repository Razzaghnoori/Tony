 okay okay they suggested that we uh discuss what we think of when we say camping yeah what do you where do you like to camp how do you like to camp oh i can camp just about most anyway camping or uh motor home is nice uh travel trailer pop up i used to uh live in the Ozarks and uh liked to go up there and just take a backpack and strike out into the woods oh really oh you really rough it then yeah uh huh do you do that very often i haven t done it in quite awhile since i moved down here But i used to do it uh huh uh huh quite a bit you d have a lot of hills in that down in that area yeah yeah it was real hilly yeah that would be really great take a twenty two and go out pardon take a twenty two and find a creek uh huh that sounds like it d be fun did you go alone or with a group or i used to go with my brother we just lived up there uh huh uh huh oh that s great long as it s not raining yeah it gets kind of i we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in um hum get out of the rain really oh that would but i don t know much about camping in Texas uh huh well i m in Pennsylvania you re in Pennsylvania yes i didn t know they did this are you in Texas now yeah oh okay yeah i m down here at TI most everybody i ve been talking to is from Texas but uh we re up here in western northwestern part of Pennsylvania i used to be in Ohio it s some pretty country up there uh huh well you kind of know what it s like then so yeah but we ve uh we ve done uh many types of camping we ve we ve done tent camping and we had access to a motor home which is really super great if you don t want to rough it too much yeah you can get the and uh they have some nice camping grounds you know that have the water piped out uh huh uh huh just set it up and get out of get out of the city for awhile right just get you away from the everyday things that are going on we when the children were smaller we used to go to uh Delaware along the ocean ocean most every year and that was fun we stayed mostly in state parks and uh we really enjoyed that tell you what i m losing you huh i said i m losing you you re getting fade you re fading out oh maybe my dropping my phone is that better yeah that s oh but so what you try take a vacation every year and go out and camp yeah well we used to we don t as much anymore but uh we used to we kind of slowed down a little bit but uh i think the worst the worst thing is when it s raining if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping yeah then it can be kind of bad i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the Ozarks uh huh that s kind of kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping i don t think i would like that what kind uh Copperheads mostly oh those aren t too pleasant no they re yeah we have some of them around here you probably have more there though i would imagine yeah one year they were they were just everywhere i don t know what it was we had a real rainy spring and then it was all year there was oh uh huh just Copperheads everywhere uh huh but you still backpacked and camped out yeah well i lived down in down in the bottom of a big hollow and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time uh huh if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could uh huh uh huh you just get used to it yeah i guess you know enough to look where you re walking or sitting or whatever you re doing yeah yeah yeah i would think i would think a cave would be could have problems like that too yeah this cave that we used to go in was little it was small it was more uh huh yeah it was just big enough for a couple of people to sack out uh huh is your brother younger than you or yeah he s about a year and a half younger uh huh uh huh well that s great that d be a lot of fun you have a lot good experiences from that yeah yeah yeah it was saw a few bears did you really things like that what black ones yeah yeah that would be exciting yeah the first first couple of times it s pretty scary but uh after that you realize they are just as afraid of you too so yeah yeah they re usually more afraid of you than uh you are of them usually but they re on the increase in this area oh really um hum i don t know if they don t have them up there do they the black bear oh yeah yeah the population s been really really up they ve uh yeah oh do they they ve had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much yeah they down here they they stopped for awhile or they really made it hard to hunt them i don t know what it s like now i haven t been back up there in awhile uh huh yeah but uh we we really like camping i i must say that uh we have we really have a lot of fun a lot of memories in that from camping and uh well it s good to get out and smell some fresh air too yeah yeah so it s just so it s a lot of work too it s uh getting you know getting ready and taking care of everything but it s um yeah it s really refreshing so well i think we re about to run out of our time i think so well it was really good hearing from you and i hope you get back into camping again and do a little more of it yeah yeah i m sure i will okay thanks a lot and you have a good day okay bye bye you too bye
