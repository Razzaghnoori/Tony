                            This book the latest in the excellent Monographs in Population Biology series from        Princeton University Press is a work of advocacy in which the authors argue that        evolutionary theory is incomplete and that in consequence we are failing fully to        understand phenomena as disparate as ecosystem development and the interplay of genes and        culture in shaping human evolution What we are missing they argue is an appreciation of        niche construction the process by which an organism modifies the abiotic and biotic        environment in which it is subject to natural selection The authors major assertion is        that the importance of niche construction is so great that it should be regarded after        natural selection as a second major participant in evolution and that it is not just an        important addition to evolutionary theory but requires a reformulation of evolutionary        theory Bold claims indeed        After introducing the conceptual framework OdlingSmee et al set out a series of        arguments to support this position the first of these being the empirical case for the        existence of niche construction Niche construction as broadly interpreted here is        everywhere Animals build nests burrows and protective cases and so alter the environment        they experience in a way that may select for further adaptations The changes caused by        some animal species such as beavers and earthworms are of a sufficient magnitude that the        environment experienced by a host of other species is affected Many plant species also        modify the environment they experience by generating organic litter influencing        hydrological and biogeochemical cycles affecting temperature humidity and light regimes        and over the longer term determining the make up of the atmosphere Decomposer and        chemoautotrophic microorganisms similarly influence biogeochemical transformations while        parasitic species can manipulate the behaviour and internal environment of the hosts they        infect Perhaps less obvious examples of niche construction are the many types of migration        and cultural evolution that like physical transformations cause the organisms        descendants to experience a different selective environment        After this broad accessible survey the authors change key rather abruptly and explore        twolocus frequencydependent population genetics The novelty here is that selection on        one locus depends on the history of gene frequencies at the other niche construction        locus In an extension gene frequencies at one locus affect an environmental variable with        its own dynamics that in turn influences the second locus As one would guess the models        display a range of potentially interesting dynamics though generalisations and broad        conclusions are sparse We guess the aim of the chapter is to illustrate that environmental        feedbacks can be potent and general agents of evolutionary change but the restriction of        the theory to such a narrow model with very technical explanation risks losing the few        readers who we suspect will stay the course did we really need a rederivation for        haplodiploids        Perhaps aware of the dangers of getting bogged down in detail the argument then moves        to proving a case for the universality of niche construction Invoking the second law of        thermodynamics and Maxwells Demon the authors lead us through a challenging thesis that        concludes that the persistence of life on earth requires both natural selection and niche        construction thereby justifying some of the bold claims for their new theory We think        they are technically correct but we are concerned that the demonstration of the        inescapability of niche construction as defined here does not guarantee that it will        actually tell us new and important things about the world as the theory of natural        selection has        The remainder of the book explores the implications of nicheconstruction thinking for        evolutionary biology ecology and the human sciences and in our view is the most        successful part Though it is rare for the authors to offer new analysis and insight their        sideways look at many issues from the nicheconstruction viewpoint often offers interesting        new angles on old problems and suggests new avenues of enquiry that may be the books        greatest legacy A good example of this is their convincing and timely argument that a more        explicit recognition of evolutions role in environmental feedbacks will help to unify        populationcommunity ecology and ecosystem science        The chief argument for the prosecution is that niche construction is common but not        pervasive and that wherever ecologists and evolutionists have found interesting examples        of it they have developed appropriate theory and concepts to understand its ramifications        For example some of the clearest examples of niche construction occur in plant succession        where as FE Clements realised nearly a hundred years ago earlysuccession plants        frequently modify their environment in ways that allow other species to replace the        pioneers Interestingly the strict Clementsian theory of facilitation niche construction         avant la lettre  has given way to a more pluralistic theory of        succession It is a great pity that the authors give so little space to plants and plant        ecology as it here that some of the finest examples of niche construction are found as        well as the bestdeveloped conceptual framework for studying the roles of environmental        feedback        Other areas where biologists have welldeveloped theories of the influences and impacts        of niche construction include coevolutionary theory where the environmental feedbacks are        largely biotic and Dawkins theory of the extended phenotype Very close to some of the        arguments discussed here and generously acknowledged is the idea developed by Jones        Lawton and colleagues of ecosystem engineers species that have a major impact on the        abiotic environment experienced by a large number of species        A major strength of the book is that it reveals common processes and patterns underlying        disparate biology in consistently interesting ways Its chief contribution is thus not to        tell us new things about how nature works but to link together many different aspects of        ecology under an umbrella of theory that may in the future lead to new insights Do they        deliver on their grand claims Time will tell but our view is that they dont They        engagingly admit that for their project to succeed the new theory must earn its keep by        producing significant new biologysomething which has yet to occur However the great need        for the biological and human sciences to integrate across subdisciplines as the authors        bravely attempt here makes this a hugely worthwhile book Its breadth of scope and its        boldness in creating syntheses have resulted in a stimulating and challenging read
