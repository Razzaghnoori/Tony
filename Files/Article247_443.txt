 Dow Bites Man Everyone leads with yesterday s action on Wall St Nobody calls it a crash At USA Today it s a global stock market blowout At the Los Angeles Times it s a sell off The Wall Street Journal goes with correction The New York Times favors plunge the Washington Post waves of selling Despite the one day loss of almost 700 billion in stock value and the halting of trading not once but twice by tripped circuit breakers the papers make the non crash case in their primary reporting They all point out that the 7 2 percent drop in the Dow was far less than the 22 6 percent drop in 1987 and not even among the top ten biggest one day percentage losses It was 12th And that the Dow is still up over 11 percent for the year The WP produces a particularly interesting pro calm nugget It has the chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange saying that within a couple of hours after the Big Board closed nearly 80 percent of his market s traders had paid off what they owed from the day s trades This notes the Post is a sign that firms are healthy enough to absorb their losses And the NYT observes that thus far the stock market has not seen the explosive growth in volume that characterized the 1987 crash But notes the WP there was one growth of volume compared to 1987 that of on line trading which as a result yesterday provided poor to non existent execution The WSJ quotes one brokerage house stock expert to the effect that the Fed isn t tightening interest rates aren t rising and there isn t a recession in sight The paper also quotes a second Wall Streeter saying There is no sense of urgency like in 1987 It seemed far too quiet for a day with almost 700 million shares traded and a Dow off 550 points Then the Journal tries to take the temperature of people off the Street but in doing so demonstrates a bit of a tin ear about the typical investor since the paper immediately comes up with a West Hollywood hair stylist getting his Mercedes Benz washed and a New York psychotherapist who spent a session calming a patient thinking about selling The WSJ says that the day s events show one thing above all else To an extent never seen before the world s stock markets are interconnected and co dependent When one market quakes others can tremble Indeed the papers say another down Dow day is likely today based on poor Tuesday openings in the Asian markets Despite the generally evenhanded reporting there are still some hyper graphic elements Both USAT and the LAT run their headlines in extremely bold type And to boot the LAT s is a six column banner And as was pointed out to this column by Tim Ferguson of Forbes somebody should tell the photo editors that those pictures of anguished looking floor traders that so often run with sell off stories are a bit misleading Those traders aren t necessarily bummed out when markets go down big time They re just tired Unless they re carrying their own long positions they make money on their transactions either way
