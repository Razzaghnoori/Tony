 One two three testing testing I am Renee Cheezem and I m doing an interview with Burt Cheezem on March 12th um how old are you Burt 47 In what country were you born United States of America In which part of the country Georgetown SC And grew up where In SC And NC as well Yes NC And Burt you understand from the form that you signed that this um interview is part of a research project on storytelling and I wonder what your earliest memories of stories being told to you as a child might be Those would be stories of parents and grandparents experiences they had in the depression wars and things like that Can you remember the first story that you can remember anyone telling you some of the first memories of someone telling you a story Well it would probably been things like living back in the hills of TN and having to ride a mule to school things like that Who would have been telling you those stories This would have been my father Were there other people who told you stories when you were very young grandparents perhaps Grandparents grandfathers told me things about things he did when he was younger and a construction carpenter and places things he d been things he d build Do you remember anyone in your family telling you stories that were just maybe made up stories or funny stories Well I don t think that too many of them were made up some of them seemed kind of funny at the time Do you remember any specific ones that you could retell Well I remember tales about some of our relations For example my uncle in FL who uh had his own airplane and decided one thing he always wanted to do was land his airplane on the highway so he arranged one day to coincidentally run out of gas nowhere near an airport so he could have the experience of landing his plane on the highway and taxiing up to a gas station to fill it up and take off again At least that s what everyone accused him of doing So you re not sure if this was a true story or a made up story within your family I know it s true that he landed on the highway we had the newspaper clippings to prove it But the gas station part you re not sure about The gas station part Yeah he taxied to a gas station to fill it up And who told you that story Uh my father He also showed me the newspaper clipping Do you remember being read to when you were little Oh yes Reading stories to you Can you remember the very first stories that were read when you were little Probably one of the first ones that was ever read to me the first one I can remember is my cousins Mary and Glenda reading Trumpet the Dog It s one of the Little Golden Yes I remember all the things about Trumpet the Dog Can you retell the story Can you remember all the details of the story basically Pretty much There was Trumpet the dog and he was always raising false alarms And one day the fox got in the hen house and he went running barking and nobody wanted to believe it was him and he finally drug him out there and lo and behold there it was Something to that effect So this story was read to you by your cousins Mostly How old would you say you were when your cousins were doing this reading Well I was about three at the time They were let s see Mary was probably seven or eight Glenda was about 10 or 11 So your younger cousin was just a beginning reader herself reading stories to you And you remember that one because it was read often or it was your favorite Yeah it was one of the ones we read pretty often it was also the first one I learned to read Did your parents read stories to you also Some Did you have any family storytelling rituals a story at bedtime reading a Bible story or any of those sorts of things Uh not real continuous or anything Who in your family would have been most likely to read to read this you a story or tell you a story Probably depended on which night it was Probably more likely my mother than anyone else Did you have lots of storybooks at your house that were read to you BC We always had books lots of books You said that you remembered the story of Trumpet the Dog and your cousins reading to you Uh did that go on for a long time until you were able to begin reading stories on your own I spent a lot of time at my cousin s house from about the time I was about three probably I was about eight or nine Even after you said that you learned to read the story of Trumpet the Dog after you began to read on your own did sometimes your cousins or other people still read or tell stories to you even though you could read Yes What was well you clearly remember this story but once you got a little older and could remember a little better what would you say some of your favorite stories and books were as a child growing up How old are you talking about Oh elementary school age Well probably the favorite book I had this is a little different I had The Giant Golden Book of Astronomy which I got when I was in the second grade and I read it cover to cover till I wore it out Yeah and why was that particular one special Well because it was really interesting stuff It was about the same time when all the space program was getting started off and I was in the first grade when the United States launched the first satellite and I was in the second grade when the first manned space capsule was sent up and because of what was going on at the time it was real interesting The book just tied right into it So that one you really enjoyed and you read over and over again What about um what about and it was of course it sounds like a true book a scientific book about stars and space What about fictional stories Do you remember storybooks or children s novels that you read growing up or you like My grandfather had a real interesting history books They were sort of semi factual fiction history people in the history of the country like stories of George Washington growing up some of the explorers of the West Lewis and Clark Fremont Carson people like that So you really liked historical and non fiction kinds of things But I also know that you like fantasy as well Science fiction I didn t get started on that till I was in about the sixth grade And you learned to read quite young didn t you I was four years old at the time If I remember correctly the stories that your mother has told me you pretty quickly progressed to reading serious you moved pretty quickly from Trumpet the Dog to more heavyweight reading materials didn t you Yeah I guess so Um do you um do you remember any particular books or stories that you feel like had an impact on you as you grew into adulthood stories that maybe the message of the book or story has had a real impact on your life I d say quite a few Well let s see there s I guess one of the favorite author s of mine is Isaac Asimov who wrote some of the best science and science fiction that was ever written A lot of his books aren t really fiction but scientific essays that he prepared for publication I guess one of the other authors I like a lot uh is C S Lewis I ve read several of his books both fiction and non fiction books Do you think that um reading these books when you were a teenage and older elementary school student had some impact in your career decisions to study mathematics and more technical subjects It s kind of a which is the cause and which is the effect question Asimov his writing is very good sound factual It s also very interesting easy to follow for that type of writing I read a lot of other authors that weren t weren t as good writers but also had interesting ideas I think the best combination of interesting ideas and interesting writing When you think back to when you were younger and people were telling stories to you and reading stories to you um it sounds like the time you spent with your cousins and with your family when all this was happening is a time in your life that you remember real fondly Yes Do you think that reading and storytelling is a big part of that I would say so Now that that you re an adult obviously and have had children of your own what stories do you remember telling to your own children and reading to your own children Well let s see I ve read The Cat in the Hat about 475 times All The Little Monster Books I can t remember what the individual names of them were but I ve read them all multiple times RC Do you remember telling them not only reading to them but telling them stories as well some of the stories that were perhaps told to you that maybe you been passed down to them Oh yes All the family heritage stories about how hard life was for my parents And your own stories Yeah how my own stories about hard my life was laugh and all those sorts of things Do you um what kinds of things do you read now other than some authors that you like mentioned Real currently what do you enjoy reading at the present What writers Let s see recent authors You ve probably never heard of any of these but Gregory Benford is very good these are science fiction uh see David Grant science fiction that is real good Uh Asimov he died about 8 years ago but I still find one or two of his that I hadn t read yet We were mentioning we were mentioning writers you enjoy reading now and we had to take a break Let s see the others that I could think of that I read recently there were some Civil War books written by Jeffrey Shaara and the other by his son Michael Very good Another book that I read recently is very interesting books The Journals of Lewis and Clark Which is really a story from beginning to end I suppose It is a narrative of the three year long trip they took from Washington DC all the way out to the Pacific Ocean and back Now a lot of people would probably look at that and think my goodness I m not sure I d want to read all those details trip What did you enjoy about reading the Lewis and Clark journals Well this was this was the first time that anyone had ever traveled here and recorded any of their experiences and they saw the entire western half of the continent for the first time No one else been there no one else had ever experienced or written about what they d seen and brought it back 50 years later most of what they say and experienced didn t exist anymore So in some ways it was very similar to the space exploration that you were so interested in Kind of It was something that they were in a position to do one time and no one before or no one since could ever reduplicate it Some people think that storytelling in our culture is is uh vanishing because of television and computerized games and email and so many other things that keep people from sharing stories and taking the time to read Do you think that story telling continues to be important and why I think it s important because it s the real link you have to your past and heritage and it s also declining for the same reasons you mentioned People just don t have the time or take the time to keep the traditions going they just get too busy or too lazy How do you try to counter that with your own children and will continue to try and counter that as grandchildren are added to your family As I have opportunities as situations arise in the family such as motorcycle purchasing and things like that I try to weave some personal experience into the conversation Motorcycle purchases Oh yes And storytelling applies Certainly I have some motorcycle stories going back two to three generations actually And now that I know your own son is considering purchasing a motorcycle those stories hopefully can help him make a wise decision A wise decision yeah I suppose Well thank you for taking the time to participate in this interview and for you helping with the research project at UNCC
