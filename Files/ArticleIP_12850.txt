 More Than Monica On New Year s Eve the Guardian of London published a survey of last year s media agendas from countries around the world Headlined 1998 More than just Monica it highlighted the news priorities that prevailed in different countries during the period In China for example the big story had been the Chinese government s self proclaimed diplomatic triumphs such as President Clinton s visit to Beijing and Chinese President Jiang Zemin s visits to Moscow and Tokyo in Russia it had been the collapse of the post Soviet financial system and the humiliation of market reformers in Israel the disintegration of Benjamin Netanyahu s government amid bitter divisions over the Middle East peace process in South Africa the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission on apartheid era crimes in Germany the September election that ousted Chancellor Helmut Kohl and brought the Social Democrat Gerhard Schr der to power in Italy the country s success in qualifying to join the new euro currency and in France its soccer team s 3 0 victory over Brazil in the final of the World Cup But if 1998 involved more than just Monica it was also certainly Monica s year Hers was a story which more than any other united all the papers of the world in a common obsession However there was widespread reluctance around the world this week to report the allegations in the American tabloids that President Clinton may be the father of the teen age son of an Arkansas prostitute Only in Britain did the story play prominently The Times even led its Monday front page with it under the headline Clinton faces DNA test on prostitute s son 13 In Germany the press showed more responsible news priorities with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung leading Monday with Clinton announcing the biggest increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War But the biggest story around the world as the week began was the launch by 11 countries of the new single European currency the euro The reporting of this event in Europe was imbued with euro euphoria except in Britain where euro skepticism continues to predominate All Rupert Murdoch s British papers the Times the Sunday Times the Sun and the News of the World are campaigning vigorously against Britain joining the euro as are Conrad Black s papers the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph But even the British press had to agree with the rest of the world that the launch of the euro after 40 years of planning was an historic achievement It was especially welcomed outside Europe in countries yearning for an alternative to dependence on the U S dollar For example in Havana the weekly Juventud Rebelde announced that Cuba would be the first country in the region to substitute the euro for the dollar in its foreign commercial transactions From January 2000 it said Cuban companies would be obliged to use the euro for their trade with China Vietnam and North Korea Granma the Cuban Communist Party daily described the euro as a force for tranquility and stability and a challenge to the economic and financial hegemony of the United States In India the Hindu devoted its main editorial Monday to the euro under the headline An epochal experiment It said that the euro could benefit developing countries by mounting an effective challenge to the dollar The global preference for the dollar as a reserve currency has not only meant that the U S has had access to inexpensive funds but also that the rest of the world effectively finances its chronic account deficit the Hindu concluded In Singapore the Straits Times led its front page Monday with a story anticipating that the euro would boost the value of Asian currencies against the dollar Among various hyperbolic editorials in the European press Le Monde of Paris appealed Tuesday to a reluctant Britain to overcome its fears about loss of sovereignty and to join the single currency Englishmen the editorial began it s now your turn to play The euro awaits you Europe and its infant currency need you It continued Your country s participation in the euro is also for us Frenchmen a necessity The euro needs Europe s diversity to be neither a clone of the deutsche mark nor a Siamese twin of the Italian lira The support of your culture of your pragmatism and your distrust of bureaucracy etc is indispensable to the stability and solidity of the euro With you present the euro is more likely to become one of the great international currencies As an ancient superpower you know the advantages we can all draw from that
