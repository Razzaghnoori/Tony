 so what type of restaurant do you like basically well i m a vegetarian um and my husband is kosher so if do you know what that means kosher okay so a a lot of the restaurants we select are um uh huh um hum yeah based on the variety of food i don t particularly like to sort of American you know meat and potatoes type of restaurants uh huh yeah um i i love ethnic foods i love um Chinese Indian Tai yeah now do Indian are Indian foods kosher well as long as you re not eating meat um it s to be kosher the meat would have to be kosher uh huh right and um most Indian places don t have a rabbi the places that we eat right so um i i was about to say i didn t think so but most of the most of the the vegetarian Indian meals yeah exactly vegetables and and the same with you know a lot of people wonder do you you know do you find restaurants that will just have vegetarian meals and and even uh huh um hum if like you know you could go to a Chinese restaurant and eat the right um Italian you know that oh definitely Chinese would uh huh um hum yeah because pastas and the and the different types of sauces and things sure yeah right yeah and even um one of my favorites is El Torito s i don t know if you have that it s Mexican it s like a Chi Chi s which is of what no we don t have one uh huh you know my wife and you would probably love to go eat together yeah oh definitely well everytime when we go someplace they have to have good French fries really why oh yeah if they don t have good French fries you know if it s one of if it s a place that has other things if it s not that then we go to Chinese food you know i order um hum um hum you know a beef and broccoli or chicken or chicken and broccoli or something like that you know chicken and cashews and she orders um bean curd oh really uh huh oh tofu and and vegetables right you know so um you two would probably eat real well together um hum we certainly would if if uh huh yeah she she normally picks all of our restaurants though yeah oh does she now do you guys like to go out for sort of fine dining or are you more uh well we really can t we really don t do that that often um i i guess recently we did um um hum i get when we got engaged last summer um we went for fine dining because we were sort of celebrating and we went to the Annapolis area which is um uh huh um hum right Annapolis Maryland it it s uh state capital but it s also on the water so there s a lot of restaurants there it s uh it s a um oh very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in Annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it s French uh huh oh but it was really good everything that was very garlicky and their big specials are things like um very fancy omelets or very fancy crepes um hum crepes yeah and then they also have a lot of other uh French oriented uh meals and i normally get something that s crepe and very American and then she gets something French yeah but um yeah but yeah so she s the daring one in the family as far as food goes yeah definitely definitely yeah but most of the time when we go out um we either go Mexican because uh uh she just has a a need for either some type of Mexican chips or Mexican pizza or something like that or French fries um hum um hum um hum you have to you have to have French fries with just about every meal unless you re eating something other you know some other uh unless you re eating like a baked potato or something right yeah in fact um since Baltimore i see i m not a you don t know the Baltimore Baltimore s on the water and what yeah i was i was wondering if you guys eat a lot of fish um yeah um yes yeah we just had salmon last night for dinner uh but also the spices here um old bay is a spice i don t know if you re even aware of it it s what they used on the uh huh no uh if you ever hear of the Maryland steamed crabs sure yeah i have heard of that okay well old bay is the spice they put on the steamed crabs well true male Marylander Marylander Marylander s have have old bay on just about everything they put it on their French fries they ll put it in their potato salad they ll um um hum um hum oh really they ll they ll put it with just my wife loves old bay with everything so if we have French fries they have to have they have to have old bay on them i see it s sort of like some people and ketchup yeah right yeah yeah well see i i grew up in Pittsburgh uh where Heinz ketchup is and my family is big ketchup yeah uh huh oh really oh wow well you know i have a problem because i tend to find a restaurant and being on a on a tighter budget you know we don t go out to eat that much so once i find a restaurant i only want to go there um hum right yeah uh huh and i ll go there for you know two months straight we won t go anyplace else um hum yeah we do the same and then you know i finally get sick of that one and then i ll find another restaurant i love salad bar restaurants because um uh huh i find that when you order a salad at a restaurant you don t really get a salad you get like lettuce and you know what i mean and the croutons no you get a couple yeah couple yeah it s not a real meal exactly but a salad bar that s that s my favorite i mean if because i just feel like i can make my own meal and there s usually a lot of fun stuff and obviously it s a lot of vegetables but um um hum um yeah we re the same because i m in graduate school and we re living off her salary um hum yeah i know what that s like uh huh and my and my part time work you know it s not our the restaurant our favorite restaurant in the town of Salisbury where actually we live you know where my where i ll return to my job or whatever we can normally eat out for um under fourteen dollars um hum oh that s good and that s you know that s the two of us having unlimited unlimited French fries that s very good and uh it may be a Mexican pizza sometimes both together um along with and see it which is really funny too you know normally she goes straight for vegetables except when she s having French fries uh huh um hum oh really then i i ll order like a vegetable soup or something you know but she ll just have the French fries you know now is she does she like um McDonald s French fries oh okay no no in fact in we re very environmental so we very rarely eat at any of the fast food restaurants uh just because of the um the styrofoam and the plastic waste oh um hum um hum yep and whatever we very rarely will eat at a uh a fast food restaurant i will i ll eat at one more often because of graduate school and being on the road more well that s great it just more yeah i know what you mean but um yeah but she will she almost refuses you know to do that in fact we re at a point now where if we do a salad bar at the grocery store yeah we save the same plastic container and we yeah we take it with us back to the store and bring it home yeah and we take yeah oh do you but still uh huh well you know it s funny that you say that because um our grocery store uh i personally i think the grocery stores in Rochester are very they ll allow you to bring your own like um Tupperware thing like your own container um hum yeah to fill it up i think that s great and you weigh your container you know and then you weigh your salad after that uh huh well that s a really good idea it really is i was very happy about that because i you know i feel the same way you do yeah um hum yeah we we ve used the same uh you know tin bottom with plastic top um hum probably for the past oh i don t know six months oh that s great that really is good yeah so so we re very you know we try to be very environmental and and in fact it s terrible now because um i guess we ve donated money to a number of organizations and you know we re in school i m in school and we re um hum barely surviving here and and we get calls now from like World Wildlife Federation like demanding a hundred dollars yeah oh jeez oh man yeah and when you say but we re in college uh we re in graduate school we can t afford that you know they they say well how about twenty seven well how about ten you know yeah so great how to say no and your like you ll do your own part you know you can do without necessarily spending much um hum yeah uh huh yeah we do all we can now but that it it you know i think that also goes along uh the reason why we pick the restaurants that we go to you know we we really have we really look at restaurants now there s one other little restaurant in town that we ll go to that is um yep yep sandwiches and chips and a pickle you know but you still and that s five fifty uh huh but if you go to a fast food restaurant you re going to spend four fifty and you re going to produce a lot of styrofoam and a lot of plastic so we you know we ll go there instead of you know just going to a fast food place yep a lot more waste yeah um hum that true uh huh well i i don t usually resort to fast food um if i do i feel like it s a salad or something at McDonald s but i do rely on pizza a lot uh huh yeah i do too um i mean to me either ordering in or just going to Pizza Hut or something um hum is like gourmet i mean i just you know what i mean it s just fun it s convenient um uh the uh i don t know if you ve ever heard of Pizzaria yeah i i agree yeah yeah no uh huh okay well they just they ll do everything with pizzas as a matter of fact last night we just went there and they have a great pizza called Spinoccoli and what it is is um normal pizza but then with spinach and broccoli oh oh and it s really really good and i feel like jeez i ll tell Laura i ll tell Laura about that yeah tell her about that um and i feel like i m getting a little bit more health out of that pizza then maybe just well i wouldn t eat pepperoni but you know sausage or something like that but um uh huh um hum um hum yeah that s because my that s really see because a lot of times we ll order a pizza we ll just get a regular cheese pizza or um uh for we just recently got married so my wife so i uh huh got a uh a heavy duty mixer like a KitchenAid or something like that it s called so she s make she makes dough pizza dough and freezes it uh huh um hum oh yeah and then takes it out before i get home for the weekend because pizza s probably one of my favorite most favorite food yeah and she ll make that for the weekend and she ll make you know we ll have two pizzas mine will be regular tomatoes and um really mozzarella and Monterey jack cheese you know sprinkled on it and her s will be you know something um hum uh more gourmet but more you know with yeah more with what you like and i i she loves broccoli and spinach and i think uh she i don t think she s ever probably thought of that cashews or something like that right um hum well Spinoccoli she can t patent the idea though because Pizza Inn already already has it but it s a it s very good well they put it they i guess they put like the dough and then the sauce and then uh huh yeah so it s it s just regular it s just tomatoes uh huh
