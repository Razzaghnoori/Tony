 I Like Mike When Richard J Daley was alive and mayor of Chicago no one gave him a harder time than Mike Royko did Maybe the funniest piece Rokyo ever wrote was an extended parody of one of Daley s frequent solecisms Daley responding to his critics once uttered the phrase Like a guy said a long time ago He who hasn t sinned pick up the first stone Royko riffed on this through an entire column as in Moses leading the Israelites out of Egypt Let s get out of here Ahab sighting the Great White Whale Let s all get that fish Douglas MacArthur leaving the Philippines in 1942 Let s all come back here some time In a less madcap vein Rokyo wrote Boss a devastating portrait of the Daley machine and probably the best book ever written about city politics Yet when Daley dropped dead of a heart attack in 1976 Royko sat down at his typewriter and banged out a column that was both an interpretation and an appreciation Daley s abuse of the English language didn t offend people who weren t that far removed from parents and grandparents who knew only bits and pieces of the language Royko wrote The mayor s abuse of power didn t bother those who had lived through far worse The people who came here in Daley s lifetime were accustomed to someone wielding power like a club be it a czar emperor king or rural sheriff Royko noted The niceties of the democratic process weren t part of the immigrant experiences So if the Machine muscle offended some it seemed like old times to many more It s hard to imagine a political scientist or any other journalist for that matter framing it so simply or so well Reading these gems in the new posthumous selection One More Time The Best of Mike Royko I found myself wondering Why doesn t anyone write a newspaper column this good anymore Royko wasn t quite a Twain or a Mencken but his writing was distinctive and memorable and in its time the closest thing to lasting literature in a daily paper Royko could make you laugh and make you think stir outrage at a heartless bureaucrat or bring a tear to the eye when he flashed a glimpse of the heart hidden beneath his hard shell He performed this range of feats with a regularity and prominence that no city columnist or any national one can match today Royko wrote his 900 words five times a week sometimes six Today the columnist who writes something decent twice a week is a marvel For the better part of 34 years everyone in Chicago read him first in the Daily News then in the Sun Times after the Daily News closed then in the Tribune after Rupert Murdoch bought the Sun Times Even after Royko said that no self respecting fish would be wrapped in a Murdoch paper the Alien refused to accept his resignation and kept reprinting his old columns This led Royko to write In Alien s Tongue I Quit is Vacation Royko s fame spread nationally despite the fact that he seldom left Chicago and refused to do television By the time he died in 1997 he was syndicated in 600 papers around the country Royko s hold came in part from his sense of place He grew up in the Polish neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago that Nelson Algren captured in one of Royko s favorite books The Neon Wilderness and he never left it in spirit Royko s father was a milkman and the family lived over a tavern Before finding his way into journalism Royko already had experience setting bowling pins working on a landscape crew in a greasy machine shop and in a lamp factory and pushing carts around a department store as he noted in 1990 When he said he became a writer because it was easier on the feet he half meant it To his working class and working class once removed readers Royko was like Daley one of us But where Daley often drew on the worst side of ethnic Chicago its tolerance of corruption its parochialism and racial prejudice Royko spoke to its better instincts A neighborhood populist he celebrated the corner tavern and the weekend softball game But Royko also challenged white Chicago s prejudices skewering bigots who tried to keep a white couple that had adopted a black baby out of their neighborhood or a funeral parlor that didn t want to bury a black soldier killed in Vietnam In the column he wrote the day after Harold Washington became the first black person elected mayor of Chicago Royko began with one of his inimitable openings So I told Uncle Chester Don t worry Harold Washington doesn t want to marry your sister Of course Uncle Chester along with Slats Grobnik and Aunt Wanda didn t really exist I m sure that Sam Sianis the proprietor of Royko s beloved Billy Goat Tavern didn t say many of the things Royko attributed to him I m not sure how many of Royko s readers understood that much of what he wrote was facetious or fictionalized These days newspaper writers are no longer allowed the kind of license he took As journalism has become less of a trade and more of a profession once common vices like embellishment plagiarism and binge drinking have ceased to be regarded as charming Mike Barnicle a second rate Roykoesque columnist was fired from the Boston Globe for blending fiction and fact in a way that Royko did routinely Nor is it possible for a newspaper writer now to be as blunt as Royko was In 1990 the University of Missouri School of Journalism released a list of words for journalists to avoid including such terms as gorgeous lazy sweetie and fried chicken Fried chicken fried chicken fried chicken I said it and I m glad Sue me Royko wrote His refusal to be sensitive got him in trouble in 1996 the year before he died In a column lampooning Pat Buchanan Royko wrote that Mexico was a useless country that should be invaded and turned over to Club Med By then Royko s tone had grown increasingly bitter and his irony was easy to miss The result was an enormous protest outside the Tribune by Hispanic groups that took his comments literally and demanded that he be fired If journalism has changed since Royko s heyday so too have cities like Chicago White ethnics have ceased to be the dominant force in urban life In 1981 when Royko moved to a condominium in a lakefront high rise he cast himself as a bungalow bred Margaret Mead studying yuppies by living among them But yuppies or at least the suburbanized offspring of Slats Grobnik were increasingly his audience and his newsroom colleagues Royko saw himself as more and more of an anachronism Before he died he quit drinking and unhappily moved to the suburbs So why don t we have newspaper columnists as good as him anymore To summarize We no longer have his kind of newspaper We no longer have his kind of city But mainly we don t have another Mike Royko a newspaper writer grounded in a place like Chicago with a gift for explaining it to the world and the world to it
