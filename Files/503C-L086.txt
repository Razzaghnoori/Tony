 November 30 1990 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name Please send a million dollars so we can really support geological activities here at IUPUI in perpetuity Late last Spring we established an account for the IGGS Scholarship to help defray the tuition costs for an undergraduate major in Geology at IUPUI As I explained at that Spring meeting I hoped that eventually the IGGS Scholarship fund would have a principal of 20 000 so that the interest would cover the complete costs for a student for one year The account now has about 4 400 There are several ways that we can reach the balance of our target principal The simplest is for one or more of the members to simply donate one million dollars to the IGGS Scholarship Fund If because of the depressed stock market your assets are not liquid enough for you to come up with one million dollars this year then we can consider one of the other alternate ways to achieve our goal One alternate is for you and each of the 36 friends of IGGS on my mailing list to contribute 434 to the Scholarship Fund and our goal will be reached immediately Another alternate way to reach our Scholarship goal is for everyone to contribute as much as he or she can this year and each year for the near future and sooner or later the goal will be attained Let me assure you that we would appreciate receiving one million dollars from you But let me also assure you that we would appreciate equally well the contribution you are able to make Whatever you can contribute you will be helping to support a geology student at IUPUI Your tax deductible contribution may be sent in the enclosed postage paid envelope with the attached return card As an Indiana resident your gift qualifies for a special tax credit of 50 up to a maximum of 100 for an individual or 200 for a joint return For your convenience I am enclosing a copy of Form CC 40 which should be filed with your Indiana State Income Tax Sincerely Arthur Mirsky Chairman
