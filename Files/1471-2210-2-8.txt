 Background Parkinson s disease PD is the prevalent neurodegenerative disorder of adults and is believed to be due to a dopamine deficiency state in the fore brain area It is caused by the death of more then 75 of mid brain dopamine producing neurons Tremor rigidity and akinesia characterize the disease Genetic and environmental factors are believed to initiate Parkinson disease The environmental theory of PD recently received strong support from the work of Greenamyre et al 1 At present there is no satisfactory medication for the treatment of PD Levodopa which is a dopamine structural analog is the golden standard in PD but its side effects upon long term administration dyskinesia dystonia etc 2 compel the search for drugs with better pharmacological profiles Other dopamine DA agonists do not provide adequate therapeutical response 3 Thus multidrug therapy is usually often used In this therapy various adjuvants alleviate side effects of levodopa and enhance its antiparkinsonian action Three main groups of compounds were found to have antiparkinson effect These are dopamine DA receptor agonists MAO B inhibitors and N Methyl D Aspartate NMDA receptor antagonists 4 The monoamine oxidase enzyme exists under two forms MAO A and MAO B Dopamine is oxidized in the brain by the MAO B form MAO B inhibitors maintain dopamine concentration by blocking the MAO B enzyme whose activity is also known to increase with age 5 In addition MAO B inhibitors can block the formation of toxic metabolites from the compounds that are capable to cause PD e g MPTP 1 The beneficial action of DA agonists is based on direct stimulation of the DA receptors There are two classes of dopamine receptors D1 D1 D5 subtypes and D2 D2 D3 D4 subtypes The antiparkinson action of dopamine agonists was found to be mainly due to the stimulation of the D2 class receptors 6 Therefore we favored in the present work those DA agonists that exhibit at least moderate activity toward D2 class of DA receptors NMDA antagonists were observed to enhance the therapeutic effects of dopaminomimetics in PD They block the glutamatergic excitatory pathways that are overstimulated in PD 7 Such action decreases the influx of calcium ions into the neuron and hence downregulates the activation of calcium dependent enzymes This can prevent the neuronal excitotoxic damage We set to identify the pharmacophores responsible for each of these pharmacological activities so as to provide guidelines for the synthesis of new and possibly more potent analogues We also speculated that better drugs could be identified that contain more than one biophore possibly providing activity at multiple sites We therefore designed some potential drug by grouping several biophores into a single molecule thereby creating a single molecule cocktail of drug activity The use of such a drug might reduce side effects stress imposed on the patients while the synergy of its effects might improve overall response Methods Information about available MAO B inhibitors 8 9 10 11 DA agonists 12 13 14 15 and NMDA antagonists 16 17 18 19 38 39 40 was collected from literature sources Their structures were coded and three separate databases MAO inhibitors DA agonists and NMDA antagonists were created and submitted to analysis by the MCASE program MCASE is a powerful analysis tool whose principles have been described in detail elsewhere 20 Basically the program works with databases of structurally diverse compounds where each entry contains the structural formula of a molecule and its activity in a specific endpoint MCASE looks for key features that may be responsible for the observed activity of the compounds of the database The basic idea is that if a substructure is related to the observed activity it will be found mainly in active and marginally active compounds On the other hand if it is not relevant to the observed activity it will be randomly distributed amongst active and inactive compounds of the database The substructures that are seen to be responsible for activity are called biophores 20 which in the case of pharmacological process are basically the pharmacophores The compiled databases contain qualitative data about compounds Our MAO inhibitors database used data from Kalgutkar 8 and others It consists of compounds tested as potential MAO inhibitors Two strategies were tried with this database In the first approach the selectivity of MAO inhibitors was used as the main criterion Selectivity database Hence the preferable MAO B inhibitors were treated as actives while MAO A inhibitors where entered as inactives and unselective MAO inhibitors as compounds of marginal activity In the second strategy only the actual activity of inhibitors towards MAO B form was considered Activity database Under these conditions all compounds that inhibit the MAO B enzyme were treated as active and the others as inactive More details will be given later during the discussion of the specific databases and their biophores For the DA database obtained from the paper by Seeman 12 and others agonists are listed as active while antagonists are entered as inactive Partial agonists are seen as compounds with marginal activity The third database contains information about NMDA antagonists and includes compounds collected from various reports 16 21 and others The database was created as follows NMDA antagonists were set as actives NMDA agonists as inactives and partial agonists as marginally actives In addition to ensure that databases built on the bases of selectivity also possess structural information about the corresponding generic activities binding to the NMDA or DA receptors inhibiting both MAO isoforms active compounds were required to have low K i the dissociation constant of the molecule receptor enzyme complex Models were created automatically by the MCASE program for each of these databases These models were tested for robustness and reliability In order to estimate the quality of the models ten off validation procedures were performed for each database In these validation procedures ninety percents of all compounds from a database were selected randomly and used as learning set to create a reduced model The remaining ten percents of molecules test set were then tested against the reduced sets to evaluated the predictive power of these models Three trials often off validations were performed for each database The results are shown in Table 1 As can be seen good predictions i e high concordance and wide coverage almost all chemicals from the test sets received a prediction were obtained for all databases The ability to recognize active compounds was slightly better by about 5 for the DA database whereas for the MAO B and the NMDA databases the situation was reversed In fact we prefer to underpredict activity i e some experimentally active molecules being predicted to be inactive rather than overpredict it when some experimentally inactive molecules are predicted to be active since overprediction can lead to the design of drug candidates that lack efficacy Overall high coverage and good predictive power by all models indicated that the database s biophores are not products of chance correlation but are relevant to the specific activity types they represent As an additional validation each model was tested with a large group of structurally diverse molecules which were taken from the FDA rodent carcinogenicity database 35 Results Table 2 demonstrate good specificity of the models Number of predicted active compounds with unaccounted activity is low approximately 1 for the NMDA and DA database and even less for the MAO B databases The most reliable biophores from each model were then selected as initial structural elements for the construction of new drug prototypes Results MAO B inhibitors IC 50 the concentration of inhibitor that decreases enzyme activity by 50 does not provide sufficient mechanistic information as it depends on the conditions of the experiment 8 Therefore it cannot be used to compare mechanistically diverse data as in our case Instead we used K i the dissociation constant of the enzyme inhibitor complex to compare the activity of different inhibitors Indeed this is a better indicator of a molecule s potential to reversibly inhibit the enzyme Furthermore reversible inhibitors are less likely to cause enzyme malfunction 8 than irreversible ones As mentioned earlier the selective and reversible inhibition of MAO B versus that of MAO A is the major criterion used to create the Selectivity database Table 1 Chemicals with a ratio greater than 10 were considered to be selective MAO B inhibitors and therefore were used as active entries while compounds with a ratio less than 0 1 were considered to be selective MAO A inhibitors and thus inactive MAO inhibitors which ratio was within 0 1 10 range were considered as unselective MAO B inhibitors and were treated as marginally active molecules In the Activity database Table 1 inhibitors with a K i MAO B value less than 1 M were treated as active while compounds with a K i MAO B value in the 1 5 M range were treated as marginally active molecules All those with a K i MAO B larger than 5 M were entered as inactive The best biophores Table 3 to be used for the derivation of new and better drugs were selected from the MAO datasets on the base of the following criteria The biophore should have a high probability to be relevant to activity PRA The lowest acceptable PRA value was 75 A sufficient number of molecules should contain the selected biophore The biophore should be present in at least 10 compounds Analysis of biophores 1 2 4 5 showed that both of them occur in substituted 5 4 benzyloxy phenyl 1 3 4 oxadiazol 2 3H ones and their analogs Figure 1 many of which are known to be strong MAO B inhibitors 9 Biophore 2 represents a flexible CH 2 O bridge between aryl moieties and was found to enhance the activity and selectivity of the inhibitors as shown in the original work 9 Biophores 1 and 2 include aromatic moieties whose main function is presumably to bind to the hydrophobic site of MAO Biophore 3 6 exists in N 2 Aminoethyl benzamides with substitutions on the aryl ring These compounds are known to be time dependent inhibitors of MAO B 22 Several QSAR and CoMFA analyses were published reporting relevant properties and structural parameters that govern MAO inhibition 23 24 25 26 All of them were performed for narrow data sets and hence the results were confined to the same group of compounds We used these studies to confirm the relevance of some of our biophores For example biophore 2 was found to be an important factor enhancing the interaction between the inhibitor and the protein core of the MAO enzyme 23 25 27 NMDA antagonists The NMDA receptor consists of two subunits that together create a membrane channel Each subunit belongs to the NR1 or NR2 subunit family Various splice variants are also known 16 Activation of the NMDA channel requires that glutamate and glycine bind at the same time to NR2 and NR1 subunits respectively Thus three main types of NMDA antagonists are known glycine site antagonists binds to NR1 subunits glutamate site antagonists binds to NR2 subunits and channel blockers In order to avoid unwanted side effects NMDA antagonists should have either low affinity for the NMDA receptor e g amino adamantane derivatives or bind with high selectivity to one type of NMDA receptor e g ifenprodil eliprodil or similar compounds 16 The chemicals used in the NMDA database were required to have significant affinity for the NMDA receptor For that purpose K i the dissociation constant of the molecule receptor complex of accepted NMDA antagonists was required to be less than 5 M The same criteria were used in the selection of the best biophores from the NMDA model as were described in the case of the MAO databases Biophores 7 10 Table 3 Biophore 7 features the glutamate binding site of NMDA antagonists Figure 2 The molecules that contain it are derivatized amino acids whose phosphonate group is a functional replacement of the carboxyl group of glutamic acid The phosphonate group of the NMDA antagonist binds to the glutamate receptor as does the natural agonist glutamic acid but no conformational change that activates the NMDA channel occurs 28 Beart et al 21 performed a SAR analysis of this type of NMDA antagonists They report a deep hydrophobic pocket good for binding of the class of compounds shown in Figure 3B and a region to accommodate the phosphonate group biophore 7 binding site 21 as structural features of the binding site of NMDA competitive antagonists The generic structure of these NMDA antagonists is shown in Figure 2 Biophores 8 and 9 are characteristic of the NMDA channel blockers Biophore 8 features an aromatic residue that presumably binds to the hydrophobic pockets of the channel walls e g Triptophan 593 Alanine 627 29 The nitrogen of biophore 9 can contribute to activity possibly by interacting with the negatively charged residues or by forming hydrogen bonds e g Asparagine 598 29 Figure 3A shows the generic structure of an NMDA antagonist that carries biophores 8 and 9 and B the relative locations of biophores 8 9 and 10 in the eliprodil molecular family Biophores 8 9 and 10 also occur in the NMDA antagonists that bind to glutamate binding site of NMDA receptor e g 8 in SDZ EAB 515 9 in SDZ EAA 494 10 in SDZ 220 581 21 37 Thus the NMDA biophores that were identified actually characterize two groups of NMDA antagonists channel blockers and glutamate site antagonists Dopamine agonists The same strategy was used to create the Dopamine agonists database as was used for the NMDA database Compounds with substantial affinity for dopamine receptors K i within nanomolar range were collected The best biophores were selected using the same criteria as those used to assess the NMDA and the MAO databases Table 3 11 16 Biophore 12 identifies the ortho hydroxyl groups of the catechol ring which is one of the structural features of dopamine and its derivatives Biophore 11 describes agonists that possess only one hydroxyl in meta position preclamol RU 24213 RU 24926 etc This biophore demonstrates the relative importance of the meta hydroxyl group as compared to the para hydroxyl group For example meta tyramine s binding affinity to the dopamine receptor is significantly greater than that of para tyramine 30 Biophores 14 and 15 characterize DA agonists without hydroxyl groups in the aromatic ring Putatively the aromatic nitrogen of this biophore carries the function of the meta hydroxyl group since it has the same structural location relatively to the phenylethylamine backbone Most of the compounds that contain biophore 13 9 out of 12 active compounds also carry a hydroxyl group Table 3 The majority of compounds that contain biophore 16 also have at least one hydroxyl in one of the three possible branching positions Table 3 Metabolites of such compounds might be more active than the parent compound Thus aromatic hydroxylation of such compounds at the ortho position would form a catechol ring Table 3 12 and produce metabolites that are structural analogues to dopamine Both biophores 13 and 16 represent dopamine like agonists that have restricted conformation for the sake of enhanced binding Based on the biophores that were identified by the program a generic structure of the DA agonist was constructed Figure 4 The specifications for such structure include a nitrogen atom separated by two carbon atoms from an aromatic moiety and containing an electron donating substituent at the meta position The importance of this backbone finds support in a number of QSAR and CoMFA analyses as well 30 31 To ensure compatibility we compared biophores and biophobes fragments that are found to be responsible for molecular inactivity across all three databases and found no collisions On the contrary structural overlap between some biophores across the three databases was observed This was used as an additional encouragement to select them for inclusion in prospective new drugs Discussion The modeling procedure requires the construction of precursor candidates precursor here is a molecule designed to have a single mechanism of antiparkinsonian action on the basis of selected and compatible biophores of each database Precursor candidates for NMDA antagonism MAO B inhibition and DA agonism were drawn to be within the context of the types of molecules they are derived from The precursor structures that were generated were then merged into candidate drug molecules Two types of precursors of active MAO B inhibitors were identified The structure of the first one is shown in Figure 1 1Aand 1B as a generic moiety The second one is based on a class of compounds that contain biophore 3 whose structure is shown in Table 3 Biophore 3 The latter precursor has the advantage of small size and its activity is quite tolerant to derivatization at the para position 22 whereas the former is known to have high oral bioavailability and low toxic effects in rats 9 A possible way of derivatization of the compound in Figure 1 X O Z CN R H is substitution at the terminal aromatic ring Analysis of the original work 9 shows that such substitution decreases binding affinity However the decrease in activity is acceptable for methyl and methoxyl substitutions in meta and para positions Thus the IC 50 of the unsubstituted compound is 2 2 nM whereas the meta methylated analog has an IC 50 of 8 nM the value for the para methylated is 15 nM that of the para methoxylated is 27 nM and the IC 50 of the meta methoxylated derivative is 29 nM 9 There are many possible choices for the selection of a suitable structure for an NMDA antagonist One possibilitys to use the backbone presented in Figure 3A another one is to use the generic structure of the glutamate site NMDA antagonists Figure 2B The latter group contains fewer biophores but there are some insights of its mechanism of action and a structural analysis has been made for it 21 Hence glutamate site NMDA antagonists Figure 2B were favored as a structural prototype since some NMDA antagonists from the former group Figure 3A express antagonistic activity toward dopamine receptors e g haloperidol Glutamate site NMDA antagonists can be readily derivitized Thus the aryl ring Figure 2B can carry quite a large variety of substituents that enhance binding if they are hydrophobic 21 Since many good biophores were identified in the DA database we designed two different DA precursors Figure 5 instead of one This was accomplished by combining a few biophores into a single molecule Each of these precursors has structurally close known homologues that are potent D2 type dopamine agonists When merged together in different ways the prototype structures yielded a group of candidates These compounds were tested in silico against all compiled databases DA MAO and NMDA Candidates with the best predictions were submitted for further evaluation of their pharmacokinetic parameters Thus they were tested against databases predicting plasma protein binding affinity 32 oral bioavailability and urine excretion unpublished results The metabolism of each candidate was then evaluated by the META program 33 using a mammal metabolism database LogP values logarithm of the n octanol water partition coefficient were calculated by the MCASE program on the base of a group contribution approach 34 Possible side effects of the drug candidates were assessed by testing each candidate and its predicted metabolites against carcinogenicity and mutagenicity databases 35 36 Evaluating candidate molecules by the predicted pharmacokinetic parameters Table 4 we favored those with higher oral bioavailability scores and lower urine excretion scores For optimal sustained action we chose a plasma protein binding range of 50 to 90 percent The four finalists shown on Figures 6and 7received the best overall prediction Compounds III with X O Y H and OH in position 1 and compound II with X S and Y H were selected as the most promising candidates since their predicted oral bioavailability was among the highest while the potential harmful side effects were predicted to be low Table 4 Nevertheless the entire group of compounds is proposed for synthesis and evaluation of their potential antiparkinsonian activity Structural variation changing X Y and the position of the hydroxyl group can be used for membrane permeability adjustment enhancement of oral bioavailability and improvement of Blood Brain Barrier penetration
