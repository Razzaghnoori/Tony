 The End of Revolution Dear Dad Well that message would have been the right place to stop After Karl Marx and the Revelation of Saint John anything else is going to be a bit of an anticlimax But I ll take a stab at it anyway and finish in the spirit of the family and maybe even the Breakfast Table not with a last word but with a last question Are we at the End of Eschatology Let me explain what I mean At the beginning of the decade Fukuyama put forward his famous thesis about how we were at the End of History only to see History seem to resume with a vengeance as you put it the other day But he was obviously onto something I would call it the end of revolution It was only a little over 200 years ago that the modern idea of revolution developed that is the idea that society and perhaps even human nature could be rapidly altered and improved through concerted political action It has its origin as much as anywhere in Rousseau The passing from the state of nature to the civil society he wrote produces a remarkable change in man it puts justice as a rule of conduct in the place of instinct and gives his actions the moral quality they previously lacked Here in these remarkable words is the seed of modern radical politics the promise that brute human nature and selfish instinct can be overcome given the proper political system The French Revolutionaries believed in it and talked of the new man nu So did the Russian Revolutionaries This promise that people can be suddenly and purposefully redeemed and lifted above their sinful natures is a profoundly Christian one And it is no accident that the idea of revolution arose at a moment when the terrible fires of religious conflict had burnt out in Europe and European thinkers had largely concluded that forcibly imposing possible Christian salvation on doctrinal enemies was not worth the enormous cost in blood and toil that two centuries of religious warfare had taken the Thirty Years War alone reduced the population of Germany by as much as 25 percent It was called an age of anti enthusiasm i e religious enthusiasm But in this vacuum a new form of enthusiasm quickly emerged along with a new quasi Christian eschatology in the idea of revolution There would still be a New Jerusalem although a purely terrestrial one There would still be Final Things and a direction to history But now after two centuries that have seen far greater suffering than the religious wars ever caused in the pursuit of this new New Jerusalem what is Wallenstein next to Stalin revolution too is at an end The central and eastern European reformers of 1989 were very careful not to label what they were doing a revolution Revolutions don t work wrote the Pole Jacek Kuron in the French newspaper Liberation pointedly on the 200 th anniversary of the French Revolution of 1789 Today hardly anyone outside of Havana and Pyongyang talks about using politics to change human nature or even suddenly and drastically to improve society In that sense we are all conservatives now and in another age of anti enthusiasm But will new enthusiasms arise once again and if so from where Will there be new promises of liberation human fulfillment and Final Things Or are we therefore at the End of Eschatology Love David
