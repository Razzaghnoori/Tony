 Background Brn3c is a POU domain factor that is crucial for inner ear hair cell development Targeted null Brn3c mutants have no mature hair cells 1 2 Close examination has revealed that some immature hair cells form in Brn3c null mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa calretinin and parvalbumin 3 Furthermore these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants undergo apoptosis in neonates 3 Consistent with an apparent absence of mature hair cells initial work suggested that all vestibular and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by postnatal day 14 P14 1 However more detailed quantification by others 3 reported that at P4 about 77 of vestibular neurons and only 29 of spiral neurons are lost It was suggested that there is possibly a complete loss in adults 3 Other than these preliminary statements no data exists concerning the detailed pattern of loss of innervation in Brn3c null mutants The initial development and partial differentiation of hair cells in Brn3c mutants could possibly lead to some neurotrophin expression in these cells to sustain sensory neurons through embryonic development and beyond Data on various single and compound neurotrophin null mutants have shown that the loss of a specific neurotrophin leads to topologically restricted loss of sensory neurons in the embryonic ear 4 5 Such selective loss in Brn3c null mutants would therefore indicate reduction of a specific neurotrophin in immature hair cells Moreover recent work shows that in embryos NT 3 is primarily expressed in supporting cells moving only around birth into hair cells 6 7 In fact the selective loss of vestibular as compared to cochlear sensory neurons 77 versus 29 3 suggests that NT 3 expression may be less downregulated in Brn3c null mutants than BDNF 6 8 9 provided that at least some differentiation of supporting cells takes place In the ear 4 as well as elsewhere 10 neurotrophins are progressively downregulated in postnatal mammals and possibly replaced by other factors 11 We have investigated in detail the pattern of innervation in the Brn3c mutants as well as the expression of NT 3 and BDNF We want to evaluate a possible correlation between the topology of sensory neuron loss and absence of a specific neurotrophin or topological loss of hair cells at birth and in older animals This information could be important for an in depth evaluation of the human deafness related to the Pou4f3 gene DFNA15 12 We report here long term retention of cochlear sensory neurons for at least 6 months in particular in the cochlear apex in Brn3c null mutant mice This retention of afferents and efferents is unrelated to hair cell differentiation as not even immature hair cells can be detected at early postnatal stages with MyoVII immunocytochemistry in this part of the cochlea This retention of apical spiral neurons is also largely unrelated to neurotrophins which are known to be reduced in their expression in neonatal rodents 4 Results Brn3c null mutants at birth P0 Vestibular ganglia are smaller in Brn3c null mutants Fig 1b than in control littermates Fig 1a but larger than in BDNF or trkB null mutants of the same age 13 15 The reduction in apparent size of the vestibular ganglia is in agreement with quantitative data published previously 3 13 These data suggest a loss of 80 85 of vestibular sensory neurons in BDNF and trkB null mutants 13 and of 77 of vestibular sensory neurons in P4 Brn3c null mutants 3 Thus the size reduction in the vestibular sensory ganglion could be compatible with a loss of BDNF production in the immature hair cells However the Brn3c null mutants show only a reduced density of afferent and efferent fibers to all vestibular sensory epithelia There is no specific loss of all afferent and efferent innervation to the canal crista Fig 2a a hallmark of both BDNF and trkB null mutations 13 15 In fact the reduction of fibers seems to be rather uniform throughout a given sensory epithelium with the crista innervation being qualitatively no more reduced than the innervation of the utricle and saccule No loss in specific areas comparable to that in BDNF null mutant mice is apparent in the saccule or utricle of Brn3c null mice Similar patterns of innervation are obtained using acteylated tubulin immunocytochemistry Fig 2b Consistent with the finding of Xiang et al 3 of only a 29 loss of spiral sensory neurons at P4 our data show little difference in the pattern of innervation of the cochlea in P0 Brn3c null mutants Fig 2c 2d No selective loss of spiral neurons is observed in Brn3c null mutants in the basal turn a feature of either NT 3 or trkC loss 6 9 14 Likewise the innervation of the apex Fig 2f shows no detectable abnormality in overall pattern of innervation compared to control animals data not shown an indication that BDNF could be expressed in the apex 6 In addition the pattern of efferent innervation shows no deviation from normal either Fig 2e whereas they show the same pattern of loss as afferent fibers in neurotrophin null mutants 16 These data suggest that the spiral sensory neurons develop qualitatively normal at least until P0 and therefore allow normal pathfinding of efferents Most interestingly there is no increase in radial fiber spacing in the apex a specific problem of BDNF null mutants 6 13 However there is one qualitative difference not recognized in any single neurotrophin null mutant Afferents reach all three rows of outer hair cells in the basal turn of control wildtype littermates Fig 2c but both afferent and efferent outgrowth is disorganized to outer hair cells in Brn3c null mutants Fig 2d and does not show any clear organization into three distinct longitudinal fiber bundles paralleling the three rows in the outer hair cell region These data suggest that fiber organization in the outer hair cell region is partly disrupted in Brn3c null mutant Brn3c null mutants at P7 8 Reduction of vestibular innervation is more pronounced than at P0 Loss of afferents and even more clearly of efferents is most pronounced in the utricle Fig 3a 3b and saccule data not shown In contrast the innervation to the canal cristae while reduced has changed little from P0 In particular the horizontal canal receives a rather dense afferent and efferent innervation in Brn3c null mutants The cochlea at P8 shows more qualitative deviations from the normal pattern of innervation For example all three rows of outer hair cells now receive both afferent and efferent innervation in the base of control littermates Fig 3c However no fibers extend to the outer hair cell region in Brn3c null mutants Figs 3d 3e 3f In control animals there is dense innervation of inner hair cells whereas Brn3c null mutants show a curious aggregation of fibers near focal spots around the habenula perforata The apex shows less pronounced deviations from normal Fig 3f 3g However as in the base afferents and efferents extend sparingly to the outer hair cell region There is formation of an inner spiral bundle communicating both afferents and efferents between the focal points where fibers appear to pass through the habenula perforata Fig 3f 3g As in newborn animals efferent fibers closely follow the pattern of innervation displayed by afferents data not shown The limited qualitative effect of Brn3c null mutations on fiber loss is particularly obvious in the P8 Brn3c null mutant apical turn Fig 3g Immunocytochemical and histochemcial data show the presence of only a few immature hair cells in the cochlea Fig 4 which amounted to about 1 Table 1 Not a single immature hair cell forms in the apex of the cochlea In contrast more immature hair cells are found in the appropriate position of hair cells in the vestibular endorgans Table 1 In fact the vestibular end organs show no overt morphological defect other than the reduced presence of these immature hair cells Nerve fibers can be traced into the sensory epithelium of P0 and P8 Brn3c null mutants past the habenula perforata and there is a normal location of spiral sensory neurons in Rosenthal s canal in the apex of P8 Brn3c null mutants Fig 3d 3g The cochlea shows other defects as well For example the spiral capillary is not found underneath the organ of Corti but in the spiral limbus nearby Fig 4 The lack of immature hair cells seems to affect also the formation of pillar cells undifferentiated almost throughout the cochlea Fig 4 and Deiters cells not recognizable based on their morphology a suggestion consistent with recent molecular data on the interaction of hair cells and supporting cells 17 18 Comparison of numbers of immature hair cells in the vestibular and cochlear areas Fig 4 with the numbers of surviving vestibular and cochlear sensory neurons does not show any correlation Table 1 Fig 5 Only a few undifferentiated hair cells were detected by MyoVIIa immunostaining and only in the basal region of the cochlea And yet only about 50 of cochlear sensory neurons are lost overall with a less severe loss in the apex in which we could not detect any immature hair cells with MyoVIIa immunocytochemistry This does not exclude the possibility that even less differentiated hair cells may form in the apex The central projection of DiI and DiA traces fibers to the cochlear nuclei Fig 6 where they show a clear segregation of apical turn afferents Fig 6 green and basal turn afferents Fig 6 red in both the entering cochlear nerve Fig 6a and the ventral cochlear nucleus VCN Fig 6b Qualitative comparable central projections are found in wildtype control littermates data not shown and suggest that the central projection to cochlear nuclei is at least until P8 in mice not critically dependent on auditory information or other hair cell mediated influences in agreement with recent suggestions 5 19 6 months Brn3c null mutants Very few fibers both afferent and efferent to the vestibular epithelia remain Fig 7a thus displaying a further reduction of the pattern of innervation found in P8 Brn3c null mutants Notably there are still a number of fibers extending from the very few vestibular sensory neurons to the canal epithelia in particular the horizontal canal Fig 7a 7b Only very few fibers extend to the utricle and saccule with the reduction of efferents to these epithelia being almost complete Fig 7aand data not shown Comparable to control mice there is some transcellular labeling with DiI to cells apparently contacted by the afferent fibers in the Brn3c null mutant utricle Fig 7b However these cells could not be clearly identified as immature hair cells based on their morphology The cochlea most prominently the apex receives many afferent fibers which form an interrupted inner spiral bundle Fig 7c Some of the radial fiber bundles are myelinated Fig 7d Only an occasional fiber extends beyond the inner spiral bundle into the area of the outer hair cells Fig 7d Even at this late stage in maturation there are still numerous spiral neurons present in the apex Fig 7c 7d In summary these tracing data suggest that mature hair cells are not necessary to direct fiber outgrowth and to maintain some fibers at least up to 6 months in the apex of the cochlea Importantly the spatio temporal loss of innervation does not follow the pattern of loss known from neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor null mutations as it starts in Brn3c mutant mice after birth In situhybridization confirms neonatal neurotrophin expression We processed four ears of P0 and P8 Brn3c null and control littermates for expression of BDNF and NT 3 using the riboprobes previously described 7 We did not analyze neurotrophin expression in 6 month old animals as neurotrophins are downregulated in neonates 20 and no expression can be found even in normal animals 4 In the canal cristae we expected and found only a BDNF signal This signal was very strong over hair cells of the P0 control animals Fig 8b In contrast only a faint signal was detected in the Brn3c null mutant Fig 8a and the few silver grains were located predominantly over the area of the immature hair cells The BDNF signal in the utricle was clearly centered on the hair cells in the control animal but some aggregation of silver grains appeared also in the Brn3c null mutants data not shown In the saccule we directly compared the BDNF Fig 8c 8d and NT 3 signal Fig 8e 8f of the Brn3c null mutant Fig 8c 8e and control littermates Fig 8d 8f A strong BDNF signal was found over the hair cells of control animals and an occasional immature hair cell also showed a BDNF signal in the Brn3c null mutants The NT 3 signal was more diffuse in both the control and the Brn3c null littermates but showed some slightly above background signal in the area of the sensory epithelium even in the Brn3c null mutant In the cochlea the BDNF signal was very weak in the base in both the control Fig 9b and the Brn3c null littermates Fig 9a However there was a surprisingly strong NT 3 signal over the organ of Corti in the apex of Brn3c null littermates Fig 9c that closely matched the signal found in the control littermates Fig 9d The NT 3 signal in the area of the cochlea that corresponds to the IHC s persisted at least until P8 in the apex of Brn3c null mice Fig 9e 9f Discussion Immature hair cells and limited expression of neurotrophins rescue afferent projection until P8 The neurotrophins have long been implicated as the mediators for target mediated cell death In essence this theory of regulation of neuronal connections via neurotrophic support implies that only limited quantities of neurotrophins are released by the target tissue to support only properly connected sensory neurons by providing only these with a critical amount of neurotrophins 21 Past experiments which eliminated one or more neurotrophins entirely only partially tested the basic assumption of this theory in vivo For example in BDNF heterozygotic animals there is a small decrease in the number of sensory neurons in the ear 13 but no change in the overall pattern of innervation Moreover all of the neurotrophin neurotrophin receptor null mutants studied to date eliminate expression in both the peripheral target and the brain simultaneously and achieve their effects in late embryos In contrast Brn3c is barely expressed during embryogenesis in the CNS 22 thus arguing that the survival of ear primary neurons depends crucially on the periphery We suggest that limited expression of neurotrophins in the immature target leads to retention of primary neurons and their afferent fibers in newborn and early postnatal Brn3c null mice In agreement with this suggestion our in situ data show a severe reduction in expression of BDNF Figs 8 9 Despite this reduction some apparently biologically significant low levels of neurotrophins are apparently expressed in all sensory epithelia in embryonic Brn3c null mutants It appears that even these low levels of neurotrophins in the vestibular sensory epithelia can sustain normal fiber outgrowth and a limited maintenance until P0 The comparatively high level of NT 3 expression in Brn3c null mutant cochlea which has been shown to be the neurotrophin most prominently supporting spiral sensory neurons 6 9 14 is in agreement with the normal development of cochlear innervation in newborn Brn3c null mutants Since BDNF appears to be exclusively produced by hair cells 6 7 20 the lack of terminal differentiation of hair cells appears to be accompanied by only limited expression of BDNF as is the case in the canal cristae Fig 8 Past research has shown that in BDNF and trkB null mutants this innervation to canal cristae is lost before birth 6 13 That even these low levels of expression are significant is clear from the fact that all canal sensory epithelia receive an innervation by both afferents and efferents at birth and later Figs 2 3 The situation in the utricle saccule and cochlea is less clear as both BDNF and NT 3 are expressed 6 7 In fact it appears that the levels of NT 3 expression hardly differ from those in control littermates Figs 8 9 The latter is particularly obvious in the apex of the cochlea In fact in the cochlea of embryos and neonates as well as in the saccule and utricle of embryos NT 3 is predominantly expressed in supporting cells 6 This expression of NT 3 in supporting cells in embryos and neonates may even preserve in Brn3c null mutants the numerous spiral sensory neurons in the apex of 8 day old animals Figs 3 4 Long term survival of apical sensory neurons is unrelated to differentiated hair cells and likely is independent of neurotrophins Past work has shown that BDNF and NT 3 appear to shift in their expression into inner hair cells around birth or are lost in the ear and other parts of the nervous system 6 10 20 23 It has been suggested that other neurotrophins may come into play in the ear 11 However the apex of Brn3c null mutants which retains most of the spiral neuron afferents at 6 month shows no formation of mature hair cells at any time surveyed here P0 P8 P10 Thus the factor s cannot be released by differentiated hair cells but there is an unexplored possibility of generalized expression of neurotrophins at low levels in the undifferentiated epithelia However known neurotrophins are largely absent in the adult cochleae 4 and significant amounts of neurotrophin expression appear to develop only in postnatal animals in the CNS 24 Such expression in the CNS could possibly offset to some extent the peripheral loss of neutrophins in targeted null mutants This would work only in cases in which the loss of primary neurons would not already be completed long before birth as is the case in the ear 6 13 It therefore remains unclear what supports the many afferents in the apex of the Brn3c null mutants until 6 months of age or longer unknown peripheral neurotrophic substances or neurotrophic support provided by the CNS Comparable long term retention of apical spiral sensory neurons was described for the deaf white cat 25 and may also be the case in humans with congenital deafness Growth of fibers to the cochlea does not require mature hair cells Formation of radial fibers that bring peripheral processes of spiral neurons to the organ of Corti seems to be rather normal even in the apex of the cochlea which does not even develop immature hair cells recognizable by Myo VIIa This does not preclude that even less differentiated hair cell precursors may form in the apex or that those precursors have died before birth Interestingly the growth to outer hair cells is most affected in Brn3c null mutant cochleae Instead of extending radially through the tunnel of Corti to outer hair cells afferents appear to stall and extend in longitudinal directions as inner spiral bundles Figs 3 7 It has been shown that the differentiation of pillar cells depends on activation of Fgfr3 26 by FGF s probably Fgf8 a factor produced by developing and mature inner hair cells 18 27 The formation of supporting cells also appears to depend on the proper expression of various bHLH factors such as Hes 1 and 5 which appear to be regulated by the Notch signaling pathway 17 28 29 It is possible that the apparent inability of fibers to extend along outer hair cells is related to the lack of differentiation of supporting cells in the absence of mature hair cells Probing for the proper expression of supporting cell specific markers in Brn3c null mutants is necessary to further evaluate these suggestions Previous work has suggested that efferent fibers derived from facial branchial motoneurons follow afferents and for that reason reflect in detail all connectional deviations of afferents 16 30 31 32 Our data agree with this scenario but extend it Specifically efferent fibers may suffer the same loss of their molecularly unknown neurotrophic support as do afferents and therefore show the same spatio temporal profile of loss Fig 3 Alternatively efferent fibers can sustain established connections only as long as afferent fibers are present More information on the actual molecular support of efferent fibers in the ear is needed before those two possibilities can be distinguished The onset of cochleotopic projections has been investigated in detail in only very few mammals 19 These data suggest that a cochleotopic projection develops before onset of hearing Our data show that at least a cochleotopic projection in the cochlear nerve and the cochlear nuclei develops even in Brn 3c null mutants Fig 6 Those data are also consistent with the formation of a crude cochleotopic projection in NT 3 null mutants 6 14 Those mutants have a much more severely reduced density of innervation in the developing cochlea 6 14 than the reduction we found in Brn3c null mutants at P0 In this context it would be interesting to see whether the recently generated transgenic mouse in which BDNF is expressed under NT 3 promoter control 33 could actually perform an even more pronounced rescue in a Brn3c null mutant background Relevance of our findings to other mutations with hair cell loss Vahava et al 12 and Frydman et al 34 have demonstrated that mutation in a single human allele of Pou4f3 Brn3c results in a late onset of high frequency hearing loss Thus far no data are available that correlate the late onset of hearing loss with morphological defects in the cochlea In fact an investigation of Brn3c heterozygotic mice showed no additional effect on hearing loss due to haploinsufficiency in these mice 35 Our data on Brn3c null mouse mutants nevertheless suggest that the high to low frequency progressive hearing loss in humans may correlate with the unknown factor s that mediate apical spiral neuron survival into adulthood Quantitative data on human Pou4f3 cochleae is needed to verify that spiral neuron loss is more pronounced in the basal high frequency area of these hearing deficient patients Similar data are also needed for other congenitally deaf children 36 and in the deaf white cat 25 Further work on the recently available mutant mice with specific absence of all hair cells 37 outer hair cells in the base 38 or apex 39 could further help to clarify the role of hair cells in forming and maintaining afferent and efferent innervation in these model mice Conclusion The progressive loss of afferent and efferent innervation in Brn3c null mutants shows neither in spatial nor in temporal pattern a resemblance to losses reported in simple BDNF or NT 3 null mutations 6 Null mutants of ear specific neurotrophins have completed the loss of sensory neurons before birth In contrast our results suggest a slow loss of afferent and efferent innervation between P0 and at least 6 months This late sensory neuron loss is likely not related to known neurotrophin signaling which becomes reduced in neonatal wildtype animals Other factors such as GDNF 11 40 need to be investigated in their expression in these mutants and their functional role needs to be assessed in particular in the cochlear apex The long term retention of afferents in the cochlear apex in the absence of any apparent differentiation of hair cells raises hopes for cochlear implants in deaf born children Similar long term retention of apical afferents exists in the deaf white cat 25 and should be explored in other model systems with embryonic and neonatal hair cell loss 37 38 Methods Breeding and genotyping Brn3c mice were bred as previously described 22 Mice were genotyped and Brn3c null mutants were raised to a specific age P0 N 8 P7 N 6 P8 N 6 6 months old N 2 The animals were deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital and transcardially perfused with 4 paraformaldehyde in 0 1 M phosphate buffer pH 7 4 Ears were postfixed in the same fixative for at least one day prior to dissection Tracing of nerve fibers DiI tracing from the brainstem was performed as previously described 41 Small filter stripes soaked with saturated DiI were implanted into the efferent fiber bundle near the floor plate or into the ascending or descending afferents in the alar plate 42 After appropriate diffusion time of the dye the ears were dissected and mounted flat for visualization in an epifluorescent microscope Images were taken on black and white film or acquired with a cooled CCD camera and processed using ImagePro software Media Cybernetics Ears were subsequently reacted for acetylated tubulin to reveal the pattern of innervation in addition to the DiI tracing with a different technique as previously described 14 Briefly dissected ears were incubated with 1 500 anti acetylated tubulin antibodies Sigma St Louis followed by secondary antibodies conjugated to HRP Dissected inner ears were reacted with DAB and H 2 O 2 for HRP distribution and subsequently viewed as whole mounts After photographing as whole mounts the ears were embedded in epoxy resin and sectioned to reveal the distribution of fibers inside the sensory epithelia in more detail Cochleotopic projection was evaluated by inserting DiI soaked filter strips into the base and DiA soaked filter strips into the apical turn of 2 P0 and 4 P8 Brn3c null mutants and a similar number of wildtype littermates After appropriate diffusion time 43 the brains with the attached cochlear nerve were embedded in gelatin hardened in 4 PFA over night sectioned coronally on a vibratome 100 m thickness and viewed with a Biorad Radiance 2000 confocal system attached to a Nikon Eclipse 800 microscope Image stacks were collapsed to view the entire projection in one section in one focal plane In situhybridization Four ears each of Brn3c null mutants P0 and P8 and control littermates were embedded in paraffin sectioned and probed for the presence of BDNF and NT 3 mRNA using the in situ technique previously described 7 Sections were lightly counterstained and viewed with bright and dark field microscopy Images were acquired with a CCD camera and displayed as false color images as previously described 18 Immunocytochemistry of hair cells and quantification of hair cells and neurons Immunostaining of P7 cochlear whole mounts using the hair cell specific myosin VII MyoVIIa antibody was performed as previously described 2 Images of labeled organs of Corti were then acquired using a SPOT digital camera Diagnostic Instruments Inc and the number of hair cells was scored from acquired images To determine the number of hair cells or neurons in vestibular endorgans or sensory ganglia serial sections were stained with Cresyl Violet and images were similarly acquired and scored Every other section was scored for each sensory epithelium and every forth section was scored for each ganglion Only neurons or cells with a clear nucleus and nucleoli were counted and 4 6 samples were counted for each epithelium and ganglion All
