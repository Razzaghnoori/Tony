 A Penny for Your Thoughts Transactions involving money say the purchase of something at a store cost money The cashier must be paid the cash register bought the bookkeeper hired etc Honest mistakes and dishonesty also take a toll These expenses can be expressed as a cost per transaction The higher that cost the larger the transaction has to be in order for it to make financial sense Computers are very good at counting money and keeping records so they have been used for decades to manage transactions Today when your credit card is run through the little machine at the checkout counter computers handle the entire transaction Nobody is going to look at that little slip you sign unless a problem develops What is the cost of a transaction done purely by computer A recent estimate put the cost at less than one millionth of one cent per transaction i e 100 000 000 transactions can be done for 1 Digital cash where the value is stored on the card you carry and there s no need to check your credit against a faraway database may be even cheaper Regardless of how it s done transaction costs will continue to plummet as computers get more powerful Low transaction costs are a wonderful thing if you re in the transaction business They re wonderful for consumers too making it cheaper and easier to buy things and creating new things to buy All this is especially true now that the Internet provides a direct connection between sellers and millions of consumers In a normal situation you could end there But this isn t a normal situation This is the Internet where any legitimate idea is immediately taken to ridiculous limits That s because there are plenty of would be Internet visionaries competing to outdo each other both in philosophizing and in trying to sell shares in their start up companies to the public The magic words on the Internet if inserted into nearly any sentence seem to protect it from normal critical scrutiny So it is with cheap transactions which tend to go by the sexier name of micropayment systems Press reports about micropayment schemes extol their virtues in breathless wonder Micropayments it is said will revolutionize the economics of journalism on the Net a topic I ve opined on before People will pay some small fee like 10 cents to read an article rather than buy a whole magazine for 2 95 Or what the hell they can pay by the paragraph sentence word or why not push it to the extreme the bit Wouldn t that be wonderful No actually it wouldn t Micropayments might be important in some limited areas but most of the hoopla is very poorly thought out To see why consider Slate which recently decided to remain free to users for now But imagine that several years hence Slate is trying to decide among micropayments subscriptions and remaining free Let s consider what effect these choices will have on a couple of typical users or readers as they used to be called tellingly the computer industry shares with the drug industry the habit of referring to its customers as users Joe Avid is what we in the computer industry would call a heavy user Joe reads every bit of every issue of Slate Jeff Accidental rarely reads Slate on purpose but every now and then he follows a link from another site into Slate Somewhere in the middle is Tom Average who reads Slate just as much as the average user does What price should we set for the micropayment If we set the price so that it will yield the same total revenue as a subscription then Tom Average will pay the same amount either way Jeff Accidental will save a bundle by buying occasional articles instead of having to buy a subscription But it s tough luck for Joe Avid He and everybody else who reads more of Slate than its average reader will pay more than a normal subscription would cost In customer service circles this is known as screwing your best customer That s OK in the sex industry but not so great in others because it tends to alienate the loyal supporters who form the core of the business It is though standard practice in the print magazine industry which gives new subscribers a bargain rate and rewards steady renewal by raising the price The problem for Slate and other Internet sites comes from having to charge for usage when what they re selling is intellectual property with a flat production cost Slate doesn t get used up by being used It costs virtually the same amount to produce no matter how many people use it and no matter how heavy the use The Random House Unabridged Dictionary is priced at 100 and has 315 000 entries Of these I have looked up maybe 20 of them since I bought a copy a couple of years ago If I could pay based on usage Random House would have to charge me 5 for each word I looked up to bring in the same revenue Hardly a micropayment Five bucks per look up would bankrupt frequent users Scrabble players or copy editors for example But I didn t really pay 100 to use 20 entries It s much more accurate to say that I paid for the option to use any of the 315 000 entries that I might need Similarly I subscribe to magazines to get an option just in case I want to read any of the articles The editors for their part arrange to have them all written just in case I do You could argue that Joe Avid is so hooked on Slate that we can afford to put him over a barrel at the micropayment rate even though it means that he will pay a lot more Similarly when dictionaries are all online Random House could hold up the world s Scrabble players and copy editors Unless that is there is competition that offers an exotic billing option known as the subscription or flat price deal It won t take a genius competitor to come up with this plan Charging a usage based fee for content sounds fair but it is artificial because your costs are fixed A flat rate competitor would present an attractive proposition to Joe Avid and anybody else with heavier than average usage So what about a hybrid plan subscriptions for heavy users and micropayments for the rest This is another way to say drop prices because heavier than average users will buy a subscription while lighter than average users will choose the a la carte plan Dropping prices can sometimes make sense especially when as here you can drop them for only your least eager customers The airlines are specialists in maximizing revenue and filling seats by charging different amounts to different people But this raises another question If lowering the price gets you more customers why not lower it all the way to zero and get the greatest number That is why not rely on advertising Advertising is in effect a funny kind of micropayment system Advertisers pay on the basis of how many people see their ad For most media this is measured statistically via surveys because statistical estimates are an even cheaper way to record tiny transactions They re not exact but the overestimates and underestimates average out over time Besides if the transactions are really small who cares if you miss a few Ad rates amount to a few cents per customer impression which is in the same range as micropayments And of course the customer ends up paying indirectly But it feels different to users If imposing micropayments or other explicit user fees loses you many users you ll decide to stay free and collect your micropayments through ads Micropayments are great if you use them for a product or service with certain properties It must be one where you can get away with usage based pricing and where there is a strong rationale for making it cheap yet not free Put another way micropayments make sense only when they match the fundamental economics of the product or service better than other ways of charging Products that get used up as they are used naturally have this property If the basic economics are usage based then the payment can be too This class does not include journalism or indeed most intellectual property Yet this is where micropayments are most often suggested That isn t quite the end of the story One situation where micropayments will work is where there are no heavy users or repeat customers or where you don t mind screwing your best customers Films are a good example The movie industry always starts a film with a high usage based pricing model 7 50 or so per ticket This price is high enough to discourage many people from seeing the film That doesn t matter because after a run in the theaters the film will be released to home video rental and pay per view where it costs 3 to 5 and nobody counts how many people are in the room There it picks up a few repeat customers but mostly new ones The price is brought lower on premium cable like HBO which is a flat rate cost to the user and it eventually hits zero when the movie appears on broadcast television where ads support it Technically speaking this is a repeated auction We re more familiar with what economists call an English auction prices start low and rise as people bid However there is also the Dutch auction where prices start high and go lower until somebody bites Movies are sold to the audience via a very slow Dutch auction where each phase between price drops can last weeks or months Book publishers do the same thing with two stages hardcover and paperback Movies get away with this because they don t generally have heavy users or repeat customers Most people see a film once or at least don t see it again for many months Some films inspire hard core fanatics who see them repeatedly but these viewers are so few in number that movie theaters do not cut them a special deal The real savior is the repeated Dutch auction which lets theaters be cavalier about pricing the movie beyond the reach of a large set of customers because they ll get another crack at them later Most Internet content does not have these special properties Sites need regular repeat visitors Their costs for the most part are not usage based So micropayments will play a very small role in selling Internet content Most sites probably will wind up being free supported by ads User fees will also exist but for any content conducive to repeat use they will be based on a flat rate either a subscription to a site or a membership that lets you get to a set of sites A penny won t buy much even on the Web
