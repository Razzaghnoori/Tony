                            The prevalence of asthma and allergy has risen in all industrialized countries during        recent decades and there is much debate about exposure to pets in early life and later        development of asthma and allergy Some studies have suggested that keeping pets actually        protects against later allergyie that early exposure may somehow modify an individuals        immune system to tolerate specific antigens What might be the mechanism for such        protection against allergy One theory of how allergies arise is that an imbalance in T        helper cell subtypes tips the bodys immune response towards overreacting to a particular        antigen There is some evidence that early exposure to high natural levels of cat allergens        can prevent such an inappropriate immune response Other researchers have suggested that        normally immune responses are kept under control by another group of T cellsregulatory T        cells The two mechanisms may be linked since exposure to high levels of cat allergens may        induce regulatory T cells        Various attempts to modify aberrant immune responses to specific allergens such as        those to cat dander have been made Investigators have treated patients with related        molecules either peptides derived from the allergen itself or much smaller peptides        produced synthetically Although therapy with peptides seems to reduce allergic responses        the mechanism of the response to treatment has not been clear in particular exactly which        cells cell surface markers and cytokines are involved in modifying the immune        response        In a paper in this months         PLoS Medicine  Mark Larch and colleagues have attempted to dissect out        this pathway in a group of individuals with asthma and allergy to cats They treated the        individuals with short synthetic peptides derived from the sequence of the major cat        allergen         Felis domesticus allergen  and then measured the clinical and        immunological response to allergen They found that treatment with the peptides led to the        induction of a population of T cells that were capable of suppressing the proliferation of        allergenreactive T cells in vitro Peptide treatment also resulted in increased levels of        a molecule called CD on the surface of blood T cellsCD has recently been associated with        suppressing T cell sensitivity to stimulation Finally the authors found that the degree        of suppression was not related to the amount of peptide given to the patients        Where does this finding leave patients who might wonder about exposure to cats and the        development of allergy The simple answer is that we do not know exactly how exposure to        antigen triggers either an immune reaction or tolerance Once triggered an immune reaction        to a cat may be hardthough not impossibleto reverse but how or why a specific individual        becomes sensitized is as yet far from clear
