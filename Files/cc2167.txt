 Introduction Activated protein C an endogenous plasma serine protease with antithrombotic profibrinolytic and anti inflammatory properties 1 2 3 is an important modulator of the host systemic response to severe infection 1 Recently recombinant human activated protein C drotrecogin alfa activated was approved for the treatment of adult patients with severe sepsis Regulatory approvals were based on the results of a single pivotal phase 3 study which demonstrated a statistically significantly reduction in 28 day all cause mortality absolute risk reduction compared with placebo 6 1 relative risk reduction 19 4 P 0 005 4 with supporting data from a single phase 2 study 5 Consistent with its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated as compared with placebo was associated with an increase in the percentage of patients experiencing a serious bleeding complication 3 5 versus 2 0 P 0 06 over 28 days in the phase 3 study 4 Bleeding complications were the most important serious adverse events associated with the administration of drotrecogin alfa activated 4 A total of 1821 adult patients with severe sepsis were enrolled in the randomized placebo controlled trials supporting the approval of drotrecogin alfa activated 940 patients received active treatment and 881 patients received placebo Since completion of those controlled trials further studies have been completed n 2 or are ongoing n 3 in which an additional 1846 patients have received drotrecogin alfa activated Furthermore up to 12 April 2002 3991 patients have received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use following approval in the USA The purpose of this report is to provide a comprehensive review of the safety of drotrecogin alfa activated for all adult patients with severe sepsis enrolled in clinical trials completed and ongoing since the start of phase 2 clinical development and up to 12 April 2002 Trials were grouped into three categories controlled trials open label trials and compassionate use studies In addition safety data are presented for patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated from spontaneous reports in commercial use Patients and method Patient populations Table 1lists the seven clinical studies that enrolled adult patients with severe sepsis and that were completed or ongoing as of 12 April 2002 Studies were classified as controlled if they included a blinded placebo comparison with drotrecogin alfa activated Xigris Eli Lilly and Company Indianapolis IN USA open label if drotrecogin alfa activated was administered in a single arm study conducted at prospectively identified and trained investigative sites or compassionate use if drotrecogin alfa activated was provided on emergent request to noninvestigator clinicians treating patients with severe sepsis All studies except F1K MC EVAS utilized inclusion and exclusion criteria similar to those in the phase 3 Study F1K MC EVAD Recombinant Human Activated Protein C Worldwide Evaluation in Severe Sepsis PROWESS 4 Severe sepsis was defined in all protocols as the presence of known or suspected infection the presence of a systemic response to infection as evidenced by alterations in temperature heart rate respiratory rate and white blood cell count and the presence of one or more associated acute organ dysfunctions cardiovascular respiratory renal hematologic or metabolic acidemia Patients excluded from participation included those at high risk for bleeding those with severe thrombocytopenia platelet count 30 000 mm 3 those taking a variety of antiplatelet agents and those receiving systemic heparin anticoagulation Study F1K MC EVAS required only the clinical diagnosis of purpura fulminans and did not have the presence of thrombocytopenia as an exclusion criterion Based on the approved recommendations for the USA patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use would have been expected to have severe sepsis and have been at high risk for death e g as assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II 6 The number of patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use was estimated from the total number of courses of therapy sold in the USA using hospital based stores information from 21 November 2001 until 12 April 2002 Drug administration Table 1lists details of drug dose and durations of infusion for each clinical trial Patients randomly assigned to placebo in the controlled clinical trials received either saline or 0 1 albumin in saline Based on the approved recommendations for the USA 6 patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use would have been expected to receive an infusion rate of 24 g kg per hour for a total duration of 96 hours Specific details regarding actual dose and duration of administration were not available for patients treated in commercial use Estimates of 28 day mortality rate Mortality rates for completed clinical trials were obtained from validated clinical trial databases Estimates of 28 day all cause mortality rates for ongoing clinical studies were obtained from separate trial specific databases created using trial specific tracking tools Twenty eight day all cause mortality i e 28 days after the start of infusion was assessed for all studies except study F1K MC EVBC in which 7 day mortality was assessed for a subset of patients non US For this subset the number of additional deaths occurring between days 7 and 28 was estimated using the following method Of the 240 adults in study F1K MC EVBC 28 day follow up data were available for 168 patients 40 deaths and 7 day follow up data were available for 72 patients 12 deaths It was determined from the result of F1K MC EVAD PROWESS that the 28 day mortality rate in 7 day survivors receiving drotrecogin alfa activated was 15 2 Therefore for the subset of 7 day survivors in study F1K MC EVBC an additional nine deaths 15 2 of 60 were estimated to have occurred before study day 28 Thus total 28 day mortality in study F1K MC EVBC was estimated at 12 9 40 240 0 254 At present an estimate of the mortality rate for patients who have received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use is not available For the placebo controlled studies F1K MC EVAA and F1K MC EVAD PROWESS the cause of death was adjudicated by Lilly physicians in a blinded manner for all patients from death summaries provided by the investigators Serious bleeding event rate estimates Bleeding complications meeting the regulatory definition of a serious adverse event were extracted from a validated pharmacovigilance database which included events reported in clinical trials and in commercial use For all clinical trials in this report bleeding complications included but were not limited to any of the following any intracranial hemorrhage ICH any life threatening bleeding event requirement for 3 units or more of packed red blood cell transfusion per day for 2 consecutive days or meeting other criteria defining serious adverse events For patients experiencing ICH the following data were extracted from the serious adverse event report type of ICH most recent platelet count and presence of meningitis The causal relationship of drotrecogin alfa activated to serious bleeding events was assessed by comparison with placebo event rates for controlled trials For open label and compassionate use studies causal relationship was assessed using investigator assignment of causality related or not related and by comparing events that occurred during the infusion period with events that occurred postinfusion The study drug infusion period was defined as the actual duration of infusion plus 1 calendar day study days 1 5 The postinfusion period was defined as study days 6 28 All serious bleeding events were assessed as procedure related if associated with an invasive procedure or non procedure related Serious bleeding events were recorded for up to 28 days following the start of study drug administration for all but one study F1K MC EVBC In study F1K MC EVBC serious bleeding events were recorded for up to 28 days except for a subset of patients n 72 For this subset all serious bleeding events were recorded for 7 days following the start of infusion and study drug related serious bleeding events were recorded for up to 28 days Statistical analysis Because of the lack of final validated baseline data for ongoing clinical trials comparisons between clinical trial types were avoided Accordingly 95 confidence intervals CIs using exact methods are reported for event rate estimates Hypothesis testing was not performed as part of the present study All calculations were performed using SAS version 8 2 software SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA Results Twenty eight day all cause mortality The administration of drotrecogin alfa activated was associated with a mortality rate in controlled trials of 25 1 236 940 95 CI 22 4 28 0 in open label studies of 25 2 398 1578 95 CI 23 1 27 4 and in compassionate use studies of 26 1 70 268 95 CI 21 0 31 8 The mortality rate for all patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated in clinical trials was 25 3 704 2786 95 CI 23 7 26 9 The point estimate of the mortality rate with drotrecogin alfa activated for each trial category was less than the combined placebo mortality rate of 31 0 273 881 95 CI 28 0 34 2 An estimate of the mortality rate for the population of patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated in commercial use is not available In controlled clinical trials the leading causes of death were multiple organ failure refractory septic shock and respiratory failure Table 2 There were numerically fewer deaths from refractory septic shock and respiratory failure in drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients than in placebo treated patients There were fewer deaths from ICH and stroke combined in drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients than in placebo treated patients in controlled trials Table 2 Serious bleeding events The overall rate of serious bleeding events for all patients treated with drotrecogin alfa activated in all clinical trials combined was 5 3 148 2786 over the 28 day study period The serious bleeding event rate associated with drotrecogin alfa activated was similar across classes of trials controlled open label and compassionate use Table 3 The majority of serious bleeding events 58 79 that occurred during the infusion period in patients in all clinical trials 2 1 58 2786 were considered by the investigator to be related to drotrecogin alfa activated When assessed thrombocytopenia platelet counts 50 000 mm 3 was frequently present in drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients who experienced a serious bleeding event during the infusion period 22 53 patients for whom data were available Table 4 Twenty one serious bleeding events which occurred during the infusion period 0 8 of all patients 21 2786 were not considered to be related to drotrecogin alfa activated This incidence rate 0 8 was similar to the serious bleeding event rate observed during the infusion period for placebo treated patients in controlled studies 0 7 6 881 In F1K MC EVAD PROWESS the incidence of serious bleeding events during the postinfusion period was similar between drotrecogin alfa activated 12 850 and placebo patients 11 840 both approximately 1 For all drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients only a small minority of serious bleeding events that occurred during the postinfusion period 8 69 events 0 3 of all patients were considered to be related to drotrecogin alfa activated A relatively high proportion of all serious bleeding events was found to be related to invasive procedures as shown in Table 5 In the phase 3 trial study F1K MC EVAD PROWESS 53 3 16 30 of serious bleeding events in drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients and 23 5 4 17 in placebo treated patients were associated with invasive procedures during the 28 day study period These procedures typically involved the instrumentation of large blood vessels or highly vascular organs The incidence of non procedure related serious bleeding events i e spontaneous bleeding events was similar between active treatment and placebo groups in that trial In all patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in clinical trials serious bleeding events associated with invasive procedures accounted for 39 2 58 148 of the total number of events Table 5 The incidence of serious bleeding events was highest during the first day of therapy and decreased thereafter for all drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients Of serious bleeding events on day 1 of therapy 56 15 27 were procedure related On day 1 there were 12 patients with nonprocedure related serious bleeding events Platelet counts were not available for three of these 12 patients Of the remaining nine patients three had severe thrombocytopenia platelets 30 000 mm 3 and three had an elevated international normalized ratio greater than 2 0 In commercial use 3991 patients received treatment with drotrecogin alfa activated in the USA There have been 34 serious bleeding events spontaneously reported to the pharmacovigilance database for a rate of 0 9 34 3991 If one assumes that many of those patients had APACHE II scores greater than 25 then comparison with PROWESS F1K MC EVAD patients who had APACHE II scores greater than 25 is possible PROWESS F1K MC EVAD patients with APACHE II scores greater than or equal to 25 who received drotrecogin alfa activated and suffered serious bleeding events during the infusion period amounted to 9 414 2 2 and those with scores below 25 amounted to 9 436 2 1 In PROWESS F1K MC EVAD 75 634 850 of patients who received drotrecogin alfa activated and a similar percentage 76 637 840 of patients who received placebo were exposed to heparin during the infusion period PROWESS F1K MC EVAD patients who had serious bleeding events during the infusion period and were exposed to heparin amounted to 11 18 61 1 For comparison 14 49 28 6 of patients in open label trials and 3 10 30 0 patients in compassionate use trials who had serious bleeding events during the infusion period were exposed to heparin Serious bleeding events intracranial hemorrhage subset In controlled clinical trials two patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated 0 2 2 940 and one patient receiving placebo 0 1 1 881 experienced ICH all reported as parenchymal Both events in the drotrecogin alfa activated group occurred during the study drug infusion period and were associated with severe thrombocytopenia platelet count 30 000 mm 3 All three events were associated with a fatal outcome In open label studies 11 and 10 patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated experienced ICH during the infusion period 0 7 and postinfusion period 0 6 respectively Three and six patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in compassionate use studies experienced ICH during the infusion period 1 1 and postinfusion period 2 2 respectively For all patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated in clinical trials the ICH rate was 0 6 16 2786 during the study drug infusion period and 0 6 16 2786 during the postinfusion period The overall 28 day ICH event rate was 1 1 32 2786 Parenchymal hemorrhage n 14 was the most common site of ICH event during the infusion period Table 6 Nine ICH events that occurred during the infusion period were fatal of which seven were considered related to drotrecogin alfa activated Table 7 Five of these seven events which were considered to be related to drotrecogin alfa activated were associated with thrombocytopenia platelets 50 000 mm 3 range 17 000 49 000 mm 3 Meningitis was present in two of those five events and severe thrombocytopenia platelets 30 000 mm 3 was present in four of those five events Ten of the 16 events 62 5 had one or both potential risk factors Table 8 Eight fatal ICH events occurred during the postinfusion period of which only one was considered related to drotrecogin alfa activated The other seven fatal ICH events considered not related to drotrecogin alfa activated occurred between study days 8 and 28 well after the infusion period In commercial use 0 2 8 3991 patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated were reported to have experienced an ICH Non ICH serious bleeding events associated with fatal outcome In controlled clinical trials four drotrecogin alfa activated patients and one placebo patient experienced non ICH serious bleeding events associated with a fatal outcome based on adjudicated cause of death Fatal non ICH serious bleeding events that were reported as serious adverse events for drotrecogin alfa activated patients in all clinical trials combined are presented in Table 8 Three patients experienced non ICH serious bleeding events associated with a fatal outcome All three events occurred during the infusion period and all were considered related to drotrecogin alfa activated One of these involved thrombocytopenia platelets 19 000 mm 3 with severe coagulopathy partial thromboplastin time 150 s Discussion The observed mortality rates for patients receiving drotrecogin alfa activated were consistent across controlled open label and compassionate use trials ranging from 25 1 to 26 1 These results are similar to and supportive of the observed mortality rate of 24 7 associated with drotrecogin alfa activated use reported in the pivotal phase 3 trial F1K MC EVAD PROWESS 4 These mortality rates are lower than recent mortality rate estimates for severe sepsis which ranged between 30 and 50 7 and lower than the combined placebo rate from controlled clinical trials of 31 0 The consistency of treatment effects in drotrecogin alfa activated patients might have been expected given that for the most part inclusion and exclusion criteria were similar across trials The survival benefit associated with drotrecogin alfa activated appears to be related to a reduction in the number of deaths from refractory septic shock and respiratory failure These observations are consistent with the observed more rapid improvement in cardiovascular and respiratory function for drotrecogin alfa activated patients as compared with placebo patients in study F1K MC EVAD PROWESS 8 Consistent with its antithrombotic and profibrinolytic properties drotrecogin alfa activated increased the risk for serious bleeding The overall serious bleeding event rate 5 3 includes compassionate use trials in which investigators had limited experience using drotrecogin alfa activated The percentage of patients experiencing an event probably related to drotrecogin alfa activated appears to range between 2 1 and 2 8 as assessed by the investigator or by whether the event occurred during the infusion period respectively Approximately 2 0 of placebo patients enrolled in controlled trials experienced a serious bleeding event over the 28 day period Neither APACHE II score 25 or 25 nor concomitant heparin use appear to alter serious bleeding event rates associated with drotrecogin alfa activated substantially Underreporting of baseline heparin exposure in the open label and compassionate use trials is likely given that medication listings for the safety database were only collected on the day of the event Serious bleeding event rates for both active treatment and placebo patients enrolled in clinical trials of drotrecogin alfa activated probably underestimate the bleeding risk for all patients with severe sepsis In these trials patients at increased risk for bleeding e g some patients with multiple trauma or patients with severe thrombocytopenia i e platelet count 30 000 mm 3 were excluded from participation Clinical trials of treatment of severe sepsis with other novel therapeutics that have antithrombotic properties also excluded a similar patient population Estimates of serious bleeding complications in these latter trials ranged between 6 0 9 and 12 8 10 for placebo treated patients Exclusion criteria related to bleeding risk similar to those used in all of these trials should be employed in developing guidelines for the use of drotrecogin alfa activated Severe thrombocytopenia is included as a warning in the US Package Insert and as a contraindication in the European Summary of Product Characteristics In the former instance the recommendation is for physicians to weigh potential benefit of drotrecogin alfa activated against a potentially increased risk associated with its use In the European Summary of Product Characteristics the recommendation is that physicians not administer drotrecogin alfa activated to patients with platelet counts of 30 000 mm 3or less Indeed serious bleeding events in drotrecogin alfa activated patients appear to be associated with severe thrombocytopenia suggesting that this characteristic may be a risk factor for bleeding complications Therefore maintaining a platelet count above 30 000 mm 3and discontinuing the drotrecogin alfa activated infusion if the platelet count falls below this level are reasonable recommendations to guide its use A large percentage of bleeding events associated with drotrecogin alfa activated were also related to procedures performed either before or during the infusion period The types of procedures associated with bleeding complications were frequently those in which adequate control of bleeding vessels could not be obtained In controlled trials the percentage of patients experiencing non procedure related bleeding complications was similar between drotrecogin alfa activated and placebo patients Therefore limiting invasive procedures before and during infusion of drotrecogin alfa activated as well as minimizing risks associated with procedures e g instrumentation of blood vessels in which direct compression might be expected to control bleeding could improve the safety profile of the drug Additionally approved product labels recommend stopping the drotrecogin alfa activated infusion 2 hours before invasive procedures and waiting 12 hours after major surgical procedures to restart the infusion after ensuring adequate hemostasis 6 The infusion may be restarted immediately after uncomplicated less invasive procedures after ensuring adequate hemostasis These recommendations are based on the observation that the concentration of drotrecogin alfa activated in plasma is below the assay level of detection in a large majority of patients within 2 hours of discontinuing the infusion 11 The difference between ICH events occurring during the infusion period 0 6 or considered related to drug and the ICH event rate in all clinical trials combined 1 1 was similar to the background rate for ICH reported for patients with severe sepsis In a recent large sepsis trial of antithrombin III 0 4 of placebo treated patients experienced ICH during the study 10 Oppenheim Eden et al 12 also reported an ICH event rate of 0 4 for all intensive care unit patients who did not have an admitting diagnosis of stroke or stroke syndrome However all patients experiencing ICH had a diagnosis of severe sepsis and a platelet count of 30 000 mm 3or less suggesting that the event rate for the severe sepsis population overall may exceed 0 4 12 In a recently completed phase 2 trial of platelet activating factor ase an ICH event rate of 2 3 1 43 was reported in placebo treated sepsis patients Opal S personal communication Approximately 0 4 of drotrecogin alfa activated patients experienced a serious bleeding event associated with a fatal outcome that was considered related to its use during the infusion period These events were most frequently ICH events These data suggest that although use of drotrecogin alfa activated reduces sepsis induced mortality its anticoagulant effects may increase the risk for life threatening bleeding complications Patients that appear to be at risk for such a complication are those with severe coagulopathy i e low platelet counts high international normalized ratio Risk for sepsis related death in these patients may be greater than that in the overall population of severe sepsis patients with no coagulopathy In controlled trials although drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients experienced more hemorrhage related deaths there were fewer deaths from stroke in drotrecogin alfa activated patients than in placebo patients two versus seven patients The composite end point of any fatal ICH and any fatal stroke favored drotrecogin alfa activated as compared with placebo four versus eight patients The number of patients experiencing any fatal bleeding event or any fatal stroke was similar between the drotrecogin alfa activated and placebo groups nine versus eight patients respectively These data suggest that the 28 day all cause mortality rates reported for drotrecogin alfa activated represent a composite end point of less sepsis induced death potentially less thrombotic related deaths as well as any fatal complications associated with the use of drotrecogin alfa activated The primary limitation of these analyses was the lack of placebo treatment groups for five of the seven studies reported and no comparison group for patients administered drotrecogin alfa activated under commercial use Additionally baseline data describing the patient population was unavailable for patients enrolled in ongoing trials or receiving drotrecogin alfa activated commercially There were also notable differences in the inclusion criteria used to enroll patients in the compassionate use study F1K MC EVAS i e that study enrolled only patients with purpura fulminans This inclusion criterion may explain in part the higher bleeding rates seen in compassionate use trials Conclusion Drotrecogin alfa activated significantly reduces mortality in severe sepsis The treatment efficacy and safety profiles of drotrecogin alfa activated have remained consistent over multiple clinical trials The only significant serious adverse event associated with drotrecogin alfa activated treatment is bleeding Additional clinical experience indicates that invasive procedures are associated with a substantial percentage of these serious bleeding events Severe thrombocytopenia for all serious bleeding events and meningitis for ICH only may be risk factors for serious bleeding Mitigating the risk for serious bleeding by maintaining adequate platelets e g 30 000 mm 3 during drotrecogin alfa activated infusion may reduce risk for both bleeding and ICH Key messages Mortality rates in drotrecogin alfa activated treated patients remained consistent across trials The most important serious adverse event associated with drotrecogin alfa activated treatment is bleeding Serious bleeding events are most frequent on day 1 of therapy with drotrecogin alfa activated and rapidly decline on subsequent days Serious bleeding events were frequently procedure associated ICH during infusion period of drotrecogin alfa activated was frequently associated with severe thrombocytopenia and or meningitis Competing interests Gordon R Bernard received grant support from Eli Lilly and Company and serves as an occasional consultant
