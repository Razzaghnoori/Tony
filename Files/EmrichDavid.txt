 OK This is David Emrich and he also grew up in Philadelphia and he s lived in Charlotte for is it almost three years Is that right Three years Um and I ll ask you the same questions as well When you were growing up do you remember reading a book that uh you particularly liked and you remember or do you remember someone reading you a book that you particularly liked See When I was growing up the books I remember the most of were like The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Frank Swift and those kind of really um you know just serial serializations of books and those were the books that I remember first I don t remember any specific mysteries or anything like that I just remember reading dozens of them really until I was probably seven or eight years old Is there any particular reasons why you chose those books to read over others I think that I was given them as a gift The other because I would and they kept giving me gifts of books because they knew knew I liked to read And they were it would it would generally be series and like for example I remember now I now I recall uh I d gotten a series uh they d come in box sets at Christmas and they d be paperbox paperbacks in a box with a eight or ten books in them And I remember reading like uh I remember reading Sherlock Holmes mysteries this way and I remember reading books by J RR Tolkien uh you know Lord of the Rings and you know all those books the same way So I guess that these were the I mean my parents knew I liked to read and I would always for Christmas or my birthdays or or um you know anytime a gift was appropriate These were the kind of gifts that I would get I would get other gifts of course but not only also get something like this every year Were I mean obviously your parents thought reading was important because they d give you books because they knew you liked to read Did they like when you were younger maybe you couldn t read did they ever read anything to you that you remember Hum No I don t recall anything like that it doesn t mean it didn t happen It just means I don t recall it Hum Um did as you got older did they types of book change Did you still like mystery type books As I got older Let s see You know ten eleven or twelve By the time I got to be ten eleven or twelve I mean I remember I would read the books that were assigned in school and I really like those like you know the seventh grade readers usually that John Knowles A Separate Peace I remember reading that and it was very good and I remember reading um um Lord of the Flies by Sir William Golding which was was the type of book that was assigned then Um even then I used to like to read histories I remember reading very specifically uh uh history of the German rocketry program during WWII that reading you know I was just a thirteen or fourteen year old boy Uh I remember actually I remember reading a book it was on the best seller list at the time it was uh it was probably written in the late seventies and it was called The Third World War and it was it was uh it was written as if it were factual but it was uh um sort of a fictionalized account of what of a of a potential third world war and I remember the funny thing I remember was I read this book like after it was probably 77 or 78 and the war took place according to this book in like 85 or 86 I wouldn t say I lived in dread but I always a little afraid of that year That this was the year that these these events would come true and that there would be a Third World War In fact I remember it was seventh grade I remember because in this particular book the Soviet Union at that point had used um nuclear weapons against Birmingham England um and I had uh and that s what caused their coalition to unravel because none of the coalition partners wanted any part of that and that was what eventually caused them to lose the war But I remember doing a creative writing piece for a seventh grade reading class um where I invented a series of newspaper articles surrounding that particular event The fact that the Soviet Union had launched nuclear attacks various parts various uh you know cities around the world So you used what you had read to actually you you wrote about things you d actually read Yeah I d Created your own writing system Actually what I did was I imagined that this was that I was a news reporter writing for the New York Times or whatever Hum And I you know made up a big headline you know Such And Such a City Destroyed you know give a by line you know give a date and time and then just start writing what I what I thought were journalistic articles at that point about that event event which I had read about in a book which I had imagined Hum Um hum Um did do you remember any particular stories that were told to you when you were a child Well ah I don t remember my parents reading anything I do remember being in grade school and being in the library and the librarian reading James and the Giant Peach to us And we would go to I forget how often we d go to library like you know maybe it was once a week maybe it was three times a week but everytime we d go we d all sit on the rug we d sit Indian style cross legged and uh I m sure it s very politically incorrect at this point but the librarian could never say that today Um and then she would read us you know chapter at a time of James and the Giant Peach Did you look forward to reading or hearing her read James and the Giant Peach Yeah sure did I think think I enjoyed James and the Giant Peach Hum In fact I remember a few years ago they made a movie of it and I thought I ought to go see that but I guess it didn t do so well and it fizzled and I never saw it no Hum Do ever go back and reread the things that you read when you were younger now Uh Maybe not now but you know within the last four or five years Right I don t re remember rereading anything Besides um things like you know first off what I mentioned before it would it could be adult reading like um A Separate Peace or Lord of the Flies I remember rereading those in college just because I wanted to reread them Um but I don t I don t remember rereading anything that I read when I was a kid that that I that I reread as an adult OK Um Do you like now um I asked Megan the same question but now do you are there any family stories that you either remember or you like think are bizarre or you know would like to hear again Well I mean I don t think that uh my family generally doesn t sit around telling stories about what people did years ago or that kind of thing years ago there is one event I remember um no I mean there s a few things a few things I remember or have memories of but it isn t like anyone sits around telling stories about them Certainly the memory I have is different than the stories that that uh the family swaps around the table or anything like that So like you remember specific events I remember general things I remember one time we were at the shore my fam my grandfather had a house in Stone Harbor and there was a hurricane and I remember um you know we moved all the furniture inside for the hurri hurricane and we went out and he had an awning over his porch and you know and we we double tied the awning down During the hurricane we d go out and check to make sure that uh uh you know all the strings were still tied and the awning wasn t going to blow away but I don t remember you now I don t think we d sit around and telling that story I mean I occasionally mention that Do you remember Does anyone remember that story That that kind of thing that You don t elaborate on it much No no but I remember it like um most of my memories of of childhood memories I guess were were of that beach house and you know my grandmother and my mother and my sisters would stay there during the week and then on the weekend the men would come down like the men meaning my grandfather and my father and that kind of thing Um hum But I don t remember we we don t generally sit around and swapping stories about it I mean we just last week we were at the whole family again went to this time a North Carolina beach My Mom rented a house there and we you know I think at that point just because you know being at the beach I remember things and I would say You remember when we used to do this or that and the other thing and We talked about some other things then but it wasn t like we sat around telling hilarious tales and laughing over dinner and things like that OK Thank you very much Well you re welcome very much
