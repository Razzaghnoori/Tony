 Sprite s Spite Jooky produced for the Coca Cola Co Sprite Brand by Lowe Partners SMS This spot wasn t made for Jooky the kooky product it seems to promote It was made for Coca Cola s Sprite a fact it hides well Only at the end of the spot is Sprite mentioned only then does one realize that the string of clich s sun and sand beach towels and bikinis invited you to suspend disbelief through the viewing and that you fell for it The thump of a Caribbean beat urges that you open up a Jooky and someone does The screen fills with purple bubbles a detail that in retrospect suggests a consumer research finding that purple isn t the soft drink color of choice Then come the ubiquitous images dude on surfboard girl being tossed in blanket crowd cheering that link the product be it deodorant or dentures the Bahamas or a beverage with that oldest persuader of them all sex Jooky and nooky get it The jaded viewer mocks the gag then promptly buys it Most consumers studies have shown believe themselves impervious to the pitiful ploys of advertising Most consumers studies have shown are not in fact they are especially vulnerable when advertisers play directly to their skepticism It s a party in a can Here s Poseidon his adventure just beginning emerging from the depths He bears his burden of blonde and cans with ease A hot young thing swings on a tire offering you her drink A jock makes short work of a pile of Jooky cans Hard bodies dance toward the volleyball net Jooky is fun and fruity it make you really kooky The mandatory buffoon in the mock Superman outfit romps on the sand his one thought you got it captured in a comic book bubble Bit by bit the spot winks at its own satire The jingle trips the light fantastic promising the earth Jooky make you manly mahn in a Caribbean accent thick enough to thaw What we get instead is a trip in the sand Jooky in hand a volleyball player falls flat on his face He smiles beatifically and forsooth He has a missing front tooth Is Paradise fraying at the edges Absolutely the transition seems to say Borrowing a political advertising technique a shot of a television with the opponent s spot playing as a sign that we re being manipulated that what we re seeing isn t real it takes us into a grungy living room where two unbuffed slobs respond to the Jooky commercial just ending on their TV set This pair falls plumb in the middle of the Jooky target group no dates no sun no sand What they do have is the storm raging outside and the cheap college couch they re sitting on Can Jooky transport them to sunshine and women One of the men raises his can and looks within He s searching for the beach The other tries to open his can and breaks the lift tab It s happened to all of us hard to pop cans not hard bodies are the reality of soft drinks Mine s busted becomes the Jooky epitaph Image Is Nothing says the chyron But of course it s everything in a spot that turns sunny visuals against soft drink advertisers using the images to make the long overdue point that they are a stupid reason to pick a drink The grunge feel reinforces the invitation to rebel against yuppiedom trust your taste buds it says not commercials The anti image as image is powerful indeed So is the message Sprite must taste good if the company can risk advertising it this way We hardly notice that the disclaimer mentions Coca Cola the very company that s helped inure us to the images being satirized here Or was that Pepsi Initial impressions notwithstanding Jooky ends up making intention and product crystal clear It s taking on a whole genre on behalf of a drink that promises only good taste not the good life Robert Shrum
