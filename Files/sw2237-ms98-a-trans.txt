 okay so do you have do you have the long i guess not not if there s see i was raised in New York but i guess up there you all don t have too long of a growing season do you uh well we probably have about three months do you do you do you do your own gardening approximately um hum um hum we live on a used to be a farm but we don t farm much we uh but we do have a garden huh see i got mine in well let s see i put in pepper plants this weekend oh i wish i could be doing that and uh yeah i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen and uh huh i enjoy tinkering with it you know it s pretty hot down here during the summer we hit you know a hundred hundred and two sometimes so but you know we don t do too much during the summer as far as tomatoes and stuff like that but uh huh you right yeah you almost have to get started pretty early probably i guess yeah i can usually i can put in oh probably mid March i can put anything in the ground you know beets and onions and stuff like that uh huh uh huh uh huh but then i have to wait for my tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks uh huh as soon as we re sure we re not going to have another freeze then i ll finish it yeah you ve had more freezing this winter or this yeah winter i think yeah we ve had just a few you know freezes a little here and there but every once in a while we get a freeze around the middle of April and it s pretty tough more bad weather um hum um hum um hum are you do you work or are you retired or you no i work um i m only forty years old i have to work uh uh my husbands retired but he s not a gardener he he he s been helping me more but he really isn t real uh real crazy about gardening well but i i really enjoy it it gives me time outdoors and you know i m a golfer but it gives me time outdoors and time around my house and and i burned my grass off here in the last couple of days and uh huh uh huh uh huh oh uh huh getting ready to start to for the Spring season and see if i can grow me another nice lawn i usually have a pretty nice lawn it s a lot of work you know but it s um hum huh oh yeah but it s a pleasure to like you said it s good to get outside and yeah it is and i like i like my garden too we didn t have to we have just a small garden but we planted corn last year too which takes quite a bit of space and uh huh we we didn t have too good luck with it because the uh we had a couple of good real good wind storms and it really damaged the corn so we didn t get too much oh yeah corn last year we re going through that we going through the dust storms down here now so uh huh but i uh what i did with my garden is i have a a two by six frame that s five by ten i have two of them sitting side by side uh huh and then i put uh like a black plastic it s really not a black plastic it they call it Weedex and i put that down and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that oh uh huh hum and i use a one of those black soaker hoses that actually oozes water every where so i lace it up and down there a couple of times and i only have to water about two hours a week um hum um hum oh that s great and it s pretty nice especially during the Summer it keeps everything wet instead of wilting uh huh uh huh yeah we don t we don t usually cover ours we did a few different times sometimes we ve covered with the plastic and other years we ve tried newspapers and uh but we generally don t we do our watering from our spring oh uh yeah we have an old fashioned tub sitting that you know water runs into and and uh my husband set up a pump that runs it runs till it s down and then it stops oh you have a spring how nice uh huh and then when the water comes up it comes on again and we use that to water our garden oh that s uh that s pretty nice with so but you actually enjoy it huh oh i do i love it get out there on your hands and knees and crawl around i d rather be doing that than housework i understand i can imagine you all have much trouble up there with insects or uh not a whole well not a whole lot i think our cabbages and broccolis and that we have more trouble with that type of thing with the the yeah with the worms yeah i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs and haven t figured out how to get rid of those yet uh uh huh uh do you go more for natural keeping them off naturally or do you use insecticides yeah i try to no i uh uh try not to use any insecticides at all i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn but i sometimes i can t manage uh huh uh huh uh huh yeah well our lawn is is a big lawn because because we live out in the country and so we were not our lawn is not perfect you know it s just the it s just a lawn if uh huh do you eat any of them yeah yeah well mine s full of dandelions now so no i never have i don t know how to prepare them oh did well did does your wife ever make uh a bake in a hot bacon dressing like for salad no huh uh oh it s delicious and it goes real good on dandelions um hum really huh i ve never eaten dandelions now i ve tried dandelion wine um hum uh but i ve never tried any dandelions just to eat uh huh this is use the greens and you get them when they re young and tender you know before they have grown too too taut because they do get a little stringy yeah all right but u h they re kind of fun to to try get a get a few and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes yeah i ll try that i sure will yeah yeah oh i don t know uh but i ve been cutting our grass too lately because my husband s back and he s been having trouble with so wasn t allowed to run a lawn mower so it takes about four hours to cut our grass oh oh you and we have we have hills i m afraid of the hills but i m getting on to it i just pretend they re not there and i just go ahead and do it so you all are into so you all are into the lawn big time huh yeah yeah i only got well i guess i got um my whole section of my house is probably maybe a tenth of an acre uh huh and i have a pretty nice backyard and you know i ve got enough room to throw horseshoes you know couple of other odds and ends uh huh oh that s great great that s a lot of people don t have that much space even no and it s nice i m just inside the city limits i m probably a mile mile and a half inside the city limits and i m only a mile and a half from work that uh huh so you have all the conveniences of a city yeah and and the country also yeah it s pretty nice i have the room outside i need and i don t really have all the room in the house i need but uh huh well you never have enough room do you think no no especially if your into any hobbies or anything or yeah i have a question to ask you about gardening though you know those what are they called the they called uh roly poly bugs that s what my son calls them anyway uh huh roly poly what roly poly bugs the ones that roll up in a ball i don t know what they re called is it a bug you mean they look like they ve got yeah no no it s not like a no a worm a cut worm not a grub worm you find them under bricks and all that stuff where it s moist and if if you touch them they roll up in a ball oh i don t know what they call them but i m plagued with those things down here and i haven t figured out i even called the nursery either though see um um hum i m trying to think of what they are what kind they could be i i don t know you find them under bricks usually and that yeah under bricks or under wood or you know if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long they get in there they usually come out at night but you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that s been laying around no they re not a slug not a a slug is actually kind of slimy and and these are just he plays with them all time he picks them up and rolls them across the patio yeah yeah yeah oh really they are not hard are they are they a hard worm no no they re not real hard they re not a hard huh they re like a a water bug of sorts i don t know what they re called them yeah yeah yeah when when you touch them they roll up oh are they black then but they roll up i can t think of what kind they would be uh huh i m no help on that then because i can t think of what they are but i m plagued with those what they would be but i think you have a lot more insects down there even than than what we have you know i think it s because probably because we re in more of a tempered zone you know we don t really we only freeze down here in January and February at the most you know uh huh uh huh uh huh i know my brother had trouble with fire ants and that even uh yeah and they be can be a real dickens yeah i got fire ants too and you spray in one part of your lawn and they just move to another part so you got to spray your whole yard and then uh huh uh huh yeah yeah your your neighbor gets them and then he sprays his yard and you get them back again so yeah but we re not doing too bad down here really you know the daffodils are out and and uh yeah you keep trading them yeah uh huh uh huh ours are going to be coming out now our cancer society sales daffodils right now they re they re big now so we we have daffodils for in the house because of the cut flowers but they re just beginning to come out the end bud yeah yeah yeah see mine are up and bloomed already oh and they sure are pretty i like them and the Snap Dragons are starting to come up oh oh they re such a nice bright early spring color yeah and then in in my back flower bed i have uh tiger lilies um hum um hum and they bloom in you know late June mid July and they re yeah they are they re real nice but they re they re nice and green you know they re up above a foot maybe eighteen inches um hum and they re beautiful too yeah they re beautiful uh huh oh my they come up real pretty every year no problem yeah no we won t have too much here for another couple of months yet really yeah yeah we re having it s raining today is it still pretty cool up there yeah well do you all have a what kind of grass do you grow up there do you grow uh Bermuda or rye or well our grass like i said is just grass we really didn t plant anything it s just so i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even okay yeah see we i have Bermuda in my yard now i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there but and uh uh huh um hum it s probably very pretty Bermuda seems to be yeah Bermuda seems to do pretty good down here uh huh uh huh we have some people that have done their lawns and and uh
