                    Background        The role of genetics in modulating the immune response        to infectious diseases is a topic of longstanding interest        among epidemiologists clinicians population geneticists        and immunologists      Zinkernagel and Dohertys Nobel        Prizewinning discovery that cellular immunity to viral        infections was restricted by the highly variable proteins        of the Major Histocompatibility Complex MHC brought the        field of immunogenetics into sharper focus     Their        demonstration that T lymphocytes recognize virus antigens        displayed on a host cell in the context of MHC proteins        immediately suggested the idea that genetic differences at        the loci encoding the MHC might modulate the intensity and        effectiveness of host response to infection        The relationship between MHC genotype and infectious        disease resistance can take several forms Most simply        individual MHC alleles may be especially effective or        especially ineffective at presenting antigens from        particular infections so that carrying one or two copies        of a given MHC allele might predispose an infected        individual to a more or less favorable disease outcome A        second distinct but compatible hypothesis was suggested by        Doherty and Zinkernagel soon after their discovery of MHC        restriction since each MHC allele provides an infected        individual with the ability to present a particular set of        antigens individuals who are heterozygous say genotype        XY at a particular MHC locus may mount a more vigorous        immune response to a given infection resulting in a better        outcome than individuals who are homozygous for either of        the corresponding alleles XX or YY            Determining whether either or both of these mechanisms        operates for a particular disease is of interest for a        variety of basic and applied purposes Epidemiologically        HLA genotype partially accounts for interpatient variation        in disease severity or progression rates for such longterm        viral infections as HIV human Tcell lymphotropic virus        type  HTLV and hepatitis B and C         Such        associations can lead to mechanistic studies to test        hypotheses about the immunologic basis of these        associations     and could in principle be used to        help predict individual prognoses      At least one        clinical study has shown that HLA genotype affects the        immune response to a candidate HIV vaccine     Vaccine        designers have begun to take account of the HLA genotypes        of potential recipients in choosing antigens for inclusion        in a vaccine     and it has been suggested that HLA        genotype be considered in designing samples for inclusion        in epidemiologic studies of antiHIV immune response            In evolutionary biology the possibility that HLA        heterozygotes are more resistant to infectious diseases is        the basis for a leading hypothesis to explain the        unparalleled diversity of HLA genes and MHC genes in other        vertebrates and the maintenance of this diversity over        long periods of evolutionary time            Of the two ways described above in which MHC genotype        may affect disease outcome the first  association between        a particular allele and disease outcome  has been        repeatedly documented in human populations by various        methods of genetic epidemiology     The second kind of        effect more vigorous immune responses to a pathogen by a        heterozygote as compared to homozygotes for the same        alleles which we term allelespecific overdominance has        been suggested by several animal studies               although none of these studies is unambiguous see        DISCUSSION There have been no studies to our knowledge        in humans that directly compare the infectious disease        outcomes of heterozygotes to those of homozygotes for the        same alleles interestingly the situation is very        different for autoimmune diseases see DISCUSSION for        further consideration        As an alternative to directly examining the hypothesis        of allelespecific overdominance several investigators        have compared the infectious disease outcomes of        heterozygotes at a given HLA locus as a group to the        outcomes of homozygotes at the same locus as a group In        many cases heterozygotes as a group have shown better        infectious disease outcomes slower disease progression or        more rapid clearance of viral infection than homozygotes        as a group          a phenomenon we call        population heterozygote advantage Because these studies        group all homozygotes and group all heterozygotes they do        not in fact test the hypothesis of allelespecific        overdominance which is conditional on the alleles        involved Although population heterozygote advantage and        allelespecific overdominance are different            reports of population heterozygote advantage have        frequently been interpreted as confirmations of the        DohertyZinkernagel hypothesis of allelespecific        overdominance        In this report we show that although population        heterozygote advantage is compatible with allelespecific        overdominance it is also compatible with the opposite        ie population heterozygote advantage could arise in a        population in which every heterozygote had a         worse disease outcome than either of        the corresponding homozygotes allelespecific        underdominance The reason for this disconnect is an        unusual form of confounding in which particular protective        or detrimental alleles are over or underrepresented        among heterozygotes as we discuss below an additional        factor that may be involved results from the effects of        dominance in creating an asymmetry between homozygotes and        heterozygotes As we have suggested above it is        biologically and epidemiologically useful to determine a        the beneficial or harmful effects of specific alleles and        b the effects of heterozygosity such as allelespecific        overdominance we show here that unconditional comparisons        of all heterozygotes to all homozygotes can reflect either        or both of these and cannot distinguish them To measure        the quantitites of direct interest analyses that compare        disease outcomes conditional on the alleles involved        rather than grouped comparisons of heterozygotes to        homozygotes will be more informative        In the first section below we outline a general model        for the relationship between genotype at a particular HLA        locus and infectious disease outcome which we dichotomize        into favorable and unfavorable and we use the model to        define the conditions under which population heterozygote        advantage is expected We show that depending on allele        frequencies at the HLA locus of interest population        heterozygote advantage may occur when there is        allelespecific overdominance but may also occur under        other conditions including allelespecific underdominance        Two examples are given to illustrate the reasons for the        lack of concordance between population and allelespecific        effects In the Discussion we suggest some possible        approaches for estimating allelespecific effects                    General Model        To determine the precise conditions under which        population heterozygote advantage will be observed we        consider a general model that predicts the expected outcome        of a comparison between heterozygotes and homozygotes in an        epidemiological study as a function of i the frequencies        of resistant and susceptible alleles at a particular locus        and ii the relationship between genotype at that locus        and phenotype Note that this is         not a model for the evolution of        genotype frequencies or for the maintenance of MHC        heterozygosity but simply an algebraic framework for        predicting the outcome of an epidemiological study of the        type cited above given current allele frequencies and        genotypephenotype mappings        The model is summarized in Table  Suppose that        individual alleles of a particular locus confer either        susceptibility or resistance to a given disease and that        there are         m resistance alleles         R                   R                   R                   m          with frequencies         p                   p                   p                   m          in the population and         n susceptibility alleles         S                   S                   S                   n          with frequencies         q                   q                   q                   n           Let be the total frequency of resistant alleles and        be the total frequency of susceptible alleles with         p          q   Further define and are the        sums of squared frequencies of the resistant and        susceptible alleles respectively We assume HardyWeinberg        genotype frequencies    throughout Thus  is the        frequency of RR homozygotes and is an inverse measure of        the diversity of resistant alleles while  the frequency        of SS homozygotes is an inverse measure of the diversity        of susceptible alleles        We assume that SS homozygotes have a probability         x of a favorable disease course and        that SS heterozygotes carrying two different susceptible        alleles SR heterozygotes RR heterozygotes and RR        homozygotes have probabilities         ax          bx          cx  and         dx respectively see Table  To        give meaning to the notions of resistant and susceptible        alleles we assume         d   RR homozygotes do better        than SS homozygotes and         a          b          c given that one is heterozygous        more R alleles are better This model can accommodate        dominance          a           b          c          d  additivity          a           c          d          b            d  or recessiveness          a          b   and         c          d  of the resistant alleles It can        also accommodate overdominance of the resistant alleles          a           b          d          c          d  in which each heterozygote does        better than either corresponding homozygote and        underdominance in which each heterozygote does worse than        either corresponding homozygote          a           b           c          d  In this model susceptibility        and resistance are relative and simply refer respectively        to lower and higher probabilities of favorable disease        course given infection For simplicity we assume that all        S alleles are equivalent and all R alleles are equivalent        our conclusions could obviously be generalized to cases        where there is a whole range of effects for different        alleles        Under these assumptions we can calculate         f                   hom          and         f                   het           the probability of a favorable disease course for        homozygotes the first and fifth classes in Table  and        for heterozygotes the  nd  rd and  thclasses in Table                        The relative risk RR of a favorable outcome for a        heterozygote compared to a homozygote is defined as                Population heterozygote advantage corresponds to RR          Various formulations for relative risk or odds ratio        used in casecontrol studies such as     are used in        studies of HLA heterozygosity and disease outcome but in        all cases the cutoff is one and a value larger or smaller        than one depending on the precise definition used        corresponds to population heterozygote advantage Using the        relative risk equation above it can be shown by taking        partial derivatives with respect to the parameters         p   and  that under the        assumptions stated above the relative risk increases with         p and  and decreases with  Thus        population heterozygote advantage is most likely to be        observed when resistant alleles are common          p large but highly diverse  is        small and when susceptible alleles are not diverse large         These trends can be understood intuitively Homozygotes        will be predominantly resistant if R alleles are common and        have little diversity and sensitive when S alleles are        common and have little diversity Heterozygotes will be        predominantly resistant if R alleles are highly diverse and        sensitive if S alleles are highly diverse        Figure shows the parameter regions in which population        heterozygote advantage is expected and those in which the        contrary is expected homozygotes on average are more        likely to have a favorable disease course Each panel        reflects a different assumption about the true genetic        basis of resistance  assuming that resistant alleles are        overdominant dominant additive recessive or        underdominant In each case population heterozygote        advantage shown as the black region and corresponding to        RR   is most likely when resistant alleles are highly        diverse and susceptible alleles have low diversity bottom        right of each panel        Figure shows that allelespecific overdominance the        biological phenomenon of interest and population        heterozygote advantage the finding of epidemiological        studies such as those cited above are two different        things Population heterozygote advantage black may be        observed even when resistance is not overdominant but only        dominant additive recessive or only underdominant as        long as allele frequencies are sufficiently far toward the        lower right of the parameter space high diversity of        resistant alleles and low diversity of susceptible        alleles Figure shows that this is possible under a        fairly broad range of parameter combinations ie there        are substantial black areas in the dominant additive and        recessive panels        The converse is also true though only in what seem to        be very special circumstances That is even when        allelespecific overdominance holds it is possible that        heterozygotes on average will do worse than homozygotes so        population heterozygote advantage will not be observed        This occurs with genotype frequencies sufficiently far        toward the top left of Figure  with a high diversity of        susceptible alleles and low diversity of resistant ones        This occurs only rarely for the parameter values we have        chosen most of the leftmost panel is black and this        seems to be the case for a broad range of parameter        values        Although neither population heterozygote advantage nor        allelespecific overdominance implies the other the two        phenomena are of course related Specifically the        conditions to observe population heterozygote advantage are        broadest when allelespecific overdominance holds and        become narrower as the underlying genetics becomes more        different from overdominance of resistance dominance         additivity  recessiveness         underdominance                    Two Examples        The intuition behind our result that population        heterozygote advantage need not reflect allelespecific        overdominance can be seen in two simple examples        Example  Suppose that there are two alleles each at         frequency in the population one R conferring        resistance and one S conferring susceptibility in the        homozygous state Population heterozygote advantage will be        observed if the probability of a favorable outcome for        heterozygotes is greater than the arithmetic mean of the        probabilities of favorable outcomes for RR homozygotes and        for SS homozygotes In this situation population        heterozygote advantage does not require overdominance but        merely allele effects that are more than additive partial        dominance Dominance of particular HLA alleles conferring        resistance andor recessiveness of susceptibility poor        outcome alleles have been documented for schistosomiasis            leprosy     acute lymphoblastic leukemia for        which an infectious cause is hypothesized     and        hepatitis B in this case the outcome was vaccine        responsiveness            When allele frequencies are equal as in Example         partial dominance is sufficient to create population        heterozygote advantage      When allele frequencies        differ the conditions for population heterozygote        advantage may become broader or narrower This can be seen        in a second deliberately extreme example        Example  Suppose there are  alleles each with        frequency  each conferring resistance to a particular        disease and one allele with frequency  conferring        susceptibility In the notation of Table  this        corresponds to         p          q                  In this case  of homozygotes in the        population will be homozygous for a susceptible allele        since the frequency of SS homozygotes is    while        the frequency of RR homozygotes is    In contrast         of heterozygotes will have at least one resistant        allele In epidemiological terms this is a form of        confounding in which possession of a resistant allele is        positively associated with heterozygosity the exposure of        interest and positively associated with having a favorable        disease course the outcome of interest Because of this        confounding under some parameter values population        heterozygote advantage can occur even when heterozygotes        are not at an advantage relative to their corresponding        homozygotes Specifically population heterozygote        advantage may be observed when resistance is additive        heterozygotes have risks equal to the average of the risks        of the corresponding homozygotes when resistance is        recessive or even when it is underdominant heterozygotes        have higher risk of disease than either corresponding        homozygote        Continuing this example suppose that the resistant        alleles are recessive to the susceptible one so that        individuals with one or two copies of the susceptible        allele have favorable outcomes with probability  and        individuals with two resistant alleles have favorable        outcomes with probability  these assumptions correspond        to         x           a          b           c          d   In this example there are        no SS heterozygotes since there is only one S allele SR        heterozygotes make up  of the population          pq   while RR heterozygotes        carrying two different R alleles make up         p       of the        population The probability of a favorable outcome for        heterozygotes will be the weighted average of the        probabilities of a favorable outcome for SR and RR        heterozygotes using equation                 For homozygotes using equation  the probability of a        favorable outcome         f                   hom          will be the weighted average of the probabilities for        SS homozygotes  of the population and for RR        homozygotes  of the population                Thus heterozygotes on average will be  times more        likely to have a favorable outcome even though each        heterozygote has the same outcome as if she were        homozygous for the worse of the two alleles she carries        In epidemiological terms heterozygotes would have a        relative risk of  of an unfavorable outcome compared to        homozygotes        Both of these examples were chosen for the purposes of        clarity rather than for precise reflection of the allele        frequencies in real populations in particular few if any        populations have a single HLA allele with a frequency of         Moreover we have simplified the effects of alleles        into two categories resistant and susceptible R and S        which are simply relative notions In fact real alleles        will likely have a spectrum of effects ranging from highly        resistant to highly susceptible with some alleles having        no effect Note however that no effect is also a        relative term and refers to an allele whose effect on        disease outcome is close to the population average                    Discussion        The foregoing examples show that the finding of        population heterozygote advantage as in the infectious        disease studies cited does not support an inference of        allelespecific overdominance the condition of primary        interest as an immunological hypothesis and a mechanism for        the maintenance of MHC diversity Put another way        population heterozygote advantage may appear due to a        combination of the two distinct mechanisms we defined in        the Introduction the protective or detrimental effects of        particular alleles R and S alleles in our model and the        effects of heterozygosity itself The effects of R and S        alleles appear as effects of heterozygosity vs        homozygosity because heterozygotes and homozygotes will in        general carry different distributions of S and R alleles        thus in an analysis that fails to condition on the alleles        carried heterozygosity is confounded with the alleles        carried        One advantage of correctly separating the effects of        individual alleles from the effects of heterozygosity        conditional on those alleles is that each of these        measures is a characteristic of an individual rather than        a population For example if genotypes XX XY and YY have        relative risks   and  for clearance of a viral        infection then this should hold true regardless of who        else is in the population In contrast we have shown that        population heterozygote advantage depends on not only the        effects of individual genotypes on disease outcome but        also on allele frequencies Therefore even if biological        and epidemiologic mechanisms were identical in two        populations but allele frequencies differed in those two        populations it would be perfectly reasonable to find        population heterozygote advantage in one but not the        other        The problem we have described with measuring population        heterozygote advantage is not in principle limited to        susceptibilityresistance studies of         infectious diseases In principle        the same problem could occur in any study of HLA        associations with disease outcome Interestingly however        in our review of the literature on HLAchronic disease        associations we have found no examples of the problem        Moreover direct estimates of the allelespecific effects        of heterozygosity relative to the corresponding        homozygotes nearly absent in the infectious diseaseHLA        literature are frequently found in studies of HLA genotype        and chronic mostly autoimmune diseases       We        do not know the reason for this difference in approach but        suspect that some infectious disease investigators        informed by the evolutionary hypothesis of overdominance        for infectious disease resistance and by animal studies        may have a special interest in detecting effects of        heterozygosity         per se  Many studies of        HLAautoimmune disease associations on the other hand        seem to focus more on the effects of individual alleles        and having established these move on to investigate the        dependence of these effects on genetic modifiers including        the identity of the individuals other allele at the same        locus        We have shown that when allelespecific overdominance        exists it will often be manifest as population        heterozygote advantage but that a finding of population        heterozygote advantage may be consistent with other        patterns of allelespecific effects for example when        resistant and susceptible alleles are equally common and        equally diverse population heterozygote advantage will        occur if allelespecific effects are additive dominant or        overdominant It is difficult to generalize without doing        a specific epidemiologic study about how the prevalence        and diversity of R and S alleles would be likely to occur        in a given population OBrien et al    found a        spectrum of estimated effects of Class I HLA alleles on        HIV disease progression and this spectrum seems visually        to be roughly symmetric but further information would be        required to determine plausible values of         p   or  from these data One might        expect the distribution to be skewed toward resistant        alleles for diseases that have exerted longterm selection        on a population but it is difficult to make confident        predictions about such patterns without detailed knowledge        of hostpathogen coevolution        Our results do not deny that allelespecific        overdominance at HLA exists in human populations with        respect to infectious disease resistance but simply raise        doubts about the reliability of the major evidence that has        been adduced in support of this phenomenon Existing data        suggest that allelespecific overdominance may exist in        some animal infectious diseases but also that simple        dominance and other outcomes are commonly observed            Several experimental studies have examined this question        using singlestrain infections in animals and while        suggestions of allelespecific overdominance have been        made none of the studies has been entirely convincing        Doherty and Zinkernagel    demonstrated using congenic        mice that MHC homozygotes had more vigorous immune        responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV than        the corresponding homozygotes but since the pathology of        the infection they used is due to the immune response the        enhanced immune response actually resulted in reduced        survival A study in mice of resistance to         Toxoplasma gondii showed that F          offspring of two genetically divergent        parent strains were more resistant than either parent        strain but there seems to be no demonstration that        heterozygosity at an MHC locus is responsible            while another reference    that has been cited           as showing overdominance at MHC in the same hostpathogen        system does not appear to address the question directly A        study of Mareks disease virus in chickens seems to        demonstrate allelespecific overdominance at the MHC using        defined genetic backgrounds but the report does not        clearly specify how homogeneous the genetic background was        in these experiments            From the perspective of the population genetics debate        concerning the role of overdominance in maintaining        polymorphism at the MHC we should note that this mechanism        requires allelespecific overdominance for total fitness        not for resistance to individual diseases As noted by        Doherty and Zinkernagel     simple dominance for        resistance to each of several diseases can create        allelespecific overdominance for total fitness if        different alleles confer resistance to different diseases             For these reasons our results while relevant to        the longstanding debate over the relative importance of        various kinds of balancing selection in maintaining MHC        diversity     raise doubts about only one of several        lines of evidence for the overdominance hypothesis        Simple and accurate methods exist to determine for a        single pair of alleles how the three possible genotypes         homozygotes and one heterozygote affect disease outcome        and these methods have been used frequently in the        literature on autoimmunity and HLA      and once        to our knowledge in the HLAinfectious disease literature            It is of additional interest for epidemiologists        immunologists vaccine designers and evaluators and        population geneticists to know whether HLA heterozygosity        in general improves the immune response to and outcome of        infectious diseases To answer this question in a        meaningful way it will be necessary to develop improved        methods that estimate the effect of heterozygosity while        conditioning on the alleles involved Meanwhile findings        of population heterozygote advantage should not be        interpreted as confirming the mechanism of allelespecific        overdominance                    Competing interests        None declared                    Authors contributions        The methodological principles in this report grew out of        discussions held by the three authors ML formulated the        problem and drafted the manuscript which was edited and        revised by CB and RA All authors read and approved the        final manuscript                    Appendix        In this appendix we prove that the relative risk defined        in Equation  is increasing in p and  and decreasing in                As a preliminary result that will be useful later note        that and                           Proof that the relative risk is          increasing in p           We must show that  To do so we calculate                By definition         p and    are each between zero and        one and all of the parameters           a          b  and         c are positive and by assumption         a          b          c  Therefore therefore all terms        in the partial derivative are positive so the relative        risk is increasing in         p  QED                          Proof that relative risk is decreasing          in            Since         RR          f                   het                   f                   hom           it is sufficient to show that the numerator         f                   het           is decreasing in  and the denominator         f                   hom           is increasing in  This is intuitively clear         f                   het          is the weighted average of the risk of individuals in        the  nd  rd and  thcolumns of Table  increasing         reduces the weight on the highestrisk category the         thcolumn with risk         cx  thereby reducing the weighted        average Similarly increasing  increases the        representation of RR homozygotes among homozygotes thereby        increasing the average risk of homozygotes Formally        first we show that         f                   het           is decreasing in  namely that  Taking the partial        derivative and rearranging we find                This is justified as follows The first term is positive        by defnition Inside the curly brackets in the penultimate        line above we have the sum of two terms each of which        itself is the product of a nonpositive term and a        nonnegative term thus the curly brackets are nonpositive        Specifically and are both nonpositive because we assumed         a          b          c            p    is nonnegative as noted at        the beginning of the appendix The term in curly brackets        is nonpositive and the term outside is positive so the        whole expression is nonpositive as stated        It is apparent by inspection that the denominator of the        relative risk         f                   hom           is increasing in  Since the numerator of the        relative risk is nonincreasing in  and the denominator of        the relative risk is increasing the relative risk is        decreasing in         The argument that the relative risk is increasing in         is exactly symmetric to the argument for
