 Background The role of genetics in modulating the immune response to infectious diseases is a topic of longstanding interest among epidemiologists clinicians population geneticists and immunologists 1 2 Zinkernagel and Doherty s Nobel Prize winning discovery that cellular immunity to viral infections was restricted by the highly variable proteins of the Major Histocompatibility Complex MHC brought the field of immunogenetics into sharper focus 3 Their demonstration that T lymphocytes recognize virus antigens displayed on a host cell in the context of MHC proteins immediately suggested the idea that genetic differences at the loci encoding the MHC might modulate the intensity and effectiveness of host response to infection The relationship between MHC genotype and infectious disease resistance can take several forms Most simply individual MHC alleles may be especially effective or especially ineffective at presenting antigens from particular infections so that carrying one or two copies of a given MHC allele might predispose an infected individual to a more or less favorable disease outcome A second distinct but compatible hypothesis was suggested by Doherty and Zinkernagel soon after their discovery of MHC restriction since each MHC allele provides an infected individual with the ability to present a particular set of antigens individuals who are heterozygous say genotype XY at a particular MHC locus may mount a more vigorous immune response to a given infection resulting in a better outcome than individuals who are homozygous for either of the corresponding alleles XX or YY 4 Determining whether either or both of these mechanisms operates for a particular disease is of interest for a variety of basic and applied purposes Epidemiologically HLA genotype partially accounts for inter patient variation in disease severity or progression rates for such long term viral infections as HIV human T cell lymphotropic virus type 1 HTLV 1 and hepatitis B and C 5 6 7 8 9 Such associations can lead to mechanistic studies to test hypotheses about the immunologic basis of these associations 10 11 and could in principle be used to help predict individual prognoses 12 13 At least one clinical study has shown that HLA genotype affects the immune response to a candidate HIV vaccine 14 Vaccine designers have begun to take account of the HLA genotypes of potential recipients in choosing antigens for inclusion in a vaccine 15 and it has been suggested that HLA genotype be considered in designing samples for inclusion in epidemiologic studies of anti HIV immune response 12 In evolutionary biology the possibility that HLA heterozygotes are more resistant to infectious diseases is the basis for a leading hypothesis to explain the unparalleled diversity of HLA genes and MHC genes in other vertebrates and the maintenance of this diversity over long periods of evolutionary time 16 Of the two ways described above in which MHC genotype may affect disease outcome the first association between a particular allele and disease outcome has been repeatedly documented in human populations by various methods of genetic epidemiology 17 The second kind of effect more vigorous immune responses to a pathogen by a heterozygote as compared to homozygotes for the same alleles which we term allele specific overdominance has been suggested by several animal studies 18 19 20 21 although none of these studies is unambiguous see DISCUSSION There have been no studies to our knowledge in humans that directly compare the infectious disease outcomes of heterozygotes to those of homozygotes for the same alleles interestingly the situation is very different for autoimmune diseases see DISCUSSION for further consideration As an alternative to directly examining the hypothesis of allele specific overdominance several investigators have compared the infectious disease outcomes of heterozygotes at a given HLA locus as a group to the outcomes of homozygotes at the same locus as a group In many cases heterozygotes as a group have shown better infectious disease outcomes slower disease progression or more rapid clearance of viral infection than homozygotes as a group 5 6 8 9 14 22 a phenomenon we call population heterozygote advantage Because these studies group all homozygotes and group all heterozygotes they do not in fact test the hypothesis of allele specific overdominance which is conditional on the alleles involved Although population heterozygote advantage and allele specific overdominance are different 10 reports of population heterozygote advantage have frequently been interpreted as confirmations of the Doherty Zinkernagel hypothesis of allele specific overdominance In this report we show that although population heterozygote advantage is compatible with allele specific overdominance it is also compatible with the opposite i e population heterozygote advantage could arise in a population in which every heterozygote had a worse disease outcome than either of the corresponding homozygotes allele specific underdominance The reason for this disconnect is an unusual form of confounding in which particular protective or detrimental alleles are over or under represented among heterozygotes as we discuss below an additional factor that may be involved results from the effects of dominance in creating an asymmetry between homozygotes and heterozygotes As we have suggested above it is biologically and epidemiologically useful to determine a the beneficial or harmful effects of specific alleles and b the effects of heterozygosity such as allele specific overdominance we show here that unconditional comparisons of all heterozygotes to all homozygotes can reflect either or both of these and cannot distinguish them To measure the quantitites of direct interest analyses that compare disease outcomes conditional on the alleles involved rather than grouped comparisons of heterozygotes to homozygotes will be more informative In the first section below we outline a general model for the relationship between genotype at a particular HLA locus and infectious disease outcome which we dichotomize into favorable and unfavorable and we use the model to define the conditions under which population heterozygote advantage is expected We show that depending on allele frequencies at the HLA locus of interest population heterozygote advantage may occur when there is allele specific overdominance but may also occur under other conditions including allele specific underdominance Two examples are given to illustrate the reasons for the lack of concordance between population and allele specific effects In the Discussion we suggest some possible approaches for estimating allele specific effects General Model To determine the precise conditions under which population heterozygote advantage will be observed we consider a general model that predicts the expected outcome of a comparison between heterozygotes and homozygotes in an epidemiological study as a function of i the frequencies of resistant and susceptible alleles at a particular locus and ii the relationship between genotype at that locus and phenotype Note that this is not a model for the evolution of genotype frequencies or for the maintenance of MHC heterozygosity but simply an algebraic framework for predicting the outcome of an epidemiological study of the type cited above given current allele frequencies and genotype phenotype mappings The model is summarized in Table 1 Suppose that individual alleles of a particular locus confer either susceptibility or resistance to a given disease and that there are m resistance alleles R 1 R 2 R m with frequencies p 1 p 2 p m in the population and n susceptibility alleles S 1 S 2 S n with frequencies q 1 q 2 q n Let be the total frequency of resistant alleles and be the total frequency of susceptible alleles with p q 1 Further define and are the sums of squared frequencies of the resistant and susceptible alleles respectively We assume Hardy Weinberg genotype frequencies 23 throughout Thus is the frequency of RR homozygotes and is an inverse measure of the diversity of resistant alleles while the frequency of SS homozygotes is an inverse measure of the diversity of susceptible alleles We assume that SS homozygotes have a probability x of a favorable disease course and that SS heterozygotes carrying two different susceptible alleles SR heterozygotes RR heterozygotes and RR homozygotes have probabilities ax bx cx and dx respectively see Table 1 To give meaning to the notions of resistant and susceptible alleles we assume d 1 RR homozygotes do better than SS homozygotes and a b c given that one is heterozygous more R alleles are better This model can accommodate dominance a 1 b c d additivity a 1 c d b 1 d 2 or recessiveness a b 1 and c d of the resistant alleles It can also accommodate overdominance of the resistant alleles a 1 b d c d in which each heterozygote does better than either corresponding homozygote and underdominance in which each heterozygote does worse than either corresponding homozygote a 1 b 1 c d In this model susceptibility and resistance are relative and simply refer respectively to lower and higher probabilities of favorable disease course given infection For simplicity we assume that all S alleles are equivalent and all R alleles are equivalent our conclusions could obviously be generalized to cases where there is a whole range of effects for different alleles Under these assumptions we can calculate f hom and f het the probability of a favorable disease course for homozygotes the first and fifth classes in Table 1 and for heterozygotes the 2 nd 3 rd and 4 thclasses in Table 1 The relative risk RR of a favorable outcome for a heterozygote compared to a homozygote is defined as Population heterozygote advantage corresponds to RR 1 Various formulations for relative risk or odds ratio used in case control studies such as 6 are used in studies of HLA heterozygosity and disease outcome but in all cases the cutoff is one and a value larger or smaller than one depending on the precise definition used corresponds to population heterozygote advantage Using the relative risk equation above it can be shown by taking partial derivatives with respect to the parameters p and that under the assumptions stated above the relative risk increases with p and and decreases with Thus population heterozygote advantage is most likely to be observed when resistant alleles are common p large but highly diverse is small and when susceptible alleles are not diverse large These trends can be understood intuitively Homozygotes will be predominantly resistant if R alleles are common and have little diversity and sensitive when S alleles are common and have little diversity Heterozygotes will be predominantly resistant if R alleles are highly diverse and sensitive if S alleles are highly diverse Figure 1shows the parameter regions in which population heterozygote advantage is expected and those in which the contrary is expected homozygotes on average are more likely to have a favorable disease course Each panel reflects a different assumption about the true genetic basis of resistance assuming that resistant alleles are overdominant dominant additive recessive or underdominant In each case population heterozygote advantage shown as the black region and corresponding to RR 1 is most likely when resistant alleles are highly diverse and susceptible alleles have low diversity bottom right of each panel Figure 1shows that allele specific overdominance the biological phenomenon of interest and population heterozygote advantage the finding of epidemiological studies such as those cited above are two different things Population heterozygote advantage black may be observed even when resistance is not overdominant but only dominant additive recessive or only underdominant as long as allele frequencies are sufficiently far toward the lower right of the parameter space high diversity of resistant alleles and low diversity of susceptible alleles Figure 1shows that this is possible under a fairly broad range of parameter combinations i e there are substantial black areas in the dominant additive and recessive panels The converse is also true though only in what seem to be very special circumstances That is even when allele specific overdominance holds it is possible that heterozygotes on average will do worse than homozygotes so population heterozygote advantage will not be observed This occurs with genotype frequencies sufficiently far toward the top left of Figure 1 with a high diversity of susceptible alleles and low diversity of resistant ones This occurs only rarely for the parameter values we have chosen most of the leftmost panel is black and this seems to be the case for a broad range of parameter values Although neither population heterozygote advantage nor allele specific overdominance implies the other the two phenomena are of course related Specifically the conditions to observe population heterozygote advantage are broadest when allele specific overdominance holds and become narrower as the underlying genetics becomes more different from overdominance of resistance dominance additivity recessiveness underdominance Two Examples The intuition behind our result that population heterozygote advantage need not reflect allele specific overdominance can be seen in two simple examples Example 1 Suppose that there are two alleles each at 50 frequency in the population one R conferring resistance and one S conferring susceptibility in the homozygous state Population heterozygote advantage will be observed if the probability of a favorable outcome for heterozygotes is greater than the arithmetic mean of the probabilities of favorable outcomes for RR homozygotes and for SS homozygotes In this situation population heterozygote advantage does not require overdominance but merely allele effects that are more than additive partial dominance Dominance of particular HLA alleles conferring resistance and or recessiveness of susceptibility poor outcome alleles have been documented for schistosomiasis 24 leprosy 25 acute lymphoblastic leukemia for which an infectious cause is hypothesized 26 and hepatitis B in this case the outcome was vaccine responsiveness 27 When allele frequencies are equal as in Example 1 partial dominance is sufficient to create population heterozygote advantage 10 11 When allele frequencies differ the conditions for population heterozygote advantage may become broader or narrower This can be seen in a second deliberately extreme example Example 2 Suppose there are 10 alleles each with frequency 5 each conferring resistance to a particular disease and one allele with frequency 50 conferring susceptibility In the notation of Table 1 this corresponds to p q 0 5 10 05 2 0 025 0 25 In this case 90 of homozygotes in the population will be homozygous for a susceptible allele since the frequency of SS homozygotes is 0 25 while the frequency of RR homozygotes is 0 025 In contrast 100 of heterozygotes will have at least one resistant allele In epidemiological terms this is a form of confounding in which possession of a resistant allele is positively associated with heterozygosity the exposure of interest and positively associated with having a favorable disease course the outcome of interest Because of this confounding under some parameter values population heterozygote advantage can occur even when heterozygotes are not at an advantage relative to their corresponding homozygotes Specifically population heterozygote advantage may be observed when resistance is additive heterozygotes have risks equal to the average of the risks of the corresponding homozygotes when resistance is recessive or even when it is underdominant heterozygotes have higher risk of disease than either corresponding homozygote Continuing this example suppose that the resistant alleles are recessive to the susceptible one so that individuals with one or two copies of the susceptible allele have favorable outcomes with probability 3 and individuals with two resistant alleles have favorable outcomes with probability 7 these assumptions correspond to x 0 3 a b 1 c d 2 33 In this example there are no SS heterozygotes since there is only one S allele SR heterozygotes make up 50 of the population 2 pq 0 5 while RR heterozygotes carrying two different R alleles make up p 2 0 225 22 5 of the population The probability of a favorable outcome for heterozygotes will be the weighted average of the probabilities of a favorable outcome for SR and RR heterozygotes using equation 1 For homozygotes using equation 2 the probability of a favorable outcome f hom will be the weighted average of the probabilities for SS homozygotes 25 of the population and for RR homozygotes 2 5 of the population Thus heterozygotes on average will be 1 26 times more likely to have a favorable outcome even though each heterozygote has the same outcome as if s he were homozygous for the worse of the two alleles s he carries In epidemiological terms heterozygotes would have a relative risk of 0 87 of an unfavorable outcome compared to homozygotes Both of these examples were chosen for the purposes of clarity rather than for precise reflection of the allele frequencies in real populations in particular few if any populations have a single HLA allele with a frequency of 50 Moreover we have simplified the effects of alleles into two categories resistant and susceptible R and S which are simply relative notions In fact real alleles will likely have a spectrum of effects ranging from highly resistant to highly susceptible with some alleles having no effect Note however that no effect is also a relative term and refers to an allele whose effect on disease outcome is close to the population average Discussion The foregoing examples show that the finding of population heterozygote advantage as in the infectious disease studies cited does not support an inference of allele specific overdominance the condition of primary interest as an immunological hypothesis and a mechanism for the maintenance of MHC diversity Put another way population heterozygote advantage may appear due to a combination of the two distinct mechanisms we defined in the Introduction the protective or detrimental effects of particular alleles R and S alleles in our model and the effects of heterozygosity itself The effects of R and S alleles appear as effects of heterozygosity vs homozygosity because heterozygotes and homozygotes will in general carry different distributions of S and R alleles thus in an analysis that fails to condition on the alleles carried heterozygosity is confounded with the alleles carried One advantage of correctly separating the effects of individual alleles from the effects of heterozygosity conditional on those alleles is that each of these measures is a characteristic of an individual rather than a population For example if genotypes XX XY and YY have relative risks 0 6 2 1 and 1 for clearance of a viral infection then this should hold true regardless of who else is in the population In contrast we have shown that population heterozygote advantage depends on not only the effects of individual genotypes on disease outcome but also on allele frequencies Therefore even if biological and epidemiologic mechanisms were identical in two populations but allele frequencies differed in those two populations it would be perfectly reasonable to find population heterozygote advantage in one but not the other The problem we have described with measuring population heterozygote advantage is not in principle limited to susceptibility resistance studies of infectious diseases In principle the same problem could occur in any study of HLA associations with disease outcome Interestingly however in our review of the literature on HLA chronic disease associations we have found no examples of the problem Moreover direct estimates of the allele specific effects of heterozygosity relative to the corresponding homozygotes nearly absent in the infectious disease HLA literature are frequently found in studies of HLA genotype and chronic mostly autoimmune diseases 28 29 30 We do not know the reason for this difference in approach but suspect that some infectious disease investigators informed by the evolutionary hypothesis of overdominance for infectious disease resistance and by animal studies may have a special interest in detecting effects of heterozygosity per se Many studies of HLA autoimmune disease associations on the other hand seem to focus more on the effects of individual alleles and having established these move on to investigate the dependence of these effects on genetic modifiers including the identity of the individual s other allele at the same locus We have shown that when allele specific overdominance exists it will often be manifest as population heterozygote advantage but that a finding of population heterozygote advantage may be consistent with other patterns of allele specific effects for example when resistant and susceptible alleles are equally common and equally diverse population heterozygote advantage will occur if allele specific effects are additive dominant or overdominant It is difficult to generalize without doing a specific epidemiologic study about how the prevalence and diversity of R and S alleles would be likely to occur in a given population O Brien et al 12 found a spectrum of estimated effects of Class I HLA alleles on HIV 1 disease progression and this spectrum seems visually to be roughly symmetric but further information would be required to determine plausible values of p or from these data One might expect the distribution to be skewed toward resistant alleles for diseases that have exerted long term selection on a population but it is difficult to make confident predictions about such patterns without detailed knowledge of host pathogen coevolution Our results do not deny that allele specific overdominance at HLA exists in human populations with respect to infectious disease resistance but simply raise doubts about the reliability of the major evidence that has been adduced in support of this phenomenon Existing data suggest that allele specific overdominance may exist in some animal infectious diseases but also that simple dominance and other outcomes are commonly observed 11 Several experimental studies have examined this question using single strain infections in animals and while suggestions of allele specific overdominance have been made none of the studies has been entirely convincing Doherty and Zinkernagel 20 demonstrated using congenic mice that MHC homozygotes had more vigorous immune responses to lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus LCMV than the corresponding homozygotes but since the pathology of the infection they used is due to the immune response the enhanced immune response actually resulted in reduced survival A study in mice of resistance to Toxoplasma gondii showed that F 1 offspring of two genetically divergent parent strains were more resistant than either parent strain but there seems to be no demonstration that heterozygosity at an MHC locus is responsible 18 while another reference 19 that has been cited 10 as showing overdominance at MHC in the same host pathogen system does not appear to address the question directly A study of Marek s disease virus in chickens seems to demonstrate allele specific overdominance at the MHC using defined genetic backgrounds but the report does not clearly specify how homogeneous the genetic background was in these experiments 21 From the perspective of the population genetics debate concerning the role of overdominance in maintaining polymorphism at the MHC we should note that this mechanism requires allele specific overdominance for total fitness not for resistance to individual diseases As noted by Doherty and Zinkernagel 4 simple dominance for resistance to each of several diseases can create allele specific overdominance for total fitness if different alleles confer resistance to different diseases 10 31 For these reasons our results while relevant to the longstanding debate over the relative importance of various kinds of balancing selection in maintaining MHC diversity 32 raise doubts about only one of several lines of evidence for the overdominance hypothesis Simple and accurate methods exist to determine for a single pair of alleles how the three possible genotypes 2 homozygotes and one heterozygote affect disease outcome and these methods have been used frequently in the literature on autoimmunity and HLA 28 29 30 and once to our knowledge in the HLA infectious disease literature 33 It is of additional interest for epidemiologists immunologists vaccine designers and evaluators and population geneticists to know whether HLA heterozygosity in general improves the immune response to and outcome of infectious diseases To answer this question in a meaningful way it will be necessary to develop improved methods that estimate the effect of heterozygosity while conditioning on the alleles involved Meanwhile findings of population heterozygote advantage should not be interpreted as confirming the mechanism of allele specific overdominance Competing interests None declared Authors contributions The methodological principles in this report grew out of discussions held by the three authors ML formulated the problem and drafted the manuscript which was edited and revised by CB and RA All authors read and approved the final manuscript Appendix In this appendix we prove that the relative risk defined in Equation 3 is increasing in p and and decreasing in As a preliminary result that will be useful later note that and Proof that the relative risk is increasing in p We must show that To do so we calculate By definition p and are each between zero and one and all of the parameters a b and c are positive and by assumption a b c Therefore therefore all terms in the partial derivative are positive so the relative risk is increasing in p QED Proof that relative risk is decreasing in Since RR f het f hom it is sufficient to show that the numerator f het is decreasing in and the denominator f hom is increasing in This is intuitively clear f het is the weighted average of the risk of individuals in the 2 nd 3 rd and 4 thcolumns of Table 1 increasing reduces the weight on the highest risk category the 4 thcolumn with risk cx thereby reducing the weighted average Similarly increasing increases the representation of RR homozygotes among homozygotes thereby increasing the average risk of homozygotes Formally first we show that f het is decreasing in namely that Taking the partial derivative and rearranging we find This is justified as follows The first term is positive by defnition Inside the curly brackets in the penultimate line above we have the sum of two terms each of which itself is the product of a nonpositive term and a nonnegative term thus the curly brackets are nonpositive Specifically and are both nonpositive because we assumed a b c 1 p 2 is nonnegative as noted at the beginning of the appendix The term in curly brackets is nonpositive and the term outside is positive so the whole expression is nonpositive as stated It is apparent by inspection that the denominator of the relative risk f hom is increasing in Since the numerator of the relative risk is nonincreasing in and the denominator of the relative risk is increasing the relative risk is decreasing in The argument that the relative risk is increasing in is exactly symmetric to the argument for
