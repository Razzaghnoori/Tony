                uh what do you   how do you feel about it   well i dont know i would hate i would rather not have to have it all taken out but i kind of feel like its part of living in a free country  but it seems like they take quite a bit out   uh im a tax lawyer  and uh i uh   oh yeah   but i agree with you i uh   yeah you probably know like i say youre a lot more knowledgeable about it than i am but do you do for corporations or mainly   i umhum yeah corporations i work for a bank   yeah oh do you oh   yeah and uh and   so what what do they think the corporation you work with   um well banks banks are regulated of course by the uh by the federal government anyway so   yeah uhhuh   we dont have the franchise taxes which are are not federal taxes uh   yeah   i dont know i i think they i dont hear anything at work about them really   yeah well i tell you i i work for a credit union so that might be a whole another topic as far as well you know how do   oh okay   whats the opinion around there about uh you know credit unions not being taxed and stuff do they do have you guys had any i dont want to say battles but do they uh a lot of people around here in Utah and stuff they they claim the unfair unfair uh unfair playing field and whatnot and whether or not credit unions are getting you know being treated special and do they get   weve had that too because of the failures though   oh yeah   and uh whether or not they should be assessed more   uhhuh   and uh the the state has uh has uh is in the midst of a reform probably in that area   its where theyre going to tax credit unions on a state level or or just assess their more for the insurance fund   or or higher assessment to yeah right   huh yeah its uh i dont know i want i think ive always felt that if we credit unions stick to their little niche they have that then it probably shouldnt be but it seems like more and more uh were getting out into a lot of the bank territories i do not know if it is too fair or not   uh i dont know that it is fair i think that its you know the way banking is being uh compacted i work for at Nations Bank which has just merged with C and S Sovran   yeah yeah oh yeah   and uh you know i think i think a little competition is good   yeah   uh   but   but down here a lot we saw  we say them doing things they shouldnt be doing   yeah they getting into business lending and things like that or yeah i the credit union i work for is one of the top the twenty uh about the fifteenth largest and we are starting to get into that and that is where i really have my questions as to whether or not were   yeah real estate   you know if they were able were playing on a level field whereas the banks are getting taxed and stuff   yeah   and i dont know what the corporate taxes are as far as how much they get taxed but i mean i know it would have to it would definitely have to effect our bottom line if we got taxed theres no doubt about it   everybodys gone down i think the individual levels are fine   uhhuh   uh i dont think theyre perceived as uh was i learned in school if you taxed a hundred percent of the income of people that made over a hundred thousand dollars you know   uhhuh   uh we wouldnt reduce the deficit by   yeah   but but a drop in the bucket because there are such few people that do that   yeah well what do you have have you ever studied i guess anything about a flat tax or anything like that i mean weve talked about it and how it kind be kind of a recessive tax for the poor or   well thats what sales tax are   yeah thats true but i mean on more of a national level i guess it seems like it might uh get rid of a lot of the problems as far as the loop holes and stuff but maybe just have it based on two or three different level and eliminate a lot of the exemptions and stuff is that   that uh flat taxes i think are a pretty good idea uh theyre debating of course right now whether to bring in capital gains again uh to stimulate the economy   uhhuh yeah   and uh find from what i from what i recall it doesnt stimulate the economy that much it just uh boots everybodys feeling about stimulating the economy   yeah thats more or less touchyfeely thing as opposed to   yeah   yeah i just always heard that the poor would end end up taking the worst brunt of it because theyre you know their their income is less and yet theyre being taxed at the same rate and therefore it hurts their spending power but you know ive heard different ideas to where they will make it so that uh you know depending on your income that itll be maybe a different level of tax but seems like then people would just do whatever they could to hide income so like you say it probably wouldnt do much anyway   the i i what happens is i think it is a good idea but they chip away at it i mean the home mortgage deduction is like sacrosanct   umhum yeah thats true   you cant take away people that said there you go youve got one exception already and uh and uh it you know well if we didnt have this exception then well just add this one and it just gets it snowballs     yeah thats true yeah uhhuh   i i think it is in theory probably a good idea   well uh are the taxes in in Texas are they are few state taxes very high or   we dont have state income tax   oh dont you oh thats sweet   none but weve got an eight percent state sales tax   oh that hurts   yeah and uh you know course thats thats a regressive tax   yeah it is   and its you know uh       uh its not on grocery
