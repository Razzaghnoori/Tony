 Clinton s Kid Stuff The Toughest Job in the World produced by Young Rubicam Inc for the Advertising Council Inc The Coalition for America s Children PSAs The Toughest Job in the World gives us a different Bill Clinton This isn t a politician trying to shrug off the shroud of scandal This is a hard working man an engaged parent trying to do the best he can in a world where the odds are stacked up against him and others like him The issues the spot focuses on children their education and development are what the public really cares about say the polls The picture it presents of Clinton as father as promoter of family and community values is one that the White House has been trying to push for at least a year As Clinton s luck would have it Madison Avenue and big media have partnered to extend the president s re election themes of family and community at no cost to him These ads created by the nonprofit Ad Council will be run free on television radio and in print as part of a public service campaign on behalf of children And this flagship 60 second spot does at least as much to promote the president s family values image as it does to jump start that public service campaign Recalling the Dick Morris Bob Squier spots for the 96 election this one opens with Clinton at a podium complete with waving flag It moves on to shots of oil paintings of Lincoln and Washington implying that these men like Clinton who s doing the voice over were also charged with doing the toughest job in the world The consequences of failure Clinton tells us could be serious Cresting around that portentous pronouncement our expectations are confounded by what comes next The job in question isn t the presidency Clinton tells us It s being a parent Appropriately the camera no longer focuses on the president alone A home video style shot of him with wife Hillary and daughter Chelsea who s clearly going to be seen more in the second term than in the first is followed by one of the first lady seen next to the president talking of drugs and all the other pressures facing our children The ensuing images and words evoke two of her favorite themes a wider investment in our children it takes a village stupid and the importance of reading one of her and the administration s major education initiatives Shots of a politically correct mix of kids of a mother with her teen age daughter of an adult reading to a youngster are followed by a series that shows the first couple interacting with the children on whose behalf they are crusading Where the first set of shots was in black and white the second is in vibrant color the aim being of course to equate involvement with warmth The first lady speaks of the 350 wonderful organizations that have come together to help parents raise good kids an idea that infuriates ideologues on the right especially when it comes from Hillary Her husband speaking to the camera and via voice over invites viewers to help This isn t just about parents doing the best they can everyone young adults and seniors alike can make a difference An e mail address and a phone number invite viewers to take up the gauntlet and become involved The images of the president and the first lady together of their obvious bond speak volumes about their commitment to family values What would have been powerful in an explicitly political ad is even more powerful in an ostensibly nonpolitical context For Clinton this kind of image making couldn t have come at a better time The scandals aside he was recently attacked in an Atlantic Monthly article about the adverse effects of welfare reform on kids The author Peter Edelman was once Clinton s top advisor on the issue Edelman s wife was responsible for bringing Hillary Clinton onto the board of the Children s Defense Fund This spot leaves little doubt that Bill Clinton like the coalition for which he is speaking is fighting for the children that he s trying to do well at the toughest job in the world It might also help him do better for himself Robert Shrum
