 Intriguing Disenchantment Dear Chris Yeah right a lot of Velvet Underground a lot of Hendrix And occasionally they d kick back with some Milton Babbitt or that guy Ornette Coleman stole all his ideas from If history is written by the winners is rock history written by the losers By wounded fans correcting popular slights redeeming ignored heroes Miller gets his most contentious in the Velvet Underground chapter when he challenges critic David Fricke s statement that the Velvets were exiled from the mainstream greeted with almost total rejection No says Miller the Velvets debut had an instant impact going on to peak at No 171 on Billboard s album chart He then spins this not especially supportive datum think how many fewer records were released in 1967 by saying how it should be compared not with the sales of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones but with those of minimalist composer La Monte Young whose influence via violist John Cale the Velvets brought to rock n roll This has got to be some of the most tortured logic I ve ever seen Why can t he just say the Velvets were a great hugely influential cult band Maybe he didn t want to recycle the line about how few bought their records but everyone who did formed a band As I skim Flowers in the Dustbin for fresh anecdotes which we agree may be the book s real pleasure I realize how many of Miller s vignettes seem chosen with an eye to 90s academic interests gender thanatos whiteness studies Not too shocking given his day job but sometimes these pieces of evidence seem pretty chimerical other times just hilarious For instance did you know That the Beatles singular revolution in rock sensibility was camp and that this was achieved through the intersection of the band s alienated look and impresario Brian Epstein s longing gaze a reverie of young lads in leather That the original lyrics of Tutti Frutti were not just off color but full of as Miller puts it thinly veiled anal eroticism And that Little Richard didn t shop that song to labels because he wanted to be a straight blues singer and Tutti Frutti was too queer That not just Wynonie Harris and Louis Jordan but also sax legend Lester Young got their starts with black minstrel shows That the strict grammarian Pat Boone made a point of introducing his Fats Domino cover in concerts as Isn t That a Shame And that because he was so proud of his Ivy League education he posed on the campus of Columbia for his first album cover That when he was playing with La Monte Young John Cale was given LSD pot and opium to help him sustain a note on his viola for two hours at a stretch Do you believe this Such apocrypha is the envy of any popular historian and it s definitely a major selling point for Miller s book It also serves to make Miller seem a lot more with it than he might otherwise You re right that Flowers is a personal project Miller says as much in the preface beginning with his magical discovery of rock back in 1956 and going on to share his eventual disenchantment with this routinized package of theatrical gestures in the 80s This puts him in an odd if touching state for a critical endeavor Intrigued by his own disenchantment as elusive a mind set as I ve ever heard he decides to figure it all out to clarify the cultural essence of rock and roll Others might have just got into gardening Re The Pretenders Are you sure you aren t thinking of say Precious with its fuck off line or Tattooed Love Boys with Hynde s quip I shot my mouth off And you showed me what that hole was for Both a bit edgier than Brass in Pocket no Yours Chris
