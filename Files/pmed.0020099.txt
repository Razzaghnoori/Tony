                    A World of Contrasts        Medical students today enter a profession defined by stark contrasts In developed        countries public health improvements have nearly doubled life expectancy in the last        century and sophisticated technology and innovative research hold the promise of longer        and higher quality life At the same time lifethreatening infectious diseases such as        tuberculosis and malaria continue to affect billions of people and a rapidly escalating        HIVAIDS pandemic now kills more than  people each day  New drugs are being        developed at a record pace but only about  of drugs that reach the market are aimed at        treating neglected diseases such as kalaazar Chagas disease and sleeping sickness        even though these account for over  of the global disease burden  Both within and        between countries the gap between wealthy and poor has continued to grow leading to        widening disparities in health outcomes        Despite these contrasts physiciansintraining around the globein rich and poor        countrieshave a common goal we seek the skills and knowledge to improve the health of        individuals and populations as we devote ourselves to a career of service The        transformative quest to become a physician imbues the learner with insights from within and        outside the profession of medicine As medical students we hold ourselves accountable to        our patients and we critically evaluate the state of our profession as we see it with new        eyes        This issue of         PLoS Medicine heralds the start of the Student Forum section a space        where medical students from across the world can exchange ideas about the critical issues        affecting health and health care from their unique perspective It is appropriate then in        this inaugural Student Forum that we consider some of the key issues of information        exchange in the context of global disease and medical education How do we access        information How is that information shaped and influenced How can we shape the content of        the debate                    Open Access to the Medical Literature Critical for Our Future        As physiciansintraining we appreciate that the medicine we will practice will differ        from that practiced by our predecessors Mastery of access to information now trumps        mastery of facts and we enter an era of medical practice that will develop synergistically        with biomedical research Our generation of physicians will face the daunting task of        translating an exploding body of biomedical and clinical research into medical practice        This task increasingly relies not only on the ability to access all the available medical        literature but on the ability to mine and synthesize it PLoS represents one of a number        of possible approaches toward ensuring free and open access to the worlds literature         and students should be at the forefront of this movement        As the democratization of access brings developed and developing countries together the        very content of the research published should follow suit Too often the thoughts and        opinions of those in the rich world have dominated research agendas and the content of        medical journals For example less than  of articles published in the six leading        tropical medicine journals in  were generated exclusively by scientists from        developing countries  Bringing the entire world of learners into a global conversation        should be accompanied by a shift in editorial priorities to ensure that medical journals        inform practice in a way that offers the greatest benefits to those suffering the greatest        burdens                    The Influence of the Pharmaceutical Industry        Journal editors and publishers pride themselves on publishing highquality research        subjected to rigorous peer review Indeed this model has contributed to significant        advances in the standards for clinical investigation and rightly drives much of clinical        practice However without the least bit of acknowledged irony medical journals have begun        publishing articles about how pharmaceutical industry advertising and marketing drives        clinical practice in nonrational ways while at the same time publishing the very        advertisements they critique        The American Medical Student Association AMSA which has entered into a formal        partnership with         PLoS Medicine  accepts no pharmaceutical industry funding and encourages        its members to eschew the industry largess through its PharmFree initiative        wwwamsaorgprofpharmfreecfm Similar initiatives are afoot in medical student        organizations around the world as we consider appropriate relationships with industry        Surely it is time that journals examine the content of their pages and stop serving as        vehicles through which physician practice is influenced by industry         PLoS Medicine is the first major international general medical journal to        refuse to advertise medical drugs or devices  We hope that other major journals will        follow suit                    The Need for Student Ideals and Ideas        Throughout the world students represent the leading edge of social change Indeed Paulo        Freire one of the most influential educational thinkers of the late th century        describes education as the practice of freedom as learners continuously work to        integrate action and reflection in a spiral of deepening connections This process of        integration is rooted in a deepseated longing for the possible informed by the lived        experience of the painful Nowhere is this more true than in medicine where the suffering        of our patients underpins our scientific inquiry our clinical development and our        personal growth as healers        As we students learn medicine we begin to ask hard questions about the proximaland the        distalcauses of our patients suffering The reductionistic logic of medical education        offers only false comfort and only to those who content themselves with pathways and        receptors Learners want to understand what led to the derangement of the pathway of the        receptor Genes Environmental factors Economics In asking we bring a sense of        possibility of hope to the process What         could be What tools do we need to address these broader causes And we        hope that thinking about these questions from a students view may offer our senior        colleagues a chance to reflect on their own work as physicians and their own place in our        world        We hope this space emerges as a vibrant source of student energy and passion grounded        in evidence accountable to the patients who will entrust their care to us and reflecting        the hope we have for the future of medicine                    Toward the Future        As we come together from three continents to inaugurate the Student Forum in         PLoS Medicine  we are committed to ensuring that this section of the        journal remains a source of vigorous debate and thoughtful analysis The section will        initially be published quarterly and will contain essays of up to  words that address        any healthrelated issue from a medical student perspective see Box         The         PLoS Medicine medical student advisory group which currently has        representatives from the American Medical Student Association the Indian Medical Students        Organization and the European Medical Students Association will be involved in selecting        and editing essays for publication        The Student Forum will be freely available for all to read and critique free from        inappropriate financial interests and committed to the drive toward justice that student        ideals embody We look forward to helping shape this forum in the best traditions of free        exchange and we look forward to collaboration with our senior colleagues to hold us to        these standards
