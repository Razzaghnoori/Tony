 Background The G C content of a genome and the codon usage of its genes are determined by selection and mutation pressures 1 Because these evolutionary processes are characteristic of each species the sequences belonging to a genome share a common pattern of composition of bases codons and oligonucleotides 2 3 making it possible to identify laterally transferred genes LTGs as those whose features are atypical for a particular genome Thus genes displaying atypical composition or vocabulary are inferred to be alien and to carry features of their previous genome 4 However it is thought that only recently acquired genes would be detected by this approach because sequences quickly adjust to their new genome pattern Since the inception of these approaches it has been noted that alien genes tend to display lower G C contents than their new host genome 4 5 6 7 M digue et al 5 analyzed the codon usage of the genes of Escherichia coli using a multivariate analysis and found that the genome can be separated into three gene classes according to codon usage The first class corresponds to highly expressed genes the second to weakly expressed genes and the third to genes with unknown function insertion sequences IS phage and genes possibly related to virulence and antibiotic resistance Therefore this last class has been interpreted as the class of genes recently acquired by horizontal transfer The fact that recently acquired genes all group together in this analysis implies that they are relatively homogeneous in their codon usage Although not pointed out by M digue et al 5 this result is surprising because these genes are thought to have been acquired through several independent events from different species and therefore should display very different codon usage patterns and be separated by the analysis Other methods based on compositional analysis often show the same result that is recently acquired genes tend to share characteristics such as codon usage and G C content 4 6 It has thus been argued that the methods used to identify LTGs are unable to detect genes acquired from donors having similar base composition and that the amount of LTGs although representing a substantial fraction of the genome following their predictions is yet highly underestimated 4 8 Moreover as noted by Lawrence and Ochman 4 Since base composition is conserved within and among related lineages genes with anomalous features are likely to have been acquired recently from distantly related organisms and genes displaying atypical composition are indeed usually interpreted as such 4 9 10 11 12 In this view gene exchanges would be very frequent not only between species but among orders or phyla Indeed base composition would hardly allow identification of a gene acquired from Salmonella in the E coli genome despite the fact that these bacteria may have diverged 100 million years ago Such reasoning relies upon the untested postulate that these genes carry the mark of a previous host genome It is well known however that some elements or regions of bacterial and eukaryotic genomes show systematic and probably persistent compositional differences to the rest of the genome This has been shown for transposable elements viruses and plasmids 13 14 and for the region of the replication terminus in numerous bacteria 15 Therefore the observed peculiarities of LTGs may represent rather than a previous genome context the mark of a particular lifestyle or local effect acting on the gene Here we address these problems by studying the codon usage and base composition of recently acquired genes detected by an approach based on complete genome comparisons We show that recently acquired genes tend to have a composition that is shifted toward A T compared to their hosts even in A T rich genomes This suggests that LTGs detected by compositional methods are not highly underestimated We moreover show that the hypothesis of an adaptation to a previous genome context hardly explains the codon and base composition of these alien genes Therefore we propose that peculiar evolutionary pressures acting on these genes are responsible for their atypical composition Hence the large majority of LTGs detected by compositional approaches do not necessarily originate in distant organisms Results Transfers or losses We inferred the numbers of gene acquisitions and losses using the method described in Figure 1and in the Materials and methods section Figure 2shows the number of lost and acquired genes estimated for each group of genomes considered Because of the stringency of the BLAST criteria used these numbers are possibly underestimates However they give information about the dynamics of the different genomes In all cases the number of acquired genes is higher than the number of genes losses in the branch of the sister grouping This allows interpretation of genes unique to a lineage as recent gains rather than two independent losses In contrast we cannot exclude the possibility that some inferred gene losses correspond to independent gene acquisition although the probability of two independent acquisitions of the same gene is difficult to estimate In most cases the number of acquired genes is higher than the number of lost genes in the same branch Two phenomena not mutually exclusive may explain these differences an increase in the size of the genome this is probably the case for the pathogenic E coli strains as their genomes contain many more genes than the K12 strain and a high turnover of acquired genes in the genome Indeed the complete sequence represents a snapshot of the genome in which many of the recently acquired genes may be destined to disappear quickly while the lost genes detected by the method have been conserved during relatively long periods of time in the two other lineages Figure 3 Most of the acquired genes have no known functions though a few are annotated as membrane proteins phages or IS In the following results the genes from these two last classes will appear in the phages and IS classes rather that in the LTG class The codon usage of LTGs comparison with native genes We computed four independent factorial correspondence analyses FCA on the genes of each type native and transferred genes IS and phages for the four species E coli O157 H7 Helicobacter pylori Salmonella enterica and Streptococcus pneumoniae Figure 4shows the projection of the genes and the codons on the two first axes for E coli Salmonella S pneumoniae and H pylori The codons have been labeled according to their third position In each case native genes and LTG form distinct groups MANOVA test p 10 4 In E coli and Salmonella the codon projections reveal that the first axis was principally due to G C content the laterally transferred genes being A T rich This analysis shows that the criterion used by M digue et al 5 probably allows identification of most of the recent LTG as only a few LTG detected independently from codon usage are in the native genes cloud These last genes may therefore display the codon usage of a closely related species or strain In Helicobacter the same pattern is observed but with a stronger opposition of A ending and C ending codons In Streptococcus the A T3 C G3 separation appeared principally on the second axis In each case the ATA codon isoleucine is systematically separated from the others on the first axis suggesting that in all cases this codon is over represented in LTGs compared to native genes Two other codons show a similar pattern AGA and except in H pylori AGG the two coding for arginine These three codons seem to be the principal ones leading to the separation between native and transferred genes in these analyses Table 1shows the relative frequencies of the codons of isoleucine I and arginine R for all the native and transferred genes IS and phages for each species In enterobacteria the native genes generally avoid the three codons ATA AGA and AGG while the transferred genes show little or no codon bias for the corresponding amino acids This is also true in Streptococcus although the AGA codon seems to be rather over represented in LTGs This codon is even more frequent in Helicobacter LTGs A few genes undetected as LTGs by our method are however localized in the cloud of points of the transferred genes The functions of these genes indicated that they could indeed be transferred genes acquired before the divergence of the genomes considered We found for example membrane proteins related to the virulence or secretory systems In Streptococcus and Helicobacter we found restriction enzymes and transcription regulators Interestingly among these genes we identified a gene coding a ribosomal protein RPS14 in Helicobacter On the basis of phylogenetic analysis this peculiar gene has been shown to be subject to extensive lateral gene transfer in the proteobacteria group and could be involved in antibiotic resistance 16 Comparisons among species Figure 5shows the first two axes of an FCA performed on the four species All the figures can be superimposed but they have been separated according to gene classes native genes transferred genes and IS Figure 5dshows the projection of the codons on the same axes Phages are not represented because they are absent from the Helicobacter and Streptococcus genomes For a given species each class of genes is represented by ellipses that enclose 90 of the points A MANOVA shows that all groups are significantly coherent and different from each other p 10 4 This confirms that LTGs in a species tend to use a relatively similar codon usage The separation on the first axis is mainly due to the base composition that is A T rich and G C rich codons Figure 5d The center of each ellipse is indicated by a color point The arrows show the displacement observed relative to the position of the native gene ellipses Transferred genes are systematically displaced in the direction of A T rich codons The IS ellipses display a similar shift toward A T rich codons However although LTGs from different species show a tendency to group together they tend to have codon usages comparable to their host genomes The base composition of LTGs We computed the base composition of each gene class for the different species The G C content of LTGs is significantly lower than the native genes Mann Whitney test p 10 4 at each codon position and particularly at the third G C3 Figure 6 This result is unexpected especially for Streptococcus and Helicobacter which have low G C content 35 and 41 G C3 respectively Thus whatever the base composition of a genome the acquired genes are more A T rich than their host genome Moreover when it was possible to measure the amount of lost genes that is in enterobacteria we have found that they also tend to be more A T rich than the genome Mann Whitney test p 10 4 results not shown suggesting a greater turnover of A T rich genes Selection on the different classes of genes Figure 7shows the relative neutrality plot RNP for each gene class in E coli O157 H7 As expected for genes undergoing strong selection pressures native genes show a low slope in the regression plots 0 241 r 2 0 212 The most recent LTGs display the highest slope 0 568 r 2 0 446 followed by more ancient LTGs 0 451 r 2 0 553 suggesting that the base composition of nonsynonymous sites in LTG is mainly the result of mutational pressures and hence that their amino acid composition is exceptionally affected by the constraints acting on the nucleotide sequence It is interesting to note that in native genes A T rich genes tend to show a higher slope for the regression plot suggesting that these genes might be LTGs acquired before the divergence of the considered genomes Phages display a correlation slope close to that of native genes 0 3 r 2 0 392 indicating that they are undergoing stronger selective pressure than LTGs The correlation for plasmid genes of E coli available in GenBank 17 shows a slope similar to that of phages 0 288 r 2 0 301 Surprisingly the IS showed no correlation r 2 0 001 indicating that G C3 is independent of G C1 and G C2 in the IS We carried out the same analysis on other species and found similar results data not shown In Salmonella the higher slope of the correlation for LTGs 0 408 r 2 0 593 compared with 0 269 r 2 0 288 for native genes as well as the absence of correlation for IS was also found indicating that these results are neither artifacts nor limited to E coli The same tendencies are observed in Helicobacter and Streptococcus although not always significant as a result of the low number of LTGs detected Sueoka 18 19 has computed the RNP for a representative sample of bacteria all species together and showed that G C12 and G C3 are correlated among bacterial genomes with a slope of 0 25 Hence the slope for genes recently acquired from indiscriminate bacterial species is expected to be 0 25 We have confirmed this prediction by randomly selecting bacterial genes in GenBank 17 release 130 From the RNP the slope of the correlation is always close to 0 3 data not shown even when filtering for A T rich sequences It thus appears that the correlation observed in the LTGs detected by our method is incompatible with the hypothesis that these genes display the compositional features of typical components from other bacterial genomes In particular the amino acid composition of LTG appears to be anomalously determined by base composition even in comparison to genes of organisms having extreme A T bias Discussion The A T richness of the transferred genes The tendency of LTGs to be A T rich has already been noted by several authors in species having intermediate G C contents 4 5 7 However these results were based on compositional analysis and have been interpreted as a limitation of the methods Our results clearly show that LTG tend to be more A T rich than their new host genomes and that the compositional methods do not overlook many of them The same phenomenon is observed for species having medium enterobacteria and low H pylori and S pneumoniae G C content This striking pattern raises questions about the nature and the source of these LTGs For example Lawrence and Ochman 4 hypothesized that the recently transferred genes were adapted to the genomic context of other distant species however our results would suggest either that the donor genomes are always more A T rich than the acceptor genomes or that there is a bias toward the internalization of A T rich exogenous DNA in the genome Foreign DNA may indeed encounter a physical barrier when entering the cell if for example restriction enzymes tend to have G C rich target sites When analyzing the base content of restriction enzyme target sites in REBASE 20 we have found that after removing redundancy they indeed present a G C content higher than 70 on average data not shown Since G C poor genomes have LTGs with lower G C content than G C rich genomes this predicts a positive correlation between the G C content of a genome and of the target sites of its restriction enzymes Only a few species have sufficient fully characterized restriction enzymes to test this hypothesis However E coli and H pylori each contain about 200 fully annotated restriction enzymes and the average G C content of their target sites is 73 and 60 respectively It is therefore possible that restriction enzymes have a role in determining the G C content of LTGs But this hypothesis is not sufficient to explain the observed pattern of base composition across species The mechanism of gene transfer often implicates the intervention of IS and phages which are known to be biased towards A T 13 It is therefore possible that the use of such vectors influences the base composition of the LTGs However both the FCA and the G C content analyses suggest that IS and phages are less biased in their base composition than other LTGs The source of LTGs in bacteria LTGs possess a composition that seems principally determined by mutation as shown by the RNP This bias is not found in other classes of gene such as native IS or phage genes This might suggest that LTGs are not true open reading frames ORFs However even if most of these genes have no known functions or homologs we find that their codon usage is close to genes implicated in virulence antibiotic resistance and secretory systems implying that they may be functional Moreover Alimi et al 21 have shown that at least some of the orphan genes in E coli are indeed transcribed The comparisons with randomly selected genes in GenBank using RNP shows that LTGs do not have the expected characteristics of genes adapted to previous genome contexts even if only A T rich sequences are able to enter the cell Moreover it is very unlikely that these characteristics emerged since their insertion in their new genome Indeed while showing differences in gene content the two E coli O157 H7 strains for instance are virtually identical at the nucleotide level for the remainder of their genomes The LTGs could not have undergone sufficient mutational pressure in such a short period of time They more likely represent genes that are either adapted to or carry the marks of frequent lateral transfers Their A T richness tends to classify them with phages and other mobile elements 13 However the RNP suggests that LTGs undergo low selection pressure on the protein sequence compared to these elements Interestingly phages have been shown to carry ORFs named morons because they add more DNA to the phage genome which often have unknown functions but are thought to occasionally confer benefit to the host when the prophage is integrated in its genome 22 These genes undergo high mutation and nonhomologous recombination rates and often display high A T content even in comparison to the phage itself 22 23 Most LTGs fit this description and may therefore have been introduced into the genome by phages Moreover this may explain why most of these genes are orphans as frequent nonhomologous recombination may preclude the recognition of homologs The current knowledge of bacteriophage diversity is still extremely limited 24 and this lack may also explain our failure to find homologs of these genes Indeed the vast majority of bacteriophages being still unknown they might represent an enormous reservoir of such genes Some of the morons have been shown to be related to other bacterial genes suggesting that they may at first have been host genes integrated in the phage genome 22 These genes may then have diverged rapidly because phages are known to have evolutionary rates orders of magnitude higher than those of bacteria 25 Morons seem rarely to confer a direct advantage on the phage but rather stabilize the host prophage interaction by slightly increasing host fitness 20 Therefore they may undergo weaker selection pressure than genes directly involved in the phage life cycle and be more sensitive to the mutational bias inherent to parasitic sequences 13 From our results it appears that whatever the nature of the organism in which the gene was first recruited its compositional characteristics no longer represent its previous genome context Although these genes seem to have a high turnover in the genome it is likely that when proved useful to the cell they establish a long lasting association with their new host Thus while moron accretion has been proposed as a key mechanism of phage evolution 22 this process may also contribute to some extent to the evolution of bacterial genomes and to their adaptation to new habitats In this view phages could be considered as a powerful way of inventing new genes potentially beneficial to their hosts Thus although bacterial genomes tend to acquire large amounts of DNA we have shown that those transferred genes have very peculiar features that do not denote a previous genomic context but connect them with parasitic sequences such as phages The genes involved in such lateral transfer obviously do not belong to classes of genes that encode typical cellular pathways Hence though the differences in content between closely related genomes have been extensively cited as evidence for constant exchanges with distant relatives these sequences carry no evidence for such exchanges Therefore attempts to use codon usage of an LTG as an indication of their phylogenetic origin should be considered with caution Materials and methods Inferring recent acquisitions and losses by parsimony The availability of sequenced bacterial genomes allows comparison of the gene content between closely related species and thus the finding of very recently acquired genes in the genomes using parsimony analysis Figure 1describes the ideal case of three closely related species A B and C for which the genomes are sequenced and the phylogenetic relationships known Three scenarios can explain the presence in species A of a gene which is absent in species B and C first the gene was present in the common ancestor of the species A B and C and has then been independently lost in species B and C second the gene has been acquired by the common ancestor of species A and B and then lost in species B and third the gene has been recently acquired by species A The last hypothesis is the most parsimonious explanation if one considers that the acquisition of a gene is at least as probable as a loss A possible verification that this hypothesis is realistic is to estimate the number of apparent gene losses Indeed the absence in species A of a gene present in species B and C can be interpreted as the loss of the gene in species A or two independent acquisitions in species B and C Note that apparent gene losses in A may be overestimated if recombination occur frequently between B and C that is acquisition of genes by B and C is not independent however the effect of such a recombination event is probably low in the present cases see Genomes section These estimations of acquisition and losses can be made for species A and B We identified genes acquired by species A after the divergence of species A and B case A B C in Figure 1 by making a BLASTP 28 query of the protein sequences more than 50 amino acids long in genome A against those in B and C Proteins having no match with a bit score 10 of the bit score of the query protein against itself were considered as being recently acquired in species A We identified gene losses by species A after the divergence of species A and B case A B C in Figure 1 by making a BLASTP query of the protein sequences more than 50 amino acids long in genome B against those in A and C Figure 1 A protein was considered as recently lost in species A if it had no match in species A same criterion as before and at least one match in species C bit score higher than 50 of the bit score of the protein against itself To avoid problems due to possible gene misannotations these results were verified using a BLASTN query Genomes To use the method described above it is important to have at least three complete sequenced genomes that are closely related with unambiguous phylogenetic relationships For this purpose we used five closely related genomes in the enterobacteria group E coli O157 H7 EDL933 11 E coli O157 H7 Saka 29 E coli K12 30 Salmonella enterica 31 and S typhimurium LT2 10 three closely related genomes in the alpha proteobacteria group Helicobacter pylori J99 32 H pylori 26695 33 and Campylobacter jejunii 34 and three closely related genomes in the Streptococcus genus S pneumoniae R6 35 S pneumoniae TIGR4 36 and S pyogenes 12 We considered as unambiguous the relationships between these bacteria because for example the orthologous genes of the two strains of E coli O157 H7 are almost identical at the nucleotide level while they show noticeable differences from E coli K12 data not shown This suggests that since their divergence the two strains of E coli O157 H7 have undergone only a few recombination events with more distant strains The same reasoning has been applied in the other cases In the group of enterobacteria it was possible to classify transferred genes relative to their date of acquisition in the three strains of E coli Thus we identified transferred genes acquired before the separation of the two strains O157 H7 ancient transfers and those acquired in one of the two strains O157 H7 after their separation recent transfers Gene classes On the basis of sequence annotations we have removed genes related to IS and prophages from the different classes of genes defined using the method described below Genes from each class that is native genes potentially transferred genes LTG IS and phages of the four groups of bacterial genomes Escherichia Salmonella Helicobacter and Streptococcus were then retained for codon usage analysis when their lengths were greater than 150 base pairs bp to avoid artifacts linked to stochastic variations that might happen in shorter genes Factorial correspondence analysis on codon usage To compute our FCA on gene codon composition we used absolute codon frequencies without considering the three stop codons or the ATG and TGG codons which are not degenerate We thus obtained a matrix consisting of 59 columns corresponding to the 59 degenerate codons and as many rows as sequences analyzed Such a matrix can be used in a FCA which is a multivariate analysis often used to study codon usage 2 5 14 37 38 It allows one to calculate the position of sequences in a multidimensional space with respect to their codon usage and to give a graphical representation of the dimensions maximizing their dispersion Genes having similar codon usage are hence regrouped The analysis being symmetrical makes it possible to represent the codons in the same space as the one used to visualize the genes which allows identification of those responsible for the clustering of the genes We used ADE 4 software package 39 to perform the FCA presented in this study To avoid statistical bias due to the differences in numbers of sequences composing each category we randomly selected 200 genes among the native genes and 200 among the transferred genes when their number was greater than this value for the intraspecific species analysis When the number of phages and IS was greater than 50 we randomly selected 50 sequences in the phage and IS categories For the same reason in analysis gathering the four species we randomly selected 100 genes among the native genes and 100 among the transferred genes The numbers of transferred genes in the different strains of S pneumoniae and H pylori were approximately 100 so the entire sets were used Ten independent selections of genes were performed to guarantee the reproducibility of the results Relative neutrality plots RNPs The strength of the selection on a given gene relative to the mutation pressure can be estimated by the method of the relative neutrality plot RNP which gives indications on how neutral a coding sequence can be considered 18 19 The method consists of plotting the G C content at the constrained or nonsynonymous positions that is first and second positions of the codons against the G C content at the relaxed or synonymous position that is third position The slope of the resulting linear correlation gives evidence on how the protein sequence is affected by the mutational bias acting on the nucleotide sequence and thus on how strongly the selection pressure acting on the protein can counteract this bias Note that the effect measured is relative to the translational selection acting on the third position of codons and that the strength of this pressure is supposed to be weak compared to the selection on the protein sequence The slope is expected to be equal to one if the protein sequences are under no selective constraints and to decrease with the strength of the selection acting at the protein level Translational selection is also expected to reduce the correlation though to a lower extent For this study we analyzed the correlations according to different gene classes to determine whether there were differences in the relative selection pressures in each of the classes All the correlations presented here are highly significant p 0 0001 except when stated Additional data files A list of the acquired genes in three groups of closely related bacteria as estimated by the method
