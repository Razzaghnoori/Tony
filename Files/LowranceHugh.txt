 Few people are fortunate enough to be able to pinpoint life changing events Fortunately I m able to to pinpoint one that happened to me because it happened in the recent history of my life It happened to me in in 1993 To give you a little bit of brief history I came out of the 80s like a lot of people did kind of floundering trying to figure out some new directions I d been through a lot of violent up and down swings and created peaks and valleys in my financial life and emotional life and course I m sure my my mental frame but everything settled down and I was going along had a good job was dating a lady Just enjoying life in general had a wonderful relationship with my two precious daughters One of my hobbies vices pleasures was playing tennis I played tennis out at Charlotte Tennis Club I ve been a member out there for quite some time primarily playing men s doubles and men s singles Played a lot more men s singles in the 80s than I did in the 90s as we had gotten older we seemed to migrate more towards men s doubles Had a group of guys that I played tennis with on Monday nights and at the time Thursday nights and Saturday and Sunday afternoons for quite some time On one particular Monday night we were playing mixed doubles played against played beside rather a group of women all of whom I knew and we d kind of kidded because this was a group of very attractive women three of whom I knew but the fourth one I didn t know Like I say I was playing with some friends of mine and and I was literally smitten almost like a sixteen year old by this new woman so much so to where it was very very difficult for me focus on my game that day and I was pretty much a a weak link in the match for that entire period Well could never catch the eye of this new player so the match was over their match was over they left I left and just kind of went on with my life Well a few weeks after that I ran into one of the other ladies there who along with her husband were friends of mine and I asked her who that person was And she told me who she was she said her name is Sally Trull she lives in Gastonia she s married I mean she s uh divorced and has three children And she said And she s looking for somebody who plays tennis and has a sense of humor And I said Well that would definitely be me however at the time I was dating someone and didn t think too terribly much about it Well low and behold several weeks later I received a call from this lady asked me if I wanted to play mixed doubles on a Friday night It would be she and her husband against myself and Sally So I said Certainly We all agreed to meet at the club at six o clock Well I got there Sally was there she had come straight from work However our club closes on Friday nights so she wasn t able to get in which wasn t that much of a hindrance The real hindrance was the fact that she had left her tennis shoes under her desk at work so he she had showed up to play tennis with all of her equipment her racket and no shoes which is just a very very bad combination Well we had no choice but to get shoes Of course she at the time was living in Gastonia and really didn t know her way around Charlotte very much at all So we decided to go to Omega Sports which is at the Arboretum We were at our tennis club which is over near Quail Corners Shopping Center it s really not all that terribly convenient So we hopped in my car and rode to Omega Sports to get some shoes This particular ride was probably the most crucial point in our relationship Both of us are quite gregarious and we talked to each other a good bit And in the 15 to 20 minute ride to Omega Sports as well as the 15 to 20 minute ride back from Omega Sports we both gave each other a very good thumbnail of our lives and where we were and what was going on and and the type person that we were It was very informative to me I could feel a very very strong attraction to Sally but I knew I had this other relationship going on um and didn t really want to do anything to jeopardize a potential relationship with Sally because of the other relationship So we went back played our match and as has always been the case with Sally and I or most of the time has been the case with Sally and I we won this match After it was over everyone wanted to go out and eat but I couldn t because Jocelyn was at home And I said I can t I really thought this was just a tennis match I ve got to go home my daughter s there So I went home didn t hear anything for a while A couple of weeks later Sally called and invited me to go to Jazz Fest uptown She explained a story about a group of people from work and I think maybe they d even rented a van um and were making the rounds I can t remember all the details of it but she said and I thought maybe you d want to go and she added this cleverly unless you re seeing someone else So I was honest with her told her I was and that it was in the process of winding down um but I really appreciated the invitation So we once again parted ways Several weeks later after the other relationship had run its course and had been completely wound down um I invited Sally to go to a um I think 25th anniversary party with some some people that I worked with Um we ended up getting together that Friday night before to meet some other friends of mine to kind of give her a baptism by fire Um and she played tennis at our club on Saturday and then we got together and went to the anniversary party and ended up out with some friends of ours after that was over and I think basically spent the entire weekend together and I just became closer and closer and closer to her I know that I fell in love with her that weekend um and ever since then she has been an absolutely fantastic part of my life very integral to the person that uh I have become And it s just been an amazing period of time to me that I was so fortunate to find so much of a to use a very corny term soul mate at that particular point in time in my life when I d really kind of thrown a towel in on that Um but that s that s a little story about how I uh I met my wife uh how important she is to me how things just kind of clicked all because she left a pair of shoes under her desk and sent us off on the relationship where we are Now um thank you
