 Do These Glasses Make Me Look Ugly Dear Merrill I also came across the terrible Moesha news and it s truly tragic not only for Moesha oops sorry I meant Brandy I always just think her as Moesha even though that s obviously not her name kind of the way millions of people around the country still think that Richard Dean Anderson s name is TV s McGuyver man it must drive the poor guy absolutely nuts wouldn t you think but for our entire nation On top of the the pain and suffering Moesha er Brandy must be going through herself on a personal level I once saw a Lifetime original movie about coping with dehydration and believe me it was more than a docudrama it was the powerful story of one woman s courage in the face of acute moisture shortage there is also the larger tragedy of a whole consumer populace having to go without new episodes of Moesha every week until somehow a cure can be found As a comedy writer I m sure you must be familiar with Moesha s there I go again sitcom work Did you ever happen to see the one where Moesha has to get glasses except she refuses to wear them because she thinks they make her look ugly and so she spends the entire episode bumping into things and getting into all sorts of crazy mixed up situations because she you know can t see anything I didn t but I did see a two sentence capsule plot summary for it in the TV listings one time a couple of years ago and I gotta tell you I laughed my friggin ass off Just imagine how much even funnier it would ve been if I d actually seen the entire half hour episode Until such comedy gold is back on the airwaves once again the theme song lyrics Everybody In the house Say Mo eeeeeeeeeeeeee sha will have taken on a grim new tone for us all becoming not an anthem of celebration and joy but a somber dirge of melancholy and despair across the land The bit about the TV Guide summary is a true story and here s another one An entertainment reporter here at the paper attended a press junket with Moesha I mean Brandy once and he got to interview her along with the rest of the teen cast of a psycho murderer horror flick she was in called I think I Still Know What You Did Two Summers Ago or something like that I still have the Moesha promotional hat he gave me from his trip Since they were all teens he sarcastically asked them if they had any advice for the Youth of America and Moesha literally replied that if they believed in themselves they could make their dreams come true But get this That s not the funny part To illustrate her point she said Look at me sometimes I worry that I m not pretty enough but I work hard and put on makeup and try to overcome my weaknesses She didn t say Sometimes I worry that I m not a good enough singer or sitcom actress or movie star or whatever She was worried that people didn t think she was pretty enough And I wonder what Donald Trump and really a candidate now Doesn t this guy know his life already parallels the plot of Citizen Kane enough as it is I mean hasn t he even ever seen it would have to say about that And maybe all the nation s aspiring submarine crew girls would finally get to fulfill their dreams of supervising and in the event of World War III actually launching thermonuclear weapons if only they just believed that they were pretty enough huh More later Todd
