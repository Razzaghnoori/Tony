          okay   okay   you there well have you had this with one of your parents yet   uh not with my parents although my parents are now in their early seventies   uhhuh   and uh fortunately they have to this point been very physically healthy and very self sufficient and they really look after themselves and i think considered what they want done as they get older and maybe less able   what what is do they want done thats interesting that theyve already said   well the it its more that they have when they retired and we are from South Dakota   uhhuh   so they retired from the rural farming community into Sioux Falls which is the biggest city in the state   uhhuh   and set themselves up near medical facilities and i i cant say i can tell you what theyve uh decided as to okay because i think some of that is that maybe you think ahead somewhat but you dont uh book those facilities yeah   right and it depends on their health too i know some people say they never want to go to a nursing home you know where others say well you know put me there if i get that bad you know   uhhuh   now my parents are seventy nine and eighty one   uhhuh   and theyre theyre still taking care of themselves but when they were your parents age they were doing much better now its gotten to where its just barely and we know its going to be probably anytime you know that that were going to have to change them from their home or something you know   well have they do they recognize the coming and try to make the decision themselves   no my stepfather is one thats always had a horror of nursing homes and dont ever put me there now my mother on the other hand i do not think would mind you know   uhhuh uhhuh   uh they live in a small town uh a hundred and twenty miles northeast of Dallas and uh and so the nursing home there if if they had to go there there would be some of their old friends there you know and its and rather than in a city where you probably wouldnt know anyone so that would be to their   uhhuh   advantage but uh i guess you know i dont know how long i have a brother and two stepsisters but we really havent really discussed it that much either we should have by this point you know at seventy nine and eighty one but i guess were just waiting to see what happens and then i guess well make a make decisions then   uhhuh   and uh but my stepfathers health is is failing bad you know i dont know if he has starting of Alzheimer or or what but the last say three years since he had to have some kind of brain surgery hes been going down hill you know   uhhuh   and uh so anyway i uh by this time we should have probably made some decisions but we havent so i i can see a lot of friends here in the neighborhood too uh ones mother just got to where she couldnt take care of herself anymore in Florida as far as you know eating meals and all that kind of stuff she just wasnt doing it you know so she has come to live with her daughter in the neighborhood   yeah that is one of the options but uh that is so related to the family situation of the children and uh you know i guess not that its happened in our case in my family because it well i have seen it in their generation it what you do is first see your parents go through it with their parents   uhhuh   and i would say well at this point um you could say been through all that because i have no no grandparents left uh and its you see all the different options and you see that they all can work uh   uhhuh ive almost been surprised the last three or four years with my friends in the neighborhood as many mothers its always been mothers have come to live in the home but then maybe theyll have a stroke or something and and then then theyll go to the nursing home but they go to the home first   uhhuh well if theyre uh thats the thing if theyre physically able it is a much more pleasant more caring uh situation to be in the home of one of the children   uhhuh   uh the other side of that is that if the children are no where near where the uh parents had spent their life then in a sense you you have no friends at the new place   uhhuh   uh in this that you are unless that you develop new friends and uh the best thing is kind of a combination where uh the at least one of the children if not several are uh uh back in the area where the parents uh had spent their years and then   that would make it easier yeah if if you were but like you say then to uproot them and take them to another state or something   yeah uhhuh   but uh in some of the cases i was talking about in the neighborhood though they have been up rooted from another state but then but then maybe things had gotten where they live that they never really saw anybody much any more anyway you know   uhhuh   too uh they you know get to where they dont get out that much anymore maybe especially if they hadnt always lived in that area theyre moving from   yes well its its not an easy choice because its but uh its something that we all face and we uh   right and then then its then its our turn so we better better handle it well because it will be   yeah but the way society changes it makes it so that uh what was acceptable for our parents and their parents may not be as workable for us it its certainly a problem as we as people live older of course as long as you can live a healthy life uh the uh the care is is not near the issue it becomes when you start having the physical problems   right and of course one thing we havent even discussed that makes a big bearing on what you do is the cost   yes   you know if the parents if they are going into some kind of of nursing type home you know that helps helps them uh you know do they have the money to pay for it or are the children going to help out to make up the difference you know if theres two parents that might be three thousand   right
