 A Racist STRONG EM Slate EM STRONG On March 23 the House of Representatives debated a proposed resolution condemning the Council of Conservative Citizens a racist group that Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott has come under fire for addressing Rep J C Watts Jr of Oklahoma pre empted consideration of the bill by introducing an alternative resolution denouncing all forms of racism and bigotry without mentioning the CCC specifically After Reps Charles Canaday of Florida and John Coyners of Michigan criticized the Watts substitute which failed to get the two thirds vote required for passage Watts answered them from the floor I would just say to my friend the gentleman from Florida that it is an amazing thing to me that over the last 4 years when I have been attacked when I have had racist comments made about me my friend from Florida never came to the floor and spoke up The gentleman from Michigan when I have had racist attacks made against me by people in the white community back in Oklahoma the State Democrat Party back in Oklahoma Slate magazine which is a national magazine no one ran to the floor to condemn that Bruce Gottlieb of our Redmond office called Rep Watts office to ask what he thought Slate had done that constituted a racist attack Watts s press secretary Pam Pryor pointed to a Strange Bedfellow column that I wrote in May 1998 titled The Football Caucus Gottlieb then forwarded the article by e mail and asked what in it Watts found racist From Pam Pryor Sent Thursday March 25 1999 3 16 PM To Bruce Gottlieb Bruce the part in the story that says But despite his go along get along through if he weren t black is the part we find offensive in particular Doubtful you would have said that about a Black Democrat And if you did many voices would have risen against you I then replied From Jacob Weisberg Sent Friday March 26 1999 3 45 PM To Pam Pryor Dear Ms Pryor I can understand how Rep Watts might be annoyed by my article and how any number of people might disagree with it for a variety of reasons But on what basis did he go onto the floor of the House and call Slate and by implication me racist You cite this passage But despite his go along get along affability Watts is unlikely to accomplish much in the House The problem is that Watts would never be given a leading role in his party if he weren t black I can only guess at what Rep Watts might have found offensive here The phrase go along to get along has no racial implication that I m aware of It s a standard description of party loyalty applied most often in my experience to white Democrats Next we come to the phrase unlikely to to accomplish much in the House This is my prediction based on my assessment of Rep Watts record thus far and my opinion of his abilities I might be wrong in this forecast But either way it s got nothing to do with the fact that he s black Indeed I say nearly the same thing about Rep Largent elsewhere in the same article The final sentence in the passage you cite contends that Rep Watts has been elevated within the Republican Party in part because of his race In other words I think that affirmative action has played a role in Rep Watts rapid ascent within GOP Do you actually dispute this Would you seriously maintain that Rep Watts would have been chosen to give the Republican response to President Clinton immediately after the 1994 election and to speak at the San Diego Convention in 1996 to name only a few of his honors and distinctions if he happened to be white But again whether or not I m correct in my analysis there s nothing racist about arguing that a member of a minority group whether a Democrat or a Republican has benefited from a desire for diversity Supportive of the party line not especially capable beneficiary of affirmative action I most certainly would say any of these things about a black Democrat to whom they applied In fact I did say them in a column about Alexis Herman a few months earlier No one accused me of bigotry And if someone had I would have been just as offended as I am now Unless I m missing something here I really think Rep Watts owes Slate and me an apology Yours sincerely Jacob Weisberg To date we have received no answer from Rep Watts or his office s a link to my original article Readers can make up their own minds about whether it constitutes a racist attack
