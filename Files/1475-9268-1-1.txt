 Background During meiosis homologous chromosomes replicate pair to form a bivalent experience a high rate of recombination and undergo two rounds of chromosome segregation to produce haploid meiotic products In meiosis I MI homologous chromosomes segregate from their partners in a reductional division and during meiosis II MII sister chromatids segregate from one another in an equational division similar to mitosis Crossover recombination reciprocal exchange generates chiasmata physical connections between homologs which provide the primary mechanism to ensure proper segregation of homologs during MI 1 In the absence of chiasmata crossovers homologous chromosomes experience nondisjunction and segregate randomly from their partners However backup achiasmatic or distributive mechanisms have been identified in some species 2 3 4 5 6 7 These distributive segregation systems can partially or almost fully restore faithful segregation of chromosomes during MI in the absence of recombination The respective contributions of chiasmatic and achiasmatic distributive modes of chromosome segregation can be studied in organisms with naturally occurring achiasmatic chromosomes 8 in cells harboring non recombined artificial chromosomes 9 and in achiasmatic mutants 10 Among achiasmatic mutants those lacking the Spo11 Rec12 protein are of particular interest because Spo11 has a key role in the initiation of recombination 11 Meiotically induced Spo11 Rec12 dependent double strand DNA dsDNA breaks have been demonstrated in budding yeast and fission yeast 12 13 14 15 Spo11 almost certainly catalyzes these breaks as it shares high homology with the A subunit of Topoisomerase VI of Sulfolobus shibatae 16 17 and it becomes linked by a phosphotyrosine linkage to the 5 end of the cleaved DNA 18 19 20 21 Spo11 homologs have been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes and available evidence suggests that initiation of meiotic recombination via Spo11 dependent dsDNA break formation is conserved 22 23 24 25 Our results with the fission yeast S pombe fully support this view see results and discussion Spo11 protein has potential functions in addition to catalyzing dsDNA breaks It is dispensable for chromosome pairing and synapsis in some organisms but is required in others 22 24 25 26 27 28 Budding yeast spo11 null mutants lack chromosome pairing but catalytic site tyrosine mutants spo11 Y135F support significant levels of DSB independent pairing 29 so the function of Spo11 proteins in pairing may be separable from its function in catalyzing recombination Localization of Spo11 across synapsed pachytene chromosomes of mice also suggests that Spo11 has an additional role after it catalyzes recombination in meiosis 25 This study examined the relationship between meiotic recombination and chromosome segregation in rec12 spo11 mutants of fission yeast We report that Rec12 protein and its active site tyrosine are essential for crossover recombination in multiple intervals of all three chromosomes Rec12 also has two roles in reductional chromosome segregation during MI First catalytically active Rec12 is required for normal levels of reductional chiasmatic segregation Second catalytically inactive Rec12 protein facilitates achiasmatic distributive segregation In addition we report that Rec12 and its active site tyrosine are required for proper equational chromosome segregation during MII Results Structure of rec12 gene and complementation by rec12 cDNA While rec12 was reported to encode a protein of 139 amio acids 30 conceptual translation of the surrounding region suggested that rec12 encoded a larger protein with homology to Spo11 of S cerevisiae and Top6A of Sulfolobus shibatae 17 21 Alignments and splicing sequence profiles 31 were used to identify four putative introns Figure 1A Oligonucleotide primer pairs flanking each of the putative introns were used for PCR and RT PCR to amplify genomic DNA and meiotic mRNA respectively In each case the product from mRNA was shorter than that from genomic DNA confirming the presence of four introns Figure 1A Presence of four introns suggested that the rec12 cDNA encodes a protein of 345 amino acids with high homology to eukaryotic Spo11 proteins Figure 1B To test this hypothesis we introduced a full length genomic clone and a sequence confirmed cDNA into inducible expression vectors 32 in such a way that the first methionine in predicted exon 1 would be used for translation Figure 1C Each of these constructs restored wild type levels of recombination to rec12 117 strains Figure 2A 2B We conclude that the cDNA encodes a functional Rec12 protein of 345 amino acids in length This conclusion was confirmed by Western blotting of an epitope tagged Rec12 protein expressed from the endogenous rec12 locus a meiotically induced protein band of the expected size was observed W D Sharif and W P Wahls unpublished observations Rec12 Spo11 protein shares homology with the catalytic Top6A subunit of Topoisomerase VI which functions as a heterotetramer with Top6B 16 17 However no Top6B homolog is present in most eukaryotes and the Rec12 Spo11 enzyme does not need to affect strand passage in the manner of canonical type II topoisomerases 11 We therefore tested whether overexpression of rec12 would lead to a hyper recombination phenotype thereby implicating function as a homodimer Very low levels of ectopic rec12 expression restored wild type recombination levels to the rec12 117 mutant Figure 2B confirming that functional Rec12 protein was produced However upon overexpression of rec12 the frequency of recombinants did not increase significantly above wild type levels Figure 2C 2D Thus Rec12 protein in excess of wild type levels is biologically inactive some other factor becomes rate limiting under these circumstances The rec12 117 mutant was isolated in a genetic screen the rec12 117 mutation reportedly confers a 100 fold or greater reduction of intragenic recombination and a 6 fold reduction of intergenic recombination 33 To define more precisely the requirement for Rec12 in meiotic chromosome dynamics we used gene replacement to generate a null rec12 D15 mutation and a mutation in the putative active site tyrosine rec12 Y98F We then determined the effects of these mutations upon intergenic crossover recombination within intervals of chromosomes I II and III We also employed a combination of cytological and genetic approaches to reveal the nature of meiotic chromosome segregation defects for each chromosome in each of the three mutants Rec12 and its active site tyrosine are required for chiasmatic meioses Models for recombination posit that gene conversion and reciprocal exchange crossover recombination are alternative outcomes of a common intermediate 11 Intragenic recombination at the ade6 locus a measure of gene conversion was reduced more than 100 fold in rec12 117 mutants 33 and we have obtained similar results with the rec12 117 rec12 D15 and rec12 Y98F mutants Figure 2 W D Sharif and W P Wahls unpublished data Because reciprocal exchange accompanies more than half of all gene conversions at the ade6 locus 34 35 the rec12 mutants must also have a reduced number of reciprocal exchanges in the vicinity of ade6 If Rec12 protein is required for all or most meiotic recombination then rec12 mutants might fail to produce a sufficient number of reciprocal exchanges to ensure that each chromosome pair receives at least one crossover To address this issue we determined the number of crossovers present in regions of chromosomes I II and III in the rec12 D15 deletion and rec12 Y98F active site mutants Multiple genetic intervals encompassing approximately 20 of the genome 444 cM were analyzed Intergenic recombination was reduced an average of 256 fold in the rec12 D15 null mutants and 263 fold in the rec12 Y98F active site mutants relative to wild type levels Table 1 Thus Rec12 protein and its active site tyrosine are likely required for most crossover recombination throughout the genome Because there are between 11 and 18 crossovers per chromosome in wild type S pombe meioses and those crossovers are distributed without interference 36 we can estimate the residual number of crossovers present on each chromosome in the rec12 mutant meioses A 250 fold reduction in recombination would leave less than 0 1 crossovers per chromosome so all three chromosomes in most of the rec12 mutant meioses are achiasmatic Rec12 is required for proper meiotic chromosome segregation The rec12 mutant meioses are achiasmatic and would thus be expected to suffer chromosome segregation errors during meiosis I To gain insight into this possibility asci from meiotic cultures were stained with a DNA specific fluorescent dye DAPI and visualized by differential interference contrast DIC and fluorescence microscopy The majority of asci from wild type cells contained four well rounded spores each with a single DAPI staining body of equal intensity Figure 3A The rec12 mutants were proficient at meiosis and underwent two meiotic divisions as revealed by ascus development and the distribution of chromosomes However each of the rec12 mutants exhibited a high frequency of chromosome segregation errors that were sometimes accompanied by defects in spore formation and or ascus development Figure 3B The data from a large number of asci from each mutant are presented schematically in Figure 3C The rec12 117 rec12 D15 and rec12 Y98F mutants exhibited qualitatively and quantitatively similar cytological phenotypes Figure 3C They each produced between 60 and 66 of asci with gross defects in DNA distribution These mutant phenotypes were not uniform different asci from the same cross were differentially affected Figure 3 This heterogeneous phenotype is characteristic of a variety of mutations that directly affect meiotic chromosome dynamics 37 38 39 Aberrant or random assortment of the three chromosome pairs or twelve chromatids leads to heterogeneous DNA distributions within different asci The rec12 mutants also exhibited high frequencies of additional developmental defects such as abnormal spore placement reduced spore numbers and abnormal spore formation Figure 3C It has been suggested previously 38 that these phenotypes are characteristic of a defect in meiosis II because spore formation in S pombe is controlled by the spindle pole body of the MII spindle 40 41 42 S pombe produces ordered tetrads If chromosomes segregated aberrantly during the MI reductional division and then segregated appropriately during the equational division of MII one would expect sister spores to receive identical complements of chromosomes However among rec12 mutant asci with four spores and an aberrant DNA distribution Figure 3C classes b c d e only 26 or less exhibited a pattern characteristic of simple MI nondisjunction Figure 3C classes c e The remaining 74 or more had DNA distributions characteristic of precocious sister chromatid separation and or MII segregation errors DNA was unequally distributed between two sister spores Figure 3C classes b d In some cases a defect in chromosome segregation during MII was visualized more directly For example in many cases DNA masses failed to separate properly into two sister spores during the second meiotic division Figure 3B Figure 3C classes f g j k m Thus Rec12 protein is required for some function of MII as well as for recombination during MI rec12mutants produce a high frequency aneuploid meiotic products Since S pombe contains only three chromosome pairs aberrant assortment during one or both of the meiotic divisions can produce by chance a significant fraction of meiotic products that receive at least one copy of each chromosome and are hence viable 38 43 Aberrant segregation can also produce nullisomic aneuploids missing one or more chromosomes polysomic aneuploids having additional copies of individual chromosomes and diploids 38 39 44 In S pombe the haploids and diploids are viable nullisomic aneuploids are inviable and disomic aneuploids tend to lose the extra chromosome or chromosomes and become haploid 45 We therefore determined the frequencies of spore viability and meiotic diploidy as genetic measures of chromosome segregation errors Approximately 50 of the meiotic products from the rec12 117 and rec12 D15 null mutants were inviable Figure 4A indicating that about 50 of the products were nullisomic for one or more chromosomes This value is close to the frequency 58 of nullisomics that one would expect if chromosome segregation were completely random in either one of the two meiotic divisions Interestingly the rec12 Y98F mutant produced a significantly higher frequency of inviable spores than the rec12 117 and rec12 D15 mutants Figure 4A suggesting that rec12 Y98F is a separation of function mutation As a second measure of aberrant segregation we determined the frequency of diploid spore colonies in the mutants Each of the rec12 mutants behaved similarly and produced approximately 10 diploid meiotic products more than 30 fold higher than the frequency produced by wild type cells Figure 4B If chromosome segregation were completely random in either one of the two meiotic divisions one would expect approximately 4 of the viable products to be disomic for all three chromosomes The value obtained in the rec12 mutants was 2 5 fold higher than the predicted random value indicating that the segregation errors are not simply the consequence of random chromosome assortment nondisjunction occurring exclusively during one of the two meiotic divisions Rec12 is required for chiasmatic and achiasmatic chromosome segregation during MI and its active site tyrosine is required for chromosome segregation during MII Because each of the rec12 mutants had aberrant meiotic chromosome segregation Figure 3 produced a high frequency of viable meiotic products Figure 4A and produced a high frequency of meiotic diploids Figure 4B we were able to monitor directly the segregation patterns of all three chromosome pairs in each of the mutants Meiotic diploids were genotyped for heteroallelic centromere linked markers on each of the three chromosomes Those data were compared to the inheritance patterns predicted for each type of chromosome missegregation Figure 5 Approximately half of the diploid products from the rec12 117 and rec12 D15 null meioses were heterozygous for centromere linked markers on chromosomes I II and III Figure 5E Thus those meioses did not exhibit simple MI nondisjunction because 100 of diploids arising from MI nondisjunction would be heterozygous at the centromeres Figure 5B Precocious separation of sister chromatids during MI 44 46 can also produce diploid meiotic products 67 of which would be heterozygous for centromere markers Figure 5D 38 However the average heterozygosities in the rec12 117 and rec12 D15 mutants were significantly below this value indicating that these mutants must have suffered some proportion of MII segregation errors By applying mapping functions for aneuploid meiotic products 47 we can set a lower limit of 22 and 29 MII nondisjunction for the rec12 117 and rec12 D15 meioses analyzed respectively Surprisingly the rec12 Y98F active site mutants produced meiotic diploids that were almost exclusively homozygous for centromere linked markers Figure 5E The average heterozygosity for loci on all three chromosomes was 4 7 4 1 This indicates that about 95 of those rec12 Y98F mutant cells that produced diploid spores must have successfully completed the reductional segregation of chromosomes MI and failed to properly segregate sister chromatids during the equational division MII While there was clear cytological evidence of two meiotic divisions and aberrant chromosome assortment in each division in the majority of rec12 mutant cells Figure 3 it remained possible that some of the diploid meiotic products were derived from cells that had skipped one of the two meiotic divisions thereby biasing the chromosome segregation data If this were the case all three chromosomes within any given individual meiotic product would exhibit identical segregation patterns However about half of the diploids from rec12 117 and rec12 D15 meioses and 14 of diploids from rec12 Y98F meioses exhibited mixed patterns of MI or MII missegregation for different chromosomes within individual cells Table 2 Furthermore the observed frequencies of mixed segregation matched the frequencies predicted from the average values for single chromosomes e g 14 vs 13 for rec12 Y98F These data provide additional evidence that two meiotic divisions had occurred and that the diploids arose as a consequence of meiotic chromosome segregation defects Discussion Conserved structure and function of Rec12 Spo11 to initiate recombination Identification of four introns Figure 1 and complete complementation of the rec12 117 hyporecombination defect by the full length cDNA Figure 2 confirmed that Rec12 protein is homologous to Spo11 of other eukaryotes 11 Both Rec12 and its active site tyrosine are required for intragenic and intergenic recombination at multiple locations on all three chromosomes Figure 2 Tables 1 2 data not shown We observed an average 256 fold and 263 fold reduction in crossover recombination in the rec12 D15 and rec12 Y98F mutants for intervals encompassing 20 of the genome Since wild type S pombe has 44 crossovers per meiosis between 11 and 18 per chromosome 36 the mutants statistically have less than 0 1 crossovers per chromosome per meiosis and are thus achiasmatic It was reported previously that rec12 117 mutants exhibit only a 6 fold reduction in crossover recombination 33 which is at odds with our value of more than a 250 fold reduction in the rec12 D15 null and rec12 Y98F active site mutants Table 1 This discrepancy is not due to the nature of the rec12 117 allele as we have also observed a 200 fold or greater reduction in crossovers in rec12 117 mutants W D Sharif and W P Wahls unpublished data Our observation that rec12 117 mutants produce a high frequency of viable diploid meiotic products about half of which are heterozygous for centromere linked markers Figures 4 5 Table 2 provides a straightforward reason for the discrepancy The previous study failed to exclude diploid spore colonies and scored only for double prototrophic recombinants the double auxotrophic reciprocal recombinants were not analyzed Presumably the bulk of the colonies reported previously as recombinants were actually diploids or disomics exhibiting intergenic complementation We used dosage studies to see if Rec12 functions in a manner predicted by homology to Spo11 Top6A Upon overexpression of Rec12 protein the frequency of recombination did not increase beyond wild type levels Figure 2 The simplest interpretation is that Rec12 functions in a multisubunit protein complex a complex in which other components are required either for efficient catalysis of dsDNA breaks or for correct subcellular localization of Rec12 In budding yeast the active site mutation exhibits allele specific semidominance when heterozygous with wild type 51 and we have made similar observations in fission yeast W D Sharif and W P Wahls unpublished data This provides evidence that a dimer of Rec12 Spo11 protein harboring two functional active sites is required for catalysis of dsDNA breaks in each organism Thus with regard to primary protein sequence Figure 1 inferred subunit structure Figure 2and data not shown strict requirement for meiotic recombination Figure 2 Table 1 and dependence upon its active site tyrosine Table 1 Rec12 protein is a structurally and functionally conserved member of the Spo11 family of enzymes that catalyze meiotic dsDNA cleavage to initiate recombination 11 Rec12 has dual roles in chiasmatic and achiasmatic distributive chromosome segregation during Meiosis I In the absence of crossover recombination chiasmata and a backup distributive achiasmatic system for chromosome segregation MI nondisjunction should occur and 100 of any resulting diploid spore colonies would be heterozygous for centromere linked markers Figure 5B However only about 50 of diploid meiotic products from rec12 D15 null mutant meioses were heterozygous for centromere linked markers Figure 5E indicating that some fraction of the products were derived from precocious separation of sister chromatids PSS and or MII nondisjunction Figure 5C 5D Since PSS does not occur in rec12 null mutants 52 those centromere homozygous chromosomes must have experienced a proper reductional segregation and a failed equational segregation discussed below The rec12 D15 null mutants are achiasmatic Table 1 and as anticipated exhibit a high frequency of MI nondisjunction Figures 3 5 Table 2 However the frequency of MI nondisjunction observed is only half of that expected suggesting the presence of a distributive achiasmatic system of chromosome segregation There is precedence for a distributive MI segregation system in several organisms 7 53 In rec7 hyporecombination mutants of S pombe the fidelity of segregation of homologs during MI exceeds the expected random level 10 Similarly MI segregation of GFP tagged centromeres in rec12 deletion mutants occurs at non random levels L Davis and G R Smith personal communication in good agreement with our genetic results In each case identified this distributive system of fission yeast can partially circumvent the MI segregation errors of achiasmatic chromosomes approximately one quarter to one half of those homologs expected to nondisjoin i e move to the same pole end up segregating distributively i e move to opposite poles While the rec12 D15 null mutants frequently suffer MI nondisjunction the rec12 Y98F active site mutants produce meiotic diploids with nearly normal MI segregation patterns Figures 3 5 Table 2 This difference is unrelated to crossover frequency because the active site and null mutants have identical deficiencies in crossover recombination Table 1 Thus Rec12 protein has one or more functions in MI that are distinct from its functions to catalyze recombination and mediate chiasmatic segregation We propose that the Rec12 Y98F protein facilitates distributive segregation of achiasmatic chromosomes during MI A meiotic checkpoint could provide additional time for missegregating chromosomes to correct their erroneous wanderings during MI 10 We propose two likely mechanisms by which the Rec12 protein improves the MI segregation of achiasmatic chromosomes First Rec12 may be required for an MI nondisjunction checkpoint that delays meiotic cells in which proper MI disjunction has failed to occur If Rec12 were required for such a checkpoint the null mutants would be achiasmatic would fail to delay for the time period required to establish distributive segregation and would consequently undergo high rates of MI nondisjunction In the presence of Rec12 Y98F protein the checkpoint would be active thereby allowing the achiasmatic chromosomes sufficient time to reorient and undergo distributive segregation Meiotic progression in spo11 rec12 null mutants of budding yeast is accelerated 29 supporting our hypothesis that Rec12 may participate in an MI nondisjunction checkpoint As an alternative but not mutually exclusive mechanism Rec12 protein may participate directly in the machinery of distributive segregation In female meioses of D melanogaster heterochromatic pairing of homologs can substitute for chiasmata to ensure bipolar spindle attachment of bivalents and subsequent distributive segregation 4 5 6 8 Rec12 may serve a similar role in maintaining a paired or pseudo paired state between achiasmatic chromosomes prior to the first meiotic division In support of this possibility Spo11 of mice colocalizes extensively along homologously synapsed chromosomes during pachytene and dissociates when the homologs segregate from one another during anaphase of MI 25 Rec12 has a role in equational chromosome segregation during Meiosis II that is dependent upon its active site tyrosine Cytological and genetic data each demonstrated that the rec12 D15 null and rec12 Y98F active site mutants frequently suffer chromosome segregation errors during MII Figures 3 5 Table 2 This role for Rec12 in equational chromosome segregation may be conserved as spo11 mutants of Sordaria macrospora also exhibit frequent MII nondisjunction S Tesse A Storlazzi S Gargano and D Zickler personal communication Irregular partitioning of chromosomes during the second meiotic division has also been reported in fission yeast rec7 mutants 10 so MII missegregation may be a relatively common fate for chromosomes in hyporecombination mutants As described previously in this paper and elsewhere 38 the biology of fission yeast facilitates the identification of MII segregation defects that are difficult to detect in other organisms that terminate meiotic progression or produce inviable meiotic products as a consequence of defects in meiotic chromosome dynamics Although they exhibit a striking difference in their apparent MI nondisjunction frequencies the rec12 D15 null and rec12 Y98F active site mutants manifest at most a two fold difference in the absolute frequency of meiotic diploids exhibiting MII missegregation patterns Figures 4 5 Table 2 Catalytically inactive Rec12 Y98F protein apparently cannot enhance the fidelity appropriate MII segregation relative to MII missegregation levels in cells lacking Rec12 entirely We therefore propose that Rec12 protein mediates a signal strictly dependent upon its active site tyrosine that is required for the equational division of MII There are two main hypotheses as to the nature of the signal First Rec12 protein itself may participate in the signal transduction In pat1 114 ts meioses Rec12 appears to persist until about the time of the second meiotic division N Herrera and S Forsburg personal communication so Rec12 is available at the right time Alternatively some aspect of the crossovers or chiasmata may transduce the signal This could involve structural components that persist on chromosomes at the positions where recombination and chiasmata had previously occurred or could involve a diffusible component generated by recombination events At present two hypothetical mechanisms by which a Rec12 dependent signal affects MII are proposed First Rec12 dependent recombination dependent signals might trigger a block after MI thereby allowing cells to skip a frequently irregular MII division 39 However the majority of the rec12 mutant meioses show evidence of two meiotic divisions Figure 3 and many of the meiotic diploids exhibit mixed MI and MII missegregation patterns for centromere linked markers on the three different chromosomes Table 2 In the absence of PSS which does not occur at significant levels in rec12 mutants 52 such mixed segregation patterns can only be generated by a combination of errors in both reductional and equational segregation A second hypothetical mechanism takes into account the coordinate two step release of sister chromatid cohesion that is essential for the two meiotic divisions 38 Rec12 dependent or recombination dependent signals may be required for the proper maintenance and or dissolution of centromere proximal sister chromatid cohesion in MII These and other hypotheses regarding the unambiguous requirement for Rec12 in MII remain to be tested Conclusions The role of Spo11 Rec12 in the initiation of meiotic recombination via catalysis of dsDNA breaks is conserved and likely universal among eukaryotes The rec12 null and active site mutants are achiasmatic and as anticipated Rec12 dependent crossovers chiasmata are required to ensure proper reductional chromosome segregation in MI In the absence of Rec12 protein and crossovers a backup distributive achiasmatic segregation system operates successfully on up to half of the chromosomes that would otherwise undergo MI nondisjunction Presence of catalytically inactive Rec12 protein enhances the fidelity of this distributive segregation system In addition catalytically active Rec12 protein or Rec12 dependent recombination is required for faithful chromosome segregation during MII Methods S pombeculture Strain genotypes are listed in Table 3 Culture media and genetic methods were as described 38 54 55 Intron mapping cDNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis Cells harboring the pat1 114 ts allele were induced to enter meiosis 56 and were collected after 3 hours of meiotic induction Genomic DNA and total RNA were prepared 57 and subject to PCR and RT PCR 58 using primers flanking each putative intron Full length rec12 cDNA was obtained using RT PCR The 5 and 3 primers contained Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites respectively and were designed to amplify the rec12 cDNA from the first ATG in exon 1 to a position 142 bp downstream of the stop codon in exon 5 RT PCR products were cloned by blunt end ligation into pCR Blunt Invitrogen Corp and both strands were subject to DNA sequencing GenBank accession no AF195027 Alignment of Rec12 with other Spo11 family members Protein sequences homologous to that of S pombe Rec12 were identified with a NCBI Blast search 59 using matrix BLOSUM62 Representative homologous sequences see Figure 1legend were aligned using T COFFEE 60 which optimizes alignment of sequences with low levels of homology Output was prepared using a 50 threshold for identical and conserved residues Inducible pREP vector constructions Genomic rec12 DNA and rec12 cDNA were cloned between the Nde I and Bam HI restriction sites of the inducible vectors pREP2 pREP42 and pREP82 32 Induction of gene expression and northern blot analysis of rec12 mRNA levels were as described 32 57 Genomic DNA was liberated from pYL78 30 by partial Eco RI digestion and complete Bam HI digestion which cleaves within the polylinker site approximately 700 bp downstream of the rec12 stop codon in exon 5 The DNA fragment with single site cleavage by Eco RI at bp position 3 relative to the ATG start codon was gel purified A dsDNA oligonucleotide linker containing cohesive Nde I and Eco RI ends was constructed 5 TATGAGCCATCATCATCATCATCATAGCATG 3 and 5 AATTCATGCTATGATGATGATGATGATGGCTAC 3 This linker encoded in frame the amino acids MSHHHHHHSM with the last residue corresponding to the first methionine encoded in rec12 exon 1 Trimolecular ligation was used to create pREP2 rec12 pREP42 rec12 and pREP82 rec12 clones encoding Rec12 protein with 6X histidine tags An Nde I Bam HI fragment of a cDNA clone with wild type rec12 sequence see above was sub cloned into the pREP42 vector to generate pREP42 rec12 cDNA The integrity of all clones was determined by a combination of restriction mapping PCR and DNA sequencing Construction of rec12 D15 ura4 and rec12 Y98Falleles A PCR based gene targeting approach 61 62 was used to delete the rec12 coding region and replace it with the ura4 gene Candidates were screened with a combination of PCR analysis restriction digestion and DNA sequencing to identify those with successful allele replacement Replacement of the endogenous rec12 locus with the rec12 Y98F allele was achieved by transformation and a pop in pop out approach 61 63 A 1 2 kbp Xba I Xba I fragment of rec12 was subcloned into pBluescript SKII and subject to oligonucleotide directed mutagenesis 64 to simultaneously introduce a silent

described above Recombinant frequency determination Mating meiosis and preparation of free spores were as described 54 55 65 Intergenic and intragenic recombinant frequencies were determined as described 38 65 Because diploid spores could contain complementing markers and be mistaken for recombinants we tested all spore colonies for diploidy by replica plating on complete media containing Phloxin B YEA B On these plates diploid cells produce dark pink colonies whereas haploid cells produce light pink colonies 54 Diploid meiotic products were excluded from recombinant frequency determinations Diploid spore isolation and haploidization analysis Identification of diploid spore colonies and their haploidization with m flourophenylalanine m FPA 55 were as described 38 Fifty haploidized colonies derived from each diploid spore colony were replica plated to differentially supplemented minimal media to genotype the lys1 and ade6 loci The tps13 alleles were scored by replica plating colonies onto rich YEA media and testing for growth at permissive 22 C and restrictive 35 C temperatures Microscopy Asci from meiotic cultures were fixed with 70 ethanol at 20 C for at least
