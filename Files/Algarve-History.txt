A Brief HistoryLittle is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europes southwestern extremity The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes or Cunetes Whatever their origins their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians who settled in the area around  bc followed by the Celts Iberians Greeks and CarthaginiansBut it was the Romans who arrived late in the third century bc who most greatly influenced all of Iberia They built towns industries roads and bridges developed agriculture and bequeathed the Latin language of which Portuguese is a direct descendant The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated and by the third century ad had introduced Christianity By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place based in Faro But Rome had already fallen into decay and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the midfifth centuryUnder Moorish RuleIn ad  the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels squat white houses the dark complexions of the people and in the very name given the regiontaken from AlGharb which means country of the west when the Moors conquered the territory it was the most westerly in the known worldThe Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge invulnerable fortress The capital was Chelb or Xelb and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon Today the town known as Silves see page  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish rampartsThe long struggle by Christians to expel the Moors a campaign known as the Reconquista or Reconquest began towards the end of the eighth century ad By the th century Portucale consisted of a small section of Castile and Len todays northern Portugal Yet it wasnt until the th century that significant gains were made to take back southern Iberia The beginning of the end came in the Battle of Ourique in  After the victory Count Afonso Henriques proclaimed himself the first king of Portugal making it one of the first nationstates in EuropeThe Reconquest of Silves not achieved for another  years was a grisly affair A mixed bag of Crusaders from northern Europe were recruited en route to their battles east in the Holy Land They sailed upon the river port of Silves and ignoring conditional offers of surrender slew all the inhabitants at no small loss to themselves and pillaged the great treasures of the cityTwo years later Muslim forces rallied again retaking Silves and the Reconquista stumbled on for another half century So many interreligious alliances reigned and so pervasive was the intermingling of Moors and Christians that it was hard to tell who was on which side and for which piece of land they were fighting On top of that the situation was further clouded by a feud between Portugal and Spain each of them claiming sovereignty over the Algarve However by  Faro and the western Algarve were retaken under King Afonso III completing the Reconquest The possibility of war with Spain was averted by an expeditious royal marriage and by the end of the century a treaty with Spain drew up the boundaries of Portugal that stand todayThe Algarve was a region regarded separately within the new Portugal as is evidenced by the royal title Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve In those days the notion of the Algarve as a distinct entity did make some sense like an island it was cut off to the south and west by the Atlantic to the east by the Guadiana River and to the north by the mountains The regions titular autonomy was upheld until  when the monarchy itself was overthrownThe NavigatorIn  long after the Reconquista was completed a Portuguese fleet assembled on the River Tagus in Lisbon for an assault on the Moors in their homeland Crossing the Straits of Gibraltar the armada attacked and seized the North African city of Ceuta An illustrious member of the famous raid was the young Prince Henry half Portuguese and half English the son of King Joo I and his wife Philippa of Lancaster Ceuta would be Henrys one and only military victory though he was destined to establish Portugal as a major world power helping to develop important world trade routes by the time of his death in At the age of  Henry assembled a School of Navigation It was certainly not a formal institution of lectures and classes but probably resembled an informal modernday thinktank Prince Henrymade governor of the Algarve in had the money influence enthusiasm and vision to lead and cajole the best astronomers cartographers boatdesigners and seamen of the day to expand Portugals maritime horizonsThe waters at the western extreme of the Algarve were all that was known to sailors Once they were beyond Cabo de So Vicente they faced the unknown with no communications and no possibility of rescue if the voyage turned out badly Yet out into the unknown they went for the glory of God and country and in search of personal fame and fortune Their mission was made easier by the craft Algarve shipwrights had developed a successor to the lumbering ships of the day the caravel It was light fast and very maneuverable Any breeze was enough for a captain to steer it where he wanted to go With the subsequent development of new navigational techniques it was no longer necessary to stay within sight of land Now the only limits to maritime exploration were mans ingenuity and courageAccording to tradition the site of Prince Henrys base was the Sagres peninsula see page  though there is little there today to persuade you of this The actual headquarters of the Navigation School may have been  km  miles east in Lagos see page  This location had a port shipyards and was home to the prince in his role as governor of the AlgarveDuring Henrys lifetime Portugals caravels sailed beyond the most westerly point of Africa They colonized the Atlantic islands of Madeira and the Azores laying the foundations for the future Portuguese empire Before the century was over Henrys compatriots Bartolomeu Dias and Vasco da Gama completed epic voyages rounding the Cape of Good Hope and reaching India respectively and Pedro lves Cabral claimed Brazil Between  and  another Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan led the first expedition to circumnavigate the world Mercantilist Portugal became a rich maritime superpowerForeign IntriguesTo protect its seagoing interests and trade routes Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa India Malacca East Indies and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau now Macao the Congo and various other parts of Africa including the Sudan The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire rather than to conquer nations To this end it succeeded with relatively few bloodsoaked episodes in its colonial historyAdventures abroad however proved disastrous during the second half of the th century In  the yearold boyking Sebastio ascended the throne the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of AlcacerQuiber Morocco in pursuit of a vain crusade Sebastios untimely demise alongside some  illprepared badly led followers set the stage for a crisis of succession For many years afterwards legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executedIn fact the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed he died heirless Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity Spain occupied the power vacuum and Portugals neighbor and longtime antagonist became its masterSpanish rule dictated Portugals inadvertent involvement in Spains ongoing wars In  a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve now a legitimate target as Spanish territory and sacked Sagres thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator Nine years later Faro was torched The  Treaty of Windsor by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship seemed a distant memoryPortugals empire was gradually eroded and many of its trading posts with the notable exception of Brazil were picked off by the British and Dutch Finally after  years of Spanish rule Portuguese noblemen aided by the French then at war with Spain organized a palace coup and restored independenceThe Great DisasterPortugals greatest misfortune struck on All Saints Day  November  With the candlelit churches crowded with worshippers a monstrous earthquake struck followed by fastspreading fires and a devastating tidal wave that swept over the Algarve inland as far as  km  miles The exact casualty figure will never be known but it is estimated that  died immediately and between  and  perished as a result of secondary injuries and the ensuing famine and pestilence The epicenter of the earthquake is thought to have been off the Algarve coast possibly between Tavira and Faro but it devastated places as far away as the capital Lisbon Witnesses claim to have seen a fiery volcano erupt from beneath the sea just before the first joltThroughout the Algarve and much of the rest of southern Portugal virtually every important monument cathedral castle and mansion was destroyed or at least critically damaged in the earthquake Among the hardest hit towns was Lagos see page  which lost its castle its churches and the palace in which Henry the Navigator had once livedPolitical UpheavalThe beginning of the th century brought further alarm to the country This time the epicenter was Paris and the cause Napoleon Just as Portugals forced alliance with Spain had made the country a target for Drakes thcentury raids now her friendly alliance with England rankled NapoleonIn  the French invaded Lisbon causing the royal family to flee to Brazil Spain followed by Portugal rose up against the French occupation in what came to be known as the Peninsular WarAmong the early blows struck for independence was a rebellion in the town of Olho see page  On  June  the townsfolkarmed with little more than ancient swords spears and stonesattacked and captured the local French garrison Its said that a party of local men then set sail from Olho all the way to Brazil without maps or navigational aids to tell the king of the insurrection The real battle however was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fightingThe war left Portugal further weakened and in  its major empire outpost Brazil declared independence At the same time a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal and his brother Miguel The power struggle with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism excited the interest and intervention of other powers With British help Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St Vincent in  and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon Pedro took the throne though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after thatBy  Portugal racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies including those of Mozambique and Angola declared itself bankrupt The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sownKingdoms EndBloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy On  February  the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza Terreiro do Pao when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne Prince Luis Filipe The princes younger brother Prince Manuel was also hit but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of Amid republican agitation a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in  Having ruled for less than three years Manuel died in exile in  in EnglandThe sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable  times between  and  until a military revolution suspended Portugals problematic democracy After six years of power General Oscar Carmona appointed his finance minister Antnio de Oliveira Salazar to be Prime Minister a position he was to hold until  Salazars repressive rule and austerity measures rid the Portuguese economy of debt though poverty increased Portugal remained neutral during World War II and Salazar demonstrated his financial acumen by selling materials and supplies to both sidesIn  the elderly Salazar was forced into retirement after a stroke His successor Dr Marcelo Caetano feeling the spirit of the age began tentative relaxations of the old regime The armed forces finally overthrew him in a popular bloodless coup known as the Carnation Revolution on  April Portugal finally began to pull itself out of the long and fruitless struggle against revolutionaries in its African colonies and granted independence to the remaining members of its empire in  This too caused major upheavals and a million permanent refugees rushed the motherland aggravating the shortage of housing and jobsAlthough economic problems continued to beset the young democracy the political scene was greatly stabilized In  Portugal the former poor backwater of Europe joined the European Economic Community now the European Union or EUWith aid from the EU Portugal became one of the fastestgrowing countries in Europe The Algarve already a favorite of sunseeking beach lovers from England and Northern Europe also benefited from EU funds to build up its infrastructure and to invest in tourism In  Portugal hosted the World Expo in Lisbon and in  further consolidated its European membership by accepting the gradual introduction of the Euro the single currency also adopted by Spain Italy Germany France and others
