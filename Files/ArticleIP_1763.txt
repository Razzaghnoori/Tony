 A Plump Sheep GET INTERNATIONAL PAPERS BY E MAIL For Tuesday and Saturday morning delivery of this column plus Today s Papers daily Pundit Central Monday morning and Summary Judgment Wednesday morning click here What the Italian papers call sexygate or sexgate was back on most of the world s front pages Thursday offering a promising lifeline for newspapers during the dog days of August Most papers seemed to think President Clinton would get away with it though at some personal cost Clinton has changed American customs for ever said Corriere della Sera of Milan He has won the right to privacy for his successors But the price he has paid has been a spider s web of half truths and half silence which is wearing him away La Repubblica of Rome said American public opinion has already forgiven Bill for a sin he won t admit to having committed In Paris Le Monde said that if Clinton tried to fend off the questioning with dodges similar to the one about fellatio and penetration he will founder in ridicule If he admits to having lied he will be found guilty of perjury But it was still unlikely that Congress would find enough evidence to bring a charge of impeachment to trial it said Die Welt of Germany said it was now Monica s word against Bill s and the paper doubted that Kenneth Starr could make his case against the president stick In Britain the liberal Guardian said Clinton should not be toppled by the affair The president would be wrong to commit perjury about his relations with Lewinsky but not perhaps so incredibly and shockingly wrong It said there was also some irony in expecting a president to be absolutely truthful on personal matters when he heads a government which often varnishes the truth or worse on matters of much graver importance The paper concluded This summer now seems likely to be remembered for the climax of the Lewinsky saga but it is not so earth shaking that it should bring the President down In an op ed article in the Times of London Anatole Kaletsky said Lewinsky s decision to testify before Kenneth Starr s grand jury was the best possible news for the White House before November s congressional elections In a straight contest between the word of the President and the testimony of a self confessed fantasist like Monica Lewinsky it is inconceivable that any American court or even a Republican Congress would unseat a hugely popular President And in the extremely unlikely event of a move to impeach Mr Clinton the same Washington commentators now goading the White House would suddenly turn on the Congress accusing the Republicans of trying to reverse the will of the people by abusing the legal system Kaletsky added Under the headline Clinton Presidency Holed by Starr the conservative British tabloid Daily Mail said in its main editorial Thursday that even if the Clinton presidency is able to run its course it already resembles a drifting hulk gutted by the tawdry activities of its skipper bereft of the moral authority and energising spirit that should emanate from his great office In an op ed piece in the conservative Daily Telegraph the president s chief British accuser Ambrose Evans Pritchard a former Washington correspondent turned his fire on Starr calling him a trimming limp wristed procrastinator with the zeal of a plump sheep who works part time on the job craves approval and bears the imprint of the last person who sat on him Evans Pritchard concluded that Clinton might survive He may skate yet as they say in Arkansas In the Age of Melbourne the city where Rupert Murdoch grew up an article analyzing the Murdoch divorce said it was very unlikely that this divorce will ever go to court Anna Murdoch s demand for full disclosure of his business interests was a ruse to wring a settlement out of the man known for his personal parsimony by hitting him where it hurts most The Murdochs were a family where business came first the article said and that meant two things First that the price for Murdoch of seeing that business survive in something like its current shape will be one of the most expensive divorce settlements ever recorded And second that the settlement will be reached out of court
