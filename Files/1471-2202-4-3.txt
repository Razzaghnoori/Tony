 Background The mammalian tachykinin peptides include neurokinin A NKA neurokinin B NKB and substance P SP 1 It is known that these three neuropeptides have a common C terminal amino acid sequence and that NKA and SP are derived from the preprotachykinin A gene whereas NKB is derived from the preprotachykinin B gene It is also known that the biological actions of NKA NKB and SP are mediated by three receptors named neurokinin NK 1 NK 2 and NK 3 2 Thus the tachykinins have been implicated in several physiological actions such as salivation the regulation of smooth muscle contraction depolarization of central neurons hyperactivity interaction with dopaminergic A 10 neurons mediating behavioral activation regulation of blood pressure and the transmission of the baroreceptor reflex 3 4 5 6 7 In addition a loss of tachykinin containing neurons has been described in neurodegenerative diseases 8 suggesting that the decrease in the amount of tachykinins could be involved in these and other diseases 9 10 Several inmunocytochemical in situ hybridization and radioimmunoassay studies have demonstrated the distribution of tachykinins in the rat the cat and the monkey CNS 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 In the human brainstem the presence of SP has been widely studied 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 Moreover in humans the neurokinin B system has been studied in the cerebral cortex hippocampus and the hypothalamus 28 However no data are available in the literature concerning the distribution of neurokinin immunoreactive structures in the human brainstem Thus in the present work we attempted to study in detail the distribution of fibers and cell bodies containing neurokinin in the human brainstem using an immunoperoxidase technique and to compare our findings with the distribution of other tachykinins previously described in the human brainstem 23 24 25 27 Finally we report here a widespread distribution of fibers and cell bodies containing neurokinin in the human brainstem Results Distribution of NK ir structures in the human medulla oblongata NK ir cell bodies A low density of immunoreactive cell bodies containing NK was observed caudally in the medullary central gray Figs 1A 4A whereas more rostrally Fig 1B such clusters of NK ir perikarya showed a moderate density At the latter level Fig 1B a moderate density was also observed in the dorsal motor

a previous study we described the distribution of NK ir structures in the cat brainstem 15 Although the presence of NK ir fibers is widely distributed in both cat and human brainstems it seems that the distribution is a little more widespread in humans than in cats Thus for example in the former we found NK ir fibers in the superior colliculus the restiform body the pyramidal tract and in the pontine nuclei in which in the cat no immunoreactive fibers were found 15 Comparing the distribution of cell bodies containing NK in both cat and human brainstems it seems that the distribution is widespread in the feline see 15 In both species NK ir perikarya were found in the periaqueductal gray and in the inferior colliculus However in the cat cell bodies containing NK were observed in the superior colliculus the interpeduncular nucleus the lateral reticular nucleus and in the nucleus of the solitary tract as well as in other brainstem localizations in which we did not observe NK ir cell bodies in the same brainstem regions of humans By contrast in humans we found NK ir perikarya located in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus in which in the cat no immunoreactive cell bodies were found 15 The differences observed in both species concerning the distribution of cell bodies containing NK could be due to technical considerations since in the cat colchicine was administered in the fourth ventricle in order to accumulate the peptide in cell bodies 15 Our data are in agreement with previous results described in the rat brainstem using radioimmunoassay techniques 29 30 Thus these latter authors found higher levels of NKA and lower levels of NKB in both the midbrain and the medulla oblongata of the rat 30 In both regions of the human brainstem we observed a high density of NK ir structures Moreover in the midbrain of the rat those authors described NKA in the substantia nigra the interpeduncular nucleus and the periaqueductal gray 29 just as we found NK ir structures in these nuclei of the human brainstem when using immunocytochemical techniques Several studies have shown the distribution of NKA preprotachykinin A mRNA 12 and NKB peptide 2 preprotachykinin B mRNA 14 16 17 20 in the CNS of the rat The work of Harlan et al 12 revealed a more widespread distribution of neurons encoding SP and NKA preprotachykinin mRNA in the rat brainstem than the distribution of NK ir cell bodies observed in the human brainstem In addition taking together the results of the other four works 14 16 17 20 it also seems that neurons expressing NKB are more widely distributed in the rat brainstem than those observed containing NK in the human brainstem However in the rat those authors did not find either NKA nor NKB in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and in the nucleus prepositus hypoglossi in which in humans we observed NK ir structures Future works must address the issue of whether the discrepancies observed in the distribution of neurokinin in both species are due to technical and or species differences Distribution of tachykinins in the human brainstem In comparison with previous works in which the distribution of SP was described in the human brainstem 24 25 26 27 it seems that in general taking together the results obtained from the four above mentioned works the distribution of NK ir structures in this region of the human CNS is quite similar Thus for example SP and NK ir structures have been observed in the same human brainstem areas such as the periaqueductal gray substantia nigra parabrachial nucleus inferior and superior colliculi reticular formation nucleus of the solitary tract red nucleus interpeduncular nucleus medial vestibular nucleus cuneate nucleus spinal trigeminal nucleus and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus However for example we found NK ir structures the antibody used in this study principally recognizes NKA see specificity of the antiserum in Methods in the human brainstem in the lateral cuneate nucleus and in the pyramidal tract in which no SP ir structure has been described in humans 24 25 26 27 It is known that both neuropeptides SP and NKA are derived from the same precursor Thus the differences found in the distribution of both neuroactive substances in the human brainstem could be due to the intraneuronal segregation transport of the peptides and or the different processing of the precursor see 31 Another possibility could be that the immunoreactivity observed in those nuclei of the human brainstem in which NK ir structures but not SP are found is due to NKB the antibody used here also recognizes NKB As is known this latter tachykinin derives from the pre protachykinin B gene whereas SP and NKA derive from another precursor the pre protachykinin A gene Finally SP immunoreactive cell bodies have been found in the human brainstem for example in the superior colliculus and in the spinal trigeminal nucleus 22 32 in which we did not find NK ir perikarya Possible physiological actions of the NK in the human brainstem The widespread distribution of NK ir structures in the human brainstem suggests that the peptide might be involved in several physiological actions acting as a neurotransmitter and or neuromodulator Thus for example the presence of NK in the nucleus of the solitary tract the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus the periaqueductal gray the spinal trigeminal nucleus the interpeduncular nucleus the substantia nigra the parabrachial nucleus and the superior and inferior colliculi indicates that NK could be involved in a broad range of physiological functions such as in cardiovascular anti nociceptive nociceptive motor respiratory visual and auditory mechanisms Moreover a possible interaction between NK and other neuropeptides e g neurotensin and somatostatin in the human brainstem could be suggested since in almost all the nuclei located in the dorsal brainstem of humans immunoreactive fibers containing NK neurotensin and somatostatin have been observed 33 34 This observation is in agreement with the results found in the cat brainstem in which a clear anatomical relationship between the three above mentioned neuropeptides has been indicated 15 Finally we hope that our study will serve to compare the distribution of NK ir structures found in normal human brainstems with those observed in the future in brainstems showing a given pathology e g Parkinson or Alzheimer disease since for example the loss of SP containing neurons has been described in the brainstem of people with Parkinson s disease 8 Conclusions 1 There is a widespread distribution of immunoreactive structures containing neurokinin in the human brainstem 2 The highest density of fibers and cell bodies containing neurokinin was generally observed in the dorsal part of the human brainstem 3 The widespread distribution of neurokinin immunoreactive fibers and cell bodies indicates that neurokinin might be involved in several physiological functions acting as a neurotransmitter and or neuromodulator Methods Immunocytochemistry In order to avoid possible interference by endogenous peroxidase free floating sections were treated with distilled water containing NH 3 20 H 2 O 2 30 and NaOH 1 for 20 min 35 Then the sections were washed for 20 min in PBS and preincubated for 30 min in PBS containing 1 normal horse serum and 0 3 Triton X 100 The sections were then washed for 30 min in the last solution containing caseine 0 5 and were incubated overnight at 4 C in PBS containing Triton X 100 0 3 and normal horse serum 1 as well as anti neurokinin antiserum and diluted 1 15000 1 30000 The sections were then washed in PBS 30 min and incubated for 60 min at room temperature with biotinylated antirabbit immunogamma globulin diluted 1 200 in PBS After a 30 min wash with PBS the sections were incubated for 1 h with avidin biotin peroxidase complex Vectastain diluted 1 100 Finally after washing the sections in PBS 30 min and Tris HCl buffer pH 7 6 10 min the tissue bound peroxidase was developed by H 2 O 2 using 3 3 diaminobenzidine as chromogen The sections were rinsed with PBS and coverslipped with PBS Glycerol 1 1 Specificity of the antiserum Polyclonal anti neurokinin antibody was raised in rabbits against immunogens prepared by coupling the synthetic NKA peptide Bachem Switzerland to a carrier protein human serum albumin with glutaraldehyde The specificity of the immunostaining was controlled by omission of the neurokinin antibody in the first incubation bath No immunoreactivity was found Moreover control sections were incubated in the primary antiserum previously absorbed by neurokinin A or neurokinin B Inhibition of staining was obtained after preincubation of the first antiserum with neurokinin A 10 4and 10 5M or with neurokinin B 10 3M Moreover no significant reduction in immunoreactivity was observed on incubating the first antiserum with an excess of SP eledoisin or kassinin Thus the antibody used in the present work principally recognizes NKA but shows some cross reactivity with NKB For this reason the term neurokinin like immunoreactive NK ir is used to described the staining results in our material However we have to indicate that the immunoreactivity found in this study is mainly due to NKA see and compare Figs 6B 10A 11A 11B since the distribution of NKB is much less widespread in the human brainstem in comparison with the distribution found for NKA personal observation obtained after using a very specific rabbit anti NKB antibody from Peninsula Thus the anti NKB antibody IHC 7357 showed the following crossreactivities 100 for NKB 2 for physalaemin 1 for eledoisin 0 6 for kassinin 0 2 for substance P 0 1 for NKA and 0 for neuropeptide K Moreover in the nuclei of the human brainstem in which NKB was observed the density of the immunoreactivity for NKB was lesser than that found in the same nuclei for NKA see and compare Figs 6B 10A 11A 11B Mapping Mapping was carried out according to the atlas of the human brain of Haines 36 and the same atlas was used for the terminology of the brainstem nuclei In addition the atlas of Paxinos et al 37 was consulted The number of immunostained cell bodies appearing in each section from each person was counted a high density of NK ir perikarya was considered when we found more than 20 cell bodies section a moderate density when we found 10 20 cell bodies section and a low density when we found fewer than 10 cell bodies section The density of the immunopositive fibers was graded under microscopic observation into four categories high moderate low and single This was accomplished by viewing the sections under bright field illumination at a constant magnification with reference to photographs of defined series of densities 38 Finally photomicrographs were obtained with a CoolSNAP digital camera attached to a Zeiss Axiophot microscope To improve the visualization of the results only the brightness and contrast of the images were adjusted without any further manipulation of the photographs Abbreviations used in figures 1 Caudal end of the motor hypoglossal nucleus 2 Caudal end of the dorsal motor nucleus of
