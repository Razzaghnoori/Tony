 okay i ll let you start first okay okay we um i m presently living in a house uh first time uh we had the house built and so this is our our fifth year in it i guess and uh um it was a really excitement to uh to go out and select a house and have one made and built and like you wanted it we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses and um as we did with probably ninety five percent of the people here in Dallas Fort Worth we bought a Fox and Jacobs home and they re good for about five years or four years and after that they start falling apart so i would um not recommend F and J house for my dog to live in uh because they re overpriced um but they re a cheap house if you can t afford something good you know they re good for that and um you can call it a home because it s a place to go home and keep the rain off your head but as far as the costs for what your getting uh the longevity of the house is not uh is not worth it how about in your case well in my case my husband is not a carpenter but in fact he s in electronics but he knew the only way we d ever have a new home is if he would build it so it took him about two and a half years but uh he built us a house it s uh we have thirty two hundred square feet and it s a brick house and pricewise it wasn t great because he did it all hisself you know so that way he could we could kind of control in control it um hum and um we live in kind of a small town um hum and i mean it s nothing fancy you know it s it s a house it s nice and it s real pretty and we re all comfortable in it well that s great that s great that s uh i ve heard i have another gentleman friend of mine who uh who had a house built matter of fact another guy s building one now he s been doing it for three years and the city s a little upset with him but i understand you save a lot of money off uh by doing that and uh oh you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else nothing wrong with that uh i ll vouch for that you know um so but uh of course my husband did everything except my brother s a trim carpenter and he came in you know and did the inside for us and that helped and and uh yes and uh we had to hire course the plumbing and the brick and everything else nothing you know he did everything else that was a big savings well that s great well have you been in it long we ve been in it six years oh really well have you do you have any plans to uh maybe um expand or move onward no no well well uh our kids are kind of still small now and we had thought before when they get a lot older we don t need such a large house that we ll sell it but he will not build a second one himself because he says agewise he ll never be able to handle that again yes yes i see well first one s always a bear we re having a an architect friend of mine design a house for us and uh that can basically be be be put on any lot in any state any country you know so that s kind of the um we just got with him and told him what all we wanted and he s charging about a buck a square foot to design it and he s registered certified and registered so at least we know we re it s not gonna fall in or something if it s built but uh i have heard uh huh yeah oh that your approach is is is right you can actually go out and sub it if even if you don t wanna get hands on you can even just sub it out the concrete and those kind of things and and that s kind of the plan i have so um uh everyone i talk to uh i ve uh huh yes i file in my little book and do other things with it uh that s great that s great but uh like i said otherwise you know a the the expense but you know we could not had one as large as we have if you know we hadn t did it ourself sure i can imagine yeah i mean it s not a Eldorado house or anything like that but you know it s ours if your happy with it that s all that counts that s right that s right that s only only uh you only have to uh satisfy yourself and no one else apparently apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high isn t it it really is ooh and that s uh that s uh a a encouraging sign if you ever wanna resell it i guess because i i m always shocked at about you know what they ve got have it appraised at i think oh my goodness a lot of money i bet well that s great well yeah i guess that about does it okay and it was nice talking to you okay bye bye nice talking with you too bye
