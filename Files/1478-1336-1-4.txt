 Background The nuclear receptor NR family comprises 48 structurally related transcription factors many of which require their cognate ligand for activity 1 2 3 The NRs regulate transcription by binding to response elements in the promoters of target genes and acting as scaffolds for the assembly of large coactivator and corepressor complexes 4 NR coactivators include the p160s including GRIP1 TIF 2 SRC 1 and AIB1 ACTR pCIP The p160s enhance transcription by binding histone acetyl transferases such as p300 CBP and pCAF 5 and methyl transferases such as CARM1 and PRMT 6 which in turn enhance transcription by modification of chromatin Other NR coactivators include TRAP220 7 which is part of a larger complex TRAP DRIP SMCC mediator that contacts the basal transcription machinery and PGC 1 8 a cold inducible coactivator that binds CBP and SRC 1 and proteins involved in RNA processing 9 NR corepressors include NR corepressor N CoR and silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid responsive transcription SMRT 4 Both N CoR and SMRT repress transcription at least in part by binding to histone de acetylases HDACs either directly or indirectly through other corepressor complex components Other known NR corepressors include RIP140 10 Hairless 11 short heterodimer partner SHP 12 and DAX 13 and receptor specific corepressors such as the estrogen receptor ER interacting proteins REA and HET SAFB 14 15 Generally NR transcriptional activity is dictated by the balance between coactivator and corepressor recruitment and one of the most important factors that influences this balance is the absence or presence of agonist ligands reviewed in 4 Unliganded NRs such as thyroid TRs and retinoid receptors RARs bind corepressors and ligand promotes release of corepressor and subsequent binding of coactivators The mechanism of this coregulator exchange is well understood NRs consist of three domains the N terminal domain which contains a context specific activation function AF 1 the central DNA binding domain DBD and the C terminal ligand binding domain LBD which contains a hormone dependent activation function AF 2 The unliganded LBD recognizes hydrophobic motifs termed interaction domains IDs which are reiterated three times in N CoR and twice in SMRT and conform to the consensus L IXXIIXXXL 4 see also 16 By contrast the liganded LBD binds shorter hydrophobic motifs termed NR boxes that are reiterated several times within each coactivator and conform to the consensus LXXLL The LBD utilizes a large hydrophobic cleft composed of residues along H3 and H5 to bind IDs 17 and a smaller hydrophobic cleft that is composed of residues in the upper part of H3 and H5 and H12 and corresponds to AF 2 to bind NR boxes 18 Thus agonists promote coregulator exchange by promoting the packing of H12 over the lower part of the ID binding region an event that simultaneously completes the coactivator binding surface In other cases however the balance of coactivator and corepressor recruitment is regulated by direct competition for the AF 2 surface rather than ligand dependent coregulator exchange RIP140 Hairless and DAX possess NR boxes that interact with AF 2 11 13 19 and these corepressors act as negative regulators of the activity of the liganded NR The NR family contains two related ERs ER and ER that conform to the typical three domain NR structure and share extensive sequence homology in the DBD and LBD region 20 21 Analysis of the function of the individual ERs in mouse knockout models suggests that the major proliferative effects of estrogen are mediated by ER and not by ER which seems to play an inhibitory role in proliferation in some studies 22 23 The ligand binding properties of the ERs are different with ER often exhibiting stronger binding to plant derived phytoestrogens 24 More importantly the ERs exhibit isoform specific effects on gene expression Both ERs enhance transcription from genes with classical estrogen response elements EREs but ER requires less ligand to obtain maximal activation than ER 25 26 Likewise both ERs suppress the activity of the TNF promoter in response to estrogens but ER is a more potent repressor than ER 27 However some of the most striking isoform specific differences in gene regulation are observed at promoters such as that of cyclin D1 which contain AP 1 sites or related cyclic AMP response elements CREs ER enhances AP 1 activity in response to estrogens 28 29 but ER inhibits AP 1 activity in response to estrogens 29 30 31 ER also completely suppresses ER activity at the cyclin D1 promoter and even suppresses the activity of an ER mutant that is selectively superactive at AP 1 sites and CREs 29 Finally ER shows a unique capacity to enhance AP 1 activity in response to selective estrogen receptor modulators SERMs such as raloxifene tamoxifen and ICI 182 780 Faslodex ICI 30 31 32 Together these observations suggest that there are fundamental differences in the way that the ERs bind unspecified cofactors that modulate gene expression and that some of these cofactors must play a role in differential ER activity at AP 1 sites Although the poorly conserved NTD region clearly plays an important role in isoform specificity 32 33 it is also likely that there are differences in the better conserved LBD region that contribute to differential ER and ER activities Phage display techniques have revealed that ER and ER show different preferences in LXXLL binding reviewed in 34 35 Moreover some cofactors that contain LXXLL motifs show differential binding to LBDs of the ER isoforms reviewed in 36 SHP binds ER preferentially 37 and represses ER activity more strongly than that of ER The PGC 1 related protein PERC also binds ER preferentially and potentiates ER activity more strongly than that of ER 38 We recently observed that ER binds the C terminal NR interacting regions of N CoR and SMRT in the presence of SERMs but not estrogens 39 In this study we report that ER interactions with N CoR and SMRT are promoted by agonists and inhibited by SERMs Thus the ERs show completely opposite ligand preferences of interaction with corepressors We discuss the potential significance of these different modes of ER interaction with N CoR in terms of known isoform specific behaviors Results Agonist Dependent ER Interactions with N CoR and SMRT To investigate ER interactions with corepressors we examined the interactions of full length ER amino acids 1 530 with bacterially expressed C terminal NR interacting domain of N CoR amino acids 1944 2453 in vitro Fig 1A Fig 1Breveals surprisingly that ER bound N CoR in the absence of hormone and in the presence of agonist ligands E2 DES and phytoestrogens genistein coumestrol Moreover these interactions were suppressed by SERMs ICI raloxifene and tamoxifen ER bound to the coactivator GRIP1 more strongly than N CoR but did so with an identical ligand preference Similar agonist dependent interactions could be observed between ER and the alternate NR corepressor SMRT in vitro Fig 1C Control binding experiments performed in parallel confirmed that ER bound to N CoR in the presence of SERMs and not estradiol Fig 1D and that TR bound N CoR in the absence of hormone and was released in the presence of T3 whereas TR only bound GRIP1 in the presence of T3 Fig 1E To examine interactions between ER and N CoR in mammalian cells we performed two hybrid assays using a GAL4 DBD N CoR C terminus fusion protein as bait and a VP16 ER LBD fusion as the prey Fig 2shows that the ER LBD bound N CoR in the presence of agonists and phytoestrogens but not SERMs Control two hybrid assays confirmed that a VP16 TR LBD fusion protein bound N CoR in the absence of hormone but not in the presence of T3 E2 dependent binding of ER to N CoR was dose dependent Fig 2B with an EC50 0 3 nM that resembled that of ER binding to the GRIP1 NR box region amino acids 610 770 Thus ER binds the N CoR C terminal NR interacting region in the presence of agonists but not SERMs and does so in vitro and in mammalian cells Moreover results from the two hybrid assay indicate that the ER LBD is sufficient to obtain estrogen dependent interactions with N CoR ER Interactions with N CoR are Dependent on AF 2 and require H12 Unliganded NRs usually bind ID motifs consensus L IXXIIXXXL in the N CoR C terminus To ask whether ER might bind these motifs in the presence of estradiol we examined the ability of peptides containing known NR interacting motifs to compete for the interaction Fig 3A A peptide overlapping to the N CoR ID1 motif amino acids 2265 2291 that competes for N CoR binding to unliganded TR and RAR 16 failed to compete for agonist dependent ER interactions with N CoR By contrast a peptide corresponding to GRIP1 NR box 2 did compete for this interaction 40 41 This finding suggests that agonist bound ER does not recognize ID motifs and that ER interactions with N CoR more closely resemble those with GRIP1 NR interactions with N CoR are usually mediated by a hydrophobic cleft that spans residues from H3 and H5 and includes residues that lie under H12 in the liganded configuration 4 17 These interactions are either independent of or inhibited by NR H12 17 39 42 By contrast NR interactions with coactivators are mediated by residues from the upper part of H3 H5 and also require H12 itself 18 Fig 3Bshows that a mutation in a conserved residue on H12 that is required for coactivator binding E493K abolished the interaction of ER with both N CoR and GRIP1 Moreover other mutations in the upper part of the H3 H5 region that comprises the AF 2 surface D303Y I310R and K314A on H3 V328R and L331R on H5 abolished ER interaction with both cofactors Control mutations in other regions of the ER surface left its interactions with N CoR and GRIP1 either slightly reduced or intact these are L301R at the base of H3 V361R in the S bends M379R in H8 L426R T434R in the H10 and Y488S in the H11 H12 loop Thus ER interactions with N CoR are dependent on the AF 2 surface including H12 and in this regard resemble those of ER and GRIP1 ER Binds an NR Box Like Motif in the N CoR C terminus To map the region of N CoR that interacted with ER we examined ER binding to a series of rationally designed smaller fragments of the N CoR C terminus Fig 4 ER did not bind two of these smaller fragments of N CoR 1944 2033 2230 2322 that contain known ID motifs IDs 3 and 1 16 ER bound weakly to two regions of N CoR 2033 2123 2123 2230 one of which 2033 2123 contains an ID motif ID2 but did so in a ligand independent fashion However ER did bind to a fragment that spanned the extreme C terminus 2322 2453 and did so in a manner that was promoted by E2 and suppressed by ICI much like the interactions of ER with the entire N CoR nuclear receptor interacting region The interaction of ER with the small N CoR C terminal fragment amino acids 2322 2453 was stronger than that observed with the intact C terminus amino acids 1944 2453 This apparently improved binding is likely to be a consequence of our methodology West et al Unpublished data In general expression of large fragments of the N CoR C terminus in E Coli yields a mix of full length protein along with truncated products To create the expression vectors for the smaller fragments truncated N CoR polypeptides that were obtained in E Coli extracts were subjected to protein sequence analysis and cDNA fragments that coded for the major truncated products were prepared Each of the resulting polypeptides was expressed very efficiently in E Coli The end product that was obtained after GST purification essentially consisted of a single short polypeptide as judged by Coomassie stain Binding of ER to N CoR 2322 2453 is probably very efficient for two reasons First equal amounts of GST fusion protein were used as baits for the translated ER protein in this series of experiments 3 g per assay Thus N CoR 2322 2453 is present in molar excess over N CoR 1944 2453 Second as developed above preparations of N CoR 1944 2453 generally contain truncated products so sequences corresponding to the extreme N CoR C terminus which binds ER is markedly under represented In any case the fact that ER binds weakly or not at all to the three N CoR ID motifs that mediate interactions with TRs and RARs and instead binds in an agonist dependent fashion to a region in the C terminus of N CoR that has not previously been implicated in NR interactions indicates that ER recognizes a novel protein sequence motif within N CoR The N CoR C terminus contains the sequence PLTIRMLS box amino acids 2399 2406 Fig 5 This sequence does not exactly conform to the LXXLL consensus but contains features underlined that resemble the ER H12 region L L LE ML and artificial ER interacting LXXLL peptides 293 P NLIS LLS D47 PL LLS LLS both of which bind to the ER AF 2 surface 43 44 45 46 47 Moreover the presence of a proline residue amino terminal to the hydrophobic groups is typical of so called class II LXXLL motifs which are found in ER interacting cofactors such as TRAP220 and RIP140 45 Finally the unusual C terminal hydrophobic pair ML has been observed in ER and ER H12 43 44 48 and in RIP140 NR boxes 19 We investigated the significance of the box in ER interactions with N CoR As Fig 6Ashows a synthetic box peptide competed for binding to N CoR albeit somewhat less efficiently than native GRIP1 NR box 2 Similar results were obtained in competition experiments that used GST GRIP1 instead of GST N CoR data not shown The isolated box also acted as bait for a VP16 ER fusion protein in mammalian cells and did so with similar efficiency to other known ER interacting peptides Fig 6B Finally mutations within the box especially M2405A L2406A disrupted ER interactions with N CoR in mammalian two hybrid assays but did not affect TR interactions Fig 6C Thus the box is sufficient to bind ER and is essential for agonist dependent ER interactions with the N CoR C terminus Next we examined whether the box would bind other NRs The Gal box fusion failed to recruit the ER TR or RAR LBDs in mammalian two hybrid assays Fig 7A Moreover while the box and GRIP1 NR box 2 peptides both competed for ER interactions with GRIP1 only the NR box 2 peptide competed for ER interactions with GRIP1 Fig 7B Thus the N CoR box is at least to some degree ER specific Mutation of N CoR to obtain a box sequence that more closely resembled a conventional LXXLL motif T2402L led to enhanced hormone dependent interactions with ER and permitted novel hormone dependent interactions with ER Fig 7C Thus some of the observed ER specificity is probably a consequence of an unexpected ability to tolerate the absence of a leucine residue at the N terminus of the LXXLL motif Together our results indicate that ER has the potential to utilize its AF 2 surface to bind NR boxes within coactivators or an NR box like sequence in the C terminus of N CoR A HDAC Repressor Enhances ER Activity Since ER bound N CoR and SMRT in the presence of estrogens we investigated the possible involvement of corepressors in the actions of agonist bound ER in vivo To perform this experiment we examined the effect of the HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A TSA on ER activity in transiently transfected HeLa cells Fig 8Aconfirms that ER shows stronger transcriptional activity than ER at a simple ERE responsive reporter gene TSA enhanced the basal activity of the ERE TK reporter gene by about fifteen fold in the absence of ER see inset However TSA also equalized the relative transcriptional activity of both ERs Fig 8Bshows that the isolated ER LBD exhibited more potent transcriptional activity than the ER LBD However both LBDs showed similar transcriptional activity in the presence of TSA Thus corepressor complex HDACs must play an unspecified role in restricting the transcriptional activity of both ER and in particular the ER LBD This is consistent with the notion that corepressors restrict the activity of agonist bound ER LBD Conclusions NRs generally interact with the corepressors N CoR and SMRT either in the absence of ligand or in the presence of receptor antagonists and agonists promote corepressor release 4 In this study we demonstrated that ER binds to N CoR in the presence of ER agonists such as estradiol and DES and the phytoestrogens genistein and coumestrol but not in the presence of SERMs Moreover this interaction is dependent upon ER AF 2 including H12 and is competed by NR box peptides but not ID peptides The hormone dependent component of the ER N CoR interaction maps to the extreme C terminus of N CoR which has not been previously implicated in NR interactions and requires a sequence that resembles an ER specific NR box PLTIRMLS box In this regard ER differs from ER which probably binds ID motifs in a SERM dependent fashion 49 50 and shows reduced binding to N CoR in the presence of estradiol 39 ER also differs from many other NRs which either bind N CoR in the absence of ligand and are released in the presence of ligand or interact with N CoR in the presence of antagonists but not agonists 4 The fact that the mode of ER interaction with N CoR resembles that of NRs with coactivators 4 or with corepressors that modulate the activity of liganded NR complexes such as RIP140 10 raises the possibility that ER may be able to recruit N CoR and SMRT to estrogen regulated promoters in response to agonists and that the balance of overall ER activity in the presence of estrogens may be regulated by competition between p160s and corepressors for the same ER AF 2 surface We recognize that our studies do not directly address this issue Our attempts to identify ER mutants that differentiate between GRIP1 and N CoR binding to analyze the role of agonist dependent corepressor binding have not yet been successful probably because ER utilizes the same surface to bind both cofactors Moreover transfection of N CoR or various mutated N CoR derivatives did not significantly affect ER activity at EREs or AP 1 sites data not shown We do not understand why but in our hands transfected N CoR also fails to affect TR or ER activity data not shown despite the fact that it clearly interacts with both NRs Nevertheless we suspect that estrogen dependent N CoR binding may represent an important component of the regulation of ER activity As described in the Introduction ER and ER must interact differentially with factors that modulate ER activity in the presence of estrogens The finding that estrogens suppress N CoR binding to ER 39 but promote N CoR binding to ER represents the first demonstration of a corepressor that shows completely distinct modes of hormone dependent interaction with the ER isoforms Thus N CoR and SMRT and their associated HDACs are excellent candidates to explain some of the differential behaviors of the ER isoforms Consistent with this notion the apparent weak transcriptional activity of the ER LBD is a consequence of corepressor HDAC activity at some level Fig 8 Full verification of the importance of ER interaction with N CoR will await demonstration that ER recruits N CoR and SMRT to estrogen regulated promoters in vivo and that this event is related to modulation of estrogen response While the ER isoforms have contrasting effects on AP 1 activity in the presence of estrogens ER truncations that lack the NTD and ER both enhance AP 1 activity in the presence of SERMs 30 31 Mutational analysis of ER action at AP 1 sites suggests these effects may be related to N CoR binding 39 and we have proposed that SERM action at AP 1 sites may therefore involve contacts with corepressors 31 51 The fact that ER and ER show completely different ligand preferences of interaction with N CoR suggests that the target for SERM activation at AP 1 sites may not be N CoR in both cases Thus this finding complicates our attempts to explain this unusual phenomenon Perhaps the ER isoforms enhance AP 1 activity by superficially similar mechanisms that involve different cofactors Alternatively ER and ER action at AP 1 sites could in fact be mediated by SERM dependent contacts with a common cofactor that is as yet unidentified This common factor may yet prove to be N CoR if ER interactions with the box were somehow masked in vivo What features of the box contribute to ER specificity Intriguingly the box contains N terminal proline and C terminal serine residues that extend the homology of this region to an artificial ER specific peptide 45 However the box also lacks the first Leu of the consensus LXXLL A mutation PL T IRML PL L IRML that restores the LXXLL consensus increases ER binding to N CoR and permits ER to bind to N CoR in the presence of estrogens in mammalian two hybrid assays Thus the unusual sequence of the box contributes to ER specificity and ER can tolerate the absence of a conserved N terminal leucine in LXXLL motifs ER might bind to yet more cofactors that contain variant NR boxes that resemble the box Other aspects of ER interactions with corepressors warrant further study It will be interesting to understand whether the weaker ER interactions with other regions of N CoR which are insensitive to ICI play a role in ER binding Fig 4 Finally SMRT also binds ER in the presence of estrogens but we have not explored the structural features that promote this interaction Intriguingly human SMRT contains a sequence insertion at the position of the hydrophobic pair in the N CoR box which apparently leads to deletion of both residues N CoR RMLS SMRT RLqagvmaS 52 Perhaps SMRT contains a different NR interacting motif or the N CoR NR box sequence may be more
