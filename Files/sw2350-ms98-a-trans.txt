 hi Debbie how are you oh just fine what do you think of this weather oh it s been beautiful here lately oh i love it yeah i was i was glad that Easter was nice because sounds like you have a child too yeah yes you can hear her huh yeah i ve i ve got a two year old and we hunted Easter eggs yesterday and the weather was really nice uh huh yeah i have a four year old and a one year old um hum so uh yeah i m glad it was nice too i we had a got a chance to to go outside and yeah just have a nice day the um i remember last year wasn t it raining a lot this yeah all that flooding and everything it was raining last year we had uh huh we i m glad we don t have that this year so far oh oh it was awfully rainy last year it was a it was a very very wet spring remember how they had all that flooding down uh south of downtown all those people got flooded out uh huh we live just north of Trinity Mills and it floods there you know oh did it quite a lot um it s not it doesn t usually damage any businesses or anything but you can t get off of thirty five to um oh really i did to go to Home Depot and that s a problem yeah oh gosh yes uh the a lot of people go there yes or Target for that matter now yeah i m i m we re not from Texas we re from further we re from Missouri so it s it s uh huh the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home yeah oh yeah yeah we re not from Texas either um we re i grew up in Pennsylvania so oh so you re really yeah it it s not like this in Pennsylvania no i like the winters but i don t like the summers down here it it s awfully hot it s terribly hot in the summer here i just yeah when we moved down here our we had a our vehicle didn t have an air conditioner oh you re kidding i m not well we didn t well i we really really don t need it very much in Missouri where we re from sure but um oh we suffered that first summer we traded that thing in as as soon as we could because it just it s indispensable down here to have air conditioning oh i m sure i i think you would probably it would be terrible down here yeah i d just i think it s a necessity we um we have i guess we bought that my car in Colorado that s where we we moved from and uh um hum oh so we we had a feeling we d be coming back this way and again there they don t sell all the cars with air conditioning it s you know it s really a not yeah it s it s almost a luxury oh it is you know uh we didn t have air conditioning in our house or anything oh yeah that would be nice oh i i get the the our electric bill in here July and August is just about kills me it s because it s so hot oh yes it does because i don t think they build them as energy efficient down here as they do up in the north i just really don t no i don t think so either no because of the winters winters i kind of miss winter since it it didn t do anything down here this winter oh no we didn t even have any of the famous Dallas ice storms no we didn t no we didn t did we no isn t that surprising that was that is surprising and i i it was uh really odd but we went home to Missouri at at at Christmas and i we had well we ran into town and in the ice uh huh oh as we were coming into town and then it snowed a half a foot oh my gosh so we got our fill we went home at Christmas well you know we lived in Colorado for four years i guess um hum so and we you know we had a lot of snow and i i really don t miss that yeah my husband says he certainly doesn t mind shoveling missing the shoveling i mean we had a big sidewalk and he didn t like that at all but yeah yeah i don t know i d rather have the snow than the ice yeah oh definitely because in Missouri we have a we have a lot of ice uh huh and snow but uh but the the ice is really bad because it knocks out power lines and and you just you just absolutely at least when you ve got snow just about everybody has four wheel drive vehicles that s right so the ice you know that s that s a whole you don t you don t need a four wheel drive vehicle you sit and spin uh it doesn t matter right Colorado wasn t bad for that because um it so at least in Colorado Springs where we lived it was so sunny most of the time uh huh that at right after it snowed it would almost always be a bright sunny day that s a and all of the roads would be clear you d still have the snow on the yard yeah the kids could play in it but it d be a bright sunny day and you know it would it would melt and you could drive around and it was really no big deal that d be nice did you all work at TI uh TI Colorado Springs yeah yeah oh okay we got we had a lot of people from my husband s old group that moved out there really yeah and they re still they re still out there though uh that s good they scaled down quite a bit they have a lot of changes out there lately did oh they re they are everywhere they that s true certainly not localized there no but we i don t know i i don t really miss the snow i miss the change of seasons myself yes uh huh the fall is what i really miss from Pennsylvania it just everything just kind of gives up and dies here yeah it just turns brown and makes a mess nothing pretty about it no it just the the trees just go to about the first of December and then just oh well it s time to die so it just it s just an ugly mess um hum my folks don t live in uh Pennsylvania anymore but for a long time i would purposely go back and visit in October yeah just so i could see the trees and the fall and such a pretty time yeah my grand my grandparents took a tour of the oh of the northeast this past Fall and they really enjoyed it they said that the color was just fantastic uh huh it really is and i think you don t this year i growing up there i just assumed that s how it was all over the country i never really realized it was such a local well yeah thing i yeah well the maple tree the maple maple trees have a lot to do with it maples make a lot of nice color yeah which there are none down here nope it s too hot for them we have a lot of Maple trees in Missouri so we have a lot of nice color too but uh the northeast really has the corner on that yeah they they do on the on the real nice color but uh i i like spring i like i like the reason it s i like that spring comes quickly here yeah i do too i m ready to get outside and get the kids outside and yes uh yes and seems to just even my one year old it really changes her temperament she can be in here all grouchy and oh put her outside and hey she s fine oh definitely oh my my my two year old she hates to be put in indoors anyway and just um hum well i think long winters would really mess up mess her up uh my my son born he was born in Colorado and when we first moved here um he was three i guess just turned three um hum and for the first week we were here it was over a hundred every single day it was in July oh whew yeah and he was lethargic he really he wasn t used to the heat at all he yeah huh uh would go outside and he d turn into a zombie and walk around like he didn t know what was going on but he s used to it now i think he s i mean i know he certainly doesn t like the heat but he doesn t become lethargic anymore yeah well when we moved down here it was it was June and and it was just like a shock uh huh how oh being it s just so much different i mean the heat when it gets hot in Missouri it it it ll get hot for a couple of days in the in the in the mid to upper nineties and people think it s terrible and then it and it always just goes away uh huh it just i just couldn t it was just oppressive the heat down here that s a good word for it and i just couldn t um make my family understand this is hot uh really hot so well it s been good talking to you well nice talking to you too hopefully we ll have some more good weather but oh yeah we ll see okay take it easy bye bye all righty bye bye
