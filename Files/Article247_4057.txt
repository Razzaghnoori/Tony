 Why Gore Paid His Accountants 4 Million Of the 40 million Al Gore s campaign will raise this year 4 million or roughly 10 percent will go toward the legal and accounting costs of meeting federal campaign finance regulations the New York Times estimates Why is Gore s bill so high Gore s bills are par for the course for candidates who participate in the government s matching fund program George W Bush and Steve Forbes aren t participating in the matching fund program because it comes with a 33 million spending limit Bill Bradley is The matching fund program disburses one dollar for every dollar donated by an individual to a campaign up to 250 If an individual donor gives the legal limit of 1 000 only 250 qualifies for one to one matching funds To qualify for matching funds campaigns must verify the addresses phone numbers signatures and occupations of all donors and constructing this paper trail can be costly For example if a campaign requests matching funds for a 500 donation from a joint checking account it must obtain a letter verifying that each person contributed half otherwise the campaign will receive only 250 of the matching funds Similarly the campaign s expenditures must be exhaustively documented to demonstrate that they comply with the campaign finance laws Monster accounting and legal bills like Gore s are so common that the Federal Election Commission allows presidential campaigns to automatically deduct 10 percent of the money they raise against the 33 million spending cap Some candidates often spend more than 10 percent on legal and accounting bills but they must document that fact to the satisfaction of the FEC Because the FEC adds new rules after each election cycle the complexity and costs of reporting continue to mushroom Most large campaigns outsource their regulatory accounting and since there are only a handful of firms that specialize in this area these services can be quite expensive Are they worth the bother and expense In Gore s case he spent 4 million to receive only 13 million in matching dollars Next question
