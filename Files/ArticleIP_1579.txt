 Risky Business Tell produced by Bob Squier of Squier Knapp Ochs for the Clinton campaign Windows or Mac download time 16 minutes at 14 4K Tell the Clinton campaign s new spot that aired two days before Bob Dole s acceptance speech all but defines a rapid response ad The spot capitalizes on the ambivalence greeting Dole s 15 percent tax cut proposal The latest CBS New York Times poll shows that voters aren t sure the cut is good for the country but still favor it 61 percent to 33 percent Tell s strategy is to highlight the cut s dangers without mentioning the benefits Tell begins with shots of the Old Dole filmed in the attack colors of black and white It rips Dole s economic proposal but avoids calling it a tax cut Instead the narrator warns of Dole s risky economic scheme He still won t tell us how he ll pay for it all The word risky displayed as a bold chyron atop the Dole footage bolsters this idea So does a quotation from Business Week also shown as a bold chyron asserting that under the Dole plan we can expect the deficit to balloon That Dole is silent about how he ll finance his scheme makes his plan sound like a Democratic giveaway program This is more political jujitsu from Clinton guru Dick Morris who continues to pre empt the other side Although the Dole proposal is straight out of Reagan s 1980 tax cut playbook Tell tilts not against Reagan but against Bush The next shots plunge the viewer into scenes from the Bush recession an empty factory a family apparently struggling to pay its bills a Plant Closed sign a bold 1991 chyron over a poster for a going out of business sale Tell poses the question Are you better off than you were five years ago and suggests that a vote for Dole would return us to the grim black and white of the past The spot s next target is the Republican Congress The narrator says that Dole s campaign co chair Sen D Amato note the studied political correctness of co chair might raise Medicare premiums to help pay for Dole s promises Again there is no mention of the 15 percent tax cut and the word help reminds the viewer that we still don t know how the Dole plan will be financed The message is driven home as the camera pans across a doctor s office to an elderly woman in a wheelchair Medicare is what broke the Gingrich Congress so Tell naturally pairs Gingrich with Dole who is shown yielding the microphone to Newt Better than any narrator s accusations this visual conveys the argument that it if Dole wins Gingrich will run the government and cut Medicare Social Security education Positioning Gingrich not Jack Kemp as Dole s running mate will be a recurring Clinton tactic The spot finally shifts to Clinton filmed at the White House in glorious color The previously ominous music is replaced with an uplifting theme Reaganism is reprised with a reference to a 100 billion tax cut but the tax cut is Clinton s This is the first time the magic words tax cut appear in Tell The message is that Clinton can make his cuts work while balancing the budget We see a worker clocking in while the narrator points to 10 million new jobs and as the spot cuts to a Kennedyesque Clinton with children it concludes with the phrase a better future Tell is essentially about the past Clinton s economic success vs Bush s recession and Gingrich s Congress Expect Dole to respond by emphasizing that his 15 percent tax cut solves the problem not yet addressed by the Clinton recovery that real wages for most workers have stagnated With Dole at last in the race and equal to Clinton in campaign dollars the struggle to define the choice will peak Will voters go for the Dole tax cut the Republican equivalent of a 15 percent wage increase Or will they stay with a president who claims to have ended the Bush recession and who offers a lesser tax cut Framing the election around the desirability of tax cuts is risky business for Clinton since the age of Reagan the public assumes that the Republicans are the anti tax party Robert Shrum
