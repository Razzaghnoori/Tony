                um i guess my feelings are that uh we almost have a universal health care system uh to a great degree except that now i read where weve left out about thirty four million people   oh   and um i dont know exactly how were gonna cover many of these people because im sure that some of them uh dont uh dont have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i i have a feeling since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get that this uh then becomes an obligation of the government because its gonna become an obligation of either state local or federal government anyway   yeah because when people cant pay they end up going to clinics or you know to public hospitals and that kind of thing and you know   well it seems to me that that im paying anyway because when i go or my insurance carrier anyway when i pay something the bills seem inordinately high   oh definitely   and the reason that theyre inordinately high is because that has to cover the costs for the indigent people who apparently dont have the money or the wherewithal to do that   right yeah yeah   would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who uh employ these people and pay them uh you know subminimum wages or whatever were asked to share to share their fair burden of this too just as my employer is and myself i guess   yeah yeah yeah yeah that sounds like a good idea my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government i dont know do we wind up with more red tape and more problems so yeah yeah   well well who who else is gonna do this then i mean its worked successfully in Europe ive heard all these stories about i travel extensively   umhum   and spend uh maybe half a year in Europe every year and i find that the health care programs there   oh   uh are administered with uh at least people i talk to with uh a great deal of integrity and uh people dont seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree as a matter of fact if im injured or   yeah   have an emergency when im say in Germany or France uh that im automatically taken care of i mean i dont even have to pay   wow yeah well i think part of the the tremendous benefit of that is that theres so many people who wait now because they dont have the money until you know they have no preventative measures because people um you know just go on and on and on i mean so many people dont even get prenatal care or and it just extends with if if it what what would be a minor problem to deal with if they had a help available early on becomes just this horrendous you know burden on the taxpayers theyre saying now that one out of every ten child born in in public hospitals is addicted to crack well you know   well i uh uh i i i know it i have a solution you see uh my my solution even though im rapidly approaching the uh the age when ill qualify for Medicare and Medicaid i i my mother and father both uh uh well my fathers not living but my mother is   umhum   and they are um of of an advanced years and when i see the money thats poured down the down the drain on Medicare and Medicaid i mean the absolute uncontrollable situation that we find ourselves in and the extraordinary amounts   yeah   i know that because those people vote i mean theyre the ones who get out and vote thats whats robbing a poor mother of the prenatal prenatal care the young people arent getting the proper care that they need and nutrition i think   yeah yeah   and were spending on these useless many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people   oh its just unbelievable how much you go through when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar CAT scan and i mean a chiropractor got it in one time it was just strange   thats right i mean it does seem like were the the the now i noticed just the other day in the paper that that Medicare will be based payments will be based not uh just on cost but on cost effectiveness so i guess   oh well that should help   well i dont know uh well see how that goes i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment but well see what happens   yeah oh i see oh gosh   well listen uh i think ive ive exhausted my uh self on at least ive blown off steam of the way i feel about it   okay well  okay thank you byebye   okay see you next time bye
