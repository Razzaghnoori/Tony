 April 20 2000 Dear I hope this correspondence finds you and your family doing well I am writing in regards to our alma mater Cathedral High School and her Annual Fund Drive It is a privilege and honor to be asked to serve as your Annual Fund class representative Cathedral High School is indeed a special and exciting place Your loyal support and generosity clearly make a difference As many of you may be aware this academic year Steve Helmich began his tenure as Cathedral s fifth president Mr Helmich brings many unique gifts to the position His outstanding leadership skills will serve Cathedral exceptionally well The future of Cathedral High School under the leadership of President Steve Helmich is indeed bright The Cathedral Report is a good one The school is enjoying full enrollment with many accomplishments being achieved by students and graduates We continue to place many of our graduates into top schools across the country Our dedicated faculty works extremely hard to give all of our students every opportunity to reach their potential The Science Department is in the process of renovating the labs and other facilities in order to provide our students with science instruction that is second to none A local software company has generously donated a complete analysis of our computer hardware and software needs so that the school can offer faculty and students the most up to date information technology Needless to say this is a must if we are going to continue to offer a top notch education to our young people We are doing everything we can to adjust to the new economy Each year Cathedral High School makes a general solicitation of parents alumni and friends Last year our Annual Fund Drive raised a record 365 000 The Annual Fund plays a significant role in providing financial assistance to those students who cannot meet the ever increasing cost of a quality education Tuition for the 1999 2000 school year is 6 250 and is expected to go up next year Approximately 25 of the current Cathedral student body receives some amount of financial assistance So you see the purpose of this fund is about need and helping worthy but less fortunate students who without your help would not be able to attend the school of their choice Please think about a donation to Cathedral this fiscal year which ends June 30 2000 Your help is needed more than ever Cathedral has made great progress but is continually challenged to do more Small private high schools face a constant pressure to raise funds in order to keep up with the public funded schools with their unlimited access to taxpayer dollars The battle never ends Cathedral provided us with a good education and a great foundation for our futures Please help make that same opportunity available to some deserving students today Thanks in advance for your support Sincerely Michael P Alerding 67
