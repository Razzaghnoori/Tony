 Background Double strand ds breakage of chromosomal DNA is obviously a serious threat to cells because various activities of the chromosome gene expression replication and partition depend on its integrity However recent experiments suggest that such chromosomal ds breakage may occur relatively frequently during normal growth in several organisms in bacteria 1 2 yeast 3 and chicken cells 4 In Escherichia coli spontaneous breakage and degradation of the chromosome associated with a replication fork were predicted from early genetic analysis and were detected under various conditions of altered replication for review see 5 DNA ds breaks play a key role in homologous recombination From a DNA ds break RecBCD enzyme starts degrading DNA for review see 6 When it encounters a specific sequence called Chi it promotes its pairing with a homologous DNA Even in the absence of RecBCD enzyme sbcA mutation confers other recombination pathway called RecET pathway The recE gene product of the Rac prophage converts dsDNA ends into 3 protruding single stranded form and the recT gene product promotes recombination by annealing them with a homologous DNA in its vicinity for review see 7 8 This recombination may result in one progeny DNA non conservative recombination or two progeny DNAs conservative double strand break repair 9 In a recBC sbcBC background a ds end stimulates homologous recombination that results in only one progeny DNA non conservative recombination 10 Analysis of the stimulation of recombination by replication for review see 11 and analysis of altered chromosomal replication for review see 12 led to the proposal that a chromosomal ds break formed during replication fork arrest triggers homologous recombination which would reconstitute a replication fork for review see 5 Game and his colleagues have developed a sensitive means of detecting chromosomal ds breakage using a circular chromosome 3 Under most conditions of pulsed field gel electrophoresis a circular yeast chromosome and circular bacterial chromosomes will not enter the gel very likely because they are trapped by the branches of the network of agarose 3 13 14 One double strand break transforms this circular form into a linear form which can now move slowly in the gel 3 We used this procedure to detect double strand breakage of a circular bacterial chromosome occurring spontaneously or after loss of a restriction modification gene complex 15 16 We found increased chromosome breakage in recBC null and recC1002 mutants of E coli under both conditions 1 Michel and her colleagues used pulsed field gel electrophoresis to detect degraded chromosomal DNAs arising spontaneously in recBC mutants and arising during replication fork arrest 2 RuvABC proteins which catalyze migration and cleavage of Holliday junctions are responsible for the occurrence of the degraded DNAs following replication fork arrests 17 In this work we employed the pulsed field gel electrophoresis procedure to measure large non circular forms of the chromosome obtained from various recombination defective mutants in rec recBC sbcA and recBC sbcBC genetic backgrounds Results Effect of growth medium on the accumulation of large chromosomal fragments Large linear chromosomal fragments were measured by pulsed field gel electrophoresis In our analysis growing E coli cells are harvested embedded in an agarose plug and lysed in situ The chromosomes in a plug are electrophoresed in varying electric fields An example of such a gel is shown in Figure 1 The DNA is partitioned in three places in the gel the well the area just below the well marked by a bar to the right of the gel and the lower area Intact circular chromosomes stay in the well 3 14 likely because they are trapped in the branches of agarose resin 13 Large linear forms generated by a ds break in this circle would escape from agarose trap and form broad bands beneath the well marked by the bar This area corresponds to unbranched linear forms DNA of more than 2000 kb when compared with yeast chromosome markers When the DNAs become smaller by degradation they will migrate further These interpretations are based on a previous work with a yeast circular chromosome and on our analysis of E coli chromosomal breakage after loss of restriction modification genes 3 15 16 In this work we focus on the second DNA species the huge linear forms in the area just below the well Figure 1 marked by the bar In the experiment shown in Figure 1 a rec strain in AB1157 background grown in minimal medium M9 Figure 1 lane 2 gave rise to some of these huge linear DNAs in this area There was less of this DNA species when the cells were grown in a rich medium LB Figure 1 lanes 3 In an isogenic recB21 recC22 strain the amount was larger than in rec We do not know why the medium makes such a difference It could reflect properties of the spontaneous DNA damages the replication fork the number of replication forks the number of chromosomes the organization and structure of the chromosomes the repair machinery or the availability of homologous chromosomes for repair All of these features will influence the chromosome stability not only in rec but also in mutants This medium dependence is in the opposite direction to what is simply expected from generation of a double stranded chromosomal end by collapse of a replication fork with another replication fork moving in the same direction 18 because replication initiation should be more frequent in a rich medium than in a poor medium Whatever the reason we chose to use the rich medium in which the rec strain produce less linear forms because the background is clear and may allow sensitive detection of their increase in a survey of various recombination defective mutants recand ruvmutations The accumulation of huge linear DNAs was also seen in other recBC null mutants in this AB1157 genetic background recB21 recC22 and recC73 Figure 2A and in another V66 genetic background recC73 Figure 2B as observed earlier 1 2 A recD mutant showed no accumulation The other non null recBCD alleles examined recC1001 recC1002 recC1003 recC1004 recC2145 recB2154 and recB2155 did not accumulate the huge linears Figure 2B We do not know why the same mutant allele recC73 shows more accumulation in V66 background than in AB1157 background in a reproducible manner Figures 2Aand 2B The other mutants tested recA recF recG recJ recN recO recQ recR ruvAB and ruvC did not accumulate huge linear DNAs The recF mutation partially suppressed the effect of the recC73 mutation in accumulating the huge linear chromosomes Figure 2B recBC sbcAbackground In the recBC sbcA strain an sbcA mutation on the Rac prophage expresses recET genes which promotes homologous recombination at a ds end 7 The accumulation of the huge linears was seen with recA recE recT recJ recQ recF recO and recR strains Figure 2C Mutations in genes involved in processing Holliday structures recG ruvAB and ruvC did not lead to their accumulation The accumulation by recJ mutation was suppressed by a recQ mutation Figure 2C lanes 7 and 15 recBC sbcBCbackground In the recBC sbcBC strain RecBCD enzyme is inactive and RecFOR and RecQJ proteins promote recombination together with RecA 19 In the recBC sbcBC background recA recF recJ recQ and recR mutants accumulated these huge linears to varying extents Figure 2D However again the ruvC mutation did not lead to accumulation Control experiments These assays were carried out more than twice for each strain and the extent of accumulation of the linear forms was reproducible The DNA in the area just below the origin was also measured by densitometry to confirm the above results data not shown When the chromosomal DNA in the agar plug was digested with a restriction enzyme Xba I before the pulsed field gel electrophoresis all the strains examined produced comparable amounts of DNA Figure 3 This amount is much larger than the large linear forms This indicates that the total amount of undegraded DNA associated with the cells is comparable for all the strains Discussion We found that large non circular forms of the chromosome accumulate in varying amounts in various recombination defective mutants of Escherichia coli Our operational definition of the non circular forms is their presence in an area just below the well in our pulsed field gel as marked by a bar in Figure 1 The molecular species in this area may not be limited to a simple linear form of varying lengths If a chromosome carries multiple replication forks as usual at 37 C in rich media more than one double strand break may be necessary to form a non circular branched species which should be able to move through the gel Finding out macroscopic forms of these giant molecules would be a technical challenge see 20 for example We do not know why DNAs make two broad bands in this area Figure 1 4th lane for example either Depending on the electrophoresis condition one narrow band a pair of two bands or one very broad band was observed data not shown Abundance of these huge non circular forms is expected to be affected by several factors which might work potentially in opposite directions such as i breakage in the cell ii degradation in the cell iii repair in the cell iv breakage and degradation out of the cell Each term is in turn affected by other factors such as chromosome organization number of the replication forks speed of the replication forks abundance of specific proteins and so forth Therefore our finding of accumulation of more of the non linear forms in a rich medium than in a poor medium Figure 1 does not immediately allow us to conclude that starving conditions induce a chromosomal double strand breakage Spontaneous DNA damages repair and degradation are expected to be the key processes in interpreting our data Spontaneous DNA damages may interfere with replication fork progression and produce chromosomal double stranded breaks This would lead to extensive exonucleolytic degradation Complete repair at some of these steps would reconstitute a circular chromosome which will stay in the well On the other hand further degradation of the huge non circular forms would result in shorter or no fragments which will run faster in the gel The presence of huge linear forms therefore probably indicates both the absence of complete repair and the absence of further degradation The absence of the large linears could either mean the presence of complete repair or the presence of extensive degradation activity Our control experiments demonstrated that restriction digestion of chromosome DNAs before the electrophoresis results in release of comparable amounts of DNA from the wells in all the strains examined Figure 3 This result at least excludes the possibility that the absence of the large non circular chromosomes in some strains Figure 2 reflects the absence of DNAs in the wells during the process or by extensive and general nuclease action Of course we cannot exclude the possibility that the broken chromosomes specifically have suffered extensive degradation In spite of these potential complexity and essential ambiguity our measurements provided a unique clue to the action of recombination associated enzymes in the chromosome metabolism Indeed some of our observations in the mutants can be readily related to the established properties of the affected enzyme Accumulation of the huge linear DNAs in the recBC null mutants can be interpreted from the known properties of RecBCD enzyme in a straightforward way These null mutant enzymes cannot degrade DNA from a ds break nor can they repair DNA by recombination 6 We assume that they cannot repair the broken chromosomes to form intact circular chromosomes and that they cannot degrade them into smaller pieces The recD mutant does not show nuclease activity but is recombination proficient and able to repair the broken DNA molecules 6 This explains why it does not accumulate the huge linear forms The other non null recBCD mutants recC1001 recC1002 recC1003 recC1004 recC2145 recB2154 and recB2155 are all nuclease positive 21 22 They would be expected to degrade the huge linears They retain some to nearly complete recombination proficiency 21 22 which may contribute to repair of the large linears into circles The other recombination defective mutants in otherwise rec background did not accumulate the huge linears probably because the DNA was degraded by active RecBCD enzyme or was not produced Partial suppression of the accumulation of the huge linears in a recBC null allele by a recF mutation Figure 2B leads to several possible explanations For example RecF mediated homologous recombination may transform a circular chromosome possibly with a spontaneous damage into some type of non circular forms This is expected because RecF mediated recombination is non conservative in the sense that it generates only one progeny DNA molecule from two parental DNA molecules 10 Alternatively RecF function may somehow help generation of broken chromosomes or maintenance of break to load RecA 23 In the recBC sbcA and the recBC sbcBC backgrounds the absence of RecBCD nuclease may prevent faster degradation of the large non circular DNAs However we see only little accumulation of the broken forms One might expect that the accumulation of the huge linears may correlate with the capacity for recombination repair that reconstitutes a circular form Indeed the effects of recA recJ and several other rec mutations on accumulation of the huge linear chromosomes in these two recBC backgrounds Figures 2Cand 2D were similar to their negative effects on conjugational recombination 19 with interesting exceptions see next paragraph This accords with the concept that a huge linear fragments of the chromosome is involved in recombination following conjugation However any of the recombination mutants that lead to accumulation of linear DNA could affect the probability of breaks occurring in the first place The mutations in Holliday structure processing enzymes RecG RuvAB and RuvC did not result in accumulation of the huge linears even in the recBC minus background The complex intermediate forms accumulating in these mutants may be trapped in the agarose gel see 24 25 An alternative interpretation could be that these enzymes may be involved in generation of double strand breaks as hypothesized by Seigneur et al 17 The accumulation by the recJ mutation in the recBC sbcA background is suppressed by a recQ mutation Figure 2C Kusano et al 26 found that both sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and decreased association of crossing over with double strand break repair in a recBC sbcA recJ strain are suppressed by mutant recQ alleles Such suppressing relationship was interpreted to suggest that RecQ acts prior to or concurrently with RecJ Pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis of chromosomes after ultraviolet irradiation has revealed extensive chromosome degradation dependent on uvrA incision enzyme 27 A report 28 showed that RecQ and RecJ proteins process nascent DNA at replication forks blocked by ultraviolet irradiation prior to the resumption of DNA synthesis see also 29 The accumulation of the non circular broken chromosomes correlated with the growth rate or DNA damage response in most of the recBC minus background 30 The recB or recC null mutation showed low viability even in the absence of exogenous DNA damage 31 32 A simple interpretation of these data is that RecA RecFOR and RecQJ functions and RecET functions for the sbcA background repair chromosome breakage and or prevent generation of the breakage The major contradiction observed here is the phenotype in ruv mutants The ruv mutants in all the background did not show any accumulation of the broken chromosome This may suggest that the possible role of Ruv protein is making a break into dsDNA 33 Conclusions Our sensitive measurements of the large non circular forms of the chromosome which should be able to detect one ds break out of 4 million bp provided unique sets of data that would help in further elucidating the mechanisms of chromosome double strand break repair A simplest interpretation of our data is that RecBCD enzyme is involved in repair and degradation of broken chromosomes and that RecA RecFOR RecQJ and RecET functions are involved in prevention and or repair of the breakage Interaction was observed between a recC mutation and a recF mutation and between a recQ mutation and a recJ mutation ruvABC mutants and a recG mutant did not accumulate broken chromosomes Further molecular analysis would bring about interpretation
