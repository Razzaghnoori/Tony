 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudie As just an ordinary citizen I could never have believed that I would become embroiled in the presidential scandal Not publicly of course but among my circle of friends Although I am not a wagering sort I foolishly made a bet with a friend before the president s first apology I insisted that he would not come forth with a public mea culpa My friend insisted that he would After some heated discussion we agreed to place a 5 wager on the whole sordid mess thus adding five more dollars to the 40 million cost Now that the president has spoken I am in a terrible quandary I am a law abiding honorable decent citizen and I stand by my responsibilities and my debts But the question is What is my debt Was that speech a mea culpa I say No My friend says Yes I have thought of a Solomonic approach in which I would send 2 50 to my friend and he would send 2 50 to me but I am also a principled person and it is my view that this was no mea culpa and I am backed by many commentators such as Mike Kelly who said in the Washington Post This speech wasn t a mea culpa It was an everybody else culpa I do not want to seem cheap but if one parsed that speech perhaps one might settle on it being one twentieth of a mea culpa I would then owe my friend 25 cents Is there any way at all that you can help me do the right honorable and principled thing here You be the judge Heads or Tails Dear Heads Prudie is not a betting parlor but she sympathizes with you having had her own doubts about that speech Since there is disputation about what exactly got said and your bet was with a friend Prudie suggests the two of you go out to lunch Dutch and devote some of the luncheon conversation to the sad and shabby affair You are right that there was no obvious winner in your wager not you your friend or even alas the president And by the by Prudie could not help thinking that had Mr Clinton waited 24 hours to give that speech it might have been quite different Prudie compromisingly Dear Prudence I have a loving daughter beautiful intelligent but not always self assured She has been living with a musician for nine years She is 29 a schoolteacher and working on her master s He is a popular trumpet player with his own band Here is my question I m worried about my lovely daughter s future though that s her business I keep my mouth shut But when it comes to occasions such as his birthday or Christmas am I supposed to just send a card or do I treat him like my other sons and send a gift G in Arizona Dear G Goodness nine years is longer than Prudie s marriage to her starter husband so the young people certainly sound committed to each another The problem Prudie divines is not that you don t care for the young man but that you wish the children were married Try to put your parental concern aside since 1 you don t get a vote and 2 marriage isn t for everyone Since the young man with a horn is your daughter s spouse equivalent by all means treat him as a son or a proper in law Who knows The family feeling may have a positive effect Prudie hopefully Dear Prudence I need some ideas I m a 21 year old man and I just moved to a new city and a new job I m having difficulty meeting women One might wonder how that s possible given the plethora of meeting places most big cities offer my age group but my troubles are twofold First I don t drink don t like the taste or the fuzzy headedness and second I can t stand loud music I don t mind other people drinking though it s not a moral thing And I tend to cough when confronted with cigarette smoke Anyway I ve tried bookstores without any luck and the average patron s age at the local dance studio is about twice mine Churches and the like are out too since my atheism probably wouldn t go over too well at such functions Do you have any ideas for me Do I have to start drinking believing and packing Advil for the music headaches Clueless in the Capital Dear Clue Do not start hitting the bottle for starters If the need arises to order a drink try Prudie s favorite cranberry juice and soda in a wine glass Also hang in there with your boycott of deafness inducing music The only people you would find there anyway are those whose musical taste would clash with your own You also need not find religion or feign it to meet women Simply get out and about Try affinity groups classes volunteer groups of interest to you singles nights at the supermarket etc And don t neglect to put out the word to friends and co workers that you re available A 21 year old man who is a teetotaler and appreciator of good music sounds very desirable for a young woman of taste And don t dismiss the fact that the numbers are in your favor Washington D C has more women than men for reasons unknown to Prudie Good luck Prudie socially Dear Prudence I keep on wondering about the president s current situation Why would anyone be interested if the president had an affair I could not care less what he does in his personal life I know he has plunged himself in deep waters for committing perjury that does interest me but why does everyone make such a fuss about his affair with silly Monica Lewinsky anyway She is a grown up they knew what they were doing it was certainly not harassment Please help me clear up my thoughts Confused Mone From Mexico Dear Con Well as to why anyone would be interested perhaps it s an American thing For whatever reason we are unlike Europeans and apparently Mexicans always interested in the sex lives of the famous Maybe this is none of our business but that s probably why we are interested Prudie suspects the Lewinsky situation became wildly interesting for the following reasons She was near the age of the Clintons daughter she was a low level employee she was not looking for financial gain she was er Rubenesque and she was a source of interest to the president for a relatively long time And you are right It certainly was not harassment Remember too that one of this president s defining characteristics is his Hot Springs gene the one that impels him to chase skirts A fitting coat of arms for William Jefferson Clinton might carry the legend veni vidi vice I came I saw I partied Prudie regretfully
