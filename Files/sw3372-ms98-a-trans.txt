            go ahead   um i havent given this a a lot of thought im uh id thats a whole pleased with the practice practice that is they i uh i dont you would favor invasions of privacy on the other hand id say arguable that that that uh people whos jobs are critical to to public safety should have to meet special standards uh i havent given this matter enough thought   do you work for TI   no uh uh im in the Washington area i work for NIST   oh oh okay oh all right well see we have the testing already here weve had it for oh about five years it used to just be for new employees   umhum   and now its for all employees they uh randomly select employee numbers and uh the day that they select you is when you have to go and and be tested so were familiar with it   and now and how do people feel about it   uh we have a lot of um people upset about it at the beginning some not all but what was happening at TI is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse um mainly the areas where where they were doing a lot of um manufacturing type things and what they ended up doing is um kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing you know on the premises   well okay thats thats a very different issue   well yeah it it was you know combination of of uh both activities and uh and using too so they developed this uh drug policy so that uh to eliminate theres some parts of the company that we do uh government contracts and i think some of those require the drug testing but now TI thought well well just do it for all employees that um not just because of safety issues but because we want a totally drug free safe environment for all people to work in and that we shouldnt have um people on drugs within our you know offices and such i havent personally ever been tested but i dont have a problem with it   and um does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs   no but one thing that to to me was um going on stretching it a little too far was that they also check um if youre taking somebody elses prescription drug you know it happens a lot of times like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever and you know then they give it to everybody else in the family and dont always go back to the you know doctor and get another prescription   hm   well according to what they do at TI if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name it you know it cant be in your spouses name so they will look i mean the testing will look for i guess any kind of drugs and you have to tell them what youre taking a prescription for   so they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking   right yes yes when you get tested youre supposed to tell them you know everything that that might be there and then if they ever um question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name   okay well well i mean its i would guess that in fact they dont test for for they dont routinely test for very many prescription drugs but that i but they dont tell you in advance uh so   well what they were be testing for are the ones that would have like you know barbiturates or codeine things like that in them   the ones that would constitute controlled substances or something anyway   right right i guess thats what is they wouldnt be looking for penicillin and antibiotics antibiotics and stuff theyd be looking for the yeah controlled things barbiturates amphetamines   so what theyre asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs youre taking which are controlled substances   right right you pretty much you know put down what you remember even if it is was just Contact or something like that but afterwards uh maybe if you had a controlled substance  well you you probably put down you know you had Drixoral or Contact if you would remember that you did it   is Contact a what okay is Contact a   no im just saying you probably probably put down on the sheet anything you have taken but if they had a controlled substance maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name   substance okay okay   i know i had one contract employee through manpower was not a TI person but was it contract person and they test them too even if you are not a real uh TIer if you are a contract employee here they test you too   umhum umhum   and he had taken some kind of um oh you know uh just he had some kind of flu or something he got a real bad migraine and he took his mothers
