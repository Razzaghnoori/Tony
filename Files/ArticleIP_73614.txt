                                 Changing Tallulah            Hereis how we spend the first halfhour of every day in Paris            Eachmorning between  and  Tallulah begins to sing Shes only  months oldso she doesnt know any words Still she sounds as if she is practicing herscales I crawl out of bed and tumble downstairs to turn on the heat rigged bythe French handyman so that it cannot run for more than about  hours on endwithout busting I then clean up the mess invariably left by Vegas on thekitchen floorone of several evil new tricks she has picked up from the localdogsand toss her out into the garden For a minute or so I watch through thewindow to make sure she doesnt get any ideas about the Camembert Like Frenchpeople we now keep our smelly cheeses in planting pots outside Imprisoned inthe refrigerator the Camembert still had the power to stink up the entirehouse Id open the door to grab a cold drink and be driven backwards by theodor a minute later whoever was on the third floor would shout in panickytones Shut the fridge Shut the fridge Relations with the cheese hadreached the point where one of us had to go            OnceVegas is past the Camembert I turn and race upstairs to snatch Tallulah fromher crib before she stops singing and becomes outraged Coming up the stairs Ising Old McDonald Had a Farm On his farm he had a rooster I assumeCockadoodledo is the signal for Tallulah to reach out with her arms and belifted from her crib Rising she smiles and kicks her feet as if somethingreally great is about to happen I try not to disappoint Together we draw thecurtains on the thirdfloor windows and peer up at the back of the crepuscularneighboring apartment building to see if any French people are doing anythingparticularly French They are sleeping This is a nation of vampires ourstreets are empty each morning until nearly  Coo Tallulah says aftera minute of staring at the old building then swivels and tosses her warmlittle arms around me in her version of a bear hug            As wemove to the changing table the mood shifts The moment she is laid on her backTallulah loses her love for me and becomes as impatient as a racecar driverwaiting for the tires to be changed To keep her still enough to be unwrappedcleaned and then wrapped again I must find ever more exotic ways to trick herinto thinking something worth paying attention to is about to happen righthere in her own bedroom She never falls for the same trick twice Thismorning for instance I danced the Parisian Trash Bag Dancea performance shewatched less with amusement than with a kind of morbid fascination TheParisian Trash Bag Dance involves grabbing one of the giant blue trash bagsthey sell at the local market and swishing it back and forth over my headalluringly while swaying my hips like Salom charming Herod Once Tallulah ismesmerized I am able to remove one hand from the bag and do the dirty workdancing all the while A moments pause in the entertainment and shes flippingherself onto her stomach in a suicidal attempt to vault sideways off thechanging table            Thediaper changed I grab Tallulah put her under my arm like a football duckbeneath the low staircase ceiling and plunge down the narrow unbelievablysteep stairs to our bedroom There mother sleeps There for Tallulah isbliss She raises her arms and cheers and kicks up such a delighted fuss that Iam reminded all over again what a dull pleasure I am to my own child I am thewarmup act The featured attraction inured to her own importance reaches upfrom under her covers and drags Tallulah under the covers            Sadly there is hardly amoment to spare on selfpity By now there is the most unbelievable ruckuscoming from outside The dog somehow already possessed of a French dogs senseof her rights is busy breaking down the door with her head Sometimes forfun I open it just as she is about to strike again and she goes flying acrossthe kitchen floor like a vaudeville comedian in a skit crashing into theopposite wall
