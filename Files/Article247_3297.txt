 Is Eleanor s Nanny State Really So Bad Dear Chris I don t see how we can say that the good things ER was involved in e g civil rights would have happened just fine without her but she must take a huge share of the blame for the invention of the nanny state Eleanor like all do gooders motivated by the perilous business of noblesse oblige might have had her authoritarian leanings but the point is that FDR wasn t a dictator and neither was Eleanor who whatever she may have mused aloud at the start of the New Deal never got half the loaf she wanted What she did get was a chance to rally and embolden the men and women inside the New Deal who shared her belief that its benefits ought to extend to everyone including negroes and to give some lasting symbolic weight to the civil rights movement Symbolic weight isn t nothing in this case No one can say how much it ultimately meant that ER had lunch on the patio of the White House with Walter White of the NAACP but it meant something for the country s first hostess to say that there was no reason a black man shouldn t eat with her in the White House as her equal If she hadn t broken that bar who would have Bess Mamie Pat Civil rights would always be a cause that moved by symbolic advances and the fact is that Eleanor took down more than her fair share of bricks from the edifice of respectable racism And she did it as Cook makes clear in spite of her class and upbringing which she saw past only with great difficulty C mon don t you love the scene from the Southern Conference on Human Welfare It s Bull Connor s Birmingham November 1938 Connor has insisted that the 1 500 delegates sit in segregated sections ER upon entering takes her place among the black delegates When the police ask her to move she stands and moves her chair to a spot between the two sections where she plants her chair every day for the remainder of the conference What s a little aristo dis ingenuousness held up against such brave improvisation I know you re going to tell me that the Southern Conference on Human Welfare was full of com symps But so did Cook tell me that Besides let s say I grant you that Eleanor is responsible in part for the nanny state I still can t grant you that this is a bad thing I know we don t want to get lured into this old argument but still which part of the New Deal did you hate Was it the SEC The NLRB Social Security Putting my grandfather to work in the Civilian Conservation Corps I know I know or at least I think I know We re talking about a spectrum here in which some freedom is traded for some security and reasonable liberals like me and reasonable conservatives like you simply differ on where the appropriate balance is reached But where ER and FDR are concerned I think the burden s on a conservative to explain whether and why the New Deal should have halted short of where it did Finally you really lost me on that last curve about Gingrichian buck raking and rich old Eleanor inveighing against the greed of others Why isn t it better to make a lot of money you give to charity than to make a lot of shady money you give to your Newt PAC Maybe ER s money made her modestly hypocritical in preaching against the greed and privilege of others but it strikes me as unfair to seize on this as a reason to disqualify her as having done any good It s not that I have reasonable objections to what you did it s the way you did it or who you were as you did it Would it have been more virtuous of her to while away the Depression polishing the White House china May only the poor object to the treatment of the poor But I m very grateful to you for the word latifundium I had to look it up Cheers Marjorie
