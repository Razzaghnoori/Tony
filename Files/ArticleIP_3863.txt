Web is a researcher s dream enabling quick and fairly easy access to a wealth of information An individual doing research on the Web quickly learns to acquire the proper tools for the job and with a little imagination can find almost anything I use a utility that initiates searches on many search engines simultaneously and rarely fails to locate what I m after Also even when a little search refinement needs to be done it is much more time efficient than going to a library searching there and then bringing the information home Most importantly the Web is not just about information It is about communication Through e mail one can interrogate experts and seek out better information Steve J Thornburg The Knot David Boaz s Privatize Marriage adds more confusion to a muddled debate We need clarification Marriage is already a private contract and nothing keeps people from making their own very special stipulations as part of a marriage contract But the nation state currently functions as the enforcer of contracts making certain rules and formalities a practical necessity In the absence of common rules and enforcement people would have to resolve conflicts on their own which can become messy and chaotic Also the marriage contract includes provision of certain social services between two individuals the absence of which would result in excessive burdens on society Nothing should keep two or more people from signing cohabitation contracts committing to certain mutual obligations but whether and to what extent community privileges should be extended to such unions is another matter Paul Kailor An Institution by Any Other Name Privatize Marriage by David Boaz disregards the importance of semantics Gays demand recognition and respect Fair enough But they would get farther in their agendas if they would give a little respect to conventional marriage by letting heterosexual people keep the word marriage to themselves Gays should come up with a word for their own committed relationships Then they would attract more support for gaining recognition for the same kinds of legalities that help married people Richard Polese Voluntary Spending In Trumpet Voluntary Michael Kinsley misses something essential when he argues that potential volunteers and in particular well off ones might do better to donate their money than to actually volunteer Someone who donates their time becomes more not less likely to give money on top of that Also increasing volunteerism has goals other than encouraging more financial support Our society is divided by class It is possible by choosing the right suburb for middle to upper middle class people to live their lives in very little contact with the most severe problems of this country If these people were more directly involved they would undoubtedly feel more connected to the problems around them The effect is both monetary in that it encourages donations and political in that it changes and challenges the indifference to the poor that seems so painfully common on the American political stage Yaron Minsky Blanking Out Since I was looking forward to Slate s coverage of what is sure to be one of the year s most intelligent movies I found Sarah Kerr s review of Grosse Pointe Blank titled Dear John doubly disappointing Her belabored references to 80s teen movies serve no purpose save to further showcase what seems to be Kerr s suppressed thinking girl s crush on John Cusack Her actual criticisms of the film were buried in a pointless parade of her insider knowledge of the scene behind the movie far worse than John Cusack s emphasis on Evanston in interviews She whines that it wasn t developed But the symbolism of Martin s profession was clear and the ideas were consistent Without having read any interviews or reviews I immediately grasped the film s stance on American life It gave a funny precise critique without being bitter And the movie did not exclude those of us who did not know the real life characters behind it On the contrary for those of us who grew up in the 80s it spoke with a fresh real perspective that s distressingly rare Kerr s review on the other hand was annoyingly insular and bitter Michelle Chihara A Flat Tax on Net Worth The Dialogue on the capital gains tax between Michael Kinsley and John C Goodman points out one of the problems in taxing income It s hard to make it simple and fair That s why Goodman likes the simplicity of the flat tax on income But that isn t fair either There is a growing disparity between rich and poor but what an individual earns in any given year may not indicate true wealth In place of the income tax a flat tax on net worth should be considered First net worth is easy to define assets such as cash real estate and securities minus liabilities or debts equals net worth The Internal Revenue Service would be turned into an agency whose mission would be simplified determining the existence and value of assets While that is no easy task we ought not forget that the IRS currently performs this very function in administering the estate and gift tax An important feature of a flat tax on net worth is that the tax rate would be considerably lower than that advertised by Rep Dick Armey That is so even if the goal is to collect the same amount of money that the federal government now takes in from the individual income tax 588 billion But the single most compelling argument for the imposition of a flat tax on net worth is this 24 percent of all households wouldn t pay any tax at all The major arguments against the imposition of a wealth tax will be by those who argue that it will inhibit savings and result in capital flight But the experiences of other nations such as Switzerland suggest that this is not true The richest will pay much more in taxes but most of the rest of us will pay less Some will pay nothing at all That s as it should be Roy Ulrich Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com
