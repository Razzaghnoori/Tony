 Word Wars Dear Dennis The last few weeks have been good ones for popular discussion of language Monica Lewinsky s father is suing a TV show for using his daughter s name to refer to a sex act a woman chosen to run one of the world s largest law firms has decided to refer to herself as chairman and Senator Jesse Helms used the delightful word floccinaucinihilipilification the longest word in the first edition of the Oxford English Dictionary in a letter to President Clinton I hope we can talk about some of these issues this week But the one thing that s been most striking recently is the response to an On Language column by Margalit Fox in the New York Times Magazine Ms Fox filling in for William Safire wrote about a common language myth that some dialects are intrinsically better than others Ms Fox citing various linguists and explaining things quite clearly said that negative reactions to nonstandard dialects are the result of social factors not linguistic ones the dialects whether ebonics Brooklynese or Peter Jennings are just as regular and logical as any other variety of English To us as linguists this is familiar and noncontroversial I had thought that Ms Fox s presentation would be viewed by the general public as noncontroversial as well but I was mistaken The letters column last week had no fewer than six angry letters calling us intellectual diddlers and well paid academic theorists who confine our victims to minimum wage jobs It was even implied that considering dialects to be linguistically equal was a pernicious threat to common sense logic science and our basic political freedoms Who knew It would seem that the writers of such letters themselves lack common sense or at least the ability to understand simple language Ms Fox was very clear that languages were considered equal on purely linguistic grounds and that value judgments were socially determined The linguists who spoke in favor of diversity were certainly not advocating the abandonment of language teaching just a better understanding of how language works It s too bad that a genuine effort to spread this understanding has to meet with such hostility don t you think Best Jesse
