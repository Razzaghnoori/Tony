 Eine Klein Critique Kausfiles com went away for a few days and missed a Joe Klein swoon This time over Bill Bradley Actually it was more of a swoonlet as Klein makes clear in a contribution to Slate s Fray he s just really happy with several of the candidates this year including Bush and McCain Is he allowed to swoon for more than one at a time Isn t that some sort of antitrust violation Klein s piece is perfectly OK But one expects a lot of him since he was once and may again be the best in the business So 1 Why discover Bradley so late Most of the press told us weeks ago about the ex senator s artful languor his aloof anti charismatic messianism his emphasis on substance not style You can see Klein s failure to obey the media s quasi menstraul cycle which dictates that this is a Gore Comeback moment as stubborn heroic individualism Or you can say The New Yorker seems to think its high income readers aren t very well informed doctors maybe with no time to read the papers and they can use a sort of remedial course on what s been happening in politics over the past months They need a classy analyst to tell them that Bradley has run an extremely effective campaign but that The race is about to intensify Did Klein write sentences like that when he was at Newsweek I don t remember them A third theory Maybe it s New Yorker editors who are isolated and not very well informed 2 In the course of mildly hyping Bradley s substance Klein says Bradley proposed an extremely controversial solution to each of the problems he has tackled including child poverty But Bradley s child poverty speech was a bunch of sensible incremental proposals that practically everyone to the left of the Heritage Foundation s Robert Rector might endorse and Rector might go for some of them To show Bradley s extreme controversiality on poverty Klein notes that Bradley has remained opposed to Clinton s 1996 welfare initiative But it is hardly controversial if Bradley doesn t renounce his own recorded vote against the bill What s significant is that Bradley doesn t call for repealing any significant part of the law which would be controversial What seems to have happened is that after Bradley got burned by the press sniping at the cost of his health plan he got a bit cautious and hasn t proposed anything dramatic since But that s not the sort of complication you can get into if you re giving a remedial lecture to time pressed MDs 3 Klein s other generalities are sometimes a little off He says Bradley s antipoverty plan had a big price tag 9 8 billion If that s a big price tag we really have gone a long way down the incrementalist road Klein also praises Bradley for giving speeches on issues that are less prominent on most pollsters radar screens citing as his first example Bradley s speech on gun control But if ever there was a hot button issue that is big on Democratic pollsters radar screens but relatively unimportant in reality it s gun control As others have said The New Yorker has fact checkers it needs some thought checkers 4 Maybe Klein is just spending his time doing something else like writing his next novel Alas Kausfiles doesn t have that excuse So he had a Caucasian guilt thing going is that it Ickes a White deputy chief of staff and architect of Clinton s 1996 re election steadfastly has denied breaking any fund raising laws Associated Press story of Wednesday Oct 27 describing the efforts of Clinton aide Harold Ickes on behalf of Jesse Jackson Jr s campaign for Congress
