 well who s the team well i think uh NCAA is going to go to Kansas oh really well i i m picking Duke because uh they just won it they just won it yeah holy cow i just walked in i i didn t even i guess it s i can t believe it s over already it s just yeah it s just over just uh about five ten minutes ago i guess it was a good game uh they won by about eight i think what was the score either five or eight it was a good game but uh Duke was just too much for them Kansas just couldn t couldn t hang with them well i suppose they must be still must be pretty good if they took on UNLV so oh yeah and see i was i was really thinking that they might have a let down because i i i was in a basketball pot and i picked uh Kansas for i guess more or less an upset but i i was thinking that uh Duke might have a let down after playing such a tough game with UNLV but uh i tell you what they uh they came back and put it to them it was a good game but i i i had thought all the way through that UNLV was going to be the team that would just walk away with it well you and everybody else that s right that s right i tell you what they uh they they looked like they were just men among boys but they they they fell i tell you well a lot of pressure on them though i think uh i don t think they had the same type of enthusiasm enthusiasm or attitude probably too conservative or too yeah yeah they they just need to go for it instead of uh worrying about the other team because i think if they would play their game i don t know if there s anybody that could that could keep up with them uh yeah yeah well what about professionally but uh i i was since the i m out in uh Phoenix uh Phoenix there so the Suns are starting to look pretty descent but there i think yeah yeah that s right yeah here in Dallas i ll tell you what the the Mavericks are having just all kinds of problems yeah i tell you well i used to live out there and uh seems like they ve well Tarpley just got pulled over again oh really yeah so he he s uh he s probably going to be going to jail and and the problem with him is he s on a guaranteed salary like for three years so whether he plays or not they ve got to pay him ten million dollars so if they uh they can t hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy s got Dallas in a big old bind but uh they they i think they ve just got to forget about him and uh try to build a team without him maybe go for some good they ought to get some good draft picks this year who who else do they got on that team now i they ve uh they ve got Derek Harper that s a real good point guard him and Rolando Blackman yeah and uh really they re about it they ve got a guy named Herb Williams that that i guess sort of was supposed to take the place of uh Tarpley but he uh he just doesn t have the offensive skills yeah and then they ve got James Donaldson who s been there forever playing center and uh yeah how s he doing this year just all right but he s getting to where uh i don t know if it s his age or what but he just can t play the whole game they ve got to get somebody young that can uh run the court that s still big how about the guy from North Carolina oh uh not McCrae but uh let s see are you uh Perkins Perkins Perkins they traded Perkins Sam Perkins they traded him he was from North Carolina and uh they traded him to the Lakers last year and that he was a good player and then they they ve got a that s right that s right okay yeah he was a finesse player he was good yeah and then they they uh last year went out and got oh Fat Leever and uh Alex English and and Rodney McCrae Dantely didn t they get Dantely yeah they didn t and i m not for sure what the deal is on him i think he s been hurt but he hadn t played he hadn t played in probably two months and i ve i ve gone to about three or four of their games and i don t even think he was on the sidelines so i i think he hurt his knee or something but he he definitely didn t turn out to be anything like he was supposed to so uh i think that was involved with the Perkins Perkins trade to tell you the truth it uh you know i i bet it was oh oh no no no no no no it was what is his name McGuire that was McGuire yeah that s right that s right from uh uh Detroit that s right that s who that was yeah because i don t think they got anything from Perkins i think he was a free agent or uh yeah yeah free agent his contract ended and they didn t sign him and uh i don t understand that i thought that he was always a good player you know he was but he just went for the the big bucks i think Dallas was going to pay him like sixteen million over five years and he got something like eighteen or nineteen million from Las Angeles so he just went where the bucks were and shoot you can t blame him man that s that s a phenomenal amount of money but uh yeah the Mavericks are sucking it up i tell you are they over five hundred uh no i don t think so they they were right before the uh uh oh what do you call it all star break but ever since the all star break uh shoot they ve they ve played terrible um hum and uh so now it d be really to their benefit to to really play uh some bad ball and and hopefully get a lucky uh lottery pick because uh there s no way they can even i think mathematically they re out of the play off scene now yeah so you know they they need to just play for a play off pick yeah i think i think the Suns are or a you know the Suns are are pretty good well they had i don t think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year they re uh yeah and they did they made some trades uh oh they had one white guy i can t think of his name that was real good did you say white or black white uh Chambers yeah and uh Chambers yeah he s the big guy yeah you know if if they could get somebody to help compliment him you know i think they d be uh awesome because that guy can play that Chambers is is something else but uh i don t know it ll it ll be interesting i haven t been i don t follow basketball real close but i i really don t follow the pros that close either they they just play so many games that uh you know it s just hard t o keep up with them but college i really enjoy college basketball yeah the big ten didn t fair too well in the tournament the most no they sure didn t sure didn t i m i m from the midwest so oh okay so you keep up with the yeah yeah i kind of watch you know see what s happening uh yeah more of a football powerhouse i guess but uh what s that more of a football powerhouse up there i guess well no basketball is you know Michigan won it last year is basketball pretty big do what yeah Indiana and Michigan uh and uh Iowa and i Ohio State Ohio State was ranked like number two most of the year that s that s true that is right Michigan won the NCAA last year and and you know there s always about six teams that go to the tournament uh from the big ten it s it s yeah so that s a tough conference they are they re really good in all the sports they huh actually in the last few years um football you know looks like has gone down a little bit so yeah because Ohio State used to be just a perennial powerhouse yeah and uh but uh and Michigan too but uh well i tell you what i appreciate uh the conversation and uh we ll have to we ll have to see how Phoenix ends up yeah we ll see you too bye bye alrighty well uh have a good one okay bye bye
