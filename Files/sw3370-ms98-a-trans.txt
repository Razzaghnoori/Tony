        the topic today is credit cards     yeah bummer   uh why dont you go ahead and tell me some uh some of your favorite uses for a credit card if if at all thats applies   no because i dont have any   okay   i gave up all my credit cards when i got my first divorce its uh   well i wish i was in your shoes Pat i uh i was i was i was in pretty much control of my credit cards up until the point where we moved down here from South Dakota and then uh it took my wife and i about two months to find a job so in that interim everything went on the credit card   oh yeah um   and uh so now were slowly trying to pay it off and if i would i just keep thinking if i wouldve just been able to take that money and put it in a savings account instead of   paying bills   right id be uh you know id id be doing all right today but no ive got those darn credit card bills hanging over my head   yeah but thats still it still helps sometimes sometimes they help and sometimes they dont   right   you know i think if i had one id probably be maxed out     well that uh  thats uh always a possibility   you know   um   because im not very what you call uh whats the word uh controllable   okay   my husband is but im definitely not one of them people   okay       well i uh while we were doing like i said we were doing all right you know wed put gas occasionally go out to eat or pick up a small gift or something you know some clothes or something but and we could always pay it off when   umhum   when the bill came and when we moved down here and everything was going on the credit card i think we we got a little rampant we you know went out to eat out everything and you know wed wed have to go to Wet and Wild and we had to basically play tourists the first   yep   the first month that we were here and of course everybody takes credit cards so   umhum why not   it got uh it got way out of hand but thankfully were were now   umhum   working to pay them off and and we havent put anything on them in a couple months   oh yeah it gets bad   it can it sure can well what uh   um   what do you find are some of the best advantages of credit cards   emergencies   umhum   if you have one major credit card you can do anything during an emergency   thats true   other than that then youre more or less have to have money or uh some kind of way of getting some   right right   so thats probably you know the best thing i can think of the the bad thing is you get accustom to them   thats right you can you certainly can   you know so i dont know i had i was used to them and then when my me and my husband broke up and i had to pay all the bills that did it i huhuh none i dont want any   well i understand that you know you cant even rent a car hardly or uh   with   get an airplane ticket without a credit card   without one thats right   its   unless you got cash money   right well even if you have cash its hard to if youre under twenty five and you you have cash you still cant get still cant rent a car you have to have a credit card   umhum you cant rent a car no you cant rent a car yep umhum   and that uh i dont know   i think the only thing that saves me there is you can rent a car through TI if i really had to rent a car   okay you work with TI then okay well you dont even speaking of cash you dont get the five dollars for the phone call you just you get the gift part isnt that how that worked if youre a TI employee   but other yeah yeah hum i get a little point and you get so many points and you get the little pick a little gift and thats about it   well thats all right thats thats an interesting incentive we uh we wanted to do it because we werent from the south and i think we would able wed be able to   meet more people or get to know get to know about Texas more or less yeah umhum   well not yeah exactly you know get get to i still have a hard time uh understanding some peoples accent   oh yeah   you know i i cant i i just cant understand what theyre saying   what yeah some of them have some strong ones   but yeah there are   yeah ive only been here thirteen years so   okay where are you originally from     Los Angeles   Los Angeles boy theres a change   definitely     i suppose its not as cold there as it is here now   no now i wish i was back so its hot   well whats life in LA like   not good thats why im here  uhhuh   okay a lot of crime and   oh very high   seems to me you know i i couldnt understand why it would be such a heavily populated area if theres so much crime so much smog so much traffic     because you cant people cant leave you cant just up and leave and not know where youre going i left because i was in the service so i didnt have you know i had a lot to i could leave   okay
