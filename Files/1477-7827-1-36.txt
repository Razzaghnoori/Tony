 Background Estrogens affect a variety of tissues including reproductive tissues bone liver cardiovascular system and brain Table 1lists the classical and non classical estrogen sensitive tissues and cells 1 Although several previous studies have shown that human placenta binds estradiol E2 2 3 4 and estrogens influence various aspects of placental function and fetal development in humans and primates 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 the placenta as a target for estrogens is missing The reason might be an inability of former studies to detect expression of estrogen receptor alpha ER and its immunoreactivity in placental components 12 13 Yet forms of the estradiol receptor of differing stability have been detected in human placental tissue 14 This indicates that some determinants of placental ER may possibly undergo denaturation during tissue processing and become undetectable e g in paraffin sections On the other hand we have recently shown ER expression in human term placenta by western blot analysis ER immunoreactivity was confined to villous and cultured cytotrophoblast CT cells but not syncytiotrophoblast ST We also localized ER immunoreactivity in villous vascular pericytes and extravillous amniotic fibroblasts but not in villous endothelial cells amniotic epithelium extravillous trophoblast EVT or decidual cells In tissue culture E2 stimulated trophoblast differentiation into syncytial aggregates 15 To our knowledge no attempt has been so far made to study placental expression of ER beta ER Although it was first believed that estrogen receptors were predominantly cytoplasmic it was later proposed that they are located exclusively within the nucleus It is now clear that these receptors can be found in both the cytoplasm and nucleus with the ratio dependent upon the cell type and physiological conditions Some studies also indicate that estrogen receptors reside on the plasma membrane and modulate cellular activity without directly associating with DNA 16 Human ER is encoded by 477 amino acids 52 kDa and has substantial homology to ER 66 kDa 17 18 Although both estrogen receptors ERs can be expressed in various estrogen sensitive tissues and cells evidence is accumulating that their expression varies during cellular proliferation and differentiation 19 It appears quite clear today that ER has biological roles that are distinct from those of ER and certain results indicate that ER can have effects opposite to those of the ER 20 21 Although some in vitro studies suggest both ERs may play redundant roles a dissimilar tissue distribution indicates otherwise ER ERKO and ER knockout ERKO female mice possess a normally developed reproductive tract and maintain expression of the opposite ER 22 The ERKO female is infertile and exhibits a hypoplastic uterus that is refractory to estrogens The ovaries of the ERKO female are consistently polycystic and lack evidence of spontaneous ovulation In contrast the ERKO female exhibits a hormonally responsive uterus and grossly normal ovaries but is subfertile in terms of the frequency and size of litters Double ER knockout DERKO mice are infertile possess the expected reproductive tract structures but exhibit a remarkably distinct ovarian phenotype characterized by postnatal loss of oocytes and redifferentiation of the remaining somatic cells to Sertolilike cells This sexreversal in the DERKO ovary is accompanied by the ectopic expression of testisspecific genes reviewed in reference 22 A recent study of ERKO mice has shown that ER is not required for the normal prepubertal development of the mammary gland but for organization and adhesion of epithelial cells during pregnancy and hence for differentiated tissue morphology 23 These observations indicate a possibility of complementary sequential roles of ER and ER since ER appears to be required for the basic development of estrogen sensitive tissues and ER seems to be required for their functional maturation Besides the 52 kDa ER additional related forms have been identified at the RNA level often denoted as ER B They would generate 56 61 and 63 kDa ER proteins 24 Recently developed monoclonal antibodies made to the human ER hormone binding domain have been shown to identify 52 kDa and an additional 62 64 kDa band in protein extracts from granulosa cells of several mammalian species Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies revealed nuclear specific localization of the ER protein in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in epithelial and some stromal cells of mouse and rat epididymis Epitope mapping studies indicated that the E12 and F12 antibodies recognize overlapping peptide sequences in the C terminal region of the hormone binding domain a region that is highly conserved among species 18 Villous CT cells are a type of stem cell which divides during pregnancy including the term placenta 25 26 27 However if the division is symmetric i e resulting in two identical cells both cells should either proliferate or differentiate The former situation might result in placental site trophoblastic tumor or choriocarcinoma 28 the latter in the loss of the ability of the villous trophoblast to proliferate However ten years ago biologists began to gain insight into the cellular mechanisms by which a cell divides into two cells of different developmental potentials a process known as asymmetric division Asymmetric division is a fundamental means of generating cell diversity and may involve extrinsic or intrinsic factors With extrinsic factors daughter cells are equivalent after separation but adopt different fates due to their interactions with the environment With intrinsic factors unequal amounts of cell fate determinants are distributed into the two cells prior to their separation 29 Among the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric division the interactions of the Numb differentiation associated protein with Notch proliferation associated signaling is the model most widely studied ranging from bacteria yeast and Drosophila to mammals 30 Mammalian cells known to exhibit asymmetric division include diverse cell types such as neuronal cells thymocytes and satellite cells involved in myogenesis and the list is growing 29 30 31 32 The aim of present study was to investigate expression and localization of ER in normal term placentae as compared to that of ER Our data indicate that virtually all cellular compartments of the human placenta express either ER ER or both In addition we identified asymmetric ER segregation in dividing villous CT cells Materials and Methods Tissues Seven normal placentae from deliveries between 36 and 38 weeks of pregnancy were investigated The source of placental tissue was women with normal pregnancies admitted to the University of Tennessee Medical Center Excluded were patients with blood transferable infections e g hepatitis and HIV and apparent ascendent placental infections The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board Tissue processing The processing started within 30 60 minutes after delivery Tissue blocks of placental samples were frozen in optimum cutting

extensive washes in PBS the slides were incubated for 20 minutes with mouse anti human cytokeratin 18 clone DC10 DAKO Corporation Carpinteria CA diluted 1 50 and peroxidase coupled secondary antibody as above Antigen antibody complexes were detected by a DABNi detection kit according to the supplier s manual Vector Laboratories Inc Burlingame CA giving the substrate dark blue color This contrasted with the brown color resulting from the first sequence of immunoreagents Thy 1 immunostaining The slides were dehydrated and mounted without hematoxylin counterstain A control procedure consisted of dual color immunohistochemistry as above but both primary antibodies were replaced with PBS Since the diaminobenzidine reaction product masks the antigen and catalytic sites of the first sequence of immunoreagents and thus prevents interaction with the reagents of the second sequence 35 a possibility of co expression in the same cell types has been investigated Therefore another set of slides was similarly processed with the opposite order of primary antibodies CK Thy 1 In addition two sets of slides were immunostained for Thy 1 or CK expression alone followed by hematoxylin counterstain not

Expression of ER and ER proteins in vivo and in vitro Figure 6 We used western blot analysis in order to evaluate overall expression of ER and ER proteins in vivo and in cultured trophoblast Expression of ER and ER proteins was detected in CV isolated trophoblast cells at time 0 t 0 and early EC and late trophoblast cultures LC Fig 6A Both ERs showed higher expression in time 0 and early cultures when compared to CV and late trophoblast culture We also tested the specificity of primary antibodies in western blots When the ER antibody was pre absorbed with blocking peptide PA ER no bands were detected Fig 6B ER and ER bands in original protein extracts lanes 1 and 2 and a lack of ER protein bands in cdk2 IPs lanes 3 and 4 is shown in Fig 6C Probing for cyclin E positive control

fragment see ref 18 higher in trophoblast cultures lanes 7 and 8 However in protein extracts from CV and trophoblast cultures from this placenta no prominent band at 52 kDa was detected by E12 and F12

trophoblast cultures as compared to the CV and time 0 protein extracts Overall ANOVA was P 0 0001 post test revealed P 0 01 differences between columns with different superscripts The data indicate that the expression of 64 kDa ER protein with hormone binding domain significantly increases in early cultures EC vs CV and T 0 and high expression persists in late cultures LC Placental localization of ER and ER immunoreactivity Table 2 ER and ER 52 kDa immunoreactivity in various placental cell types is summarized in Table 2 From trophoblast cell types the villous CT expressed ER only while ST and EVT showed ER However CT cells merging with ST and young syncytial aggregates showed expression of both ERs Other epithelial mesenchymal or vascular cell types showed either ER pericytes or ER endothelial cells amniotic epithelium decidua Rare decidual cells showed nuclear ER Interestingly nuclear and or cytoplasmic expression of ERs varied depending on the cell type stage see superscripts in Table 2 Both ERs were also detected in some cells in the extravillous connective tissue Table 2also shows that expression of ER with hormone binding domain 64 kDa is exclusively nuclear associated with ST EVT and amniotic epithelium and fibroblasts Therefore these placental cell types appear to be responsive to estrogens via the nuclear ER hormone binding domain Expression of the cell cycle related proteins in the placenta and derived cultures Figure 9 To understand better the role of other proteins involved in the regulation of trophoblast proliferation and differentiation in vivo and in vitro we also compared expression of some cell cycle related proteins in vivo and in vitro In normal placentae the expression of cyclin E cE which is involved in the stimulation of cell cycle progression 37 was low as was that of p27 cE antagonist promoting terminal differentiation of cells 38 lane 5 Fig 9A This is in agreement with occasional trophoblast proliferation in normal term placentae 25 apparently not prevented by high p27 expression In early cultures expression of both proteins increased significantly lane 1 Fig 9A see also panel B for quantitative evaluation During culture initially high expression of cE significantly decreased at 45 and 70 hours and remained low at 94 hours However moderate expression of p27 in early cultures significantly increased at 45 hours and remained extremely high till the end of the culture These trends were observed in all cultures from normal placentae investigated Such observations indicate that the p27 antiproliferative effect may play an important role in the prevention of cultured trophoblast proliferation and therefore promote an overall tendency of cultured trophoblast cells toward terminal differentiation see also Discussion Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study showing placental ER protein expression by western blot analysis and ER immunoreactivity in placental cell types We also show a comparison of placental ER and ER protein expression and cellular localization Our observations indicate that various cellular components of human placenta express either ER or ER Furthermore we show in vivo and in vitro that ER ER CT cells differentiate into ER ER young and ER ER mature ST aggregates In situ hybridization and immunolocalization of ER and ER in a variety of reproductive tract tissues in males and females have shown that in most instances either ER or ER is expressed in a particular cell type although some cell types e g Leydig cells ovarian surface epithelium and epithelial and stromal cells of the uterus and breast may show expression of both ERs 39 40 41 However since only a proportion of cells were detected to express ER or ER in a single color immunohistochemistry 42 such an approach cannot demonstrate coexpression of the ERs in a particular cell nor indicate eventual transition from one ER subtype to another during differentiation However recent double color immunohistochemistry experiments indicate that the cells in the mouse proximal efferent ductule epithelium can be separated into three types with distinct expression of ERs 1 ER ER 2 ER ER and 3 ER ER 43 The authors did not provide any functional explanation of these observations Nevertheless our study also shows that these three types of ER expression can be detected in villous trophoblast Moreover our data indicate that there is a switch in ER expression from type 1 ER ER to type 2 ER ER and finally to type 3 ER ER during trophoblast differentiation in vivo and this observation was confirmed by the study of trophoblast differentiation in vitro As mentioned in the Introduction recent studies of the functional significance of ER in ERKO mice show that ER is sufficient for basic differentiation of estrogen sensitive tissue However a lack of ER results in a defect in terminally differentiated tissue morphology 23 and indicates that ER expression is required for terminal differentiation of estrogen dependent cells Our study concurs with such observations since we show that ER expression is associated with terminal differentiation of trophoblast Moreover we show a switch from nuclear to cytoplasmic ER expression in terminally differentiated ST and EVT In addition the decidual cells which are known to exhibit degenerative changes at term 44 show marked diminution of cytoplasmic ER This suggests that terminal aging and degeneration of estrogen responsive cells are accompanied by a progressive loss of ER expression Our ER and ER single and dual color immunohistochemistry experiments show that daughter CT cells derived from ER parental cells coexpress both ERs during early stages of differentiation and lose ER during their terminal differentiation into the ST The differentiation of CT was associated with very narrow 2 m ST which may need complementation by additional CT cells to function However the parental and daughter cells showed in vivo differences in nuclear ER immunoreactivity prior to their complete separation While the parental cell showed high nuclear ER the daughter cell associated with ST showed marked diminution of ER immunoreactivity and an increase of differentiation associated ER protein These observations parallel recent studies that postmitotic cells may exhibit asymmetric distribution of the differentiation associated proteins prior to their separation Asymmetric division may involve extrinsic influence of adjacent cells or intrinsic factors Among the intrinsic factors underlying asymmetric division the interactions of the Numb differentiation associated protein with Notch proliferation associated signaling is the model most widely studied ranging from bacteria yeast and Drosophila to mammals 30 When the neuronal progenitor cells undergo asymmetric division 20 in neuronal tissue cell culture they produce neuronal daughter cells to which Numb protein segregates preferentially and such daughter cells show an enhanced differentiation of neuronal processes 45 Interestingly Numb is firstly associated with one pole of the plasma membrane of a dividing cell and subsequently with one of the two resulting nuclei 29 45 Our study indicates that preservation of nuclear ER in one of two postmitotic cells is associated with the ability of CT to replicate and diminution of ER and appearance of nuclear ER dictates a generation of a daughter cell that is committed to differentiate Fig 10 The model presented in Fig 10can be used to explain at least in part the role of ERs in proliferation and differentiation of other estrogen dependent cell types However it has to be considered that ERs are certainly not the only proteins which are involved in decisions of estrogen dependent cells to proliferate or differentiate At least cell cycle related proteins either suppressors or facilitators and growth factors and cytokines produced by stromal cells 1 46 47 48 49 should be considered in addition to the promitotic effect of E2 mediated via ER Figure 10may not be applicable for transformed cells with abnormal ER variants or cells exhibiting only one type of ER For example expression of ER only may indicate that differentiation but not proliferation is estrogen dependent Former studies also indicated that the decision between symmetric and asymmetric division in vivo depends on the mitotic spindle orientation During fly neurogenesis the neuroblasts delaminate from a monolayer of ectodermal cells The ectodermal cells at the surface of the Drosophila embryo divide with the axes of their mitotic spindle parallel to the plane of the ectodermal monolayer In contrast a neuroblast divides along the apical basal axis so that the axes of its mitotic spindles are perpendicular to the plane of the ectodermal layer Thus the mitotic spindle of the neuroblast has to reorientate by 90 degrees from the plane of the ectodermal layer 50 The orientation of the mitotic spindle correlates with the asymmetric distribution of Numb 29 Figure 3Ashows that similar perpendicular orientation i e 90 degrees from the plane of ST layer toward the villous core applies for asymmetrically dividing villous CT Hence in CV one pole of dividing CT cells is associated with mature ST and the other with the mesenchymal villous core stroma It is possible to speculate that the poles of dividing CT cells are influenced differently the juxta syncytial pole toward differentiation and juxta mesenchymal toward proliferation Therefore the extrinsic factors type of neighboring cells may dictate asymmetric segregation of intrinsic factors determining the fate of dividing cells In other words asymmetric division in vivo may be a result of the influence of both extrinsic and intrinsic factors If so the extrinsic factors should be viewed as inducers and intrinsic factors as effectors of asymmetric division Based on available data 29 30 45 50 51 52 and our observations a possible sequence of events involved in asymmetric division of villous CT cells is given in Figure 11A Note an involvement of stromal stimulation of CT division and ST signaling stimulation of cell differentiation Figure 11Bindicates that symmetric division of ST may result from the presence of stromal and absence of ST signaling However perpendicular orientation of dividing trophoblast cells in vivo cannot be achieved in vitro because the complex villous structure and the villous core in particular is absent Although ER ER transition was also observed during trophoblast differentiation in culture the cultured trophoblast cells are expected to undergo symmetric division toward the differentiated phenotype rather than asymmetric division Indeed early cultures show proliferating CT cells which are gradually transformed into the differentiating CT cells and syncytial aggregates during the culture 15 possibly due to the prevalence of differentiation signals in the absence of stromal signaling Figure 11C This view is supported by gradual diminution of promitotic cyclin E and an increase of antimitotic p27 proteins during trophoblast culture Fig 9 Finally regarding the placenta it is important to consider the stage of pregnancy For early pregnancy the scheme in Figure 10can possibly be extended to other cell types decidua EVT in contrast to the term placenta where only villous CT cells are dividing 25 26 27 We recently showed that exogenous E2 markedly stimulates development of large syncytial aggregates in trophoblast cultures 15 We also observed that this effect can be abolished with pure anti estrogen ICI 182 780 unpublished data These data indicate that trophoblast differentiation is estrogen dependent Since trophoblast differentiation is associated with transition from ER to ER expression with temporary co expression of both one may assume that both ERs are involved in estrogen stimulated trophoblast differentiation Since production of placental hormones is characteristic of mature syncytium 5 9 11 53 54 which shows in vivo cytoplasmic ER expression only one may also assume that estrogens stimulate production of placental hormones by ST Studies on localization and expression of ER hormone binding domain recognized by E12 and F12 monoclonal antibodies in human placenta are of particular interest Immunohistochemical studies with these antibodies by Choi et al 18 revealed nuclear specific localization of the ER protein in granulosa cells of the rat ovary and in epithelial and some stromal cells of mouse and rat epididymis Specificity of the E12 and F12 monoclonal antibodies was verified by western blot analysis using baculovirus expressed form of human ER 53 kDa 18 These antibodies were also reported to identify an additional 62 64 kDa band in protein extracts from granulosa cells of several mammalian species in addition to the 52 kDa band 18 Our observations on human placenta show that E12 and F12 antibodies exhibit nuclear specific reactivity with placental ST Therefore cytoplasmic reactivity in mature ST detected by N 19 polyclonal antibody which recognizes a single 52 kDa band might not be related to the ER variant with a hormone binding domain Indeed in human trophoblast cultures the E12 and F12 antibodies are shown to exhibit virtually no reactivity with the 52 kDa variant and the N 19 polyclonal antibody shows no reactivity at 64 kDa Therefore one may speculate that the placental 52 kDa ER variant is not necessarily a hormone binding protein One may also assume that the placental ER hormone binding variant recognized by E12 and F12 antibodies does not contain or expose epitopes which are recognized by the N 19 ER polyclonal antibody which shows reactivity with trophoblast cultures The E12 and F12 antibodies have been shown to react with baculovirus expressed 53 kDa form of human ER protein 18 Yet it is possible that mammalian cells naturally expressing ER produce two protein variants with and without ER hormone binding domain resulting from post translational modifications of the ER protein Interestingly villous cytotrophoblast cells merging with syncytium showed nuclear specific F12 but not E12 immunoreactivity Hence the epitope associated with the 64 kDa ER hormone binding variant recognized by E12 and F12 can be excluded but the 68 kDa variant recognized by F12 might be considered to be involved in early trophoblast differentiation Since the F12 antibody also failed to recognize a distinct 52 kDa band in human granulosa cell protein extracts 18 and the E12 antibody did not show any reactivity at 68 kDa one may speculate that the 68 kDa band might be another ER protein variant Indeed it has been indicated that it is unlikely that the E12 and F12 antibodies recognize exactly the same state of the epitope since the F12 antibody was much more efficient in immunoprecipitation of the native ER protein generated in vitro 18 We also show that E12 antibody identifies the 56 kDa band in trophoblast cultures barely visible in extracts analyzed by F12 antibody Fig 8B Nevertheless as compared to CV and time 0 protein extracts trophoblast differentiation in early and late tissue cultures was associated with a more than three fold increase of the 64 kDa ER hormone binding variant Fig 8C while the 52 kDa protein identified by N 19 polyclonal antibody showed a tendency to decline in late cultures Fig 6A Therefore the ER hormone binding protein appears to play a dominant role in the hormone stimulated terminal differentiation of trophoblast while the 52 kDa ER protein might be somehow related to the non hormonal regulation of early stages of trophoblast differentiation see proposed role of ER in asymmetric division of estrogen dependent cells discussed above The importance of ER hormone binding variants in stimulation of terminal trophoblast differentiation is supported by our observation on the stimulatory effect of E2 for the formation of large syncytial aggregates 15 From the above it appears that in human placenta there are at least two ER proteins 1 the cytoplasmic and nuclear 52 kDa ER with N terminal related epitopes recognized by N 19 polyclonal antibody and lacking a hormone binding domain recognized by the E12 and F12 antibodies and 2 the nuclear specific 64 kDa ER with a hormone binding domain recognized by E12 and F12 antibodies and lacking epitopes recognized by N 19 polyclonal antibody The existence of these two distinct ER proteins is particularly supported by their different expression in trophoblast cultures compare Fig 6Aand 8Aand 8B A possibility exists that there is an additional 68 kDa ER protein which is recognized exclusively by the F12 antibody Fig 8Aand 8B and expressed in the nuclei of early differentiating trophoblast cells merging with ST Fig 7B Conclusion In conclusion our observations concur with recent views on the importance of ER in the proliferation and ER in the maturation of estrogen dependent cells Asymmetric segregation of ER in dividing villous CT cells accompanied by appearance of ER in differentiating daughter cells suggests a unique role of ERs in asymmetric division of estrogen dependent cells Significantly enhanced expression of the 64 kDa ER hormone binding variant in differentiating trophoblast cells and stimulation of trophoblast differentiation by estrogens indicates a unique role of the ER hormone binding domain in the regulation of placental function Since ST is a major source of placental hormones which ensure optimal conditions for the fetus and mother ER expression by ST may be involved in stimulation of placental hormonal production by estrogens
