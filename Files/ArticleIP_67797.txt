 Christmas Reading Slate will be publishing erratically for the next couple of weeks There seems to be some holiday going on The normal flood of magnificent journalism gushing from this URL will be reduced to a trickle and you may want to seize this opportunity to catch up on your Slate reading from the past year The Slate Archives formerly known as the Compost is now accessible without charge and you can use Slate Search to produce a list of articles in any department or by any author Of course you also can do a normal search for occurrences of particular words We thought of providing a list of articles worth a second look or for our many new readers in 1999 a first look But on reflection we didn t want to spend the holiday break pacifying outraged authors who were left out So we suggest that you poke around at random Start if you wish with our pre selected list of random words beginning with the letter M Monica Millennium Merger Microsoft McCain Money Or pick your own word type it in the search window at the bottom of this page along with 1999 and see what you get Or go to our search page and ask for all articles published on your birthday Frankly you cannot go very wrong Merry Christmas from all of us at Slate And have a nice millennium
