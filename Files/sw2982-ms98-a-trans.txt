                okay now you can tell me what you do   uh well i work with computers just like your son   uhhuh   and i actually do research in speech recognition   oh great   and so as part of the reason im participating in the project is to see how the stuff goes but um   uhhuh uhhuh   i was working well actually i havent worked for any large companies per se   uhhuh   uh recently but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits namely lots of vacations not real good salary but lots of vacations but   uhhuh yeah well the one John works for seems to have a lot you know good benefits and the pay is decent   umhum yeah the uh well actually where i was working with the company one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits which these days i think are really important because health care is so ridiculously expensive because were were paying our own insurance right now   uhhuh uhhuh uh umhum umhum umhum   for it um and im we actually had a little baby so im taking a little bit of a  time off from work ah congratulations     oh great i had i had a granddaughter     and um so one thing that im very concerned with now is first of all health benefits because its more important with a family and you know our doctors visits routine doctors visits covered my health insurance only covers um   right   your emergency care and so   umhum do you have major medical benefits   right yeah but i dont   that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is   right well my our deductible is five hundred but its for each   each person yeah thats pretty hard thats pretty high   event yeah right but you know so it covers the emergency things but it doesnt cover if you get sick it doesnt cover     right thats thats right thats   doctors visits things like that   and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your major medical too   oh yeah it certainly is   yeah i know where my daughter works now she she course we live in a a rural sort of setting and where she works she has no benefits at all and her her wage is not   um umhum wow   not very good   umhum   but its a its a type of area we live in of course living expenses arent as bad either though which makes a difference   and probably the medical care care is less expensive too   well she has to pay for it herself you know they have to pay for their own insurance but uh   umhum   uh   so i think that in general the doctors fees are probably lower there and so the insurance would cost lower   uh well from what ive seen from my aunt and uncle really from Florida up to here theyre not that much different   well i know that friends of mine had a baby up in Boston and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in Manhattan   uhhuh is that right   and they were at one of the better hospitals and you know good doctors in Boston   uhhuh oh thats a big difference   and i was at one of the big hospitals in New York but thats a huge difference just between   uhhuh uhhuh   you know and its two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable   oh yeah should be   so i was pretty shocked at that but the other thing that im really concerned about and most companies dont have some are starting to have is day care because it would be really nice to be able to have   yes uhhuh   you know someone that could watch my daughter at work and id go to work and if she were sick i could go down and see her if she needs to be fed whatever it is   and itd be much more convenient yeah it would be more convenient too umhum oh yeah yeah my my other daughter works and has they have to take their two children to day care you know   and i it would be more convenient more productive i think uhhuh   and uh it its its i dont know how they do it i really dont you know getting them there and then and going to work and then picking them up and  all the preparations   and your and your and your hours are much more constrained and things like that   umhum umhum   and that to me well that you know those three things the health care vacation and day care are probably the most important benefits i should suppose i should be concerned with   umhum umhum   life insurance and uh retirement plans but   oh i dont know i think those benefits you mentioned mentioned sometimes theyre even more important than you the wage itself   yeah   if you can get those benefits even uh they they come out to much a much better benefit than than an increase in your wage a lot of times   right because youre you know certainly something like day care at the work place would like make life so much simpler that its worth paying you know having a lower salary i would certainly accept a lower salary for that   uhhuh umhum umhum oh yeah oh yeah it make it a lot better   you know everything else being equal because your life would be so much easier and theres a question of quality of life also   uhhuh uh well and if it was there you would really have a little more uh knowledge on whats going on probably you know with your child   yep right and you you you dont feel like youre a half hour away if she something happened   right yeah   and youre less preoccupied with it i think   right yeah   so but unfortunately there arent i think IBM has started having that in certain locations   i dont know my daughter one daughter works for MCI and they dont they where she works they dont have anything like that   uhhuh is that locally   uh Pittsburgh   uhhuh   Pittsburgh Pennsylvania   yeah because Pittsburghs a big enough city too but you know i wouldnt be surprised if things like that didnt happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones   umhum  umhum umhum   just because people might be more flexible in smaller locations and   yeah   things like that because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies   uhhuh   like uh one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby um any where between ten and forty hours a week   umhum   and um you know call call my own days call my own hours and   oh so they were very flexible and that that would be great yeah   yeah and and you know which many times at a large company its almost impossible   umhum umhum   to do things like that   they say youre going to do it this way and thats the way its going to be yeah   right and if you get two weeks off you get two weeks off and youre not allowed two weeks and one day   umhum yeah yeah yeah   and so it all depends on what your position is there too   true well thats true in any any company i think   yeah   uh ive ive never well i cant say ive never ive maybe worked five years out of our married life out of the home you know out of the home   umhum uhhuh   but uh the rest of the time ive been an Avon lady and a  lady   was that when you were um well those have its pluses and minuses too ive been a consultant recently and so i dont have any benefits at all and   uhhuh umhum and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself yeah   right and the same thing my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that than what he is and um they they they   uhhuh uhhuh usually consultants make very good income   right and they they refuse to give him more salary   is that right   because they say they cant pay more than this and that and theyre not allowed to pay him more than what his previous salary was and things like that and you know times are rough now so its new its harder to get   uh oh uhhuh uhhuh   the uh your increases and things but um   umhum a consultant consultant consultant really is should be more knowledgeable than everybody else  you know so it stands to reason they should really have have more benefits   yeah well the right well hes been doing a long term hes being called a consultant and hes really sort of a temporary employee at a place   uhhuh uhhuh   and they they pay him as a consultant but he doesnt get any health benefits he doesnt get well we dont care about retirement benefits he doesnt get um vacation benefits and he does a lot of things that   um umhum   get factored into somebody elses salary so really his salary should be you know twenty percent or thirty percent higher just based on that not including the fact that you know its a less long term commitment for the company and all that sort of stuff   umhum umhum yeah umhum yeah and theyll do it
