 okay what kind of books do you like to read for enjoyment uh mainly the the books i read are uh business related uh huh or self improvement um i ve got a a uh small company on the side that i that i do things with so uh a lot of the reading that i i do has to do with um how can i uh do better at at my small time business uh what kind of business is it important issues such as a you know taxes and uh huh business expenses and all those kind things well that sounds interesting that sounds fun what kind of business is it um i ve got a uh small distributorship uh i uh uh huh sell a uh healthy cookie on the side really and uh i have a few health food stores that i send it to i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can so i can get a deal from the uh from the main from the supplier uh huh well that s interesting and then i distributed them and then i can i get i can sell them at a cheaper price plus i ve got a uh drinking water system business that i ve had on the side for years that i ve done a what a drinking water business uh yeah yeah oh really well that sounds interesting my mom always wants me to open a health food store but i ll i m not really into it i don t know the information i don t know that much about it so anyway but well that s interesting i personally i like mostly um if i had a book of my choice i like books i go to the library a lot and it seems like i always i never go to the fiction section i mean that to me is just ridiculous it s like life is to interesting to read fiction but uh huh i always get books like um i like to quilt well i m not into quilting but i check a lot of books out to learn how i just haven t done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book but i like to um can and do food preservation and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff and i like to check books out like that and i always come away with i m a Christian and i enjoy reading books about um i like i have a real heart for people involved in cults uh huh and so i have a real you know heart for them and i m going to bring my Mormon neighbors some Amish bread today and that s just where my heart is so i read a lot of books on that and you know Christian books written by people about you know to help you out and stuff and i read the Bible i don t read the Bible as much as i should but but i think i would always think that no matter what i did so but i do enjoy reading that and so pretty much we have different interests i think in reading sounds like it but and i have a neighbor with a big motorbike and he likes to run down the street with it and you you can probably hear him but um i don t know so do you enjoy reading anything like that um uh huh um i haven t really read anything like that in in in years there was a time when i was really into the home things and i did uh had my own garden and i did canning all those kind of things that was when i was about uh ten years younger uh huh and uh had thirty or younger is that what you said about ten years younger yeah oh ten years younger oh that s funny and um uh the the problem that i ve had in the past with uh my children growing up and moving out of the house and and still having three left at home out of the five um i ve uh huh tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested in in reading more and and spending more time at the library and it i ve been moderately successful uh huh uh with my daughter and with my son they both have different interests in books but um they they uh they do read them um i have some books on on health that i read all the time one s on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing but yeah i i m oh really yeah Maureen Solomon i had a a friend of mine has a book by her right now called Foods That Heal uh huh they eat a lot of it you know you can take your vitamins and she was telling me to take zinc so anyway i ve been taking enough zinc you know to kill a horse probably i hope it doesn t hurt me but anyway i did read one chapter of that there s a uh a couple called um oh i m going to forgot his name now uh Dirkson uh huh um and uh there s a book called Life Extensions i don t know if you ve ever heard of it no i haven t okay it s a book called Life Extensions there s also a book called The Life Extansion Extension Companion uh Dirk Pearson and uh huh oh i forgot Sally s last name anyway it s a couple i ve i ve seen them on TV and uh they have they are pretty down to earth about uh what you can take and and what you can t take and um the quantities and the quantities what are good for you what isn t and um Life Extensions what s the name of it again Life Extension uh yeah he s probably about forty years old now i saw him probably seven years ago on Johnny Carson Show um hum uh huh oh really and uh i was pretty impressed he had a he before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs uh huh you know based on how well it was performing and then he embarked on this uh vitamin treatment and then every year he had the same tests run um hum uh huh and at the age of thirty two i think it was his um heart was that of a fourteen year old really and all the rest of his organs were all greatly you know all tested out greatly below his actual age and of course Sally uh isn t a very big woman i mean she s you know she appeared to me to be very petite and um she took a horse shoe and and turned it turned it into an S um hum oh really and uh it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that that give you the strength and of course doing isometric exercises uh together they both exercised about five minutes a day doing isometrics rather than you know physical strenuous exercises really i know there s not any food that you can get and it s grown on good soil hardly anymore and i know my my husband s uncle owns a big some acreage in a Eastland Texas which is in West Texas uh huh and he owns a lot of acreage that s been farmed properly you know and uh we get black eyed peas off of it and stuff but yes i know that you know the further we go from Adam the worse the food is for you but God still somehow makes us all be able to still live i think it s a miracle we re all still alive after so many generations well the last couple of processed foods you know i mean but i don t know i like to i like to my i like to be able to eat really healthy you know what am saying and i guess i m going to have to wait for the millennium i think though because i do don t think we re going to restore the earth to you know i think Jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be uh huh but uh in the meantime we pray over our food because i m always looking down my plate and i think man isn t this stuff was probably grown in who knows what you know kind of environment but i do take some vitamins on the side and i do like reading books like that i just i have a hard time a lot of the books are real new age oriented like Mother Earth and we re going to restore the earth i just don t see that i think i mean think to think that is almost it s hopeless to think that man can do anything with the you know what i m saying it s to big than us and i think God s in charge and God s going to restore it when he wants to so sometimes i get bogged down in the yes you know in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking but you know there s a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that and then i just chunk off like water off your back some of it and you know and try and do what s what i can do out of it that s practical but anyway so yeah there s i ve i ve read a lot of things um since i got involved in the water business back in eighty three um and it s amazing that the the legislation they have uh huh um for food that doesn t apply to water they don t consider water a food and uh the basics premise is that if water was a food it would be you know they wouldn t be able to sell it to you uh huh through your pipes because it s toxic um chlorine it s toxic it s a i don t know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer because it s what oh uh huh uh huh they know that they ve proven that um yet their saying well we re putting such low doses in there that well you don t have to worry about dying from it the problem is that i ve that i ve read books that uh huh uh huh uh have proven that there is a link between the ingestation of chlorine and arteriosclerosis which is heart attack um and if you look at the history of heart attacks heart attacks were nonexistent prior to nineteen twenty really and we started doing um large quantities of chlorination of water starting around uh where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water really you know i bet that s why we have some friends that eat only i just took this Amish bread out of the oven man it s going to be good i had a starter that friend of mine made anyway uh i had a friend that read a book on that and um i ve all my relatives my mom you know you probably read Back To Eden or something i don t know we read a lot i know people have read all those books but the um they drilled they drilled a well i don t know how many feet but it s three or four times deeper than it needed to be uh huh and so their water comes out they live in Grand Prairie but it s they live kind of in a the planes go right over from DFW so it s not real developed and so they have a probably half an acre yeah i m very familiar with the area and yeah and they drilled this well and the water comes out at thirty two degrees so it s kinds of neat would that be healthier do to do that to drill your own fresh water well like that it depends a lot of uh a lot of things were thought that uh as you know the farmers thought okay we got chemicals we re putting chemicals on the field well the ground will naturally filter out the
