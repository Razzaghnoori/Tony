 Background Injury of the spine and back are classified as the most frequent cause of limited activity among people younger than 45 years 1 2 Approximately 10 percent of the adult population has neck pain at any one time 3 and 80 of the population will experience low back pain LBP at some time in their lives 4 Five to 10 percent of the workforce is off work annually because of LBP Indeed LBP is second only to headache among the leading causes of pain Approximately 80 90 of LBP is mechanical non organic musculoskeletal dysfunction in origin 5 Patients with mechanical spinal pain often seek and receive spinal manipulation by chiropractic osteopathic and allopathic clinicians physical therapists or other health care professionals 6 Health care professionals have utilized spinal palpatory diagnostic procedures and manual manipulative treatment for several millennia to treat back injury and pain 7 8 Along with the history of illness and physical exam examiners utilize specific spinal palpatory diagnostic tests in order to identify spinal neuro musculoskeletal dysfunction Spinal neuro musculoskeletal dysfunction refers to an alteration of spinal joint position motion characteristics and or related palpable paraspinal soft tissue changes The scientific committee of the International Federation of Manual Medicine has stated beneficial outcomes and effectiveness of spinal manipulative procedures rely on appropriate and skilled treatment that is based on an accurate diagnosis which in turn depends upon the accuracy of the palpatory procedures used 9 Spinal palpatory procedures have been described in journals 10 11 12 and textbooks 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Static palpation of anatomical landmarks for symmetry palpation of spinal vertebral joints before during and after active and passive motion tests spinal and paraspinal soft tissue palpatory assessment for abnormalities or altered sensitivity are most common Several narrative reviews of the literature on the validity and reliability of spinal palpatory diagnostic procedures have been published 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 However most reviews are discipline specific despite the fact that similar spinal palpatory procedures are used across disciplines Only two systematic reviews of spinal palpatory validity studies have been published 29 30 One study was a limited review of chiropractic literature on palpatory diagnostic procedures for the lumbar pelvic spine 29 and the other concentrates on validity studies at the sacroiliac joint 30 An annotated bibliography 31 and a systematic review of the primary reliability research studies published between 1971 and 2001 are in progress Validity and reliability are concepts that are often used interchangeably but the concepts are quite different Validity is the accuracy of a measurement of the true state of a phenomenon 32 while reliability measures the concordance consistency or repeatability of outcomes 25 However even if a measurement is consistent and reliable it is not necessarily valid e g an arrow may consistently hit the target area but never hit the bulls eye There are various types of validity studies The concept of validity differs in qualitative and quantitative research 32 Though it can be argued that palpatory diagnostic procedures are subjective and therefore qualitative investigators in the field believe they can measure a physiological phenomenon that can be detected by objective means They maintain that studies addressing the validity of spinal palpatory diagnostic tests are quantitative studies The types of quantitative validity studies can be distinguished as follows face validity construct validity criterion validity and content validity Face validity is the extent to which a test appears to measure what it is supposed to measure In other words whether the proposed test seems to provide a reasonable measure of the concept it is intended to measure For example spinal vertebral joint motion palpation tests which aim to detect the presence of hypomobility have face validity because they seem to be reasonable measures of the concept they are intended to measure 33 Face validity studies have been criticized for being subjective intuitive and unsubstantiated Troyanovich and Harrison 33 pointed out that in spite of the common perception or belief that motion tests are valid and reliable for assessment of presence or absence of restricted vertebral motion there was no evidence to support this concept Thus palpatory vertebral motion diagnostic tests are prime examples of tests accepted on face validity Construct validity is the extent to which a test identifies the concept or trait of that which is being measured A construct is a hypothetical or conceptual idea that may be used to label or explain observed phenomenon 34 For example taking a dysfunctional vertebral joint as the concept a test demonstrating the ability to identify the presence or absence of that concept or its related components is said to have construct validity Feinstein describes construct validity as an appraisal of the effectiveness with which a measure does its job in describing an existing or established construct i e does the measure behave the way one would predict on the basis of the concept it represents For example Jull et al 35 compared cervical spinal static palpation to diagnostic nerve blocks with anesthesia The construct is that tenderness upon provocative palpation is related to local nerve irritation and nerve conductivity A local anesthetic nerve block of related spinal segments showed that the identified tender spots no longer elicited a pain response Thus they demonstrated that there is a high degree of correlation between the palpatory test that identified a tender spot and the ability of the anesthesia to reverse the results of the provocative test Therefore the pain provocative palpatory tests used were demonstrated to have high construct validity Construct validity however is an artificial framework that is not directly observable 27 To establish construct validity of a test or measure the researcher must determine the extent to which the measure correlates with other measures designed to measure the same thing and whether the measure behaves as expected Construct validity studies do not measure the same phenomena that palpatory procedures are designed to measure i e resistance to digital pressure or motion but similar phenomena that are believed to be related to the palpable phenomena Many construct validity studies on diagnostic spinal palpatory tests compare a test s results to another measurement of abnormal physiology in the same region Studies using thermography 36 electromyography 37 and coronary angiography 38 fall into this category There are other examples of construct validity studies using instruments to measure skin temperature electrical skin resistance and or gross range of motion to discern a dysfunctional vertebral segment These measurements are then compared to those obtained by another examiner who utilizes one or several palpatory procedures that assess resistance to joint motion or paraspinal soft tissue abnormalities to help to discern a dysfunctional vertebral segment Or one examiner uses pain provocation and the other palpatory motion restriction sense to assess for a dysfunctional vertebral segment Criterion validity measures the extent to which an intervention allows a researcher to predict behavioral or pathological outcomes Criterion validity studies therefore do not measure the phenomenon being palpated but attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure e g with another measurable outcome like diagnosed visceral disease For example Beal 39 and Tarr 40 studied the ability of physicians using spinal palpatory procedures to identify or predict which patients had visceral disease related to the spinal findings of altered structure motion and or soft tissue Content validity is the extent to which a measure adequately and comprehensively measures what it claims to be measuring Although Troyanovich and Harrison 41 consider face and content validity as synonymous there is an important distinction content validity studies employ a reference standard A reference standard also called gold standard is a measure accepted by consensus of content experts as the best available for determining the presence or absence of a particular phenomenon When there is no perfect reference standard as in the case of measurement of a patient s sense of pain provocation i e pressing on a tender point or trigger point then pragmatic criteria can be used as a reference standard 42 The visual analog pain scale has been used as a pragmatic reference standard for palpatory pain provocation tests Ideally content validity studies attempt to compare a test with a reference standard of the same phenomenon as that which is being palpated i e palpable abnormalities in structure motion and soft tissue The Chiropractic Mercy Center Consensus Conference held in January 1993 identified and rated the value of various measurement instruments related to spinal joint functional assessment that could be used as reference standards 43 Based on their critical review of the literature Troyanovich and Harrison 44 suggested postural assessment instruments and radiographic measurement as valid reliable and clinically useful objective measurement tools to help identify dysfunctional spinal vertebral joints Based on this brief review it appears that construct and criterion validity studies do not measure the phenomenon being palpated Instead they attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure with another measurable outcome On the other hand content validity studies measure the same phenomenon as that which is being palpated Given how important it is to know whether the diagnostic tests used in palpatory exams are valid we conducted a systematic review to assess the content validity of spinal palpatory tests used to identify spinal neuro musculoskeletal dysfunction Methods Study setting The study was conducted at the Susan Samueli Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine University of California Irvine UCI A multi disciplinary team of clinicians researchers a statistician and a health sciences librarian participated in the systematic review The clinicians represented content area expertise in osteopathic and chiropractic medicine family medicine and clinical research In addition the researchers had expertise and experience in evidence based medicine research design and methodology Inclusion Exclusion Criteria The study inclusion exclusion criteria were adapted and modified from those published previously by the Cochrane Collaboration 45 and others 46 47 Studies included in the review met the following four criteria 1 the studies pertained to manual spinal cervical thoracic lumbar and surrounding para spinal soft tissue but not the sacrum or pelvis palpation procedures 2 the studies included measurement of validity or accuracy of spinal palpation where validity was defined as the capability of the manual spinal palpation procedure to do what it is supposed to do and accuracy was defined as a measure of how well it actually does that content validity 3 the studies were dissertations or a primary research studies published in a peer reviewed journal 4 the document could be written in any language 5 the primary research must have been published or accepted for publication and 6 all studies were made available between January 1 1966 and September 30 2002 Studies were excluded from the review based on the following criteria First the data pertained to non manual procedure s Second the studies included a whole regimen of tests or methods without separate data for each test and or the data for spinal palpatory procedure could not be retrieved Third although the document retrieved was relevant to the subject matter it was anecdotal speculative or editorial in nature Fourth the document retrieved was inconsistent with the inclusion criteria see Additional file 2 After review of the retrieved papers a secondary exclusion criterion inappropriate statistical tests used was applied Appropriate statistical tests included sensitivity and specificity predictive value likelihood ratio diagnostic odds ratio and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve ROC curves analysis Additional File 2 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria for developed and used for this study review Click here for file Search strategy A comprehensive strategy was designed to conduct a detailed search of pertinent literature that addressed the study question What is the content validity of spinal palpatory tests used to identify spinal neuro musculoskeletal dysfunction Specifics on the search strategy are described in another paper 48 In brief our search strategy included both online and manual searches for appropriate literature For the online search of literature we defined a detailed search template which we applied to appropriate databases The basic search template included MeSH Descriptors from MANTIS Biosis etc Medical Subject headings from CINAHL and related key terms generated by the investigators from the review team see Additional file 3 This defined the research question into four key concepts validity validity findings spine palpation procedure and neuro musculoskeletal dysfunctions Additional File 3 Key terms and search strategy used to identify articles in the databases used in this review Click here for file Limits for the search template included human studies publications in all languages journal articles research articles and conference proceedings if in press dissertations and publications between January 1 1966 and September 30 2002 We applied the search template with minor modifications to optimize and enhance the search outcome of individual databases to 11 databases that had a potential coverage for the areas of osteopathic medicine allopathic medicine chiropractic and physical therapy The databases accessed by the project included PubMed MEDLINE MANTIS CINAHL Web of Science Current Contents BIOSIS EMBase OCLC FirstSearch Cochrane Osteopathic Database and Index to Chiropractic Literature The selection of databases was based primarily on the availability of online resources that we could access from our affiliated institution libraries In addition to the online literature search strategy we used manual methods to identify appropriate literature These manual methods included gleaning references that were cited in studies selected from the online search consulting experts in the fields of chiropractic and osteopathic medicine contacting authors of eligible conference abstracts and manually searching bibliographies of osteopathic text books and review articles on somatic dysfunction Review strategy We used a three step selection process to identify articles for the systematic review First we reviewed titles identified through the online search and excluded those which gave no indication that the studies pertained to validity Second we reviewed the abstracts of all the remaining studies identified through the application of our search template and excluded studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria Third we reviewed the complete paper and applied the inclusion exclusion criteria to studies included at step two In all based on the online and manual searches 48 studies were fully reviewed Five studies met the inclusion exclusion criteria for the systematic review The remaining 43 studies were excluded because they did not study spinal palpation procedures did not assess content validity and or did not use appropriate statistical tests see Additional file 1 Several of the abstracts reviewed at step two of the selection process did not provide clarity towards a study s focus spinal palpation type of validity studied Additional File 1 Studies reviewed and excluded from this study organized by type of validity they were classified to Click here for file Review instruments Two instruments were developed to extract the data and assess the quality of the studies reviewed The instruments were developed taking into consideration previously published guidelines 49 50 and instruments 51 52 53 54 55 To maximize objectivity in the evaluation of paper quality a checklist of quality factors was developed and transformed into a quality assessment instrument The factors were grouped into 7 major components of quality study subjects examiner characteristics the reference standard used palpatory test study conditions data analysis and presentation of results see Table 2 Detailed information on the 7 components identified to denote internal validity and quality of a study were abstracted and scored In terms of the subject characteristics we considered criteria such as their socio demographic description presentation characteristics and severity of symptoms selection criteria and sample size determination procedures sample size and recruitment procedures Information regarding the examiners pertained to their selection criteria sample size and background The reference standard if used and palpatory procedure information pertinent to the quality scoring included a description of the tests their reliability and expected outcomes and definition of positive or negative test results The study conditions were documented with regards to consensus on and description of the palpatory procedure the training of examiners in the procedure and blinding of examiners and subjects For information on the data analysis and results we abstracted information on the type of statistical procedure s used to assess validity and how the results were displayed and described The quality assessment instrument focused mainly on the internal validity taking into consideration biases reported previously namely selection performance measurement and attrition bias A weight was assigned to each criterion based on a group consensus A maximum score of 100 points was set In designing this instrument we differentiated between quality of an article i e conduct of the trial and reproducibility and validity which relates to the ability of the study to answer the research question The data extraction and quality assessment instruments were structured to mirror each other and facilitate the review and scoring Using the quality assessment instrument each article was reviewed and scored on the seven major components discussed above by two blinded reviewers title names of author s and journal were removed The quality scores included an absolute score i e total points received on all seven components of the quality assessment form and a relative score i e absolute score total score that could be obtained 100 The relative score was especially important for studies wherein certain aspects of the quality scoring components were inapplicable i e the subjects criteria was inapplicable for studies which used mechanical models or measures An article s score absolute or relative indicated its quality in terms of its internal validity criteria whether conclusions drawn from study are likely to be unbiased and the authors explicit description of the study Although important the quality score does not imply a study s significance or impact in terms of findings relevance to the discipline Based on prior recommendations the overall quality of studies was assessed through the summary scores and the relevant methodological issues pertinent toward internal validity of a study were assessed individually and their influence explored 55 A pilot test of the data extraction and quality assessment instruments was conducted on four articles randomly selected from the 48 studies evaluated during step three of the study selection process After completion of the pilot test we made changes to further clarify and simplify the instruments For the final review the articles were blinded to journal title and author and randomly assigned to a pair of reviewers In all six reviewers three pairs conducted the final review abstracted pertinent data and scored each article based on the quality assessment instrument We used descriptive statistics on the quality assessment data to determine agreement disagreement among a pair of reviewers and to present the data The descriptive statistics included standard deviation S D Mean ratio histogram and variability To achieve a consensus between the pair of reviewers on the scoring of each article we calculated the standard deviation S D to mean score percentage Agreement on quality scores was defined as less than 10 variance S D Mean ratio in the paired reviewers scores on each article When the S D Mean ratio variance between the paired reviewers score was equal to or exceeded 10 the pair of reviewers attempted to reach a consensus on each of the criteria where disagreement existed When reviewers failed to arrive at a consensus on the quality score two content experts reviewed and scored the topic in contention by consensus Results Study description A total of five studies from the 48 articles retrieved and reviewed met our inclusion criteria for content validity and are discussed in this study TABLE 3 The remaining 43 studies 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 were retrieved reviewed and excluded from our study because they either did not address manual palpation procedure s did not pertain to content validity but focused on either construct predictive or criterion validity or used inappropriate statistics see Additional file 1 Four studies were published in 4 different journals and the fifth study included is a dissertation 99 Two studies were unfunded 1 dissertation 99 and 1 did not report any funding 100 Two studies 101 102 were funded by a Research Council and a liability insurance provider and one study 103 was funded by the Chiropractic Advancement Association Subjects The three motion palpation studies were done in the United Kingdom All three studies utilized mechanical models as the study subjects as well as the reference standard The two pain studies were done in Sweden One study 101 recruited only pregnant female subjects n 200 representing a 90 response rate 200 222 while the other study 102 recruited an entirely male population n 75 they failed to report the response rate with acute 1 week neck pain Examiners Senior chiropractic students and or experienced 3 yrs practitioners were the examiners in the three motion palpation studies One physical therapist was the examiner in the cervical spine pain provocation study The lumbar spine pain provocation study 101 did not specify the background of the examiner s Design All the studies used a prospective study design In 4 studies the examiners were blinded to fixation levels or clinical presentation In one pain study 101 blinding was not described Measurement Among the three studies using mechanical models 2 100 103 looked at intersegmental motion restriction and one 99 looked at the ability to determine fixation levels The mechanical model was the reference standard used The two pain studies used digital pressure and percussion to elicit pain Visual Analog Scale VAS and pain reported by subjects were used as reference standards Reliability of the palpation procedure was not reported in any papers with the exception of 1 103 looking at motion palpation in a mechanical model Quality Scoring Findings In general the quality score would indicate the rigor with which the science was presented in the paper Quality scores of included studies ranged from 45 5 to 82 out of a possible100 The overall quality of the included studies was good for those focusing on motion palpation 69 5 82 and fair for those looking at pain 45 5 55 5 see Table 4 Discussion of examiners and study conditions were the two major areas where weakness was noted in the two pain studies but not in the motion palpation studies Statistical tests used were adequate for all studies this was one of the inclusion criteria All studies were done in the 1990 s hence the time factor was not felt to be contributive Study findings Motion Palpation Tests The three studies examining motion palpation were similar in using a mechanical model as the reference standard and focusing on the lumbar spine only While two studies used similar examiner groups and motion test the third study 99 looked only at one group of examiners using two different motion test procedures Two studies 100 103 looked at intersegmental motion restriction using sagital and coronal motion as determined by two groups of chiropractic examiners with different experience levels senior students and practitioners Both studies presented data on sensitivity ability of a test to detect correctly restricted motion segments and specificity ability of a test to detect correctly unrestricted motion segments The sensitivity for both groups in each study varied between 0 510 and 0 636 and the specificity from 0 868 to 0 902 indicating less ability to detect restricted motion segments than unrestricted motion segments The sensitivity for practitioners in both studies was poor 0 478 and 0 526 For students the sensitivity was lower in the Harvey study 0 538 than the Jensen study 0 720 Based on the data provided in each of the studies we calculated the positive and negative predictive PPV NPV values and the likelihood ratio LR for each group The PPV was less than 50 0 in both studies for both groups 42 3 46 2 and for each subgroup While the NPV was greater than 80 83 93 7 supporting the above statement of better capability of these tests at detecting unrestricted than restricted motion Table 5 The third motion palpation study 99 looked at intersegmental motion restriction as determined by lateral flexion and posterior anterior springing PAS Examiners were 50 senior chiropractic students Sensitivity for lateral flexion was 41 2 and for PAS 42 8 while specificity for lateral flexion was 61 5 and PAS was 62 2 indicating that the motion palpation procedures utilized were neither sensitive nor specific for detecting spinal segmental motion restriction The calculated PPV 31 0 and NPV 73 7 for both tests supported this conclusion Pain Provocation The two studies differed in procedure location cervical vs thoracic lumbar reference standard VAS vs subjective patient report provocation test used and population studied The cervical study 102 assessed presence or absence of pain as reported by the subjects upon palpation of their facet joints Sensitivity ability of the test to identify presence of pain in subjects reporting pain symptoms was 82 and specificity ability of the test to identify the absence of pain in asymptomatic subjects was 79 the PPV was 62 and NPV was 91 The results indicate that the test procedure as performed is moderately good at identifying subjects with neck pain and very good at identifying asymptomatic subjects The thoracic and lumbar spine study 101 used the VAS as the reference standard and assessed the relationship between the clinical back status and reported pain locations during and after pregnancy Two types of pain provocation tests were used digital pressure within 5 cm of the midline and lumbar percussion In the thoracic region digital pressure DP sensitivity was 17 8 specificity was 98 5 calculated PPV was 72 2 and NPV was 84 4 In the lumbar region DP sensitivity was 21 2 specificity was 96 19 calculated PPV was 61 76 and NPV was 80 83 lumbar percussion sensitivity was 5 1 specificity was 100 calculated PPV was 100 and NPV was 78 4 see Table 6 These results suggest that the thoracic DP test was better at identifying asymptomatic than symptomatic subjects Both tests performed in the lumbar region were unable to discriminate adequately between subjects Discussion To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive systematic review of literature on the content validity of spinal palpatory procedures To reiterate it is imperative to focus on studies assessing content validity of procedures since by definition they attempt to measure the same phenomenon as that which is being palpated Studies with a focus on other forms of validity i e face construct and criterion although important provide information which does not directly answer the question Does the procedure i e palpation measure or assess the phenomenon it is supposed to assess but attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure with another measurable outcome The systematic review revealed several methodological reporting and research issues which severely constrained integrative qualitative and quantitative evaluations such as systematic reviews and meta analysis The evaluation of the validity of spinal palpatory procedures has a number of methodological challenges In particular there is no agreed upon reference or gold standard measuring device for spinal palpatory procedures A reference standard is the best available independently established test procedure used to determine the presence or absence of a phenomenon In the absence of well established reference standards one would use other research designs such as pragmatic criteria e g pain scales independent expert panels clinical follow up delayed type cross sectional study standardized protocols or prognostic criteria 104 One may also use the most reproducible and reliable test or the most experienced examiner as a reference standard Some designs utilize invasive procedures e g surgery histopathology or angiography or a combination of tests to serve as a reference standard It is important to identify a reference standard to which a palpatory diagnostic test is compared to ensure that it actually measures what it purports to measure i e that a test for resistance to motion actually measures resistance to motion Spinal palpatory diagnostic procedures like vertebral joint motion restriction assessment are difficult to objectively measure in humans The concept of a neuro musculoskeletal spinal dysfunction that is corrected by non invasive manual spinal manipulation has no agreed upon reference standard Typically a conglomerate of findings of altered position motion characteristics and paraspinal soft tissue feel is necessary to make the diagnosis X rays can be validated by altered position Altered motion has been difficult to validate due to the difficulty of finding a suitable reference standard However in order to assess an examiner s ability to discern resistance to vertebral joint motion the plastic spinal model with an artificially fixed vertebral segment has been employed as a reference standard Altered tissue feel can be validated in part by measuring skin moisture temperature friction and resistance to pressure A reference standard used for palpatory pain provocation tests has been the visual analog or numeric pain scale 105 106 107 Given that face construct and criterion validity studies do not measure the phenomenon being palpated but attempt to correlate the findings of a palpatory procedure with another measurable outcome only content validity studies which attempt to measure the same phenomenon as that which is being palpated were included in this systematic review Physicians orthopedists physiatrists neurologists emergency medicine family medicine sports medicine etc chiropractors massage therapists osteopaths and physical therapists use manual palpatory exams regularly in their practice However very few studies 5 have attempted to assess the content validity as defined in this paper of these widely used tests Among the few validity studies identified motion palpation tests were evaluated only by chiropractors and pain studies by physical therapists In this review 5 studies focused on three types of tests fixation 2 range of motion 1 and pain 2 The quality scores of motion palpation studies were good however all the tests had poor sensitivity This indicates that the motion palpatory tests intersegmental lateral flexion and posterior anterior springing are not able to identify areas of fixation or motion restriction A poor positive predictive Value PPV supported this finding The pain provocation studies reported good validity for evaluation of pain in the cervical region but not in the lumbar area This result confirms the results of a previously published 108 study indicating a higher sensitivity for identifying pain in the cervical region compared to the lumbar spine Unfortunately most of the research study results reported are not comparable due to variability in the palpatory tests terminology research design methodology and statistical analysis utilized These inconsistencies make it difficult to rate the relative value of their results There is a worldwide concerted effort underway to rectify this problem The International Federation of Manual Medicine FIMM an international organization of physicians and surgeons who practice manual medicine held their General Assembly in Chicago in July 2001 At that meeting their Scientific Committee reported that their top priority is to promote validity reliability sensitivity and specificity studies of spinal palpatory diagnostic procedures They recently developed guidelines Protocol Formats on how to perform high quality validity and reliability studies of spinal palpatory procedures which are available on their web site 9 They recommend the use of valid palpatory tests so that homogeneous populations with spinal musculoskeletal dysfunction can be selected and treated as part of a controlled clinical trial The results of these trials can subsequently be combined using meta analysis and would help formulate guidelines for the practice of spinal manipulation It is difficult to translate these results into the clinical setting due to the limited number of studies focused anatomical sites and populations studied Also argument could be advanced that the use of a mechanical model may not have external validity when applied to human subjects All three motion palpation studies used a mechanical model as the subjects and reference standard and focused on the lumbar spine Findings indicate poor validity of the motion palpation tests The 2 pain studies are of fair to poor quality One focused on examining pain in the lumbar spine of pregnant women and the other on pain in the cervical spine among men with acute injuries To translate these results into the clinical setting additional studies exploring the content validity of spinal palpatory exams using accepted reference standards are needed Identifying a perfect error free reference standard for each palpatory test is challenging Even widely accepted reference standards are imperfect e g histopathology 109 Therefore identifying a perfect reference standard is not as important as identifying an acceptable reference standard Content experts in this field should come to an agreement on acceptable reference standards for spinal palpatory tests This review is unique a by the cooperative work among a multidisciplinary team of researchers and content experts b the review was not limited to any specific discipline or language c the focus on content validity is practical and clinically relevant to practitioners and researchers d a great effort and detail went into the development of the search strategy inclusion exclusion criteria and quality scoring instrument The search strategy included 11 databases and was done three times using general and specific keywords and strategies to verify results The quality scoring instrument was developed taking into consideration strengths and weakness of published instruments recommendations by the QUOROM 110 and CONSORT 111 112 statements as well as the Cochrane criteria In addition this study makes a contribution to the field of manipulation and medicine in general by highlighting the limited research and reference standards in this field It also provides future researchers with a guideline to follow to design a successful content validity study As with a majority of reviews this is a retrospective review which makes it susceptible to potential sources of bias publication quality The focused definition used for content validity limits the studies that are included in this review However this strategy allowed more clarity since only content validity studies were included in this systematic review Despite the number of safeguards used to be inclusive multiple databases hand search review by experts and multiple searches in our search a few studies published but not included in these databases could have been missed The quality assessment tool used for this review was developed by this team of researchers based on their evaluation of the literature feedback from methodologists and statisticians Although we feel that the instrument is well balanced and unbiased it might have over or underestimated the quality of certain papers When comparing the quality scores assigned to studies included in this paper to scores assigned to the same papers in another systematic review 27 one notes that our scores are consistently lower Conclusion Despite the use of manual spinal palpation by many health care disciplines very few studies investigated their ability to measure what they intend to measure content validity Given the high frequency of spinal pathology and the use of these diagnostic methods to investigate them well designed studies are needed For the practice of evidence based medicine it is important to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of procedures usually and customarily used in clinical practice To this end established benchmarks for the validity and reliability of procedures are essential This comprehensive systematic review has highlighted serious gaps in our knowledge about the accuracy of spinal palpatory procedures The findings have implications for research clinical practice and policy From the research perspective researchers across discipline need to incorporate more rigor towards the definition of the study questions methods and measures implementation procedures and reporting The absence of well identified reference standards and possible technical difficulties conducting these studies might have contributed to this scarcity From the clinical perspective the findings suggest poor sensitivity of the range of motion and pain diagnostic tests in the evaluation of spinal dysfunction From a policy perspective given that manual procedures are a cornerstone towards diagnostic and therapeutic interventions across disciplines professional societies and associations need to enact continuing medical education and research guidelines to address the efficacy of spinal palpatory procedures Competing interests None declared Authors contributions All listed authors worked collectively on the design of the study and development of the review
