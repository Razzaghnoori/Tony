HEALTH RESOURCES AND SERVICES ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED ORGAN PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPLANTATION NETWORK RIN 0906 AA32 i Cost benefit analysis HHS performed a Regulatory Impact Analysis which is included in the preamble to the final rule HHS recognizes in its analysis the difficulty of quantifying the costs and the benefits of the rule There is a discussion of the current costs of transplantation and the analysis concludes that the final rule will not substantially raise the costs Regarding benefits HHS discusses the use of the value of a statistical life as a quantifying benefit and the fact that in the area of transplantation the usefulness of such a measure is reduced because of the older average age of recipients and the substantial risk of either the graft or the patient not surviving Another benefit of the rule is the public oversight and accountability of the organ transplant system which will preserve public trust and confidence Also a system of patient oriented information of transplant performance will allow easier comparison of transplant center performance and the use of performance goals will create equity in the system ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 The Secretary of HHS has certified that the final rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities However because of concern over the effects of changes in allocation policies on smaller hospitals and because HHS considered as an alternative the possibility of imposing quality standards on transplant hospitals a voluntary Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared and is included in the rule s preamble The major portion of the analysis discusses the alternatives considered and the reasons why required volume or performance standards for transplant programs and imposing specific allocation standards focusing on geographic equity were rejected in favor of the performance standards adopted GAO OGC 98
