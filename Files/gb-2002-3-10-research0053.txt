 Background Retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements that make up a large fraction of most eukaryotic genomes They are particularly abundant in plants where they are often a principal component of nuclear DNA In maize 50 80 and in wheat fully 90 of the genome is made up of retrotransposons 1 2 In animals this percentage is generally lower than in plants but can still be large For example more than 40 of the human genome is now known to be composed of retroelements 3 4 All retrotransposons are distinguished by a life cycle involving an RNA intermediate The RNA genome of a retroelement is copied into a double stranded DNA molecule by reverse transcriptase and is subsequently integrated into the host s genome Retrotransposons fall into two main categories those with long terminal repeats LTRs such as retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons and those that lack such repeats for example long interspersed nuclear elements or LINEs Our laboratory is in the process of screening the GenBank rice Oryza sativa database GBRD and the Monsanto rice dataset MRD for the presence of LTR retrotransposons We have chosen to scan the rice genome because as the most important food crop in the world much of its sequence data is already available With a haploid content of 430 million base pairs Mbp the rice genome is the smallest among cultivated cereals 5 6 and only about three times larger than the smallest known genome among angiosperms that of Arabidopsis thaliana 130 Mbp O sativa has one of the smallest genomes among grasses as a whole 6 Genomes of other cereals are far larger For example the maize Zea mays genome is 2 500 million base pairs 2 5 Gbp and that of wheat Triticum aestivum 16 Gbp The molecular genetic resources for rice are excellent including detailed physical and genetic maps large YAC and BAC libraries an efficient transformation system and an extensive collection of expressed sequence tags ESTs We have used a new search program LTR_STRUC LTR retrotransposon structure program E M M and J F M unpublished work as the initial data mining tool in our survey Structural features important to the algorithm on which LTR_STRUC is based include two sites critical to replication the primer binding site PBS and polypurine tract PPT as well as the presence of canonical dinucleotides at the ends of each LTR typically TG and CA Particularly important are the direct or target site repeats TSRs When an LTR retrotransposon inserts itself into host DNA a short usually 4 6 bp segment of host DNA is replicated at the site of insertion This feature allows LTR_STRUC to make an exact demarcation of the limits of a putative element Because it searches for retroelements on the basis of their generic structure LTR_STRUC eliminates much of the bias inherent in BLAST searches based on a known retroelement query After elements were initially identified using LTR_STRUC sequence analyses were carried out to identify open reading frames ORFs encoding reverse transcriptase RT and other retrotransposon proteins Subsequent RT sequence alignments were carried out followed by construction of phylogenetic trees RTs from elements identified in our survey fall into numerous distinct families where family is defined as a group of elements with RTs having mutual similarity of at least 90 at the amino acid level 7 In addition four types of non autonomous elements discussed here lack RT sequences Osr25 Osr37 Rire4 Osr43 and Osr44 and were classified as distinct families on the basis of their unique structures see below Currently there is no consensus with respect to rice retrotransposon nomenclature In our method of nomenclature rice LTR retrotransposons are specified by the appellation Osr Oryza sativa retrotransposon Distinct families are indicated by number for example Osr1 Osr2 Osr3 There have been four different nomenclatures previously used in reference to rice LTR retrotransposons Tos transposon Oryza sativa 8 Rire rice retrotransposon 9 Rrt rice retrotransposon S Wang submission to EMBL database Rtr3 accession number T03666 Rrt5 T03669 and Rrt8 T03671 and Osr Oryza sativa retrotransposon N Jwa submission to GenBank Osr1 AB046118 We have chosen to adopt the Osr nomenclature in this study because it is consistent with the systematic logic indicative of genus and species of host organism used in previous genomic studies of LTR retrotransposons and includes the letter r to indicate retrotransposon However in every case where we use the Osr acronym in this paper to refer to a previously named family we also include any pre existing name s for the family for example Osr15 Tos12 Osr26 Rire2 Results and discussion Intra element percent LTR nucleotide identity Because of the replication process characteristic of LTR retrotransposons the LTRs of a given retroelement are sequentially identical at the time the element inserts into the host genome 18 Thereafter as an element accumulates mutations its LTRs become increasing different from each other as substitutions specific for each of the two LTRs increase in number The level of nucleotide identity seen between LTRs of a particular element usually referred to as intra element percent LTR nucleotide identity LNI can be used in determining the relative ages of LTR retrotransposon families 7 In rice comparison of the two LTRs of the same element often showed the presence of a 10 to 30 bp regional duplication present in one LTR but not the other In calculating LNI we have considered such duplications as single mutation events As the neutral nucleotide substitution rate has yet to be computed for rice we cannot presently equate LNI with a divergence time in years However the generally low level of sequence divergence between flanking LTRs of rice LTR retrotransposons 1 7 indicates that most of the euchromatic full length LTR retrotransposons in rice are relatively young although significantly older elements were also identified The seeming preponderance of young full length LTR retrotransposons in the euchromatin of rice is similar to previous reports on yeast 19 20 Caenorhabditis elegans 7 A thaliana 21 and Drosophila melanogaster 12 This contrasts with findings in Z mays 12 and humans 22 Copia like families To date 23 families of copia like elements have been reported for rice S Wang submission to EMBL N Jwa submission to GenBank and 8 9 19 23 24 Several have been described under more than one name For example the amino acid sequence given for Tos4 in Hirochika et al 23 is the same as that given for Tos1 in GenBank accession number S22455 so they are really the same Rire5 described by Kumekawa et al 25 is the same family as Tos14 previously described by Hirochika et al 23 The equivalence between Tos14 and Rire5 became evident when we found the LTR sequence reported by Kumekawa et al in elements that also contained the RT sequence given by Hirochika for Tos14 In our survey of GenBank and MRDB we have identified an additional 16 copia like families that have not been described by previous workers In addition exemplars for each of the previously identified families were found except in the case of certain families that exist at such low copy numbers that no full length element exists in GenBank or MRDB The largest copia like family One of the most interesting new finds in our survey was Osr8 one of the oldest families of LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome On the basis of a survey of the available portion of the GBRD and MRD we estimate the copy number of Osr8 to be around 1 100 more than any other copia like family Osr8 elements exist far more frequently as fragments ratio of 10 1 and they display relatively low levels of LNI in their full length copies mean LNI for the five full length Osr8 elements present in the GBRD is 97 2 The RT of Osr8 is 60 similar to an unnamed polyprotein in Z mays AAD20307 A closely related family Osr10 has two full length copies in the GBRD but scans of the MRD suggest this element also previously unrecognized has the third highest copy number 400 among copia like elements Outside rice the RT of Osr10 shows highest similarity 65 to that of the maize retrotransposon Opie 2 T04112 The broader clade that includes Osr7 Osr8 Osr9 and Osr10 is closely related to Endovir1 1 AAG52949 of Arabidopsis Figure 1 Table 2 These elements are also related 60 similar to maize s PREM 2 as well as to tomato s ToRTL1 Both Osr7 and Osr9 are present in very low copy number one full length and a few fragments in the GBRD Osr14 Tos1 Tos4 Osr15 Tos12and Osr53 Tos18 Although it is present at only about a quarter of the copy number of Osr8 the unrelated Osr14 Tos1 Tos4 is also composed primarily of highly fragmented elements Those that are full length have low LNI family mean 97 6 Thus Osr14 Tos1 Tos4 and Osr8 seem to be of similar age and to have followed a similar evolutionary pattern albeit with less intense amplification in the case of Osr14 Tos1 Tos4 Osr14 Tos1 Tos4 Osr15 Tos12 and Osr53 Tos18 form a well defined clade and are more closely related to Ta1 2 S23315 of Arabidopsis than to any other rice retroelement family outside their clade Figure 1 Table 2 Osr15 Tos12 and Osr53 are only just sufficiently different to constitute distinct families A quartet of closely allied families Osr1 Tos14 Rire5 Osr13 Tos5 Osr51 Tos15 and Osr52 Tos16 have been described as distinct families but inasmuch as their RTs are all 85 similar to each other these groups are only marginally distinct Searches of GenBank show that elements in this group are much more closely related to 75 80 at the amino acid level to maize retrotransposon Fourf AAK73108 than to any rice LTR retrotransposon outside their clade If the elements belonging to this group were considered to be a single family it would be almost as large 900 elements as Osr8 In the GBRD the majority of these elements are fragmentary but the estimated copy number of full length elements in the rice genome for this quartet still exceeds 100 A Hopscotch like clade of fragmented elements Osr18 Osr19 Osr20 Osr22 Osr23 Osr24 Osr45 Tos7 and Osr46 Tos8 form a clade of low copy number families composed primarily of fragmentary copies Our results suggest that each of these families has a copy number in the range of 50 100 elements Members of this clade are closely related to maize s Hopscotch element T04112 Figure 1 Table 2 Low copy number copia like families Osr2 and Osr12 are low copy families and are represented in the GBRD by two and three copies respectively all of which are full length although one copy of Osr12 contains a large internal deletion suggesting that these elements may have recently invaded the rice genome The high level of LTR nucleotide identity 99 seen in these elements is consistent with this recent invasion hypothesis Members of Osr12 and Osr2 are potentially active because they have large intact polyprotein ORFs usually in excess of 1 000 amino acids All three Osr12 elements detected in the GBRD are on chromosome 10 Similarly both Osr2 elements are inserted within 50 kb of each other on chromosome 4 Nonetheless these two families are not closely related their RT sequences are only 50 similar at the amino acid level Osr12 RTs differ from those of all other rice copia like elements by 50 And yet RT sequences of elements in Osr12 are 60 similar to certain elements in the maize genome Zmr1 S27768 and mzecopia M94481 1 One full length and one fragmented copy of Osr6 are present in the GBRD Osr5 is slightly more common than Osr6 to which it is most closely related but it is currently represented in the GBRD by only a single full length copy and a few fragments Osr5 is 60 similar to the tobacco retrotransposon Tnt1 94 at the amino acid level RT comparison Osr4 is another low copy family It has several fragmented representatives in the GBRD and is probably somewhat older than Osr12 and Osr2 but it has only three full length copies in the GBRD Osr4 elements have an exceptionally large polyprotein ORF 1 600 amino acids The RT of Osr4 shows 50 similarity to that of retroelements in the Arabidopsis genome for example BAB01972 NP_175303 Although the RT of Osr3 was detected during our survey elements in this family are fragments with ill defined LTRs TBLASTN reveals the RT of Osr3 to be the single representative of its type in the GBRD Both Osr3 and the equally aberrant Osr21 Tos17 differ from those of other copia like elements found in our study by about 55 Osr11 Rire1 is a low copy family closely related 75 similarity to a retroelement in the Arabidopsis genome Atr 2 T01860 Two other closely related families are Osr16 Tos6 and Osr17 both of which are similar to Sto 4 T17429 of maize Figure 1 Table 2 Nine additional low copy families identified by earlier workers are Osr47 Tos9 Osr48 Tos10 Osr49 Tos11 Osr50 Tos13 Osr54 Tos19 Osr55 Tos20 Osr57 Rtr3 Osr58 Rrt5 and Osr59 Rrt8 Source references for each of these nine families are given in Table 3 Gypsy like families predominate in O sativa Osr27 Rire9 26 is the third largest family in the rice genome with an estimated copy number of 900 elements mostly full length Li et al 26 estimated the copy number of this family at 1 600 The typical Osr27 Rire9 element is quite large 12 8 kb total length Having intact polyprotein ORFs and high mean LNI 99 these elements probably are or recently have been actively transposing Yet the presence of a few members of this family that are more mutated short ORFs low LTR LTR nucleotide identity suggests that this may also be an ancient family Two other families Osr40 and Osr41 are also members of the same clade as Osr27 Rire9 Osr25 and Osr26 Rire2 Osr25 and Osr26 Rire2 are discussed below but both have RTs that are about 30 different from those of Osr26 Rire2 and Osr27 Rire9 Neither Osr40 nor Osr41 has been previously identified but with approximate copy numbers of 600 and 300 respectively these are both large families The RTs of members of this clade show about 60 similarity to that of Retrosor1 Sorghum bicolor AAD19359 With approximately 1 500 elements Osr30 constitutes 14 of all LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome Although Osr30 is the largest family of LTR retroelements in the genome it has not been previously named These elements are slightly larger 13 1 kb than those of Osr27 Rire9 A higher proportion of fragmented copies and lower level of LTR LTR nucleotide identity suggest that Osr30 is older than Osr27 Rire9 Osr29 which is closely allied to Osr30 is also a large family with more than 500 member elements Taken together the elements of the Osr29 and Osr30 clade are unusual because they are as closely related to other major rice clades as they are to any elements outside rice Osr28 is a low copy family that is most closely related to Osr29 and Osr30 Figure 2 Two other large gypsy like families are Osr33 Rire8 25 and Osr34 These two families each have copy numbers of approximately 500 Two low copy families belonging to the same clade are Osr32 and Osrs6 Rire3 27 Figure 2 Members of these families have large LTRs typically in the range 3 000 3 500 bp RTs of families in this clade show high sequence similarity to an LTR retrotransposon in pineapple 70 to Acr 1 CAA73042 and to one in Sorghum bicolor 77 to Retrosor3 AAD221153 Figure 2 Low copy gypsy like elements Osr31 Rire7 is an aberrant low copy family that is much more closely related 77 similarity to an Arabidopsis element Atr 4 see Table 2 than to any other LTR retroelement families in the rice genome Figure 2 In the clade of five low copy families composed of Osr35 Osr36 Osr38 Osr39 and Osr42 an RT was found in the GBRD for only two families Osr35 and Osr36 The other elements were identified in scans of the MRD and their full sequences have since been submitted to GenBank for accession numbers see Table 1 This clade is closely related to Arabidopsis element Atr 5 Figure 2 Table 2 Families of non autonomous elements Members of family Osr25 are all internally deleted and thus non autonomous mean length 4 3 kb Although Osr25 elements have typical LTRs PBS and PPT the inter LTR region contains only non coding repetitive DNA The LTRs of Osr25 display 65 70 sequence similarity to the autonomous elements of the gypsy like family Osr26 Rire2 Elements with LTRs having such a high degree of similarity are usually considered members of the same family Nevertheless because members of Osr26 Rire2 have the usual coding structure typical of other gypsy like elements while Osr25 elements entirely lack typical retroviral genes and members of these two families fall into two sharply distinct non overlapping clades we report these two types of elements as separate families Estimates based on scans of the MRD and the GBRD suggest that the rice genome contains about 500 copies each of Osr25 and Osr26 Rire2 Osr25 and Osr26 Rire2 display 98 9 and 97 9 LNI respectively Osr37 Rire4 is also aberrant compared to other rice LTR retrotransposon families The typical element in this family is 4 4 kb long about the same length as Osr25 elements Members of Osr37 Rire4 usually carry a large ORF up to 600 amino acids just upstream of the 3 LTR This ORF shows no significant similarity to any known RT sequence Up to the present in the GBRD where these ORFs are generally identified simply as hypothetical proteins the large ORF of Osr37 Rire4 seems not to have been recognized as a retroviral gene This ORF may serve an integrase function as BLAST searches show that it has low homology to a putative integrase in A thaliana 28 AC005171 There are about 600 copies of Osr37 Rire4 in the entire rice genome In addition to the foregoing copia and gypsy like families our scans identified two families Osr43 and Osr44 of small elements overall length 2 000 bp With LTRs only 148 bp long and an overall length of 1 207 bp Osr44 elements are especially small Members of Osr43 and Osr44 are unique because although they possess all of the canonical LTR retrotransposon structural features LTRs PBS PPT and TSRs they are internally deleted and either completely lack or encode only very small ORFs with no similarity to any known protein Both families contain on the order of 100 copies genome wide Conclusions Rice LTR retrotransposons are a significant component of the rice genome We estimate that LTR retrotransposons constitute at least 17 of the O sativa genome Although this value is lower than the estimated percentage of LTR retrotransposons in the genomes of other cereal plants 2 12 it is more than tenfold greater than the estimated percentage of LTR retrotransposons in A thaliana a species with a genome one third the size of the rice genome 21 This disproportionate increase in the percentage of LTR retrotransposons as a function of genome size is consistent with the view that genome size variability in plants is often heavily dependent on variation in LTR retrotransposon content 27 28 We have determined that individual full length LTR retrotransposons present in the sequenced euchromatic regions of the rice genome are all relatively young displaying on average greater than 98 sequence identity between their LTRs Comparative genomic studies of LTR retrotransposons in both plants and animals have revealed that species with smaller genomes 7 10 19 20 21 do not harbor older families of LTR retrotransposons as do species with larger genomes 12 22 It has been hypothesized that the rate of turnover of retroelements may be higher in small genomes as a result of the presence of less effective epigenetic silencing mechanisms 10 It remains to be determined whether or not this hypothesis is an adequate explanation of the apparent lack of older full length LTR retrotransposons in the euchromatic portion of the rice genome In general the major clades of rice LTR retrotransposons are more closely related to elements present in other species than to the other clades of rice elements suggesting that horizontal transfer may have occurred over the evolutionary history of rice LTR retrotransposons Further analysis is required to definitively test the horizontal transfer hypothesis The newly developed search algorithm LTR_STRUC we have used in this study to initially identify LTR retrotransposons in the rice genome is not dependent upon sequence homology as are standard search methods such as BLAST As a consequence we identified several previously unreported families of rice LTR retrotransposons consisting of non coding and in some cases repeating sequence motifs LTR retrotransposons of similar structure have recently been identified within the genomes of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants 29 Preliminary evidence suggests that these elements may have a significant role in restructuring plant genomes over evolutionary time 29 Materials and methods Automated characterization of LTR retrotransposons using LTR_STRUC LTR_STRUC identifies new LTR retrotransposons on the basis of the presence of characteristic retroelement features E M M and J F M unpublished work It scans nucleotide sequence data for putative LTR pairs aligns the putative pairs and scores them on the basis of the presence absence of expected motifs such as TSRs canonical dinucleotides PBS PPT and so on When a given pair receives a score above a user specified cut off an output record is generated that specifies salient information about the putative element such as the length of the transposon and its LTRs its position within the contig an alignment of its LTRs the nucleotide sequence of the transposon its LTRs and target site repeats as well as a file listing all ORFs In our study once putative elements were identified sequence analysis was carried out on the individual output files to identify those that described actual LTR retrotransposons Additional elements were identified by BLAST searches using elements located by LTR_STRUC as queries Datasets scanned Initial scans with LTR_STRUC were conducted on a dataset consisting of the 29 8 Mb of O sativa BAC derived sequence data available in GenBank at the time of the initial scan December 2000 This dataset TDS was obtained from the TIGR website 30 Subsequently LTR_STRUC was used to scan the non redundant MRD a product of the Monsanto Rice Genome Sequencing Project The MRD is based on an initial dataset of 3 391 BACs distributed across the genome of O sativa cv Nipponbare the same cultivar used by the International Rice Genome Sequencing Project Removal of contaminants and redundancies from this initial dataset produced the MRD consisting of 52 202 contigs totaling 259 Mb of the 430 Mb rice genome More recently in an effort to determine the relative copy numbers of the various families and identify additional elements not picked up in our initial survey with LTR_STRUC we have used representative sequences from each retrotransposon family identified in this study as queries to conduct BLAST searches against both the MRD and the GBRD Thus the results reported here constitute a reasonably unbiased survey of LTR retrotransposon diversity in rice Both the MRD and GBRD are heavily weighted toward euchromatic sequences The amount of data scanned was significantly less than the total amount of nucleotide sequence contained in the MRD and GBRD Much of the MRD 36 is composed of contigs that are less than 10 kb long and are therefore of limited utility for the LTR_STRUC program which finds only full length elements rice gypsy like elements are typically longer than 10 kb and are not entirely contained in such short contigs In the case of the GBRD the amount of rice nucleotide sequence available for search was less than one third of the 174 Mb released to the public because of 15 redundancy the GBRD sequences amounted to a total of only about 150 Mb of which only some 50 Mb were actually available for BLAST search because most of these sequences were in the process of being finished RT sequences were identified according to previously described criteria 31 32 Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses The RT domains of the Osr elements were aligned with previously reported RT sequences Table 2 The ClustalW analysis 33 extension to MacVector 7 0 was used to generate two amino acid alignments one for gypsy like and one for copia like elements Draw N J Tree and Bootstrap N J commands of ClustalW were then used to generate non bootstrapped and bootstrapped trees respectively
