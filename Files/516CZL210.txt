 February 1994 Dear Friend and Donor Indiana University is fortunate to have alumni and friends like you who have made 1993 one of the best years ever in private support for the institution More than 70 000 donors have demonstrated in a very real way their understanding of the need for private funding so necessary if the University is to maintain and enhance its service to society Indiana s reputation as one of the leading universities in the nation continues to grow Along with these accolades comes the challenge to sustain that level of excellence Private gifts are the only way we can meet the expectations of such an environment This is where your caring concern for the welfare of the University means so much University Chancellor Herman B Wells once remarked that the longer he spent studying university finance the more he was convinced that the peaks of excellence are provided typically by private money Indiana University s peaks of excellence are becoming more numerous and at the same time more vulnerable Enclosed is a reply card and envelope with the hope that you will consider beginning 1994 with a gift to IU It truly is a wise investment in the bright future ahead As an Indiana resident supporting IU you are entitled to a credit against your State taxes for your gift The form you will need to claim your credit and attach to your return is enclosed Thank you for your continuing support of Indiana University We are very grateful Sincerely Curtis R Simic President
