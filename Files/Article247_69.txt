 Who s on Top A split in the commentariat Writing in Time Andrew Ferguson says that if Clinton is driven from office it will be not be because he had an adulterous affair while in the White House but because the girl is by many definitions still a girl 21 fresh from college and decent people in positions of power do not exploit the vulnerable for kicks It will also be because of the kind of sex they had which Ferguson following press accounts of Monica s accounts characterizes as strictly one way designed for maximum pleasure of the president Meanwhile in The New Yorker Larissa MacFarquhar rejects the notion that Monica is a victim She s a college graduate of twenty one who will at worst wind up with a great book deal And Clinton is a babe Who s right MacFarquhar s historical scholarship is open to question She seems to believe Lewinsky got to sleep with the President something the tapes actually contradict As the girl who lives down the hall from Chatterbox complains she gives him a blow job and then has to wait around in receiving lines On the other hand suppose Clinton had gone all the way and driven Lewinsky wild with pleasure Would that change Ferguson s mind Probably not As for the age difference well wouldn t it be just typical of baby boomers like Ferguson to define anyone younger than they are as immature not quite adult Chatterbox believes the dynamics of human sexuality are complex and subtle and it s hard to tell who is taking advantage of whom at any one time Clinton may be a user but you don t get driven from office for being a user Name a successful pol who isn t He doesn t seem to have egregiously led Lewinsky on with lies and fake JFK style promises of love or matrimony in the classic male asshole mode Yes he did talk of strains in his marriage and suggested the he d be alone after he left the White House But that may have been the truth Overall the situation must have been pretty clear Chatterbox sides with MacFarquhar at least at this point in time Neither Lewinsky nor Clinton were victims There were victims but they are to be found outside the relationship Oh yes If true Almost forgot
