 Background Identification of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF vascular permeability factor VPF responsive genes could potentially help elucidate the detail molecular mechanisms of endothelial cells EC activation EC activation is a program of gene expression that could affect angiogenesis permeability and inflammation that are closely associated with a large number of vascular diseases Recent studies show that priming of quiescent ECs with appropriate cytokines could switch on the EC transcription machinery the genes and protein products of which could activate ECs Mediators known to activate ECs include inflammatory cytokines growth factors such as VEGF VPF and basic fibroblast growth factor bFGF extracellular matrix ECM proteins such as collagen and fibronectin and proteases such as MMPs 1 2 In vitro and in vivo assays indicate that VEGF signaling promotes increased permeability cell migration proliferation and differentiation functioning through two EC specific tyrosine kinase receptor such as Kinase domain receptor KDR 1 2 3 In the majority of solid tumors VEGF is upregulated in response to hypoxia inducing the expression of pro angiogenic genes that promote tumor angiogenesis growth and eventual metastasis 3 4 5 The expression of both positive and negative factors must be tightly and specifically regulated in a coordinated manner Uncontrolled expressions of these factors could activate the EC transcription machinery which could promote pathological consequences including tumor growth and metastasis 3 4 5 6 Thus the identification and dissection of the cellular and molecular pathways associated with EC activation may reveal novel clues which could provide further understanding of biological processes such as wound healing vascular permeability and angiogenesis among others A number of in vitro model systems have thus been developed to study EC activation that employs either one or more combinations of ECM molecules including fibrin fibronectin collagens laminins and Matrigel matrices together with PMA and FGF 7 8 9 When placed in a 3D type I collagen matrix and stimulated with PMA VEGF or bFGF ECs undergo rapid morphological changes and differentiate into capillary like tubular networks Transcriptional inhibitors block this in vitro tube formation suggesting that the angiogenesis requires EC activation and gene expression 8 9 Indeed a recent review describes approaches used to identify such angiogenesis related genes 10 Although many angiogenesis related soluble factors ECM components and intracellular signaling pathways have been identified and elucidated their subsequent targets and their mode of action still remain to be determined Despite extensive studies for example the molecular mechanisms underlying endothelial cell activation and EC differentiations are not entirely understood To better understand molecular mechanisms and pathways of EC activation we embedded ECs in 3D type I collagen in presence or absence of human recombinant VEGF 165 RNAs isolated from these cultures were then subjected to suppression subtractive hybridization and differential display SSHDD Through this method we identified a set of 11 new induced genes previously not reported to be associated with the processes of EC activation We confirmed expressions of candidate genes in ECs by northern and western blot analyses There is a large number of literature showing microarray and gene expression profiling analysis of EC transcriptome However this preliminary study forms the basis for the future experiments involving analyses of signaling pathways associated with EC activation that are crucial for many pathophysiological conditions including angiogenesis cardiovascular diseases and growth of solid tumors Results Identification of VEGF responsive endothelial cell genes using SSHDD Angioblasts and ECs are the precursor cells that can form functional blood vessels in response to specific angiogenic stimuli To study the molecular mechanisms underlying capillary morphogenesis in ECs we used a well established in vitro model of angiogenesis Model system employed in our study closely resembles with those that have been described previously 7 8 9 Either human microvascular endothelial cells HMECs or human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECs were seeded between two thin layers of type I collagen gels and overlayed with complete media supplemented with VEGF 165 as described in methods This typically induced cytoplasmic projections spikes and extensions elongations of ECs within 4 to 8 hr These processes were considered to represent a precursor to cell elongation interconnections of cells and eventual tubule formation A small population of ECs that failed to elongate did not form such interconnections This model system closely approximates ECM proteolysis cell migration proliferation and capillary formation Representative photomicrographs of VEGF induced capillary morphogenesis in ECs after 8 hr and 16 hr are shown in Figs 1Aand 1B respectively Figure 1Cshows ECs forming at 200X magnification elaborate interconnections and vacuole formation at 36 hr Although control un stimulated ECs formed interconnections at the end of 24 hr but fail to form any capillaries data not shown Eosin staining of these structures demonstrated that the capillaries were surrounded by at least three to five ECs Fig 1D To identify genes associated with activation of ECs we used the method of SSHDD By employing forward and reverse subtraction we identified both common indicated by arrows and differentially expressed genes Fig 1E 1F The addition of VEGF into ECs embedded in the 3D type I collagen matrix forward subtraction generated more than 450 cDNA fragments To eliminate the identification of artifactual clones we analyzed only those cDNA fragments that were detected at least 4 times Based on this criterion only 311 cDNA fragments clones out of 450 sequences clones were retained for further evaluation From this 311 a total number of 32 induced fragments were identified and sequenced Table I Database search with these nucleotide sequences using the BLAST algorithm revealed many known positive or negative regulators of angiogenesis including proteases and cell surface receptors Importantly we identified 11 VEGF responsive candidate genes associated with the activation of endothelial cells Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Genes by Northern Blot To confirm the differential expression of genes identified by SSHDD we performed Northern blot analysis of total RNA isolated from ECs grown in 3D collagen matrices The expression of 5 known regulators of angiogenesis KDR and 2 integrin VE cadherin MMP1 and MMP2 as well as 11 candidate genes Figs 2 4 Table I identified were analyzed Consistent with previous reports the expression of KDR VEGFR 2 increased by 2 5 fold at 12 hours 2 fold at 24 hrs and 1 5 fold at 36 hours in response to VEGF 165treatment Fig 2A whereas the expression of 2 integrin subunit was increased by 5 fold at 12 hours by 2 fold at 24 hrs and was barely detectable at 36 hrs Fig 2B 11 12 Expression of VE cadherin was minimal at the earlier time points but significantly increased at the end of 36 hours Fig 2C MMP1 expression remained robustly active from 12 to 36 hours Fig 2D While expression of MMP2 appeared to be biphasic highest expressions were detected at 12 and 36 hrs Fig 2E Equal loading of RNAs was confirmed by probing membrane with a actin cDNA probe data not shown Northern analyses of clones 7D 3B 17E 22G 33A 37F 48A 54C 77D 94H 263F and 309C were performed at 24 hrs following VEGF 165treatment Fig 3A 3B 3C 3D 3E 3F 3G 3H 3I 3J 3K 3L Northern blot analysis did not support the differential expression of clone 54C Fig 3H Clone 7D 3B and 309C probes each detected 2 transcripts which could be either alternatively spliced products or related genes Clone 17E 22G 33A 37F 48A 54C 77D 94H 263F probes detected single transcripts Fig 3C 3D 3E 3F 3G 3H 3I 3J 3K Of particular note probe 3B corresponding to Stanniocalcin detected primarily the lower isoform 1 9 kb in ECs While probe 309C corresponding to Stabilin is known to produce three isoforms Most likely ECs primarily express Stabilin 1 and 2 that are 7 8 and 6 2 kbs isoforms respectively The GAPDH probe was included as a control for the quantity and integrity of the loaded RNA detecting a single transcript of 1 3 kb All data shown are representative of those obtained in at least three separate experiments with similar results Confirmation of Differentially Expressed Genes by Western Blot To confirm that the genes identified by SSHDD encode proteins we performed Western blot analysis of total cellular protein isolated from ECs grown in monolayers The addition of bFGF VEGF or PMA to the monolayers ECs induced cellular elongation over a period of 8 to 24 hr In contrast unstimulated ECs remained proliferative and retained a cobblestone appearance data not shown Western blot analysis revealed that VEGF and PMA but not bFGF induced the expression of KDR Flt 1 and the 2 integrin subunit at 48 hr Fig 4A 4B 4C Likewise only VEGF and PMA upregulated the expression of VE Cadherin Fig 4D As expected all 3 cytokines induced the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 2 Fig 4Eand 4F These cytokines also induced expression of Kinesin Fig 4G albeit less appreciably Furthermore we found dramatic increase in expression of VCIP PAP2b in ECs that were stimulated with VEGF and PMA Fig 4H lane 3 and 4 in contrast in bFGF stimulated cells Fig 4 lane 2 or in control Fig 4 lane 1 its expression remained undetectable Anti Grb2 mAb was included as control for protein loading Fig 4I These data suggest that the cDNA fragments detected by SSHDD were indeed active genes that produce proteins that could activate endothelial cells Similar studies will be required to test whether remaining novel genes produce functional proteins or not and to establish their exact role in EC activation For Western immunoblotting experiment monolayer ECs as opposed to cells grown in 3D gel were used Because it was difficult to solubilize ECs embedded in 3D gel Cold cell extraction buffer containing 1 25 Triton X 100 and 0 1 SDS did not effectively solubilize solidified 3D collagen warm 37 C cell extraction buffer was incompatible because it activated endogenous proteases It remains possible that different genes may be expressed in ECs cultured as monolayer as opposed to 3D Discussion Known Regulators of Angiogenesis Of the known regulators of EC activation identified in our study the role of MMPs has been well established Matrix digestion by MMPs including MMP 1 MMP 2 and MMP 9 is a pre requisite for EC activation differentiation and tumor induced angiogenesis 16 17 The growth of mesenchymal cells in a 3D type I collagen matrix induces the processing and activation of pro MMP 2 by MMP 1 Consistent with this incubation of ECs with angiogenic cytokines induced the expression of MMP 1 and MMP 2 Figs 2 4 We also identified 4 indirect regulators of EC activation and angiogenesis i e myeloblastin cathepsin B calpastatin and urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor u PAR The myeloblastin protein displays anti proliferative properties and is also a key protease involved in factor independent growth of hematopoietic cells 18 Overexpression of myeloblastin has been linked to multifunctional cytokine transforming growth factor TGF a known regulator of angiogenesis We postulate that myeloblastin in our model system may negatively regulate EC activation thereby signaling to end EC morphogenic differentiation Cathepsin B is a lysosomal cysteine protease the expression of which is increased in different tumors including human brain lung colon and breast tumors 19 Calpastatin is a physiological protease inhibitor that acts specifically on calpain a calcium dependent cysteine protease The cleavage of calpastatin by caspases initiates the apoptotic cascade in certain neurological disorders 20 It is possible that increased expression of calpastatin may control calpain activity thereby limiting extent of proteolysis during capillary sprouting In contrast uPAR has been shown to regulate plasminogen mediated extracellular proteolysis during angiogenesis 21 The identification of VEGFR 1 and VEGFR 2 KDR was consistent with the observation that the stimulation of ECs with VEGF increases the expression of VEGFR 2 promoting myocardial revascularization 22 We also detected the cell adhesion molecules VCAM 1 VE Cadherin and the 2 integrin subunit all known regulators of angiogenesis In the present study we confirmed the expression of KDR 2 integrin VE cadherin MMP1 and MMP2 in activated ECs by northern and western blot analysis Figs 2and 4 Finally we identified a known modulator of angiogenesis the prostaglandin endoperoxidase H synthase also known as cyclooxygenase COX The COX 1 isoform is constitutively expressed in blood vessels while expression of the COX 2 isoform is induced in new blood vessels In many angiogenic tumors COX 2 colocalizes with VEGF and TGF and increased expression of COX 2 and VEGF has been correlated with increased tumor microvascular density 23 Metabolic genes and Miscellaneous genes Although metabolic genes such as ketohexokinase adenosine deaminase and spermidine synthase detected by SSHDD assay per se do not directly activate of EC it is likely that they could represent a component of the angiogenic switch Among the miscellaneous genes identified in our study were adenylyl cyclase and platelet factor 4 PF4 Intracellular signaling machinery of adenylyl cyclase is required for cytoskeletal organization vessel maturation and vessel integrity 24 PF4 is a chemokine that binds to FGF and is a known inhibitor of EC proliferation and migration 25 Thus the upregulation of PF4 might limit the degree of activation of ECs and morphogenic differentiation It is noteworthy that Stanniocalcin Stc accession U25997 Figs 3A was also identified by GeneCalling a mRNA profiling technique and in situ hybridization demonstrated that Stc is expressed in the vasculature of a subset of squamous cell carcinomas 26 Stc is a secreted protein known to regulate calcium and phosphate homeostasis potential role of this protein in EC activation and permeability is not clear 27 Since most ECM degrading enzymes are metal ion dependent Stc may act as a sensor to maintain a steady state level of metal ions during EC activation Candidate genes associated with the activation of ECs In addition to the genes discussed above that have previously been implicated in EC activation and differentiation we also identified 11 candidate genes Table I Kinesin heavy chain KHC accession X65873 Figs 3Band 4G mediates organelle movement towards the plus ends of microtubules in the presence of ATP and functions in cell differentiation and axonal guidance 28 To our knowledge increased expression of KHC during EC differentiation has not been previously reported Although the specific role of KHC in the differentiation process is unclear this protein might be important for the maintenance of the plasticity and or polarity of ECs which may be a prerequisite for the formation of capillary ends Epiregulin Fig 3C is a member of epidermal growth factor EGF family of mitogens 29 Expression of epiregulin has been reported to be highest in placenta and in a subset of carcinoma cells Epiregulin activates COX 2 therefore epiregulin may serve as an upstream inflammatory component of COX 2 signaling pathway The function of epiregulin in the activation of ECs has not been investigated A general transcription factor BTF3 Fig 3D clone 22G accession AA130020 protein is thought to be involved in precise transcription by RNA polymerase II but fails to interact with DNA Disruption of gene encoding BTF3 protein in the mouse caused postimplantation lethality around embryonic day 6 5 30 Detailed studies have not been reported in the literature We believe this is the first report of identification of BTF3 as one of the induced genes in the activation of ECs As a first step towards elucidating the molecular mechanisms and pathways associated with activation of ECs we cloned the full length cDNA corresponding to the Clone 33A called VCIP also known as phosphatidic acid phosphatase type 2b PAP2b PAP2b shares similarity with Drosophila polarity gene Wunen 2 31 32 PAP2b VCIP encodes 311 amino acid residues contains a single N glycosylation site a consensus lipid phosphatase motif KPSXXXRPH an RGD cell attachment motif six transmembrane channel like structure and displays Mg independent lipid phosphatase activity in transfected 293T cells 32 Both N and C terminus segments of PAP2b VCIP are located inside the cytoplasm Consistent with previously published report our data suggest that PAP2b VCIP is cell surface protein and the expression of VCIP is highly enriched in vascularized tissues In addition to its known lipid phosphatase activity PAP2b VCIP also mediate cell cell interactions 31 Synaptojanin 2 Figure 4F is also known as a polyphosphoinositide phosphatase 2 This family of proteins is distant homolog of yeast protein SacI 33 The SacI homology domain is most notably found at the amino terminal of the inositol 5 phosphatase synaptojanin Synaptojanin 2 lipid phosphatase activities may be regulated by cell cell and cell matrix interactions through RAFTs morphogenetic platforms 34 G protein coupled receptor GPCR kinase interactor 2 Fig 3G interacts with G protein coupled receptor kinases and exhibits ADP ribosylation factor ARF GTPase activating protein GAP activity It is known have several isoforms alternatively sliced products however we primarily detected a single transcript of 5 2 kb size EC specific isoform Because GIT 2 localizes with a subset of paxillin therefore makes it a potential candidate signaling protein that may collaborate with focal adhesion signaling machinery 35 Thus GIT 2 may play a role in cell adhesion spreading and motility SMAP an Smg GDS associating protein Fig 3H Clone 54C accession AI401257 contains 9 Armadillo repeats and interacts with the smg GDS protein through these repeats This protein is a v Src substrate phosporylation affects the affinity of the protein for smg GDS The small G protein GDP dissociation stimulator smg GDS acts on a group of small G proteins including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki Ras Smg GDS exhibits dual activity One is to stimulate their GDP GTP exchange reactions and the other is to inhibit their interactions with membranes 36 Angiopoietin related protein AngRP Fig 3I is chiefly expressed by the hepatic cells AngRP contain the characteristic coiled coil and fibrinogen like domains that are conserved in angiopoietins however do not interact with Tie 1 and Tie 2 receptor 37 AngRP act as a survival factor for ECs but its role in angiogenesis is not clear It will be interesting to examine if there is a specific receptor for this molecule in ECs or other vascular cells Probe 94H Fig 3J detected 0 8 kb transcript amino acid sequence analysis suggest that this protein is likely to be member of ribosomal protein L19 38 In eukaryotes ribosome consists of a 60S large subunit and a 40S small subunit 39 In mammalian cells ribosomal proteins accounts for up to 12 of the total cellular protein The alpha subunit of Translational elongation factor 1 Fig 3K mediates binding of aminoacyl tRNAs to 80S ribosomes This process is driven by hydrolysis of GTP into GDP Translational elongation factor 1 interacts with guanine nucleotides 80S ribosomes and aminoacyl tRNAs In addition Translational elongation factor 1 binds with the subunit of Translational elongation factor 1 to exchange bound GDP for GTP 41 Finally clone 309C Fig 3L DNA sequence was identical with stabilin 1 Stabilin has been described as an endothelial macrophage member of the fasciclin domain containing protein Stabilin 1 and 2 are homologous transmembrane proteins showing 7 fasciclin like adhesion domains 18 20 EGF domains 1 X link domain and 3 6 B X 7 B hyaluronan binding motifs 40 Stabilin 1 and stabilin 2 are likely to play a role in cell cell and cell matrix interactions in vascular cells 40 Several articles describe the identification of genes associated with the activation of ECs and angiogenesis as well as the repertoire of genes expressed in normal versus tumor associated endothelium 42 43 44 45 Because EC activation is a complex process accompanied by alterations in many aspects of EC physiology it was not surprising that the genes identified in these studies were in several functional classes However the genes identified in the present study are significantly different from those reported by others which may reflect differences in the approaches used and types of tissues analyzed 42 43 44 45 This preliminary study serves as groundwork for our laboratory and we believe it will be worthwhile to examine their role in ECs Detail study of these candidate genes will entail generation of recombinant cDNA constructs generation of cell lines antibodies fusion proteins and perform in situ hybridization among others Detailed analysis of each of the differentially
