 Hams in Winter The Alexandre Dumas inspired swashbuckler The Man in the Iron Mask is thoroughly second rate which is to say that it waddles when it ought to whiz clanks when it strives for cornball poetry and transforms its august stars into something akin to a manic dinner theater troupe Nevertheless armed with a tub of popcorn a Three Musketeers bar and an industrial size Diet Coke with free refills I liked it better than the other more artful pictures I saw this week Here s an example of why In Twilight aging gumshoe Paul Newman regards glamorous movie queen Susan Sarandon with anguished eyes his longing for her at war with his loyalty to her cancer ridden husband Gene Hackman It s terribly tasteful and grown up but not half as compelling as musketeer Gabriel Byrne s fervid declaration to foxy Queen Mother Anne Parillaud in The Man in the Iron Mask To love you is a treason against France not to love you a treason against my heart To love a line like that is a treason against my high aesthetics not to love it a treason against my even higher propensity for florid kitsch The Man in the Iron Mask features Leonardo DiCaprio LEO LEO IS DA BOMB I LOVE YOU LEO LEO OH GOD PLEASE READ THIS LEO IS GAY LEO IS NOT GAY YOU RE JEALOUS LEO IS A BEAUTIFUL HUMAN BEING WHO LOVES WOMEN LEO PLEASE MARRY ME in the dual role of the overweening 17 th century boy king Louis of France and his twin brother Philippe who was first spirited away at birth by a father fearful of internecine struggles and subsequently locked in the bowels of the Bastille his features concealed by the eponymous iron mask That would have been all folks were Louis not a complete schmuck who capriciously drains the kingdom s coffers with foreign wars starves a lot of smudgy faced extras who hurl rotten fruit at his guards and falls on whatever beauteous wench strikes his royal fancy When he royally fancies the lady love Judith Godr che of the son Peter Sarsgaard of former musketeer Athos John Malkovich and orders the young man shipped off to battle it s time for the aging Three Musketeers Athos Aramis Jeremy Irons and Porthos G rard Depardieu to haul their uniforms out of mothballs and prove once again that they re more than the stuff of chocolate bars This is the first feature directed by Randall Wallace who wrote Braveheart 1995 in which Mel Gibson manages to bellow FREEDOM shortly before his upper and lower halves are cleft in twain thereby liberating Scotland from hordes of slumming Royal Shakespeare Co actors Wallace has a thing for men who die with their boots on This is the death I have always wanted gasps one fellow in this picture s lachrymose climax He also digs resplendent brocades alarums male choirs and handsome men on horseback saying things like Then God be with you For we shall not He apparently has no taste for pacing his actors who are left to police their own histrionic impulses which is like leaving our president to police his libidinous ones Byrne as D Artagnan the fourth musketeer torn between his loyalty to the king and to his all for one one for all compatriots has the most complicated role and carries it off with real dignity and discernment which means of course that he s just a teeny bit dull Depardieu meanwhile demonstrates that Gallic ham is fattier than its Anglo counterpart Irons and Malkovich bring to the picture two distinct styles of prissiness Irons is the upper class English poet priss locking liquid eyes on his co stars and gravely over enunciating Malkovitch is the American Method priss feyly dragging out his words and democratically abolishing all punctuation As his son Sarsgaard does a brilliant and respectful Malkovitch impersonation that s maybe the best thing in the movie At first it seems that DiCaprio LEO DESERVED A NOMINATION will be another contestant in the American juvenile falling on his face doing period European drama contest The reigning champion is Keanu Reeves Playing the swinish king his performance begins badly and the long hair doesn t flatter his wide doughy face and compressed brow But once the nice twin enters the movie DiCaprio can use his expressive eyes LEO READ THIS and his halting sweetness to win us back into his good graces OH MY GOD LEO IS THE GREATEST AHHHHH It isn t nice to beat up on senior citizens which must be why Robert Benton s Twilight has received such respectful reviews A third rate mystery tricked out with a great cast and some tony cinematography the movie unspools like an elderly director s swan song a bitter late Romantic threnody for the lost integrity of an American archetype co opted by the evils of a shabbily materialistic culture Benton isn t an old man he only directs like one This is essentially a twilit remake of his wonderful 1977 thriller The Late Show in which a senior citizen shamus Art Carney wrestles with both a brutal murder and the innumerable humiliations of aging they re connected happily assisted by a New Age flake Lily Tomlin in her most exuberant screen performance Twilight is The Late Show without the spitfire and it succumbs to the paralysis it means to portray As the hero Newman lets his voice go raspy to express world weariness His mournful performance ennobles Benton s conception without enlivening it For Benton aging evidently means forgetting everything you once knew about drama More enlivening by far is Love and Death on Long Island in which another aging protagonist John Hurt a clubby English novelist poignantly out of touch with modern society goes on another soulful quest developing an obsession with a beautiful teen idol Jason Priestley whom he accidentally sees on screen in a film called Hot Pants College 2 First time director Richard Kwietniowski has fun with the collision of high and low culture and he does elegant work But his mistake is the opposite of Benton s in Twilight Where Benton couldn t distance himself enough from his protagonist to generate a comic perspective Kwietniowski can t keep from satirizing his hero s passion Emotionally the picture plays it safe hugging the shore Hurt s face is so deeply lined that he now resembles Boris Karloff s mummy not flesh and blood but flakes and embalming fluid But if Hurt has the kind of visage we normally associate with dissipation few actors are able to combine such bleariness with such oxymoronic concentration This is a gentle tour de force by one of our greatest comic miniaturists
