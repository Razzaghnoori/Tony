 family reunions no you just just talk does this give us the signal i guess not okay um we have family reunions about every year with my husband s family uh huh and generally it s held in the summer and we have it in the state park which has worked out pretty well uh over by Clifton Forge huh which state park huh uh Delford have you ever heard of that no but it s in Virginia oh well it s bound to be beautiful right uh huh well it s pretty good yeah uh there quite a few children in the family so we have to yeah yeah yeah try to find a time when everybody can be there and we ve right been pretty lucky so far yes that that sounds wonderful i we uh we have family reunions not on a regular basis and there s mostly in my wife s family uh my family s very small uh huh um it s essentially the four of us makes up my family but um when we do get together and and the two families do get together it s usually a wedding or or uh or a uh anniversary uh my wife s uh grandparents are still living and on one side both both are living and on the other side the grandmother is still living so um we do uh occasional get together usually in New Hampshire uh huh oh at my uh my uh mother in law s house and uh where in New Hampshire uh at North Hampton right North Hampton uh huh i m from Maine originally i m sorry i said i m from Maine originally i m not i m a maniac in other words oh really yeah oh we lived in uh we lived in uh New Hampshire for ten years we lived in Dover uh until we moved out here oh uh huh so uh yeah and i don t know do you do anything special to make it interesting well uh well uh we re we re some of the older ones in the family so the ones with small kids usually have ball games and kick ball things like that oh right yeah uh one of them has made big banners to put on the oh we have one of those isn t that awful shelter a covered shelter and they ve had big banners to display across the front of that oh yeah uh huh right right and it s always a potluck everybody brings food yeah yeah seems to me well the the the uh main event of course is the meal at the end uh right everybody has a specialty and so uh it s sort of it s it s sort of a high class potluck i guess you could say and uh it s wonderful it s uh uh i mean ah get all those good family favorites right i mean and and if somebody didn t make the usually thing they d be you know everybody else would get all upset you know so if you try something new right and try something new it s not it s not acceptable drum them out of the family uh huh and uh and then afterwards uh usually uh there s a gathering in the family room to watch a football game or something oh i see so uh and uh and the kids are usually uh playing out in the back she s got uh ten acres of property that go with uh with her house so there s plenty of room for the kids to go crazy and and the parents can oh that s great oh yeah that s great what time of year do you you have it in the fall like after yeah at football games it is it s wonderful uh my next family reunion with my family will be it tends to be in the fall yeah that s that s a beautiful time in New Hampshire yeah a wedding in Atlanta this month so we re looking forward to that yeah oh that will be nice yeah do you have a feel for how many people there are when you get together uh it will be quite a few because one brother has five children and they re all going to be there with their children whoa oh gee well let s see i i don t think i could put a number on it uh i know that uh we have three kids and um my wife has uh two other sisters and one of her sisters has um two kids and then her brother has two kids going on three so there s there s plenty of plenty of that and then her stepfather has uh a daughter and a son and the son has two two

these businesses these companies that uh i mean their business is planning family reunions for people oh yeah that s i i thought about this and uh it seems like a pretty neat no i haven t huh uh thing they do uh family reunions and they do um oh what do you call it um oh class reunions oh and they make all the plans they contact everybody and they make sure everybody s got travel arrangements and uh uh huh and uh i guess it s in fact i think it was started by somebody who was a travel agent and they got this brainstorm that you know they could make a living oh by arranging for different family reunions and class reunions all over the country yeah i always thought that would be kind of might be kind of fun you know especially with a class reunion where uh huh that s pretty interesting yeah you have to do a little research try to find everybody i guess it s a little easier with a family reunion and they you know and they they re really organized you know they setup they they get the hall and they and they uh right uh huh yeah uh huh uh arrange for the catering and they have name tags
