 Janet Maslin The Phantom Menace A film with half a plot no engaging characters to speak of and actors who speak in inhibited zombie monotones as if the director had warned them to keep quiet while someone on the set took a nap A film that introduces the noxious sci fi creature Jar Jar Binks whose bug eyes lazy shuffle and minstrelly speech suggest an alien Stepin Fetchit A dull and annoying and occasionally rather offensive film in other words Yet here was the New York Times lead reviewer Janet Maslin almost alone among major critics in showering praise I t sustains the gee whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling extragalactic getaway jubilant ingenuity sweetly unfashionably benign no better tour guide for a trip back to the future Maslin did acknowledge in passing the film s ethnic stereotypes the overstuffed plot Ewan McGregor s blandness the foolish spectacle of Liam Neeson acting opposite robots and Natalie Portman s resemblance to a costumed block of wood But in her inimitable way Maslin folds all these complaints into an overall rave It was a bad piece and a telling one For more than a decade Maslin has stood out among critics for being what critics those curmudgeons so rarely are She is upbeat and forgiving often to a fault As the Johnny Mercer song instructs she accentuates the positive and eliminates the negative Or as in the case of the latest Star Wars episode she buries her list of negatives so late in the piece that it barely registers This habit of combining compensatory praise with dismissals makes it difficult to know what Maslin actually thinks Her pan of Forrest Gump for example was dead on and brave in its criticism but also packed to the gills with compliments The question not burning perhaps except for the poor dupes who suffered through the charmless Phantom because the Times recommended it is how Maslin comes by this generosity The paranoid explanation is that the paper s growing dependence on movie ads compels her in some oblique and unconscious way to be an industry booster Or it could be that Maslin is a little too well connected for a film critic as some detractors have charged and afraid to hurt her friends feelings Or maybe she is just as people who know her tend to comment exceptionally nice The question grows more curious when you look back at Maslin s career and realize that she once had a strong voice She started off in the 70s writing about rock n roll for Rolling Stone and especially for the Boston Phoenix At the time the Phoenix and the now defunct Real Paper were at the epicenter of alternative journalism a training ground for critics and reporters who would graduate to big city dailies and the slicks Joe Klein passed through the Phoenix Real Paper scene as did The New Yorker s David Denby the Times Frank Rich Newsweek s David Ansen film critic turned Vanity Fair New Yorker profiler turned Lolita screenwriter Stephen Schiff journalist wonk Sidney Blumenthal and Slate s own David Edelstein to name just a few It s unfair but true that a woman who started out at such a time and place in such an atmosphere of heady debate pot scant female and plenty of male colleagues such a woman will inevitably be noticed and talked about So let s get the gossip out of the way Maslin was attractive early on she dated Steven Spielberg she got married to Jon Landau a fellow rock critic who attended a small concert by a dynamic young man from New Jersey and wrote a famously prescient piece announcing I saw rock and roll future last night and its name is Bruce Springsteen and eventually quit his writing job to manage the Boss In the 80s Maslin married Benjamin Cheever son of John Cheever and also a novelist What s interesting here isn t Maslin s personal life but the fact that her youthful writing on Joni Mitchell say or Elvis Costello carries more conviction and therefore more weight than her mature work on the movies Maslin had a voice As gung ho as she is today but more deeply felt more confident while still refreshingly free of the insider smugness of so much writing on rock But for some reason when she migrated from music to movies first for the Phoenix then briefly for Newsweek and since 1977 for the Times she seems gradually to have inched away from her personal reactions The pattern was set long before she became the Times lead critic in 1993 A 1988 Sunday think piece on a rash of Anglophilic white flannel costume dramas was typical For much of the piece Maslin seemed to criticize the way films like A Handful of Dust distorted the novels they set out to adapt the way they reeked of snobbery and voyeurism the way they substituted rarified Ralph Lauren d cors for content Then she turned her argument upside down praising a trifle called A Summer Story precisely because of its cynical empty decorativeness To read a Maslin piece can be a disconcerting at times even haunting experience One senses her scrambling to fill the piece with everything but her own analysis More often than not she leads with a lengthy detailed visual description of a scene or a character For paragraphs at a time she leans on plot summary of the timid undergraduate book report variety She relies heavily very heavily on adverbs which serve to pepper her noncommittal reviews with small emphatic bursts and to jack up her celebrations from a 565 word review of Velvet Goldmine dazzlingly surreal brilliantly reimagines spectacularly reborn dramatically presided stunningly pretty fabulously charismatic hilariously decadent typically wicked When she does give the thumbs up especially for an anticipated blockbuster certain key words and phrases such as audience appeal and escapist fun suggest that she is not writing from her own point of view so much as she s gauging in advance the public s reaction The lead to her review of Twister called the film a gale force movie with the energy to blow audiences right out of the theater This sounds more like publicity copy than criticism what it expresses is the impression the studio hopes the film will have on an audience To be fair there is much to be said in Maslin s defense She is hardly the first good writer to be slightly stifled by the Times nor by any means is she the first frustrating critic to work there On the contrary Vincent Canby wrote from high atop a pedestal panned The Godfather Part II and indulged in an inexplicable love of Blake Edwards Before Canby Bosley Crowther ruled the roost for three decades He wielded immense power but who recalls a single thing he wrote today especially compared with the memorable work of James Agee or Andrew Sarris or above all Pauline Kael And these are tough times for reviewers in general David Denby has expressed the disappointment of a generation of critics who entered the field during the feverish Kael inspired 70s Once upon a time they wanted to grab readers by the hand and lead them to passionate works of art but no one would aim so high today Great movies are fewer and farther between at least in this writer s opinion at least for the time being and these days even the media that employ the critics measure a movie s success not by the critics reaction but by opening weekend gross Critics just don t matter as much as they used to and Maslin though she s still at the top of the heap influence wise is no exception Very much to her credit she hasn t become bitter about her shrinking influence she s not stuck in whiny nostalgia for the way things were But she has developed a disembodied ghostly way of writing about movies a criticism of lowered expectations Her main defense of the disappointing Phantom Menace It s only a movie Exactly and while we re at it Maslin is only a critic who asks for too little
