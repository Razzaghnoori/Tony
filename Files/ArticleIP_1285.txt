 Movies Con Air Touchstone Pictures This action flick about a rogues gallery of prisoners who hijack a jet is deemed summer blockbuster overkill too many ridiculous plot twists too many explosions too much ripping off of its predecessors It is so monumentally idiotic frenzied and cheesy the special effects look like Tonka toys writ large that it re sets the bar for the genre says the Wall Street Journal s Joe Morgenstern Reviewers split on the star Nicolas Cage He either emerges intact from the rubble Anthony Lane The New Yorker or proves he can be as much of an overmuscled jackass as Sylvester Stallone David Edelstein Slate Click here for the Con Air site Ulee s Gold Orion Pictures Peter Fonda s comeback as a stoic beekeeper facing down his convict son s thuggish friends is called his first worthy performance since Easy Rider 1969 A fter all this time a role that suits his rocklike demeanor perfectly and makes virtues of his expressive limitations Terrence Rafferty The New Yorker Slow paced and minimalist the film is hailed as an anti blockbuster It achieves a rare and rarely earned emotional depth ennobling and enriching without being sticky or sanctimonious Todd McCarthy Variety See Edelstein s review and Orion s promotional site The Pillow Book Cinepix Film Properties The latest from avant garde British director Peter Greenaway The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover elicits a familiar critique It s judged a visual knockout but pretentious as hell Most critics say the movie about a Japanese woman s peculiar fetish has lots of gorgeous naked bodies but little plot or character development A cold contemptuous and interminable Oedipal saga says the Village Voice s J Hoberman just a big static snooze The New York Times Janet Maslin on the other hand says the audaciously beautiful imagery captivating symmetries and brilliantly facile tricks redeem the film Music Wu Tang Forever Wu Tang Clan RCA Loud Critics predict that the Staten Island rap group s 27 track double CD released along with Wu Wear a clothing line will mark a breakthrough for hip hop as both hype and art The Wu Tang Clan has entered the stagnant hip hop scene like a slap in the face parading its strikingly original gutter funk like a ghetto peacock Matt Diehl Entertainment Weekly Critics admire the group s eclectic influences including funk flamenco and psychedelic and its lyrics as dense obsessed prolific and full of popular and arcane references as a Pynchon novel Neil Strauss the New York Times Clips are available here Books Without a Doubt by Marcia Clark with Teresa Carpenter Viking Readers don t seem to mind that the O J prosecutor s angry memoir a New York Times No 1 best seller adds little to the vast body of literature about the trial But critics do As her title suggests self reflection and an appreciation of ambiguity are not Marcia Clark s strong points Ellen Willis writes in the New York Times Book Review The dead prose style adds Entertainment Weekly s Dana Kennedy reads as if Clark had dictated it from her car phone To the dismay of still others Clark neither confirms nor denies the rumor that she and fellow prosecutor Christopher Darden slept together Firewall The Iran Contra Conspiracy and Cover Up by Lawrence E Walsh W W Norton Too much minutiae not enough revelations is the consensus criticism of the Iran Contra Special Prosecutor s chronicle of his seven year investigation Wanting still to win the case he rehashes arcane and forgotten episodes from the Reagan era scandal seemingly for his own benefit The leaden account feels like it goes on for seven years Jacob Weisberg Slate Only The Nation s Doug Ireland finds merit in Walsh s brief against the Reagan administration calling the attorney a genuine American hero Promiscuities The Secret Struggle for Womanhood by Naomi Wolf Random House The Third Wave feminist s third book part memoir part sociology part political tract gets praised for its lyrically rendered anecdotes and slammed for shoddy thinking The part about her sexual coming of age in San Francisco fares reasonably well S he melts together the personal and political so gently we re barely aware of the difference says Newsweek s Laura Shapiro But Wolf s politics are roundly ridiculed especially her idea that girls should retreat to the wilderness with older women to perform ceremonial sex rites S he tries in vain to pass off tired observations as radical aper us subjective musings as general truths sappy suggestions as useful ideas writes the New York Times Michiko Kakutani Theater Gross Indecency The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde Minetta Lane Theatre New York City Applause for this off off Broadway play written by Mois s Kaufman an unknown gay Venezuelan dramatist which finally hits the big time Rescued from obscurity three months ago by a rave from the New York Times Ben Brantley Gross Indecency about the Irish playwright s famous sodomy trials started an open ended New York run last week The play recounts Wilde s downfall says USA Today s David Patrick Stearns with the inevitability and much of the monumentality of a Greek tragedy New York s John Simon the lone sniper says the play deserved to languish in obscurity because of its annoying cuteness Updates In one of the most scathing reviews of Norman Mailer s Jesus book to date The Nation s Mary Gordon asks How can someone who has published so much some of it admirable have written such a bad book A book whose badness leaves the reader first with a sense of reluctance must I really go on then anger how can he let himself get away with this then embarrassment it is unseemly to cast my eyes on such a spectacle Praise continues to escalate for Philip Roth s American Pastoral In the Washington Post Book World
