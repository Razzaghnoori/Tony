 A Fireless Chat WASHINGTON D C History records that the first telephone conversation in 1876 was an urgent request for an in person meeting Mr Watson come here I want you Alexander Graham Bell is supposed to have said to his assistant in the next room Monday night Bill Clinton participated in what was billed as the first presidential Internet chat an event intended to showcase another epoch making technology in a larval stage Clinton was more patient than Bell He resisted the urge to say what must have been on the mind of nearly everyone present at the 90 minute demonstration Why don t we turn this damn thing off and have a real conversation The idea for the Town Hall Chat co sponsored by the Democratic Leadership Council and Excite was to demonstrate how the Net enables new forms of democratic communication Here s how it worked Clinton sat onstage in a small auditorium at George Washington University accompanied by Al From the president of the DLC Clinton and From had a screen in front of them From read aloud questions sent in by e mail and Clinton answered Also wired in to the session were five other government officials in remote locations around the country and Mark Andreessen the founder of Netscape In theory virtual participants could watch streaming video of the event listen to an audio simulcast or watch a scrolling text transcription all over the Internet In practice the technology was pretty clunky Due to network congestion the voices of two of the officials didn t come through at all and others were either time delayed or so distorted as to be barely audible At times the town hall dissolved into a series of Hello Watson can you hear me exchanges Clinton read his prepared opening remarks in which he compared the event to one of FDR s fireside chats from a teleprompter If you were watching this on the Web the herky jerky streaming video of his head and torso represented a giant leap backward from the straightforward TV broadcast on C SPAN And the scrolling text which was transcribed not by voice recognition software but by human secretaries was hardly a high tech marvel The overall effect was that of primitive video conferencing In a way it made you marvel at how far we haven t come since FDR s day When the technology did work as intended it merely made you wonder what good it is anyhow Having a meeting over the Internet is still like walking to the mailbox in a 60 pound spacesuit That it can be done impressive But why do it at all given that the quality of the interaction is so poor As in all Internet events I ve ever seen or participated in the time lags and unfamiliarity of the basic structure sucked any spontaneity and most of the oxygen from the room Part of the fault was not technical but human and political In theory the Internet allows for a vast range of queries from far and wide In practice questions for the president were so carefully vetted as to be far narrower in range than what he might have encountered from a small homogenous and friendly audience like the one in the hall The questions were in fact triple screened first by the Excite staff which weeded out anything with the word Monica in it then by the DLC staff with a bias toward substance and finally by From who choose from among those culled for him The messages that got passed on to Clinton were wonky and sincere dealing in an unchallenging way with matters like free trade and health care One of the few sparks of interest was a question about whether Clinton if he didn t live in the White House would put aside food for a possible Y2K catastrophe The president said he wouldn t because he doesn t anticipate any serious problems Before long Clinton was pointing at questions drifting by on his screen begging for more difficult ones The event might have worked slightly better if he had been given a mouse to flag questions he wanted to answer or a keyboard to send messages back to the control room But this too would have risked embarrassment since Clinton is an acknowledged computer illiterate and can t type Nonetheless he does appear to have gained a sense of how the Internet might someday be democratically useful In his closing remarks Clinton made a point about how isolated a president can become from the public despite his best intentions to keep in touch and how the new technology might help Then he thanked everyone for coming to his press conference Clinton is right that his successor will have a real tool to maintain contact with ordinary people It s too late for Clinton himself He could have learned how to use a computer of course but I don t think electronic politics holds any appeal for him You can t seduce a voter in an e mail message To Clinton the political is the interpersonal the hand on the shoulder the intent gaze the fleck of spittle in the eye Even on television he can provide a simulacrum of this human experience But on the Internet communication is far more abstract E mail bores him and it showed The most interesting part of last night s event was what happened after it ended when you got to see Clinton doing what he does like no one else schmoozing live people I eavesdropped as he massaged the ego of Tom Jermoluk the CEO of Excite I know this may have cost you arm and a leg but I think you may have revolutionized politics Clinton confided to him At the end of unsuccessful cyber events everyone always praises them as historic Perhaps so though I think history will remember them as fumbling experiments that pointed in a different direction At this point they testify mainly to the capacity of the Internet to take something interesting like a discussion with President Clinton and make it unbearably dull But be patient In five years or so advances in technology may get us to the point where an Internet Town Meeting is almost as interesting as a Town Meeting without the Internet
