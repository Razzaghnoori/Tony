                okay i guess were supposed to discuss the uh school system that shouldnt be too much trouble for the two of us right   no as many years as weve been involved in one i really feel fortunate in that there even though there are problems theyre not a lot of problems where i teach   right   but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems uh with dropouts um when i was in Minnesota last summer   umhum   there was a teacher who said that uh on a given day she didnt know how many of her students would show up and sometimes they didnt even show up for class and she taught in high school in inner city uh Minneapolis   umhum   and uh they just didnt come to school and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they dont even come to school   thats really sad isnt it right well just recently in the paper here were articles about students um working high school students that work and the percentage of hours that they work and how that affects their grades   umhum   but then the followup the next day was i was kind of glad to see  because it it said that you know yes but for those students who are determined to do well anyway that you know handling a job was very possible you know and that it seemed to have more to do with other factors   i think so too   you know like what are their plans after high school you know and whats their home situation you know that   the home is the key i think really is because if the home does not place a high priority on education and um that the main goal is making money now   right right   and it may be a survival thing for the family which you can understand so um right   right sure but there can still be an attitude of you know this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now but but that the most important thing is still you know getting your education well when they meant said the the topic you know of whats wrong with the public schools my my first impulse impulse was   your education   it isnt really whats wrong with the public public schools its whats wrong with families   thats right its whats wrong with families and if if children come to school     and society in general   yes insecure and their more biggest concern is survival   right   both at home they dont know what to expect at home they dont feel secure there they dont know whats going to happen just out front of their apartment complex for example that child that was shot   right right   uh how can they concentrate on schooling i agree with you i think thats the main problem   right yeah   and schools now are supposed to solve social problems uh mental and emotional problems as well as educate the kids and try to provide them with some security and thats overwhelming   hm yeah well weve got um you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor and thats just really not enough   no it isnt   and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school and they said oh but we need more in the middle school because thats when kids are you know at a tougher and rougher age and all that but you know part of my feeling is that if you solve help them to work through their problems while theyre littler then they wont have as many problems up there   true i think they there has to be at least a counselor and we just recently had a counselor at elementary we didnt even have counselors in elementary we have always though had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids and   really   they divided them up between three counselors but for a good while every year theyd have a different counselor and they decided that didnt work so they started uh dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees   yeah umhum they they do that here   through you know through all three years of middle school and i think that   umhum   would give them more security in going to the counselor if they have a rapport with their counselor now if they dont   umhum     i hope they have the flexibility to be able to change a child that really is in need of counseling help if they absolutely refuse to work with them on and occasionally that happens   to change yeah right   but it is frightening but   yes it certainly is   because um education is the key to our future and uh if we have children who are not getting their education for one reason or another than what are we going to do with them whats going to happen to them are they going to be   yeah thats right   able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them thats no good   yeah right im on that um campus strategic planning committee for my school and um one of the   uhhuh   uh  you know oh they have all these different names for things strategies and all these different things but anyway one of the key things was that that we believed that the public education is the best economic value then i think they decided to strike economic  anyway       you know the point was what happens when public education fails you know will then people go to private schools you know well what kind of a situation do they get there and what are you know and what kind of state are we in if if most people are going to private schools   well i think uh one thing that well see is that we wont be educating everybody there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world   right right   where they dont try to educate everyone thats one of the things that we do we try to educate everyone   umhum thats right thats right   were the only country in the world that does   umhum umhum   and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education if theyre willing you know to work and have uh some ability they can do that   umhum yeah and one of the Plano school districts you know goal is that they will graduate every child that um that is here in the ninth grade i believe its something like that its worded and um i dont know   well you know if we can keep them in school   right thats   then that that helps a lot i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too   so important oh gosh well that new movie that new movie out i hm really really a frightening situation i guess were both lucky   its scary to me i we are   to be in situations and schools where we dont see that my folks talk about it a lot in Illinois my mother was is was teacher for years and year s and um they live in Peoria Illinois and their talking a lot about the you know the school situation there too so well shall we wrap it up   um i would imagine that weve talked the amount of time necessary   I think we have to so ill see you when we see you   okay all right we were in uh Austin yesterday the reason i was in the church   umhum   and we went to hear uh James Win ensemble concert they left this morning for England   oh oh how exciting oh that is wonderful what an experience   isnt wonderful uhhuh and uh the university
