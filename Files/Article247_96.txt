 This isn t Argument It s Mere Refutation Something has happened to the argument over Flytrap in Washington It s become tedious Initially the issues were legion the ramifications seemingly kaleidoscopic the players unsure of their positions There were traitors and apostates Clintonite Clinton critics and conservative presidency defenders and many who were simply confused and bemused Now things have settled out along binary lines that are all too familiar Everyone lies about sex But it was under oath So what It s a crime No it isn t Yes it is Tis not Etc Everyone s had this argument everyone s been annoyed by not winning this argument nobody wants to have this argument again Were somebody to start it at a Washington cocktail party the guests would scurry into the other room as surely as if that someone had said Let s build the bridge to the 21st century or attempted to redebate the Vietnam War Of course Washingtonians may have chosen up sides in this fashion in part because so many people in the capital need to choose up sides in order to do their jobs in part because the only thing more boring than having an opinion on Flytrap is not having one Well I think only time will tell Gee I m so glad I invited you Outside of Washington where people never cared that much about Flytrap in the first place opinions may be much less dug in more vaguely formed and fluid The catch is that the Washington commentariat is tempted to conclude that Flytrap is over because it is bored with the scandal But in the rest of America the scandal may simply have yet to catch on Only time will tell Mulholland Dive The Washington Times reports in its April 11 edition that a Democratic party official from California Bob Mulholland is gathering marital dirt on Republicans who might vote on Clinton s impeachment Mulholland doesn t duck the charge Many of the House Judiciary members are divorced and their divorce papers contain a lot of interesting information and we ll be sharing that with the American people he tells the Times Fair enough Honest blackmail Well not completely honest since the main charge against Clinton isn t marital infidelity it s perjury and obstruction of justice Mulholland is good at his job If I were a Republican I d worry more about him and less about Sidney Blumenthal Even Chatterbox once did a bit of business with Mulholland What kind of business Let s just say that a Reagan Republican Senate candidate in California was known to somewhat hypocritically visit a Los Angeles newsstand that featured an extensive selection of adult magazines Chatterbox heard about this from a friend told someone else and eventually got a call from Mulholland who asked for the name of the newsstand which Chatterbox provided Four days before the election with one poll showing the candidates in a virtual tie Mulholland got the story out by shouting questions at the Republican during a campaign stop accusing him of also patronizing a Sunset Boulevard strip club He admitted going to the club which he called a cocktail place Witnesses confirmed his newsstand habits He did not win Democrat Barbara Boxer who did owes Chatterbox a medium sized chit Given this incident however Mulholland would probably be the wrong spokesman to righteously attack Kenneth Starr for trying to learn about Monica Lewinsky s semi pornographic bookstore purchases Note

the Fannie Mae Foundation and the Washington Post cosponsor a series of free concerts at the Kennedy Center which Johnson also heads The concerts which began in 1997 are one way for Johnson to get friendly with a major journalistic institution that might write nasty things about Fannie Mae But Chatterbox s boss rightly points out that the Post has in fact written nasty things about Fannie Mae
