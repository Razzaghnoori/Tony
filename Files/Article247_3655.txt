 Did Cokie Roberts Ever Use Cocaine Part II Presidential candidate Bill Bradley followed Chatterbox s cocaine question playbook Sunday on ABC s This Week see Did Cokie Roberts Ever Use Cocaine That is to say Bradley when asked by Sam Donaldson whether he d ever used any illegal drugs turned the tables and asked This Week s panelists about their own drug histories Slate s Pundit Central column has an excellent summary of the exchange but Chatterbox believes readers of this column will want to scrutinize the text for every last ambiguity for the complete transcript click here BILL BRADLEY I have used marijuana several times in my life but never cocaine COKIE ROBERTS Senator on guns and violence SAM DONALDSON Excuse me Cokie Recently in your life BRADLEY No SAM When you were a kid BRADLEY Well yes Right Have you SAM I think a couple of times I ve tried it And I inhaled BRADLEY Have you Cokie COKIE Oh listen I was so pregnant during those years The senator BRADLEY George Who wants to know GEORGE WILL No SAM How come you give George a pass GEORGE No I m from the Falstaff generation COKIE Can we get to guns and violence GEORGE That s my Shakespeare BRADLEY Shakespeare that s right COKIE The you wrote an Op Ed on guns Chatterbox s post game analysis The context suggests that Sam like Bradley is admitting only youthful marijuana use But it s possible he s being cagey and is ducking the cocaine question It s also possible this is admittedly a fanciful reading that in saying I inhaled Sam s referring to both marijuana and cocaine though if that were the case he d probably say I tried them not I tried it Cokie keeps trying to change the subject That may be because she agrees with Chatterbox that it s a phony issue Or it may be because she doesn t want to answer the question In fact she doesn t answer the question she just says she was so pregnant during those years This answer implies that she couldn t take drugs because she was constantly pregnant during the 1970s But obviously she wasn t pregnant for the entire decade She has only two kids Hence this is not only a non answer but a non alibi Does this mean she s hiding past drug use Chatterbox who opined in his previous item that Cokie is almost certainly not a past cocaine user guesses not Rather Chatterbox suspects Cokie of being too embarrassed to admit that she s one of those goody goodies who never tried marijuana or cocaine George answers no twice for some reason Sam thinks he hasn t answered the first time It doesn t seem especially surprising that he never tried marijuana or cocaine But what does he mean when he says he s from the Falstaff generation It s possible George means that his generation s drug of choice was alcohol presumably not sack Sir John Falstaff s favorite beverage Specifically George may mean that when he was in college he drank a lot of Falstaff Beer For an unofficial history of the Falstaff Brewing Co third largest brewer in the United States during George s college years click here More likely however George is alluding to Falstaff s observation in Henry IV Part I that the better part of valor is discretion Act V Scene iv line 120 In this context that might mean that when George was young and relatively irresponsible he didn t want to mess with dangerous and illegal substances Or it might mean that today he doesn t want to discuss the matter at all in which case we d need to reinterpret his two no s to mean No I don t want to talk about this The other George George Stephanopoulos didn t have to answer the question because he wasn t present during this segment But George S previously told this column that he d never used cocaine Chatterbox forgot to ask George S whether he d ever used marijuana but doesn t feel like calling him back to ask now Bill Kristol is never around when this question gets asked He was out of the office when Chatterbox was phoning around for the earlier item and like George S didn t appear during this segment yesterday Chatterbox continues to have no opinion about whether he ever used illegal drugs Addendum Brian Lamb got asked Monday morning on C SPAN s Washington Journal whether he d ever used cocaine or any other illegal drug He said no Also on the show was Matt Drudge of the Drudge Report who said I haven t done cocaine but declined to say whether he s used any illegal drugs Through a bizarre sequence of events Slate editor Michael Kinsley ended up being the one who asked Lamb about past drug use Kinsley said he d answer the question if asked but no one asked Drudge refused to ask and Lamb seemed about to ask but then didn t However Kinsley long ago confessed in the New Republic s TRB column that he experimented with marijuana in the distant past and wrote I deeply regret this youthful indiscretion The column Regrets Only is included in Kinsley s 1995 collection Big Babies After taking his first puff during freshman year in college I found the drug had no effect on me whatsoever and I determined not to experiment with illicit substances any further However a few days later I experimented with marijuana once again On that occasion I enjoyed it a good deal more This youthful indiscretion I also deeply regret During the next several years overcome by the spirit of scientific inquiry I experimented with marijuana perhaps two hundred or more times Kinsley now tells Chatterbox that he also tried cocaine The C SPAN caller who got all this started identified himself as the columnist HC from a satirical Website called C3F Click here for its witless Slate spoof HC said he was stoned inspiring this classic C SPAN exchange BRIAN Why are you stoned HC Because I enjoy it BRIAN What are you stoned on HC Marijuana Disclaimer Although Chatterbox deplores self righteousness and hypocrisy regarding illegal drug use he also deplores illegal drug use itself Specifically regarding cocaine a lesson of the 1980s was that its use is both addictive and potentially deadly two facts that were unknown to youthful baby boomers who tried it during the 1970s That doesn t justify the ongoing disparity between criminal sentences for possession of powder cocaine and possession of crack crack is much more likely to be used by blacks and is punished much more harshly but it does justify the tougher approach law enforcement agencies take in general today as compared to two decades ago
