 Background Prolonged or repeated agonist stimulation of G protein coupled receptors frequently causes a reduction in the response to the agonist 1 Short term agonist exposure results in desensitization that is characterized by a rapid minutes and reversible uncoupling of the receptor from the G protein followed by sequestration and or internalization of receptors from the cell surface Down regulation occurs after prolonged agonist treatment hours to days resulting in a loss of receptor binding sites 2 3 4 The processes involved in homologous desensitization have been extensively investigated for the beta 2 adrenergic receptor which is the prototypical G protein coupled receptor Initial uncoupling of the beta 2 receptor from the G protein after agonist binding is mediated by phosphorylation by G protein coupled receptor kinase GRK of specific residues in the carboxyl tail of the receptor The phosphorylated beta 2 receptor enhances the binding of beta arrestin which not only uncouples the receptor from the signal transduction process but also serves as an adapter protein that mediates entry into the internalization pathway 5 as well as serving as a platform for additional signaling pathways 6 The mechanisms of beta 2 adrenergic receptor down regulation appear to involve both an increase in the rate of degradation of the receptor as well as a decrease in the levels of beta receptor mRNA 7 Down regulation of the beta 2 receptor is in part due to trafficking of the beta 2 receptor to lysosomes via the clathrin coated pit endosomal pathway 8 9 The alpha 2 adrenergic receptors also undergo agonist induced desensitization and down regulation Desensitization occurs both in cell culture systems 10 11 12 and in the intact animal 13 14 In general the mechanisms of desensitization for the alpha 2 adrenergic receptors appear to be similar to those for the beta 2 receptor There are three subtypes of the alpha 2 adrenergic receptor alpha 2A alpha 2B and alpha 2C 15 The human alpha 2A subtype undergoes phosphorylation and short term desensitization 11 12 whereas the human alpha 2C subtype is not phosphorylated 16 and does not desensitize 11 The human alpha 2C subtype however does undergo arrestin dependent internalization 17 Many studies 11 18 including those from our laboratory 10 19 20 have demonstrated agonist induced down regulation of alpha 2 receptors although much less is known about the specific mechanisms for down regulation as compared to the beta 2 receptor In contrast to alpha 2A and alpha 2B adrenergic receptors from several species the human alpha 2C receptor does not appear to down regulate in response to agonist treatment in transfected cell culture systems 11 By contrast the opossum alpha 2C receptor in the OK cell line does down regulate in response to norepinephrine 19 20 The reason for this difference is the focus of the current studies The human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor has an acidic serine rich motif EESSSSD in the third intracellular loop that has been shown to be important in agonist induced desensitization but not in agonist induced sequestration internalization Site directed mutagenesis studies indicate that all four of these serines are phosphorylated by GRK and all four are needed for desensitization 12 The influence of this motif on down regulation was not investigated however The opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor has a very similar acidic serine motif EESSTSE in the third intracellular loop Figure 1 21 whereas the human alpha 2C receptor has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same region Figure 2 22 Thus we postulated that the lack of down regulation in the human alpha 2C was related to having only two rather than four serines in the motif and furthermore that the ability of the opossum alpha 2C to undergo down regulation was dependent on having all four serine threonine residues in the EESSTSE motif To test this hypothesis we mutated the opossum alpha 2C serines and threonine residues to alanines and valine respectively and tested whether the expressed receptors would down regulate Down regulation was not observed in the mutated receptors following treatment with norepinephrine for 24 h Results Sequence of the opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor In the process of confirming the mutations we also completely re sequenced the wild type clone and found several differences from the originally published sequence GenBank U04310 21 The corrected sequence differs from the original in 19 bases which results in 11 amino acid residue changes as detailed in Figure 2 The sequence has been corrected in Genbank Characterization of mutated receptors The results of 3H rauwolscine saturation experiments using the wild type and mutated receptors from two independent transfections of both mutations are given in Table 1 The K d values for the two mutants 0 071 0 118 nM were similar to those of the wild type 0 113 nM and similar to the previously reported K d of 0 056 nM for the wild type alpha 2 receptor for 3H rauwolscine in NaPO 4 buffer 23 Inhibition experiments with 3H rauwolscine indicated that the affinity of norepinephrine for the mutated receptors was approximately two fold higher lower K d value than for wild type receptor Figure 3 Down regulation After a 24 h treatment with 0 3 M norepinephrine the wild type receptor down regulated to 65 10 of control p 0 05 n 7 By contrast no down regulation was observed with either the SSVA 114 10 of control or the AAVA 110 9 of control receptors Figure 4 Discussion All three alpha 2 adrenergic receptor subtypes from nearly all species that have been tested undergo agonist induced down regulation 24 25 Interestingly we have shown that the potency of norepinephrine to produce down regulation differs among alpha 2 receptor subtypes 19 24 The concentration of norepinephrine required to produce half maximal down regulation is approximately 2 M for the alpha 2A receptor In contrast norepinephrine is more potent at down regulating the alpha 2B and alpha 2C subtypes with a concentration of only 70 nM required to produce half maximal down regulation This difference in potency appears to be a characteristic of the receptor protein itself because the cellular environment in which a particular subtype is expressed does not affect the potency of norepinephrine to produce down regulation The human alpha 2C receptor is somewhat unique among the alpha 2 receptors in that it does not appear to undergo agonist induced down regulation 11 The human alpha 2A adrenergic receptor which does undergo down regulation has an acidic serine motif EESSSSD in the third intracellular loop Sequentially mutating each of the four serines to alanine decreased the phosphorylation of the receptor by approximately 25 for each serine and mutating either the first two or the last two serines to alanines prevented agonist induced desensitization but not agonist induced sequestration internalization 12 The influence of mutations in this motif on down regulation has not been investigated The human alpha 2C receptor by contrast has a DESSAAAE sequence in the same region Figure 2 22 Thus it is possible that the lack of desensitization and perhaps also down regulation of the human alpha 2C receptor is due to the fact that there are only two hydroxyl residues in the DESSAAAE motif rather than the four hydroxyl residues in the alpha 2A EESSSSD motif The opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor has a EESSTSE acidic serine threonine motif in the third intracellular loop Figures 1and 2 which could be a substrate for GRK based on the EESSSSD motif of the alpha 2A subtype Thus we postulated that the lack of down regulation in the human alpha 2C subtype is related to having only two rather than four serines in the motif and that mutating the threonine and serine residues at the end of the opossum EESSTSE motif to valine and alanine residues to give EESSVAE might prevent down regulation of the opossum alpha 2C receptor Consistent with this prediction treatment with 0 3 M norepinephrine for 24 h failed to down regulate the receptor containing the motif mutated to EESSVAE although the wild type receptor with the EESSTSE motif was down regulated by 35 The inhibition data indicate that the affinity of norepinephrine for the receptors containing the mutations is slightly higher than for the wild type The affinity of norepinephrine for the mutated receptor lacking two of the hydroxyl residues was approximately twice as high as the wild type The elimination of the remaining two hydroxyl residues did not have any additional effect on the affinity of norepinephrine These data eliminate the possibility that the lack of down regulation in cells containing the mutated receptors is a consequence of the mutants having a lower affinity for norepinephrine than the wild type The elimination of the terminal two hydroxyl amino acid residues in the EESSTSE motif is sufficient to prevent down regulation of the opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor Similarly mutation of only two serine residues in the human alpha 2A receptor resulted in a loss of desensitization 12 Because the EESSSSE motif in the human alpha 2A receptor is a known GRK substrate and because eliminating two potential phosphorylation sites prevents down reguation phosphorylation of the opossum alpha 2C receptor may be important in the mechanism of down regulation of this receptor By contrast a deletion of twelve residues of the human alpha 2A receptor 293 304 which includes the EESSSSE motif did not appear to prevent agonist induced down regulation 26 Thus a phosphorylation pathway may not be involved in agonist induced down regulation of the alpha 2A adrenergic receptor In addition to the hydroxyl amino acid residues acidic residues may also be an important sequence element for alpha 2 adrenergic receptor phosphorylation and regulation 27 28 The region from 300 to 313 in the opossum alpha 2C receptor which encompasses the EESSTSE motif is a high acidic region with 50 seven of fourteen of the residues being acidic amino acids Figure 2 In an effort to determine if four hydroxyl amino acid residues in an acidic environment might be a common motif for phosphorylation and receptor regulation we searched the G Protein Coupled Receptor Database for four consecutive hydroxyl residues either serine or threonine in a linear sequence that was at least 1 3 acidic with no basic residues which occurred in either the third intracellular loop or the carboxyl terminal tail As can be seen from the results in Table 3 this does not appear to be a common motif for G protein coupled receptors not even for alpha 2 adrenergic receptors Indeed this motif is not found in the alpha 2B subtype which does undergo agonist induced down regulation although as noted above a highly acidic region appears to be important and could be related to the additional negative charge provided by phosphorylation Thus it is likely that there are multiple mechanisms that are involved in down regulation of G protein coupled receptors Conclusions A motif with four hydroxyl amino acid residues in an acidic environment appears to be important for down regulation of the alpha 2C adrenergic receptor The human alpha 2C receptor which has a DESSAAAE motif with only two hydroxyl residues does not undergo down regulation Modification of the EESSTSE to EESSVAE was sufficient to prevent down regulation of the opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor Because these are potential GRK phosphorylation sites our data further suggest that GRK phosphorylation may be involved in down regulation of the alpha 2C adrenergic receptor Materials and Methods Materials Restriction enzymes were purchased from

previously 21 Stable transfectants were selected with 500 g ml G 418 Geneticin Life Technologies and screened by intact cell binding using 3H rauwolscine as previously described 21 Down regulation assays The cells were plated at a density of 2 10 5cells ml in 150 mm culture dishes with 20 ml of growth media and allowed to grow for four days to near confluence The medium was replaced with fresh medium lacking G 418 Twenty four hours later either 2 l of 3 mM norepinephrine in 5 mM HCl or just 2 l of 5 mM HCl vehicle control was added to each of the plates Cells were harvested 24 h after adding norepinephrine or vehicle The medium was removed and the cells were rinsed with 10 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline PBS containing 5 mM EGTA pH 7 4 Another 10 ml of PBS was added to the plate and the cells were scraped off the plate using a rubber policeman The plate was rinsed once with 10 ml of PBS The scraped cells were centrifuged at 2000 g for 5 min at 4 C the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was stored at 80 C until assayed We used 300 nM norepinephrine in the down regulation studies because we have previously shown that this concentration induces maximal down regulation for the wild type alpha 2C subtype 20 24 Radioligand Binding Pellets were homogenized in 12 ml of ice cold 50 mM Tris HCl buffer pH 8 0 with a Tissumizer Tekmar Cincinnati OH for 20 sec at

membrane fraction was resuspended in 200 volumes of 25 mM NaPO 4 buffer pH 7 4 and re homogenized for use in the radioligand binding assay For down regulation experiments the cells were re homogenized in 5 ml of 25 mM NaPO 4 buffer pH 7 4 For saturation experiments duplicate tubes were prepared containing 970 l of tissue and 20 l of 3H rauwolscine at six concentrations with final concentrations from approximately 6 pM to 0 6 nM Nonspecific binding was determined using a final concentration of 200 M norepinephrine For competition experiments duplicate tubes were prepared containing 970 l of tissue 10 l of norepinephrine at various concentrations and 20 l of 3H rauwolscine 81 5 Ci mmol NEN Dupont Boston MA at a single concentration of 0 12 nM which is approximately the K d value Twelve appropriately spaced concentrations of norepinephrine were used in each competition experiment The extent of down regulation was determined using a single concentration of 3H rauwolscine 0 40 nM about 3 times the K d value We have previously shown that norepinephrine pretreatment does not alter the radioligand K d of the opossum alpha 2C adrenergic receptor 20 24 thus making it possible to estimate the receptor density with a single concentration of radioligand Total binding was determined in triplicate and nonspecific binding in duplicate for each of the three dishes for each condition All
