 Sibling Rivalry Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence A recent inquiry regarding replacing the has prompted me to seek your assistance I asked my younger sister age 20 to be my MOH But she is making the planning of my wedding a nightmare I had thought it would be a kind gesture if I asked her to pick out the dresses for the bridesmaids We visited three bridal salons and she made a veritable scene in each one She was unspeakably ugly to both my mother and me as well as the staff swearing sarcasm and just plain rudeness I was deeply embarrassed and she apparently doesn t understand that this is not going to be her day I asked her to help address envelopes and other little things that need doing and she refused Not in the mood The icing on the cake is that when she asked if the MOH is supposed to make a toast at the reception and I said it was traditional she flat out refused Both my mother and I have tried speaking with her but that just unleashed foul behavior I am sick of her antics and fed up with her I realize that asking her to relinquish the title may jeopardize our relationship but I don t understand her behavior at all T H Dear T Prudie does The little sister is competitive with you and there s a chance she wishes the bride and bridesmaid roles were reversed Acting out in stores and foul behavior are indicative of emotional problems deep hostility and no self control By all means withdraw the title and tell her you do not wish to burden her with MOH chores nor do you wish to have your dream day spoiled There is not a reason in the world that you should have to tolerate this pill of a sister In fact suggest that she not attend the wedding You need not be the victim of her neuroses As for jeopardizing the relationship with all due respect it sounds as if it s already on life support Just because she is your sister doesn t mean she gets to behave less well than a friend Sometimes a relative is just an annoying person courtesy of DNA or if you re religious a punishment from God Prudie proactively Dear Prudie My question also concerns but this time in an office setting in a bathroom with many stalls If you think you recognize the feet of the user in the stall next door and you have a question or a comment should you start talking Wondering too Dear Won If this is a same sex bathroom not an Ally McBeal unisex setup Prudie would say it s OK She is not exactly sure why though Do begin however by verifying it s the person you think it is so that you are not having a conversation with the wrong pair of shoes You might also want to edit your conversation for whoever else might be listening This would entail Prudie guesses checking for more shoes Prudie loquaciously Dear Prudence I thought your response to the about telemarketers was wonderfully done Would you run for president Better yet would you spearhead a tasteful anti telemarketing crusade I am thinking of an Internet movement Can you imagine thousands of people answering telemarketers by singing one line of Alice s Restaurant and then hanging up D C Dear D Prudie cannot run for president because she is having such fun working at Slate She is also alas out of the crusade business Your idea however about singing and hanging up is now being read by tons of people so telemarketers beware Prudie melodically Dear Prudence Thanks for all your good advice Here s my problem I broke off a relationship with a delightful man who lives two houses up the street We were together for nearly four years I m starting my own business and just don t want to be in a committed relationship right now but I would like for us to be friends He is having a great deal of trouble letting go of the more physical aspects of our past and spends a lot of time begging for just one more time How can I make it clear to him that breaking up means losing that physical connection He s prone to pouting and it s driving me nuts Thanks TOO MUCH LOVE IN VT Dear TOO Prudie is going to give you the exact language This is what you say The last time was the last time And if you have broken up how is it that you are subject to the pouting By the way it seems quite clear that your current neighbor former beau is not looking to be friends Prudie definitely Prudence When taking my seat in a crowded movie theater do I say Excuse me to those already seated before while or after I step on their feet R Smith Dear R Prudie always says it before
