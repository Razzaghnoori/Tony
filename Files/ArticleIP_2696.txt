 The Gay Fray On Nov 8 President Clinton spoke at a fund raising dinner for the Human Rights Campaign It marked the first time a sitting president has addressed a gay political organization We are redefining America s immutable ideals said Clinton But in the cauldron of politics ideals are never immutable It s your mutation vs theirs For example 1 Civil rights vs special rights Clinton s main thrust was to equate gay rights with civil rights He likened his speech to the 1947 NAACP gathering at which Harry Truman became the first president to address a black civil rights group HRC Executive Director Elizabeth Birch likewise said her cause was civil rights rather than gay rights The civil rights analogy serves three purposes First it subsumes an apparently radical idea gay rights under a patriotic tradition the espousal and gradual extension of equal rights Clinton traced this tradition to Thomas Jefferson and called it the fundamental story of our country Second it minimizes the burden on gay rights advocates Civil rights are basic You can extend them to gays and to Jews Nazis and vegetarians without condoning their behavior Third it allows gay rights advocates to avoid mentioning homosexuality Clinton spokesmen Mike McCurry and Rahm Emanuel demonstrated this feat when summarizing the speech for reporters Critics say that gays want not civil rights or equal rights but special rights The S word has so effectively permeated the gay rights debate that in their speeches both Clinton and Birch felt obliged without prompting to deny it This didn t stop Ralph Reed and other critics from hurling it on television the next morning Reed elaborated Gays are demanding a special category based on sexual preference under our civil rights statutes This argument fails logically our civil rights laws are entirely about special categories such as race but it succeeds politically by giving a fig leaf of neutrality to what is actually a moral aversion to homosexuality 2 Tolerance vs approval Conservatives long ago surrendered to the liberal crusade for tolerance Now they claim to represent tolerance against the left s demand for approval of homosexuality It s a strong argument because gays do want approval One prominent gay activist called Clinton s speech a message of acceptance Dan Quayle described Clinton s message as part of an attempt by gays and liberals to impose their particular viewpoint on us As CNN pundit Mona Charen put it We won t ask about your private life but don t flaunt it Gays see it the other way around If they can t be open about their orientation said Birch they re effectively banished to the closet But that s a hard argument to sell to an audience that doesn t know and doesn t want to know what it s like to be gay The Ellen controversy illustrates how easily open homosexuality can be construed as aggression On Oct 17 Vice President Gore boasted that when the TV character Ellen played by Ellen DeGeneres came out as a lesbian Americans were forced to look at sexual orientation in a more open light Conservatives led by Quayle exploded at Gore s use of the F word Clinton learned from the mistake On Nov 8 when asked on Meet the Press whether he agreed with Gore he rephrased the point saying that the coming out episode gave Americans a chance to see homosexuality in a new light 3 Outreach vs pandering Clinton wants to make gays participation in politics appear normal His idea of normal politics is cobbling together interest groups Previewing the speech McCurry compared it to an Italian American dinner Birch welcomed that analogy and asserted that gays should be treated like the Hispanic vote because exit polls indicate that they re 5 percent of the electorate This foolish argument helped conservatives dismiss Clinton s speech as pandering Reed adroitly deployed the S word calling Clinton a lackey of the old Democratic Party of a polyglot of special interests of gays of feminists and of union members Gay rights supporters compounded the damage by bragging about gay money and political clout DeGeneres depicted her own coming out as a financial boon I became more famous So much for those people who said that it would ruin my career Birch boasted that gays had made significant investments on par with other constituency groups into campaigns HRC advertised that it had contributed 1 million to Democrats in 1996 that gays had chipped in 3 2 million altogether and that Clinton s appearance at its dinner would raise 300 000 Clinton pointed out that since I ve become president we re spending 10 times as much per fatality on people with AIDS as on people with breast cancer or prostate cancer Conservatives gleefully connected the dots Rich homosexuals were funding Clinton in exchange for favors at other people s expense By the end of the Sunday morning chat shows CNN s Frank Sesno was asking Emanuel Is this just another political group another bunch of donors that you re appealing to 4 Protection vs pity Clinton and Birch talked about how gays have suffered from AIDS teen suicide and hate crimes But this line of argument is also dangerous If gays are unhappy said Bill Bennett in a debate with Birch on ABC s This Week the compassionate response is to help them abandon homosexuality This is fast becoming the respectable anti gay position Anti gay extremists picketed the HRC dinner with signs saying God Hates Fags but a second group of protesters won better press coverage by carrying signs saying Ellen Can Change 5 Employment vs marriage Clinton urged Congress to pass the Employment Non Discrimination Act which would ban job discrimination against gays Chat shows replayed his best sound bite Being gay has nothing to do with the ability to read a balance book fix a broken bone or change a spark plug Even Quayle and Bennett had to agree But neither Clinton nor Birch mentioned gay marriage Why They ve used the same pollster and seen the same polls Americans favor equal treatment of gays in the workplace but oppose gay marriage probably because the latter involves sex Last year Clinton signed legislation prohibiting federal recognition of gay marriages then bragged about it in campaign ads Republicans named it the Defense of Marriage Act framing gays as the aggressors Would Clinton sign it again Yes said Emanuel after the HRC speech Conservatives have attacked ENDA in several ways by claiming for example that it entails job quotas i e special rights for gays But defending the right to discriminate against gays is no longer a sure winner for them They re better off changing the subject to marriage where they hold a clear advantage On This Week Birch focused on civil rights and job discrimination only to be derailed by George Will s first question Does basic equal civil rights include the right to marry Birch unlike Clinton had to give a principled answer uh yes at which point Will and Bennett dragged her through the sordid exercise of distinguishing gay marriage from polygamy and incest Birch pointed out that conservatives defend serial and childless heterosexual marriages but the whole topic was a loser for her Questions not answers win debates 6 Identity vs behavior Everyone now agrees with Martin Luther King Jr that people should be judged by the content of their character not by the color of their skin The gay rights debate turns on whether homosexuality is more like the former or the latter This is why gays substituted the phrase sexual orientation for sexual preference Now conservatives are fighting back Their usual tactic is to pepper the debate with references to sexual vices such as adultery and bestiality But Clinton s war on nonsexual sins gives them a new angle Citing the campaign against tobacco Bennett argued that being a gay man is worse than being a smoker because homosexuality takes 30 years off your life To suppress the image of homosexuality as a vice Clinton and Birch attribute civic virtues to gays If they obey the law show up for work every day or show up for school if they re good citizens they ought to be treated with respect said Clinton Responding to Will s criticism of gay couples who seek to marry Birch insisted They are tax paying They are tax paying 7 Nature vs nurture This underlies the identity vs behavior debate On the Sunday chat shows after Clinton s speech conservatives argued that homosexuality involves a choice while liberals maintained that it s genetically based and hard wired The hot button issue behind this academic dispute is kids If children are amenable to gay persuasion conservatives can argue that they should be protected by excluding gays not just from jobs that involve children e g teaching but also from any legal rights that confer respectability The extreme argument dredged up by Bennett is that gays conspire to recruit kids The more respectable argument leveled by Will is that kids are susceptible to atmospheric social cues The conventional view of last week s frame game is that Clinton s words didn t matter because his mere presence advanced gay rights as a mainstream cause No doubt it did But words always matter and last week s exchange proved that opponents of gay rights aren t running out of good ones any time soon
