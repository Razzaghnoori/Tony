 Looking Backward I m going to sidestep your question of whether the information revolution has changed the nature of the good life and point out that your description of Bell as a conservative in culture clarifies some of what seemed so cloudy in The Coming of Post Industrial Society Bell s fleeting discussion of the sixties cultural events so in the foreground of American life circa 1973 is somewhat startling with hindsight After all the 60s was the decade standing between the last hurrah of an industrial age the 50s and the ascendance of a service centered economy in the 70s with all the doubts that came along with it like Japanese manufacturing eroding the foundation of the American economy an assessment that reflected suspicion of an economy s ability to thrive on building services rather than things As an early indicator of what the post industrial world might look like Woodstock 1999 the 60s would have been a good decade for Bell to examine in this book Yet he s far more interested in say 1860 and the goings on inside Karl s head than what was happening on some upstate New York farm Your description of Bell s cultural conservatism makes me wonder whether his decision to ignore the cultural effects of post industrial society had to do with his personal distaste for the counterculture hippie freaknik thing I ve seen in old newsreels It s an unfortunate omission because it s precisely this cultural information revolution that has changed our world and defined our post industrial society the same information revolution that allowed amplified music to be synchronized with lights using feedback i e information about the system to produce a psychedelic experience Or the information embedded on plastic films that allowed 8 track tapes to alter the way one experienced a day on the beach The entire 60s thing was a product of an information revolution one that initially empowered everyday people to personalize their media diet eroding the principle of mass experiences through media and enhancing tribal impulses to identify with your clique By not discussing these aspects of the post industrial society Bell left us with a book whose value is more for what it says about the 19th century than about the 21st Bell s basically best on Marx and if that s of interest to you in 1999 then you ll enjoy reading The Coming of Post Industrial Society Jim I m told by Judith that this is to be our last installment on this book It s been lovely corresponding with you I hope you ve been writing your messages from the beach Next time around we ll see if we can discern how the information revolution may have changed the nature of the good life as you put it for better or worse
