 Background Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins that function in intracellular signaling pathways to regulate a variety of developmental processes including cell growth cell differentiation cell polarity and apoptosis Mis regulation of Wnt signaling leads to the development of several human cancers including colon carcinomas and melanoma 1 Canonical Wnt signaling initiates in the binding of a Wnt ligand to its cell surface receptor members of the frizzled gene family along with the co receptor LRP5 6 2 3 leading to changes in the activities of cytoplasmic effectors resulting in the stabilization of beta catenin protein Beta catenin then accumulates in the nucleus where it interacts with its transcriptional co activators members of the Lymphoid Enhancer Factor T Cell Factor LEF TCF family of high mobility group DNA binding proteins to regulate gene expression 1 Many downstream gene targets of the canonical Wnt beta catenin pathway have been identified http www stke org There is a large family of Wnt ligands and not all Wnts are thought to function in the same pathway Wnts can be operationally separated into two classes the first being a class that transforms C57mg mouse mammary epithelial cells and also promotes duplication of the dorso ventral axis when over expressed in Xenopus embryos Wnts in this functional class activate the canonical Wnt beta catenin pathway Wnt 1 3A and 8 The second functional group of Wnts does not transform C57mg cells nor promote axis duplication Instead when over expressed in frog or fish embryos these Wnts perturb the movements of gastrulation Wnts in this class have been shown to signal in a non canonical Wnt signaling pathway the Wnt Ca 2 pathway Wnt 5a 4 11 The Wnt Ca 2 pathway has been shown to increase intracellular Ca 2 levels in zebrafish embryos 4 and to activate PKC and CamKII in Xenopus embryos 5 6 as well as in human melanomas 7 Moreover it may activate Cdc42 8 and JNK 9 It is important to emphasize that whether Wnts activate distinct responses and likely pathways is context dependent and thus in other contexts a given Wnt may activate another pathway Vertebrate Wnts signal through frizzled receptors that in some experimental contexts e g without co expressing LRP5 6 preferentially activate the Wnt beta catenin or Wnt Ca 2 pathways 5 Interestingly Wnt 5a may couple to either pathway depending on which frizzled receptor is present When co expressed with human frizzled 5 Wnt 5a can induce a secondary axis in Xenopus 10 In other assays however Wnt 5a along with rat frizzled 2 Rfz 2 increases intracellular Ca 2 levels and activates PKC and CamKII 4 5 6 The activation of Wnt Ca 2 signaling by Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 seems to be antagonistic to the canonical Wnt signaling pathway Specifically Wnt 5a expression inhibits ectopic Wnt 8 induction of secondary axis formation in Xenopus embryos 11 Supportingly the endogenous expression of Wnt 5a maintains C57mg cells in a normal growth state since anti sense Wnt 5a mimics Wnt 1 transformation of C57mg cells 12 This data suggests that Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a work in an opposing manner in some cellular contexts This potential role of Wnt 5a as a tumor suppressor is further supported by the evidence that ectopic Wnt 5a in human uroepithelial cells prevents tumorigenesis when injected into athymic nude mice 13 Much is still unknown about how Wnt 5a signals and importantly whether it regulates any genes The ability of dnWnt 11 to block expression of some genes in Xenopus 6 and the ability of Wnt 5a to activate the Ca 2 sensitive transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells NFAT 14 support the likelihood that Wnt 5a can regulate gene expression through a beta catenin independent mechanism We sought to identify genes regulated by Wnt 5a and compare whether these were different from canonical Wnt 1 gene targets using DNA microarray analysis Results To identify downstream genes regulated by Wnt 5a we created C57mg cells that stably express both Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 a potential ligand and receptor pair that in some assays function in the same signaling pathway We overexpressed Rfz 2 in addition to Wnt 5a in C57mg cells in order to augment the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling Both have been shown to elevate intracellular Ca 2 levels and to activate PKC and CamKII 4 5 6 In addition Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 have been shown to synergize in their induction of CamKII 6 Wnt 1 C57mg cells were also used for comparison in an effort to identify genes preferentially regulated by Wnt 5a C57mg cells appeared to respond to ectopic expression of both Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 in C57mg cells since the cells exhibited a moderate reduction in growth rate in comparison to wildtype wt C57mg cells as well as Wnt 1 C57mg cells data not shown Phenotypically the Wnt 5a Rfz 2 C57mg cells were more spread out and the overall size of the cells increased compared to wt C57mg cells or Wnt 1 C57mg cells data not shown In contrast ectopic expression of Wnt 1 induced the expected morphological transformation of C57mg cells data not shown Previous reports of ectopic expression of different Wnts in C57mg cells demonstrated Wnt 1 to be highly transforming whereas Wnt 5a failed to induce transformation 15 16 By identifying downstream targets of Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 we wanted to determine which genes are responsible for these phenotypic changes as well as which genes might be targets of noncanonical Wnt signaling RNA isolated from wt C57mg cells C57mg cells stably transformed by Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 retroviruses and C57mg cells stably transformed by Wnt 1 retrovirus were used for DNA microarray analysis Biotinylated cRNA probes synthesized from the RNA were hybridized to Affymetrix mouse GeneChips Mu11k subA and subB arrays Over 11 000 oligonucleotide probe sets were analysed including known genes and ESTs Two independent sets of experiments were performed that initiated from the growth of cells Probe sets that underwent a 2 fold or greater change in the Wnt ligand expressing cells compared to control cells were selected for further analysis Over 90 genes that repeated in both experiments appeared to change in the Wnt expressing cells Of those 50 genes were chosen for validation by an independent method quantitative RT PCR A list of some of these genes with the observed fold changes determined by DNA microarray analysis and quantitative RT PCR is shown Table 1 list of primers shown in Table 2 Genes are separated by functional categories with the greatest number of genes having roles in cell adhesion transcriptional regulation and signaling The list of genes shows those that are specific to Wnt 5a Rfz 2 differential between Wnt 5a Rfz 2 and Wnt 1 specific to Wnt 1 and common to both Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a Rfz 2 Previously identified genes regulated by Wnt signaling in this list include fibronectin 17 IL 6 18 BMP 4 19 groucho related protein 20 and Krox 20 21 22 Since Wnt 5a may couple to more than one frizzled receptor different Wnt signaling pathways may be activated by Wnt 5a depending on the endogenous expression of various frizzled receptors 6 10 Thus it is possible that the gene expression pattern we identified may be due to the activation of both canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways We compared the Wnt 5a Rfz 2 expression profile to the Wnt 1 expression profile to rule out genes common in both pathways and to identify those genes specific to Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 We next wanted to examine whether any of these genes were regulated in a similar manner if we used alternative methods for expressing Wnt 1 or Wnt 5a In particular we wanted to activate the function of these Wnts for short durations rather than relying on stable expression The first approach was to co culture C57mg cells with cells secreting Wnt ligand For the co culture experiments C57mg cells were grown together with Wnt 1 or Wnt 5a expressing 293T cells for 24 hours RNA was isolated and quantitative RT PCR was performed using primers to the list of genes from Table 1 The majority of genes had little if any background in the PCR reactions from the human 293T cell RNA data not shown One gene mesothelin exhibited a 3 fold induction in C57mg cells treated with the Wnt 1 but not the Wnt 5a secreting 293T cells Figure 1 panel A This fold change was similar to the data obtained from stable expression with Wnt 1 in C57mg cells see Table 1 Mesothelin is a cell surface antigen of unknown function that is expressed in the mesothelium It is synthesized as a 69 kDa precursor that is proteolytically processed into a 40 kDa membrane bound form that is glycosylphosphatidylinositol GPI linked and a 32 kDa secreted form The secreted form has been referred to as megakaryocyte potentiating factor MPF for its ability to stimulate the megakaryocyte colony forming activity of murine IL 3 in mouse bone marrow cell culture 23 24 Mesothelin expression is induced in a variety of cancers including ovarian pancreatic lung and cervical cancer 25 26 The soluble portion of mesothelin has drawn attention as a potential serum tumor marker since it is highly over expressed in patients with ovarian carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas 27 28 Stromelysin 1 SL 1 was induced almost 2 fold in C57mg cells co cultured with Wnt 5a secreting 293T cells but not with Wnt 1 secreting 293T cells Figure 1 panel A A similar level of induction was also observed with Wnt 5a 293T cells co cultured with Rfz 2 C57mg cells data not shown suggesting that the induction of SL 1 is due to expression of Wnt 5a and not only to Rfz 2 These data are similar to the 4 fold induction of SL 1 in Wnt 5a Rfz 2 C57mg cells Table 1 SL 1 is a matrix metalloproteinase that can alter ECM mediated signaling events during development 29 30 31 Both SL 1 and Wnt 5a have roles in mammary gland development and are elevated in certain breast cancers 32 33 34 35 although Wnt 5a is reduced in other types of breast cancer 36 Since Wnt 5a may activate both vertebrate Wnt pathways we turned to an approach that more specifically would transiently activate the Wnt Ca 2 signaling pathway This approach involves the use of a drug inducible chimeric receptor consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane spanning portions derived from the hamster 2 adrenergic receptor 2 AR and the intracellular domains derived from Rfz 2 This receptor has previously been shown to elevate intracellular Ca 2 and activate CamKII in a ligand dependent manner 6 37 38 C57mg cells stably transformed with Rfz 2 2 AR retrovirus or wt C57mg cells were treated overnight with propranolol a 2 AR antagonist to maintain the chimeric receptors in an inactivated state Subsequently the 2 AR agonist isoproterenol was added for 8 hours at which point RNA was isolated and quantitative RT PCR was performed Supporting the co culture data discussed above SL 1 exhibited almost a 3 fold induction with isoproterenol treated Rfz 2 2 AR expressing C57mg cells but not wt C57mg cells treated with isoproterenol Figure 1 panel B SL 1 appears to be up regulated by Wnt 5a and not Wnt 1 Table 1and Figure 1 panel A Conversely mesothelin appears to be up regulated specifically by Wnt 1 and not Wnt 5a since mesothelin was not induced by co culturing with Wnt 5a secreting cells or by activation of the chimeric Rfz 2 2 AR receptor Figure 1 panels A and B To our knowledge this is the first report to show that two genes are differentially regulated by two different Wnts within the same cell type In order to examine the mechanism by which Wnt 1 or Wnt 5a regulates mesothelin or SL 1 respectively C57mg cells were treated with either LiCl or phorbol myristic acetate PMA LiCl has previously been shown to mimic activation of Wnt 1 signaling by stabilizing beta catenin through its inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 GSK 3 a kinase that phosphorylates beta catenin and promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway 39 C57mg cells treated with LiCl exhibited elevated levels of mesothelin but not SL 1 Figure 2 left panel On the other hand PMA treatment of C57mg cells elevated SL 1 transcript levels 6 fold but not mesothelin Figure 2 right panel PMA a phorbol ester activates PKC and has previously been shown to activate SL 1 40 It appears that mesothelin is activated by Wnt 1 which can be mimicked by LiCl and that SL 1 is activated by Wnt 5a in a beta catenin independent manner which can be mimicked by activating PKC Discussion We used DNA microarray analysis to identify genes regulated by Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a in C57mg cells C57mg cells were chosen since they become transformed by ectopic expression of Wnt 1 and by loss of function of Wnt 5a 12 15 16 In addition Wnt 5a Rfz 2 C57mg cells exhibited phenotypic differences from wt C57mg cells see results We focused on two genes that showed differential regulation by Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a since their regulation was reproducible using several methods to activate the Wnt signaling pathways The first mesothelin was up regulated by Wnt 1 both by stable expression of Wnt 1 in C57mg cells and by co culturing C57mg cells with Wnt 1 secreting cells Similarly mesothelin expression was induced by Li an inhibitor of GSK 3 that mimics Wnt 1 Mesothelin is markedly over expressed in a variety of cancers derived from tissues of the mesothelium including lung cervix and pancreas Interestingly mesothelin expression is induced in lung ovarian and pancreatic carcinomas where constitutive activation of Wnt signaling is caused by stabilizing mutations in beta catenin 27 28 41 42 43 44 The induction of mesothelin in these carcinomas may be due to misregulation of Wnt signaling as are other targets of the Wnt pathway c myc and cyclin D1 Mutations in different effectors of Wnt signaling have been identified in a variety of cancers Interestingly Wnt 5a down regulated mesothelin expression perhaps through antagonism of endogenous Wnt beta catenin signaling Second SL 1 was up regulated by Wnt 5a in C57mg cells Three lines of evidence demonstrate that SL 1 induction is associated with activation of Wnt 5a signaling First C57mg cells stably expressing Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 elevate SL 1 levels Second C57mg cells co cultured with Wnt 5a secreting cells up regulate SL 1 Third activation of chimeric Rfz 2 receptors stably expressed in C57mg cells augment SL 1 expression To further examine how SL 1 is up regulated by Wnt 5a we tested whether SL 1 induction could be mediated by downstream effectors of Wnt Ca 2 signaling such as PKC Activation of PKC by PMA treatment of C57mg cells did indeed elevate SL 1 levels significantly SL 1 is an important modulator of cell adhesion through its function as a matrix metalloproteinase that degrades the ECM SL 1 induction in p2S cells an untransformed mouse mammary epithelial cell line triggered the disappearance of E cadherin and beta catenin from cell cell junctions and reduced the expression of beta catenin 35 Wnt 5a and SL 1 may play similar roles in inhibiting cadherin mediated cell adhesion as Wnt 5a decreases Ca 2 dependent cell adhesion similar to a dominant negative cadherin 11 The regulation of SL 1 by Wnt 5a may be important in developmental processes such as gastrulation where Wnt 5a affects the morphogenetic movement of tissues 45 Whether mesothelin and SL 1 are direct targets of Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a respectively and whether alterations in their expression are responsible for the observed phenotypic changes in Wnt 5a Rfz 2 C57mg cells has yet to be determined Whether they are direct or indirect does not alter the observation that the expression of both change in an unexpected manner in response to these two Wnts Much less is understood about Wnt 5a signaling pathway s and how Wnt 5a signals are transmitted to the nucleus to affect gene expression compared to the canonical Wnt beta catenin signaling pathway A recent report demonstrated that Wnt 5a and Rfz 2 can induce the nuclear localization of the transcription factor NF AT 14 Their results show that NF AT is a downstream target of the Wnt Ca 2 pathway and antagonizes the Wnt beta catenin pathway in Xenopus embryos The SL 1 promoter has putative NF AT binding sites but whether these are important for Wnt 5a regulation requires further testing Nevertheless our data clearly demonstrate that different Wnts have distinct effects on gene expression in a single cell line Conclusions Using DNA microarray analysis we identified several genes that are differentially regulated by Wnt 1 and Wnt 5a signaling within the same cell type C57mg We focused on two genes mesothelin and SL 1 whose regulation by Wnts was reproducible using a variety of methods to activate the Wnt signaling pathways Mesothelin a potential tumor serum marker was up regulated by Wnt 1 and down regulated by Wnt 5a SL 1 a matrix metalloproteinase was up regulated by Wnt 5a only showing that Wnt 5a can indeed affect gene expression Our data indicate that different Wnts can stimulate distinct sets of genes Methods Cell Culture retroviral infections and DNA transfections C57mg cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS and 10 g ml of insulin 293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10 FBS The Wnt 5a Rfz 2 expressing C57mg cell line and the Rfz 2 2 AR expressing C57mg cell line

in CS2 6 37 was digested with EcoRI and XhoI and cloned into PMI hCD2 at the EcoRI and SalI sites Generation of the retrovirus infection of the C57mg cell line and enrichment of infected cells was performed as described 46 48 Cell populations enriched to 95 were used for RNA isolation Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen as directed by the manufacturer Wnt 1 expressing C57mg cells were a kind gift from G Shackleford For co culture experiments 293T cells were transfected with either Xenopus Wnt 5a 45 mouse Wnt 1 49 or CS2 as control using the lipofectamine PLUS reagents GIBCO BRL as directed by the manufacturer 24 hours after transfection the Wnt expressing 293T cells were transferred to culture dishes seeded with C57mg cells Both cell types were plated at a 1 1 ratio Cells were co cultured for 24 hours and RNA was isolated For induction of the Rfz 2 2 AR chimeric receptor chimeric receptor expressing C57mg cells or wt C57mg cells were treated with 10 M propranolol overnight and then with 10 M isoproterenol for 8 hours Control cells were treated with 10 M propranolol only For Li and PMA stimulation experiments C57mg cells were incubated with 10 mM LiCl 10 mM KCl as a control or 1 M PMA for 6 hours All treatments were followed by RNA extraction Oligonucleotide Array Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit Qiagen according to the manufacturer s protocols Transcript profiling with Affymetrix GeneChips Affymetrix Santa Clara CA was performed using the Mu11KsubA and subB chips containing 11 000 probe sets Briefly 15 g of total RNA were reverse transcribed with an oligo dT primer coupled to a T7 RNA polymerase binding site Biotinylated complementary RNA cRNA was then synthesized from the resulting complementary DNA cDNA with the use of T7 polymerase 30 g of biotinylated cRNA were then randomly sheared to an approximate length of 50 nucleotides Hybridization to the arrays and first pass analysis of the scanned data were performed at the PAN Facility Stanford University Palo Alto California Reverse Transcriptase PCR RT PCR Analysis Confirmation of gene expression was performed using quantitative RT PCR cDNA was created from total RNA using the ThermoScript RT PCR System Invitrogen with an oligo dT 20 primer Minus RT controls were also prepared similarly 2 g RNA were included in each reaction in a total volume of 20 l The reaction was performed at 55 C for 1 hour and terminated by incubating at 85 C for 5 minutes The reaction was diluted 7 5 fold in water and 2 5 l were added to the PCR reaction to yield a total volume of 25 l Since nonspecific amplification was obtained in testing some of the primers sets with the RT controls optimization of the primer concentration was performed as per the SYBR green PCR protocol Applied Biosystems Three concentrations of each of the forward and reverse primers were used 50 nM 300 nM and 900 nM to obtain nine different combinations The amplification

primer concentration optimization and samples were taken out at 20 25 30 and 35 cycles to run on 2 agarose gels The combination of forward and reverse primer concentrations was selected based on the presence of a single band only in the RT sample Using the optimized primer concentrations the PCR reaction was performed with the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix Applied Biosystems and the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detector Applied Biosystems The amplification reaction consisted of the following 50 C for 2 min denaturation at 95 C for 10 minutes and 40 thermal cycles of 95 C for 15 s and 60 C for 1 min PCR quantification was performed in triplicate Fold induction was obtained by using the C t method in which all samples are first normalized to the level of mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase HPRT in each sample Relative normalized units were then compared between the experimental sample and its control The primer sequences are shown in Table 2 To determine the specificity of the primer sets to the murine mesothelin and SL 1 targets genes we performed PCR using the primers sets with cDNA from human 293T cells and found no amplification Author s contributions
