 Background The identification of individual genes governing phenotypic variation is crucial to understand the mechanistic basis of quantitative inheritance and ultimately provide information about the design of optimal breeding strategies in both plants and animals Quantitative genetics based on new statistical and computational technologies has advanced to the point at which individual genes can be detected and mapped on chromosomes 1 2 The underpinning for the detection and mapping of genes is founded on their particular segregation pattern For a pedigree derived from inbred lines the segregation pattern of a gene can be exactly predicted In this situation quantitative genetic theory can lay a sufficient foundation for gene detection and thus the properties of a detected gene can be adequately described by its effect and genomic location However for outcrossing populations such as forest trees in which inbred lines are not available genes also display population genetic properties 3 Hence the foundation for gene detection in these populations should be established on a combination of quantitative genetics and population genetics The estimation of the population genetic properties of genes such as allele frequencies and the degree of disequilibrium can not only enhance the precision and power of gene detection but also is fundamentally important to our understanding of population differentiation and evolution 4 5 We present a strategy for investigating the existence of genes in an arbitrarily complex progeny test based on phenotype data and estimating the effects of these genes on a quantitative trait and their population properties under the maximum likelihood framework Only a limited number of statistical studies have been performed to detect genes based on the phenotypic data 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 and none of these studies have considered the population and evolutionary genetic properties of genes Our study population can be derived from a natural population instead of inbred lines as used for general agronomic crops A finite number of unrelated parents are randomly selected from a natural population and are mated to produce progeny tests under a mating design such as factorial or diallel In a recent paper we used such progeny tests to derive a model for detecting major genes affecting a quantitative trait 14 This model has power to estimate the effect of drift errors on genetic variation during hybridization thus providing information about dynamic changes of the genetic architecture of a population under artificial hybridization However the estimates of population genetic parameters from the progeny test using the above model cannot be generalized to the original population from which the mating design is derived In this paper we developed a hierarchical model for analyzing the pattern of gene segregation at both population and family levels which thus can provide estimates of genetic parameters in two successive generations of the population Estimates of population genetic parameters using this hierarchical model can reasonably infer the genetic structure of the original population A forest tree example is used to demonstrate the application of the new statistical model for gene detection Model Population genetic structure Suppose there is a segregating major gene responsible for a quantitative trait in a natural or experimental diploid population This gene has s different codominant alleles A 1 A s whose frequencies in the population are denoted by p 1 p s with p 1 These s alleles randomly unite to form s s 1 2 distinguishable genotypes including s homozygotes and s s 1 2 heterozygotes The population frequencies of the genotypes are denoted by p 1 s If the population is at Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium HWD the genotypic frequency is the product of the two corresponding allelic frequencies plus the coefficient of HWD d i e p p p d where d has the restrictions max p 1 p p 1 p d p p and d v d 15 Mating design A finite number of unrelated individuals are randomly selected from the population as female and male parents to generate a I J factorial mating design Based on sampling theory these selected individuals have genotypes at the major locus whose counts follow the same multinomial distribution as those in the original population with probability vector p p 1 n The segregation of progeny genotypes in the mating design depends on how the major locus genotypes segregate 1 among the selected female or male parents and 2 within each of the full sib families Table 1 The segregation among the I female or J male parents having the same pattern as in the original population is viewed as the population level segregation The segregation within a full sib family of size n ij derived from the i th female and j th male parent follows the Mendelian segregation ratio viewed as the family level segregation To understand the genetic structure of the original population different genetic information derived from this two level segregation will not be mixed but rather combined within a maximum likelihood framework Estimation method Let y ijk denote the phenotypic measurement for the k th offspring from i th female parent and j th male parent and g ijk denote its genotype at the major gene i 1 2 I j 1 2 J k 1 2 n ij The statistical model describing the phenotype genotype relationship can be expressed as where is the genotypic value of genotype A A and e ijk is the error term with the normal distribution N 0 2 Let be the genotype for the i th female parent and for the j th male parent We denote by y the collection of the observed data and by z g g f g m the collection of the major locus genotypes for offspring female parents and male parents We assume the following hierarchical model where f denotes the normal distribution of the phenotype N 2 h is distributed according to the Mendelian segregation pattern and is multinomially distributed with probability vector p Note that genotypes for siblings are dependent and given genotypes the traits are independent of each other Under the above model y z has a joint distribution as follows Statistically equation 2 is a mixture model in which each component is represented by a genotype within a full sib family 16 17 18 The maximum likelihood estimates for 2 p can be obtained using the EM algorithm 19 20 At the t th step of the EM sequence the expected log likelihood is proportional to where G sums over all possible genotypes are the posterior distributions of offspring genotypes and iG jG are the posterior distributions of parent genotypes Conditional on these posterior probabilities can be evaluated as follows The EM sequence is defined by Suppose the major gene has two different codominant alleles the posterior probablities in equation 4 can be exactly calculated for a usual mating design However for large designs with many parents or for the case where the major gene has many different alleles we have to rely on a Monte Carlo version of the EM algorithm For example we can sample from the conditional distribution of z g g f g m given using the following Gibbs sampler 20 Example We use data from aspen trees to illustrate the appication of our statistical model for detecting a major gene The example is derived from a 6 6 factorial mating design of Populus tremuloides and P tremula The parents for the crosses were randomly selected from a mixed breeding population of two different species established at the University of Minnesota Originally the P tremuloides trees used as the female parents from the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and northern Wisconsin and the P tremula male parents came from northeastern Poland and Germany 21 The seedlings from the progeny population were planted in two different locations one on a cutover forest site near Grand Rapids Minnesota and the other on farmland near Rhinelander Wisconsin Both trials were laid out in a randomized complete block design with 10 replicates and six seedlings per family in each replicate at 2 5 2 5 spacing At the end of the second year in the field all trees were measured for stem height Figure 1presents density estimates of the second year height from each family pooled over the two locations Trees from eight families did not have growth data due to mortality The phenotypic distributions suggest the existence of a major gene in the progeny test For example in the family derived from Clone 5 TA 1 68 the phenotypic distribution is a mixture of at least two components showing the existence of a segregating gene Figure 1also indicates different segregation patterns among the families with some more smooth and others more waved thus suggesting that some parents are heterozygous with their alleles segregating in the progeny The effect and genotypic frequencies of the major gene are estimated using the hierarchical model assuming two alleles Since no significant difference is detected between two locations we only report the result based on pooled data With probability of almost one parents TA 1 91 TA 2 68 TA 4 91 XTA 3 6 have genotype A 1 A 1 parents TA 1 68 TA 1 75 CLONE 5 TA 5 61 have genotype A 1 A 2 and the rest parents have genotype A 2 A 2 The estimates of the genotypic values of A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 and A 2 A 2 are 11 56 7 0 80 12 40 6 0 32 and 22 30 0 1 02 respectively The estimate of residual variance is 218 676 6 09 Here the estimates of standard errors for the parameter estimators are obtained based on the Fisher information matrix 22 We also fitted the model under the null hypothesis that there is no major gene with a single normal distribution The likelihood ratio test has p 0 0001 suggesting the existence of a major gene for height growth The ratio of the dominant to additive effect for this major gene is less than 0 2 which implies that it affects the stem height growth in an additive manner The population genetic parameters of this major gene are estimated based on the genotypes of the parents detected The genotype frequencies estimated are identical for the three genotypes i e 11 12 22 1 3 In consequence the allele frequencies are also same 1 2 1 2 Thus the mixed breeding population of P tremulodes and P tremula is not at Hardy Weinberg equilibrium because the genotype frequencies are not products of the corresponding allele frequencies The coefficient of Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium is estimated as The estimate of allele frequencies and Hardy Weinberg disequilibrium using our hierarchical model can be well generalized to the original breeding population from which the parents were sampled However one should be cautious about the accuracy of the estimator due to the small sample size Simulation The behavior of the EM estimators is evaluated by two simulation experiments In the first simulation a 6 by 6 mating design same as our real example is assumed The major gene is assumed to have two codominant alleles A 1 and A 2 whose frequencies in the population are p 1 0 6 and p 2 0 4 The genotypic values are set to be 65 40 and 25 with standard deviation 15 Based on the hierarchical model defined in equation 1 we first simulated a set of the parental genotypes A 1 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 A 1 A 1 for females and A 1 A 2 A 2 A 2 A 2 A 2 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 A 1 A 2 for males Then we randomly generated 50 offspring genotypes and observations for each family Our EM estimating procedure converged to the correct parental genotypes after only a few iterations normally 2 or 3 A loglikelihood test is highly significant with log likelihood ratio equals 125 df 4 The estimates of genotypic values from a single simulation replicate are 64 1 0 74 for A 1 A 1 39 5 0 59 for A 1 A 2 and and 26 8 1 64 for A 2 A 2 The estimate of residual variance is 241 6 10 30 In our second simulation we studied a 5 by 5 mating design We used 25 replications to investigate the empirical accuracy of the estimators We assume the major gene has 2 alleles and randomly generated parental genotypes The parental genotypes were randomly generated based on allele frequence p 1 0 5 That resulted in female genotypes A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 A 2 A 2 A 1 A 2 A 2 A 2 and male genotypes A 1 A 2 A 1 A 1 A 2 A 2 A 1 A 1 A 1 A 2 For each family we simulated the 50 genotypes for its offsprings and then simulated its trait measurement using a normal and log normal distribution The results from the second simulation study are summarized in Figure 2 The top panel of the plots is for the simulation where trait measurements are simulated from a normal distribution The bottom panel corresponds to lognormal data In each plot we graphed the ideal estimates of the parameter assuming that we know the genotypes of each offspring versus our estimates based on the EM algorithm Mean squared errors are also indicated in the plots It is seen from Figure 2that all four parameters can be estimated quite accurately in the normal case while they are slightly biased for the lognormal data Discussion We have derived a hierarchical model for detecting major genes affecting a quantitative trait based on progeny tests of outcrossing species The new model takes into account the population genetic properties of genes and is expected to enhance the accuracy precision and power of gene detection The information about the population behavior of genes estimated from this model is fundamentally important to our understanding of the genetic architecture of a natural or experimental population and is also useful for the design of sound breeding strategies for agricultural crops and forest trees We used an example from interspecific aspen hybrids to illustrate the application of our gene detecting model The model has successfully identified a major gene with additive effects on second year stem growth in the hybrid aspens The additive effect of genes on height growth in young poplars was also observed in a molecular marker experiment 23 In this marker experiment an additive quantitative trait locus was found to explain almost a quarter of the total phenotypic variation in second year height growth The result from the aspen hybrids was consistent with that from a simulation experiment based on a mating scheme analogous to that used in our real example The consistency of the results from the simulation study suggests that the model proposed here can be adequately used to detect genes of large effect on the phenotypes The model will have immediate applications for many species in which progeny tests have been established for a number of years 24 Most of these tests are maintained in different locations and measured annually thus offering desirable opportunities to address two important questions 1 How does the genes interact with environment 2 What is the developmental plasticity of gene expression In our real example no evidence has been obtained for the change of gene expression at the major locus detected over the two field trials despite their dramatic differences in climate soil properties and silvicultural measures 21 If the stability of the expression of this gene over a range of environments is confirmed by more accurate genotype determination methods e g based on genetic markers It will have a tremendous application in breeding for stable cultivars of forest tree species Our analysis and simulation is based on diallelic inheritance But multiallelic inheritance can be similarly considered although more parameters should be introduced Also our model assumes the segregation of a single gene in progeny tests The principle behind the model can be extended to consider two or more genes Modelling multiple genes may be closer to biological reality because the linkage epistatic interaction and genetic association among genes are considered However the consideration of these relationships needs to estimate an increased number of unknown genetic parameters Finally our model is based on a balanced factorial design For some populations like mammals mating designs are frequently unbalanced because of limited resources or reproductive difficulties It is very important to extend our analysis and model to an unbalanced mating design of any complexity For all of these extensions mentioned above maximum likelihood approaches may not be sufficient owing to an increasing dimension of parameter space A more powerful computational tool e g Markov chain Monte Carol methods may be needed 20 to make our model more tractable in real applications
