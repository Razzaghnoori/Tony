 Background Color fundus photographs have been routinely employed for diagnostic purposes for many years and fundus photo gradings are central to clinical studies of macular disease 1 2 The natural history of age related macular degeneration AMD the leading cause of blindness in the developed world 3 is in particular tied to that of subretinal deposits known as drusen 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Drusen are key in the classification of AMD hence the importance of drusen identification and measurement in clinical studies The classification of patients by stage of age related maculopathy involves painstaking analysis of drusen size number area and morphology in several subcategories Significant effort has been placed in developing and validating the International 1 and Wisconsin 2 Grading Systems The systematic study of drusen resorption following laser photocoagulation also underscores the importance of drusen measurement and recognition 8 9 10 13 14 15 16 There has been continued interest in the use of digital techniques for quantification of macular pathology particularly drusen over the last two decades 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 However despite progress none of these methods have gained widespread use A major obstacle has been that the reflectance of the normal background on which the pathology is superimposed is inherently non uniform In particular the normally less reflectant central macula is superimposed on whatever the underlying or true drusen reflectance might be Hence given two anatomically identical drusen one in the center of the macula and one at 3000 m the observer will see them differently in the fundus photograph The outlying drusen will appear brighter and larger than its identical counterpart The human eye with training makes allowances for this variability but a computer applying a threshold does not Prior methods have so far been unable to deal with this non uniform macular background reflectance as a whole An early study 25 used adaptive thresholding techniques on 1024 separate windows of 8 8 pixels Perivascular windows sometimes incorrectly interpreted bimodal distributions as coming from perivascular drusen Large areas of background were also sometimes included due to incorrect choices of threshold These sources of error required many operator interventions to correct The result was a method that was capable of excellent reproducibility 2 3 but was too tedious for general use Hence as early as 1986 the limiting factor was not the time complexity of computer algorithms but the fact that the method itself was tied to local reflectance calculations This problem persisted in a recent study that relied on applying local thresholds to regions ranging from 20 to 100 pixels square 17 Drusen were identified first by checking the local histogram for sufficient skewness equivalent in this method to determining that drusen were present in the region and then setting a local threshold However the method was defeated if a large drusen dominated a local region In this case the local distribution would not be skew and the large drusen would be completely missed A user would be required to correct this error manually after the automated segmentation In general a post processing step was necessary to correct drusen segmentation errors or enlarge incompletely segmented drusen to achieve acceptable accuracy These studies demonstrate that segmentation by local histograms and threshold techniques has serious deficiencies Rapantzikos 18 et al have used other morphological operators as well as varying local histogram criteria for threshold choice to try to correct these deficiencies Their criteria involve kurtosis as well as skewness The fundamental fact remains as they readily admit no matter how many histogram based criteria are employed for local segmentation that widely different combinations of image features drusen and background can yield the same histogram An extreme example as in 17 would be regions that were either all background or all drusen in either case yielding the same mesokurtic nonskewed distribution Their solution a morphological dilation operator is intended in the all drusen case to distort the local histogram by reintroducing background and thereby improve threshold recognition It is unclear however that this artificial operator will always perform as intended Another example of the arbitrary application of a general tool occurs when their segmentation leaves isolated bright groups of pixels They conclude if these are in close proximity then they possibly belong to the same large drusen and therefore must be expanded by a closing operator But these could also be isolated small hard drusen Lastly despite the use of a wide range of general image analysis tools their methods as those in the other references take no account of the intrinsic background variability and accordingly can produce errors in a systematic and predictable fashion inadequate segmentation centrally and over inclusive segmentation in the peripheral macula as their own illustrations demonstrate An alternative to color photography is scanning laser ophthalmoscopy SLO imaging for recognition of bright features This method has been used for detection of retinal exudates in diabetes 19 using a single optimized wavelength The concept has been carried further in a multispectral approach using a tunable dye laser 20 The problem of variable illumination and or intrinsic background variability is also addressed by multiple local adaptive thresholds but with a novel addition Regions of the image are designated as featureless if the coefficient of variation of the local histogram is sufficiently small The mean gray scale values of these regions are then used to determine local thresholds which are then interpolated to give a global threshold function Since diabetic exudates tend to be smaller than soft drusen it is unclear if sufficient featureless windows would be available in an image with multiple soft drusen to apply this method Our approach to this problem has been as follows We first demonstrated that there was an inherent geometric pattern to the background reflectance in normal fundus images 26 We then developed a semi automated interactive method based on these patterns to level the background reflectance of a drusen containing image independent of the reflectivity of the overlying drusen preliminary results presented in abstract form 27 This allows the use of a global threshold to segment the drusen accurately By adopting this unified approach to the macular reflectance problem we avoid the multiple local thresholds used in previous approaches 17 18 19 20 24 25 It is important to note however that our method is not the standard technique of shadowing by subtracting or dividing by a blur image These standard techniques 28 also used herein are useful for shading correction on large scales As we have shown in our previous work 26 however the macular reflectance can change significantly over ranges of distance 50 100 m comparable to the size of pathologic structures of interest Hence subtracting the variation on this scale would tend to remove such structures from the image Indeed one reason we are presenting our particular method is that we found after many trials and errors that none of the standard morphological transform routines dilations erosion closings or combinations thereof were able to precisely define the boundary of pathological features in a fundus image We determined that it would be nearly impossible to completely automate the process relying solely on mathematical morphology On the other hand a potential advantage of using simpler techniques in less specialized software with expert oversight of the final segmentations is portability and use at other institutions for macular research We report a semi automated digital method for drusen measurement in fundus photographs using commercially available software and test it for reliability against the current standard of fundus photo grading by stereo pair viewing in the central 1000 micron diameter and middle 3000 micron subfields Methods Subjects The drusen images consisted of stereo pairs of standard 35 degree film based color fundus photographs centered on the macular regions Clinicians expert in AMD IB and CCWK selected twelve good quality stereo pairs of cases with Stage 2 or 3 age related maculopathy as defined by the International Grading System at random from the Columbia Macular Genetics Study CMGS Hence all cases had soft drusen present but lacked the advanced lesions of geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization Pigmentary abnormalities hyper or hypopigmentation were not excluded The CMGS is an ongoing cross sectional case control study of the possible genetic bases of macular degeneration This study has been approved by the New York Presbyterian Hospital Institutional Review Board One photograph from each pair was chosen for digitization All patients were white and over 60 years of age Photographs of normal maculae from the files of the first author RTS were also analyzed Image acquisition All photographs were scanned and digitized CoolScan LS 2000 Nikon Corporation Tokyo Japan at resolutions of 2700 pixels inch actual optical resolution The images were saved as 24 bit RGB TIFF files with 256 levels of intensity value for each color channel Image Processing For uniformity of processing all images were resized with bicubic interpolation so that the distance from the center of the macula to the temporal disc edge was 490 pixels These images were smaller than the originals but still contained detail information that was more than adequate for our methods This disc to macula distance anatomically 3000 microns is a more reliable constant than the disc diameter DD often used as a clinical reference scale We also found this approach more reliable than resizing based on camera magnifications We worked completely within commercially available software Photoshop 5 5 Adobe Systems Inc San Jose CA on a desktop PC The regions studied were the central 1000 micron diameter circular subfield and the 3000 micron outer diameter annular subfield with 1000 micron inner diameter centered on the fovea the 1500 micron diameter anatomical center of the macula These are the central and middle subfields defined by the Wisconsin grading template 2 The outer 6000 micron subfield of the Wisconsin system was not used in this study We next corrected the large scale variation in brightness found in most fundus photographs The non uniform illumination is a result of the acquisition step in the fundus photograph and is not intrinsic to retinal reflectance The correction process known as shading correction was carried out independently on each color channel and the results combined as the red green and blue channels of a new image Specifically each channel was copied blurred Gaussian blur 450 m radius and then subtracted from the original with constant offset values 195 for red 125 for green and 75 for blue This is distinct from a difference of Gaussian operation that requires a much smaller kernel size for the Gaussian filter This new average color was chosen to be a typical arbitrary extra foveal background color so that the result was a color balanced shading corrected fundus picture recognizable to the human eye We called this the standardized image While the offsets are mathematically arbitrary and do not affect a study of image variation numerically we found that human recognition of fundus features was essential Further optimization of visual recognition of fundus features could be achieved by contrast enhancement in Photoshop see below The resulting standardized images had the property that relative variation in brightness on a small scale was preserved with respect to the originals Large scale photographic variation as a source of bias had been removed and the mean background colors of these images were nearly identical Each standardized image was also stored with contrast enhanced versions Photoshop Autolevels and Autocontrast for ease of visual recognition of drusen We found as have others 17 18 that drusen had greater contrast in the green channel than in the other channels or other combinations of channels All further analysis and drusen segmentation were hence carried out on the green channel of the standardized image with the full color contrast enhanced versions used for subjective comparison Macular background leveling in images with drusen Step 1 Semi automated method luteal pigment correction A major factor in these centrally darker patterns is absorbance by luteal pigment We found in our mathematical modeling data not presented that fits to macular data were significantly improved when the region with evident luteal pigment was fit separately Hence if luteal pigment was evident as judged by the presence of a disc of characteristic yellowish coloration in the central macula or marked central background darkening consistent with that of luteal pigment this region was corrected first The corrections in this step were all multiplicative As an absorber luteal pigment will reduce the brightness of each underlying structure by a percentage We therefore constructed appropriate annular zones in the macula for percentage multiplicative increases in brightness to be empirically determined using published data on the spatial distribution of macular pigment 29 30 These observers found that the macular pigment density hence optical density is greatest centrally drops to half maximum within a diameter of 500 to 600 m reaches a quarter maximum at a diameter of about 1000 m and thence tapers slowly to a low constant level within a 2000 m diameter region We thus chose to bracket the 500 to 600 m half maximum range with a central disc of diameter 375 m and an annulus of diameter 700 m We chose the next annulus of 1000 m diameter to match the quarter maximum density range followed by a final annulus of 1250 m after which the effect of luteal pigment appeared to be essentially constant The correction percentages to be used in these regions were determined empirically by testing on images from several subjects with clinically apparent luteal pigment We looked at the green channel of these images standardized as in Methods III and applied tapering percentage brightenings to them in the regions chosen above We found that percentage increases in gray scale value of 3 5 2 5 1 5 and 1 0 percent applied over the inner disc and three outer annuli of diameters 375 700 1000 and 1250 m respectively provided essentially complete pattern corrections for some images partial corrections for some images but overcorrections pattern reversal in none We therefore chose to fix these percentages and regions as a conservative unlikely to overcorrect luteal pigment correction if luteal pigment was present The option to scale these percentages up or down in a given image was still available but we chose not to exercise this option in the present study The resulting correction in any cross section through the center was thus a series of step functions which roughly approximated a Gaussian distribution A smoother approximation could have been achieved outside Photoshop but the visual results of the current scheme were smooth to human observation The first step in the semi automated method was therefore to apply the above correction to the green channel of the standardized image if luteal pigment was present We then proceeded directly to the next step interactive background leveling Step 2 Semi automated method interactive background leveling Each iteration in this step is an additive correction as will be described This step was applied to the entire macular area including the central luteal area Hence if the multiplicative Step 1 did not entirely level the background centrally the leveling was completed additively in Step 2 Since we were dealing with photography not photometry the choice of multiplicative or additive correction attempted to preserve semi quantitative relationships of reflectance rather than absolute levels or precise numerical relationships 31 Further since reflectance variability was at issue rather than absolute levels we considered only the most variable components the macular luteal pigment dealt with above the nerve fiber layer 32 33 34 35 and the RPE melanin 36 The RPE melanin is denser in the fovea and as such will reduce the reflectance of underlying drusen in much the same manner as the luteal pigment However the change in density from central to eccentric locations is not nearly so marked as that of the luteal pigment and we did not include any further correction for this absorber In the case of the retinal nerve fiber layer RNFL we relied on the quantitative measurements of its spectral reflectance by Knighton 32 The highest spectral reflectance is for blue light 460 nm dropping off to perhaps 2 3 of this for green 510 nm The reflectance spectrum has essentially the same shape at varying points along an arcuate nerve fiber bundle but decreases almost linearly in magnitude with distance from the disc The authors noted that this parallels the decline in thickness seen histologically 33 34 35 and hypothesized that the reflectance spectrum of the RNFL is proportional to its thickness This hypothesis applied to the macular area implies that RNFL reflectance will be minimum centrally and will increase with its thickness to the arcades which agrees with clinical observation and with our measurements of normal macular reflectance patterns 26 Also since the RNFL is transparent with transmission on the order of 99 for visible light 31 its reflectance essentially adds to the apparent reflectance of underlying structures This holds because if r N and r S are the reflectances of the RNFL and the subjacent structures respectively and t N is the transmission of the RNFL then the net reflectance of the retina both layers combined will be r R t N 2r S r N In this case t N is nearly unity hence RNFL reflectance is additive to underlying structures such as drusen For this reason an additive correction was chosen to complete the background leveling The interactive steps in the additive correction proceed as follows The user is presented with a pseudo color topographic map which highlights those areas in the image whose background lies between the foveal minimum and the higher levels toward the arcades In Figure 1 the green channel is presented in gray scale The color green is the pseudo color representing those pixels whose value is within a given range of the foveal minimum i e the lowest background sources The user then draws on a graphic tablet Intuos Wacom Corp Vancouver WA an ellipse chosen to be just large enough to enclose the background of the given pseudo color Fig 1A magenta ellipse surrounding the green areas of low background Non background dark sources e g pigment retinal vessels are ignored The gray scale value of each pixel in the selected region background drusen and all else within the ellipse is then raised two units and the process repeated Fig 1B 1C Since each step is deliberately chosen to be only a partial correction several iterations are performed on the resulting image until there are no more background sources below this threshold This partial correction per step was chosen as a reasonable way to force a smoother result since each iteration uses a new set of ovals with boundary discontinuities limited to two units In our experience these are indiscernible in the final result A higher range of background is then tested and again the background areas beneath this minimum are step wise increased The process terminates when all background has been increased to the higher levels at the arcades which are the highest macular background levels 26 Step 3 Semi automated method choice of threshold After background leveling the optimum threshold level for drusen segmentation in the selected subfield is chosen by flicker comparison with the contrast enhanced image as follows For a given threshold the drusen image is segmented such that pixels with brightness intensities above the threshold are colored green to label as drusen and the rest darkened Each such drusen image is superimposed on the contrast enhanced image The optimized threshold is selected by visually inspecting the correspondence of the boundaries of the segmented drusen objects to those of the contrast enhanced objects The threshold is then adjusted so that this visual fit is optimum in the aggregate as judged by the user The total drusen area as a percentage of the selected subfield is then read directly Photoshop Histogram Method reproducibility and validation Drusen area in each of the 12 digital images was measured in both the central and middle subfields by two independent graders RTS and JKC using the semi automated method Means and standard deviations were calculated The first grader RTS also regraded the images in random order several weeks later and the means and standard deviations of his gradings were calculated An experienced retinal specialist Grader 1 CCWK graded the corresponding 12 stereo slide pairs independently estimating drusen areas as a percent of the central and middle subfields in categories of 0 to 10 10 to 25 25 to 50 and greater than 50 as specified by the International Classification System 1 This method of stereo pair grading is known to and accepted by clinicians as the gold standard for quantification of macular pathology Another experienced retinal specialist Grader 2 IB also graded the corresponding 12 stereo slide pairs independently but was asked to further refine her gold standard estimates of drusen areas as a percent of the central and middle subfields to the closest 5 For example if she first estimated drusen area to fall between 10 and 25 then she was asked to assign an estimate of 10 15 20 or 25 For areas less than 10 an attempt was made to grade to the nearest 1 Results and Discussion As proof of principle we first demonstrated that the interactive procedure was effective in eliminating the concentric shading pattern in both a normal image Figure 2A 2B 2C 2D and a drusen containing image Figure 2E 2F 2G 2H Line scans through the centers of these images Figure 2C 2D 2G 2H show the leveling of the central valleys in reflectance present in the originals Since the technique raised the brightness of associated drusen along with the background it provided a closer approximation to the underlying or true reflectance of the drusen It was then possible to apply uniform thresholds in the central and middle subfields to define drusen boundaries Figure 2A 2B 2C and to create a binary image Figure 3D for further morphometric analysis Another application of this method to a drusen image is seen in Fig 4 The first frame is the standardized color image which then was contrast enhanced in Photoshop for ease of drusen visualization middle frame The last frame is the final drusen segmentation after leveling the macular background As in Fig 3 minor errors are present but no significant bias between quadrants or between central and middle subfields is observed We found similar scattered errors in all images tested but overall good qualitative agreement with the human graders Testing of the digital method showed good inter observer reproducibility in two independent measurements of 24 subfields two subfields each from 12 images The means of the two measurements had standard deviations ranging from 0 2 to 21 4 Despite the large outlier these standard deviations were less than 5 in 20 of 24 cases and the median was 1 9 This reproducibility compared favorably with that of standard methods 8 There was one large deviation in the central subfield of Patient 6 see Bar graph Fig 5B In this case the photograph was of borderline quality due to cataract and a large pale area within the central subfield was digitally segmented as drusen by one observer JKC and left out by the other observer RTS The clinical graders were also divided in their opinions as to whether this lesion was a druse or retinal pigment epithelium RPE hypopigmentation Intra observer reproducibility of the digital method was tested by means of two temporally separated measurements by one observer The mean measurements had a median standard deviation of 1 8 range 0 to 4 4 These standard deviations were less than 5 in 22 of 24 cases Overall agreement was slightly better than for the inter observer measurements but not in every case On review intra observer disagreements appeared to be more due to the subjective choice of threshold for final segmentation rather than to disparities in the final background leveled image to which the threshold was applied For method validation we then compared the results of the semi automated digital method 24 fields from 12 slides with the clinically accepted gold standard of expert stereo gradings of the same 24 fields from the 12 corresponding stereo pairs of slides Comparison of the mean digital area measurements to the categories obtained by stereo Grader 1 who used the International Classification showed 92 agreement 22 24 digital measurements fell into the range in the International Classification chosen by Grader 1 The two disagreements were both in the middle subfield digital measurement 41 Grader 1 category greater than 50 digital 7 3 Grader I 10 to 25 The mean digital area measurements were then compared to the more precise estimates of stereo Grader 2 Bar graphs Fig 5and see Table 1 xls The 95 limits of agreement 37 between the mean digital area measurements and this second set of stereo gradings were 6 4 to 6 8 in the central subfield and 6 0 to 4 5 in the middle subfield The mean absolute differences between the digital and stereo gradings were 2 8 3 4 in the central subfield and 2 2 2 7 in the middle subfield Comparison with stereo grader 2 thus showed excellent agreement overall with better agreement in the middle subfield 3000 micron diameter annulus than in the central subfield 1000 micron diameter circle as evidenced by the smaller absolute differences The reason was that inclusion or exclusion of any single lesion in the smaller region had a proportionally larger effect on the measurement With the exception of one measurement in the central subfield Patient 11 the mean digital measurements were all within 5 of those of stereo Grader 2 see Bar graph Fig 5C The measurements were often closer for those images with scanty drusen 10 in which Grader 2 made estimates to within 1 but these findings were not statistically significant The above examples with larger errors illustrate the important point that both our method and the current standard of manual stereo grading are subjective and occasional large disagreements may occur with either method In our method the subjective steps include whether or not to make a luteal pigment correction the exact placement of the ovals at each step of the interactive procedure and the final choice of threshold for segmentation in each subfield The manual stereo grading method is entirely subjective Furthermore while our procedure is logically based on a semi quantitative geometric study of macular reflectance 26 there are photographic nonlinearities in each step that are incorporated only qualitatively Hence the procedure itself can be evaluated quantitatively only as to the validity of its outcome in comparison to the subjective current standard of stereo slide viewing at a light box A limitation of the present method is that introduction of substantial other pathologies besides drusen might confound our techniques whereas a trained human observer makes such distinctions quickly For example areas of RPE hypopigmentation or frank geographic atrophy with higher reflectance in the green channel could be included in the drusen threshold These would have to be removed manually or by additional software relying on other features Image quality can also make the differentiation of drusen and RPE abnormalities difficult by any method Another source of variability not encountered in this study of Caucasians could include racial pigmentation However we had found that the macular reflectance patterns in standardized images from normal subjects from other races were the same as those of Caucasians 26 Hence no new difficulty would be anticipated in drusen segmentation in these populations Other sources of possible error in the automated method are as follows the leveling of the macular background is an approximation that may make a given section too bright or too dim by a few units of gray scale Drusen in such an area would be over or under represented accordingly Likewise variation in the placement of the ovals in the interactive steps would lead to local irregular variability in the final leveled image This latter error however tended not to be cumulative since the iterative process is to some extent self correcting That is if a dark region of pixels were missed by one oval for brightening they would still be too dark in the next iteration and should be picked up there Hence errors of this kind in the final result tend to be limited to that of a single iteration two gray scale units In practice a errors of opposing signs in different sections will tend to cancel out around the mean error and b the mean error will tend towards zero when the optimum threshold is chosen by the user to give the best subjective segmentation overall i e if the image on average is too bright the user will tend to use a higher threshold This probably explains why our semi automated results give close agreement in total area to the gold standard estimates However there may still be sections of an image in which the semi automated segmentation is incorrect by wider margins This means that if it is important to have the greatest precision in a particular subregion other than the standard subfields a specific threshold for this region should be chosen separately As noted above however we did not find any systematic errors of segmentation with respect to quadrants or subregions The luteal pigment correction which was determined empirically could similarly affect central macular drusen segmentation Luteal pigment density of course varies in density and distribution between individuals especially in AMD and in this study we allowed only two options apply the fixed correction in a given image or not As noted in the Methods we used data on several normal subjects to aim deliberately for under correction in this step hence maintaining reflectance pattern concentricity Further corrections could then be applied in the next steps iterative background leveling As it happened in this study both observers thought that luteal pigment was present and thus applied the fixed correction in every case As noted in the Methods however this correction is scalable By the same reasoning as above if it were desired to have the most precise segmentation of central macular drusen the luteal correction scale could be optimized Ideally direct measurement of luteal pigment density by an independent method could have been incorporated We did not pursue this here since central subfield segmentation appeared adequate The utility of a method is also a function of the human effort i e time required to evaluate a given image The semi automated method required after training about ten minutes of observer time negligible computer time per slide to complete drusen segmentation Manual placement of ellipses followed by subjective decisions regarding final threshold choice was the most time consuming We estimated that full automation of the background leveling steps associated with ellipse placements etc would reduce operator time to about five minutes in total Grader 2 required approximately ten minutes for the more precise gradings in two fields Grader 1 highly experienced needed about five minutes to grade by the International Classification System Conclusions Quantification of drusen is essential to the study of age related macular degeneration Current techniques are relatively imprecise subjective and labor intensive By applying our findings with respect to macular reflectance patterns we have developed a reproducible validated semi automated method for leveling the macular background and segmenting drusen by a uniform threshold At the present level of automation this method can give drusen measurements at a higher level of precision 5 than the widely used International Classification System with a tradeoff of longer operator time until background leveling can be fully automated The choice of a final threshold is still subjective but its global application enforces some degree of objectivity as well Treating the macular background as a whole is a significant conceptual advance over previous methods which rely on multiple local thresholds Differentiation of drusen from RPE hypopigmentation however is still a limitation for both our method and previous methods in dealing with more complex images The main practical advantage to our technique is that in leveling the macular background the same correction is smoothly and simultaneously applied to the drusen embedded within the image with the dimmer central ones being brightened or enhanced There is still intrinsic variability in terms of the true reflectance of drusen but the variability in background reflectance is largely eliminated The result is increased precision and
