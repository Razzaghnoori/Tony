 Talking Points for the Times To New York Times Editorial Board Re Your Coming Anti Workfare Editorials The Times has just concluded a four part front page series slamming New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani s workfare policies e g EVIDENCE IS SCANT THAT WORKFARE LEADS TO FULL TIME JOBS Even now presses are stamping out the capper the first of what will probably be many righteous editorials denouncing the program It happens that workfare is an old hobbyhorse of Chatterbox s Chatterbox thinks it s the key to successful welfare reform which is the key to solving America s most pressing social problem the problem of ghetto poverty And aside from Milwaukee New York is the first big city to give workfare a try If it can make it there One point your series made seems indisputable If what Rachel Swarns reported is true Giuliani simply doesn t have an adequate day care system in place yet He ll have to do better As for the rest of the series let s stick with the major conceptual problems Misconception 1 It s the Overriding Goal of Workfare to Move People into Private Jobs Politicians like to say the purpose of welfare reform is to move people from welfare to work That s certainly a goal But it s not true that unless welfare reform takes all the people on welfare and gets them private sector jobs it s failed The overall goal of reform as President Clinton said in a neolib moment is to break the culture of poverty and dependence It s a culture that traps the poor in isolated fatherless ghettos It s also a culture that hurts the larger society not just those on welfare by producing crime destroying urban life fanning racial tension etc To change that culture you don t have to get every unmarried welfare mom into a job The idea is to establish the principle that every family has to send somebody into the workforce Enforce that principle and some of those on welfare will go to work Other mothers may choose to live with breadwinners and spend time with their children Other women not on welfare and this is the big payoff may decide not to become single mothers at all postponing childbirth until marriage Eventually communities of fatherless welfare families will become communities of intact working families That s the idea anyway Even if you think the point of welfare reform is to get everyone into a private job that s not the immediate goal of workfare Workfare is usually only one part of the larger welfare reform plan Most plans attempt to divert those who apply for welfare into private jobs They require those who do apply to search for work Only those who fail to find private sector jobs are then offered workfare jobs so they can earn their benefits Workfare in effect is the employer of last resort A fine old liberal notion It s crazy to expect the people who wind up in these last resort workfare jobs about 17 000 out of 236 000 adults on welfare in New York City to be the ones who will fly out the door into the private sector Misconception 2 We should worry because only a third of those who leave welfare quickly turn up on the tax rolls as workers The Times has made a big fuss about a New York state survey showing that of the legions of people who came off the welfare rolls in New York City from July 1996 through March 1997 only 29 percent found full time or part time jobs in the first full quarter after they left welfare Yes we want to know how many more people are working thanks to welfare reform But the people welfare reform will push most successfully into the private sector are those who now never show up at the welfare office in the first place because they realize they ll do better just getting a job The survey completely misses this group For those who do go on welfare the survey only counts those who then work for private sector employers who report them to the state for tax purposes It doesn t count self employed laborers domestic workers and others if they don t report their income It doesn t count those whose employers don t fill out the required forms Many employers who do file their forms do it late Experience with earlier groups of welfare leavers shows that the 29 percent figure will rise about 10 more percentage points to about 40 percent when these late filers eventually comply Finally just because someone doesn t get a job the first quarter doesn t mean they never will A study of Maryland s reform discovered that 36 percent of those leaving welfare had earnings in the quarter they left but 75 percent had earnings within 2 5 years Even if a single mother leaves the rolls and doesn t get a job remember that doesn t mean reform has failed She might have moved in with a man even gotten married She might be getting help from friends If former recipients were showing up in shelters or on the streets it would be bad news but that doesn t seem to be happening Misconception 3 Workfare workers shouldn t do work unionized city workers used to do At times your reporters object that workfarers do menial unskilled dead end work At other times they complain that workfarers have taken good desirable union jobs away from others Which is it It can t be both The truth is that the more the mayor asks workfarers to do useful work like street cleaning the more they will probably be doing work regular city workers once did So Is the work low paid Sure If workfare is going to be the employer of last resort it can t pay good union wages or else half the city will go on welfare to get a workfare job Nor did the Times show that any regular workers were laid off or fired to make way for cheaper workfarers Chatterbox will go for now Give em hell
