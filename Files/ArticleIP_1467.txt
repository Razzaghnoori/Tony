an explicit apology 2 Clinton s insurers State Farm and Chubb are ending their coverage of his legal bills and liabilities This ends the plausibility of a monetary settlement because henceforth Clinton will have to pay out of his own pocket something his lawyer says he won t do Pundits look forward to embarrassing depositions 9 10 Sunbeam chairman Chainsaw Al Dunlap sued the American Medical
