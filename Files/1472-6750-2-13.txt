 Background Bridging or jumping PCR BPCR can convert DNA backbone interruptions anywhere in the region of shared sequence between primer binding sites into a single and unique amplified band 1 The logic of BPCR is illustrated in Figure 1 In principle BPCR can detect backbone interruptions anywhere within a chosen sequence region This manuscript reports a study in which BPCR is used to detect a minority of interrupted molecules in the lac operon of Escherichia coli and describes a system to measure noise in BPCR Results Signal and noise in bridging PCR Bridging PCR BPCR is a combination of two processes a recombination between two template sequences and an amplification of the recombinant template Two parental sequences share a homologous region a region in which the sequence is identical and diverge in the nonhomologous flanking sequences One side of the nonhomologous flanking sequence of each of the two parental molecules contains a different PCR primer binding site Neither parental template has both primer binding sites Therefore a chain reaction cannot occur and only linear amplification is expected However during the course of cycling recombination can occur between the homologous regions via a copy choice mechanism illustrated in Figure 1 A 3 end of one template sequence if it is within the homologous region can anneal to the other template During the next extension cycle the invading strand will grow from its 3 end and newly synthesized DNA will cross the region of sequence similarity and continue into sequences unique to the second template including the second template s primer binding site The result is a recombinant sequence identical to the product of in vivo homologous recombination with one flank from the original strand and the other flank from the second template Because the two primer sites are now in cis the recombinant sequence can be amplified exponentially If the 3 end of either template is not within the region of similar sequence then no 3 end will hybridize to the other template and synthesis does not lead to recombination The creation of recombinant sequences during PCR reflects the presence of templates whose 3 ends are within the region of sequence similarity BPCR ought to be utilizable to assay the proportion of input templates with 3 ends in the region of sequence similarity However the reaction itself can produce 3 ends which then lead to recombinant templates For maximum sensitivity and S N ratio the PCR reaction itself should not produce ends at any sites that did not exist in the input DNA PCR itself generates new 3 ends 2 3 In BPCR new ends yield recombinant products even if the initial template was completely intact BPCR between plasmid pBS and Phagescript Figure 2shows the map and sequence of templates and primer sites used in BPCR between a portion of plasmid pBS and Phagescript a derivative of the ssDNA M13 phage This pair of substrates meets the requirement for BPCR substrates because the region of shared sequence the lac operator and the lac operon are flanked by sequences that are different between the two vectors The lac operon is one of the most frequently used genes for the study of in vivo mutagenesis 4 5 6 7 Determination of signal to noise S N Two samples with known quantities of templates were prepared one sample contained the pBS sequence template with a cut in the homologous region created by Pvu II digestion cut template and the intact ssDNA Phagescript DNA reference template In the other sample both the pBS intact template and the Phagescript DNA reference template were intact The molar ratio of reference template ssDNA to either intact template dsDNA or to cut template dsDNA considering only one of the two fragments was about 10 The concentration of pBS sequence template either cut or intact was adjusted to be about 0 1 nM and to be equal in the two samples The equality was confirmed by a 20 thermal cycle conventional PCR with primers b1 and M13 revI The PCR outputs from serial dilutions 10 fold dilution between each step were similar between the two samples data not shown Each of the two samples was serially diluted into BPCR reactions the dilution involving only the cut and intact template with everything else unchanged The highest concentration of template was about 10 14molecules l Typically dilution steps were 10 fold each and covered a million fold range The PCRs were run in parallel same concentrations same volume and running on the same thermal block at the same time After the BPCR output of recombinant DNA was assayed by electrophoresis For each dilution one can obtain the concentration of output R as a function of Ts the concentration of template cut or intact depending on the sample For each sample one defines Ts off as a cut off concentration below which R is no longer saturated The signal to noise is the ratio between Ts off in the two samples For example if the cut off concentration of the cut sample is 100 times less than the intact cut off concentration then the S N is 100 Pre annealing and pre extension A pre annealing and pre extension regime improved the S N In this regime templates in the reaction tube with 1 PCR buffer and dNTP s were heated to 90 C for 10 minutes then gradually cooled by approximately 1 C minute to 72 C Pre extension was carried out by holding the temperature at 72 C and adding polymerase to the pre annealing tube The temperature was held at 72 C for three more minutes before it was dropped to room temperature The rationale for pre extension 8 was that cut template molecules that are annealed to reference molecules should be extended by the polymerase to become full length There are no primers present in the pre extension cycle and therefore this cycle does not generate the class of noise due to incomplete extension from normal primers Immediately following pre extension i e without storage at 4 C the samples were serially diluted and PCR amplified with the BPCR primers BPCR with Taq polymerase yielded S N of approximately 10 Templates were prepared by 25 cycles of conventional PCR with Taq polymerase 9 using primer b1 and Jp on template plasmid pBS Phagescript phage particles rather than purified DNA prepared from the particles by phenol extraction were used as the reference template 10 The BPCR primer pair was b1 and M13 pI see figure 2for primer locations which would give a 1261 bp recombination product The S N of BPCR with Taq polymerase was approximately 10 see figure 3 lanes 1 5 This result is consistent with the report that Taq polymerase s nuclease activity 2 11 cuts in the lac operator 3 The lac operator cut site is within the homologous region in this system BPCR was conducted for 30 cycles with Taq polymerase Several variations of BPCR with Taq polymerase were carried out data not shown including 1 cut and intact templates were prepared with primers b1 and b2 2 purified ssDNA instead of phage particles was used as a reference template and 3 cut and intact templates were prepared with the Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase The S N was about 10 in these variations Increase in the number of PCR cycles and or a longer extension time 5 minutes were also tested and found to be not acceptable because non specific output in the form of multiple gel bands or smearing gel lanes frequently appeared Combining Taq polymerase with a small quantity of Pfu polymerase 12 had little effect on the S N Additives that improved Taq polymerase S N to approximately 100 Some additives were found to enhance the S N ratio Among the additives tested gp32 protein 13 or NH 4 2 SO 4 improved the S N most efficiently and the S N reached 100 See figure 3 Compare cut vs intact rows in lanes 6 10 and 11 15 Combining gp32 and NH 4 2 SO 4 did not further improve S N See figure 3 Compare cut vs intact rows in lanes 16 20 The Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase gave a S N of approximately 100 The Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase is a truncated portion of the enzyme which retains polymerase activity but lacks the 5 3 exonuclease activity of Taq polymerase 14 The Stoffel fragment does not cut at the lac operator as does Taq polymerase 3 It might therefore be a good choice of polymerase for jumping PCR Consistent with the expectation results of using the Stoffel fragment without additives such as gp32 NH 4 2 SO 4 or detergent gave a S N of 100 See figure 4 compare intact lanes 3 4 5 6 to cut lanes 7 8 9 10 Addition of any of the above additives did not further improve the S N The source templates used were also prepared by standard PCR with the Stoffel fragment and the primer pair b1 and Jp on pBS see figure 2 BPCR primers b1 and M13 pV produced the expected 328 bp recombinant sequence In this size range the Stoffel fragment of Taq polymerase yielded a better S N than Taq polymerase However the Stoffel fragment had low output in BPCR between primers b1 and M13 pI This is consistent with the manufacturer s description that the Stoffel fragment is not optimal for the amplification of sequences longer than 1 kb Vent polymerase lacking nuclease activity 15 is also expected to give a low noise level However it yielded insufficient output data not shown Discussion Sources of noise in BPCR PCR itself creates DNA damage and aberrant molecules Taq polymerase harbors nuclease activities 2 3 Sites of stem loop structure are particularly vulnerable to both degradation and to polymerase stalling 25 26 27 both of which generate noise in BPCR Gp32 an additive that increased S N for Taq is a single stranded binding protein that reduces the stem loop structures 13 associated with both cleavage and stalling by polymerases 25 2 3 11 28 Templates are damaged by thermal cycling 29 even in the absence of enzyme The buffer for Taq polymerase including NH 4 2 SO 2 and for the Stoffel fragment had a low KCl concentration 10 mM Since the stem loop structure of the template is less likely to form at low KCl this low concentration could also contribute to the increase of S N Because the Taq and Stoffel polymerase both reached the same optimum S N of 100 it seems most likely that template damage via heating cooling cycles as found by Gustafson et al 29 is limiting S N in this system Applications and limitations of bridging PCR as an assay for DNA damage It is a basic aspect of materials science in any system to study discontinuities This is especially the case in materials that store information Several methods are available to assay discontinuities in DNA and for many applications one of the several current methods may suffice 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 DNA backbone interruptions are key intermediates in genetic metabolism 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 Chemotherapy 44 ionizing radiation 45 and dietary mutagens 46 also cause distributed DNA strand interruptions 47 Chemical modifications 48 49 50 51 need not break the DNA backbone to impede the progress of DNA polymerase Other modifications can be converted into backbone interruptions For example it has been proposed that alkali sensitive ribonucleotides in DNA are a source of mutations 10 It is likely that the presently attained S N of 100 for BPCR is barely adequate for in vivo studies Further improvement of the S N by another factor of 10 or 100 would give greater assurance Even with the achieved S N of 100 we are faced with a dilemma because of the lack of other techniques that can detect a defect in less than 1 of the input DNA over a long region 328 bp in this study Background breaks at any site in the region contribute to noise therefore the background breakage at any given site is apparently less than one in 30 000 Conclusions Break copy recombination 52 53 almost inevitably occurs during PCR it has been called variously bridging PCR jumping PCR recombinogenic PCR PCR sewing gene shuffling and sexual PCR Sometimes this process is a bug in the system leading to artifacts sometimes it is a feature leading to diverse libraries of products Bridging PCR is to a certain extent ca 3 kb found in this work unavoidable in PCR With a proper configuration of markers BPCR can be used as a sensitive method for detecting discontinuities in DNA In another context fidelity of bridging synthesis is important for computing with DNA For assay and computing applications it is necessary to consider noise in BPCR In this work BPCR was studied over a 328 base segment of the lac operon and the noise level was measured as approximately 10 when no special precautions were taken with Taq polymerase With buffer modifications or the addition of T4 gp32 the S N of Taq was improved to 1 The Stoffel fragment yielded a S N of 1 without modifications of the standard protocol but was not further improved by buffer modifications or gp32 In this system with normal PCR using Taq polymerase the level of bridging that occured was ca 30 per kilobase of amplifed sequence It must be cautioned that our results have been obtained in only one system with respect to the test sequence and the primers Differences of the sequence and of reaction conditions are expected to alter the proportion of bridging that occurs in any particular system With respect to sequence it is anticipated that regions of potential secondary structure or other sites that are targets for the nuclease activity of Taq may become hotspots for crossing over during PCR Materials and Methods The sources of materials used in this study Phagescript and pBS plasmid were from Stratagene Taq polymerase and
