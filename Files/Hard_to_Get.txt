 Justice is Hard to Get When You Can t Afford a Lawyer F Dianne Taylor COMMENTARY F Dianne Taylor is executive director of Legal Services of Eastern Missouri We re all familiar with the Miranda warning or at least how it sounds in the movies It includes the statement You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning If you cannot afford a lawyer one will be provided for you at government expense The Miranda warning though applies only to criminal cases What about the less theatrical but equally troubling civil problems that can afflict people in any walk of life U S Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has estimated that four out of every five low income people in America who need legal representation don t receive it That is a sobering observation to realize that 80 percent of those who need legal help are denied such guidance and counsel Who are these people They may be victims of domestic abuse Perhaps they are elderly people who are swindled out of their life savings or beaten by a neighbor or acquaintance Maybe they are homeless children who can t attend school because they aren t officially residents of a district They are our neighbors our friends our colleagues Facing eviction or physical assault or bankruptcy without legal assistance can be every bit as frightening as standing trial on a criminal charge Issues in civil cases include family matters housing and employment cases consumer protection public benefits and income maintenance In the year 2000 alone Legal Services of Eastern Missouri fielded some 30 000 calls for assistance from low income people in the 21 counties our not for profit organization represents By contrast approximately 6 500 cases were closed by the organization last year More than 312 000 people in the eastern Missouri counties stretching from the Iowa border to Jefferson County qualify for legal aid an increase of more than 10 percent from 1990 With the increase in unemployment and the gradual decline of the nation s economy still more are likely to be unable to afford the legal help they need Legal Services of Eastern Missouri does receive the valuable volunteer assistance of more than 1 500 attorneys It employs a full time staff of about 75 lawyers paralegals intake specialists social workers and others And a number of programs now offer legal assistance for specific problems Legal Services Lasting Solutions Project provides a holistic approach to the many issues that affect families experiencing domestic violence Its MC Project helps people who are enrolled in the Medicaid Managed Care program but have been unable to access the health care to which they are entitled Through the Homeless Project volunteer lawyers visit homeless shelters and outreach clinics The AIDS Project provides legal assistance for people living with HIV or AIDS And the Immigration Law Project assists people at proceedings on naturalization temporary protective status family reunification and deportation and exclusion hearings As effective as these programs are much remains to be done Increased financial assistance from federal state and local sources could increase the number of legal professional we could hire Of course voluntary support from more members of the legal community would bring invaluable expertise and guidance as well Civil cases may not be fodder for a hot new movie They are cold hard reality though and every case closed successfully marks a victory not just for the client but for our entire community In that way with liberty and justice for all can be a way of life as well as a doctrine
