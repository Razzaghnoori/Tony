 Trouble in Paradise Division runs like a seam through the biography of the Nobel Prize winning Caribbean born poet Derek Walcott his task has been to make it more boon than burden He and his twin brother Roderick were born in 1930 in St Lucia a small link in the Antilles island chain then part of the British West Indies Walcott s was a British education The paucity of books in his native St Lucia led paradoxically to an excellent literary education grounded in the heavily accented rhythms of Shakespeare the Anglican hymnal and the King James Bible Even as he pursued a college education Walcott absorbed the parallel oral culture of the Caribbean particularly audible in his plays some of which adopt his native Creole dialect His early poems register both geographical distances and the divisions within himself In Crusoe s Island 1965 he is both Robinson Crusoe and Friday s progeny The brood of Crusoe s slave His more recent poetry especially the epic Omeros of 1990 wavers between an exile s nostalgia and a cosmopolitan s at homeness in the world The title of The Bounty Walcott s first book of poems since Omeros is a tangle of associations Walcott is first of all acknowledging his 1992 Nobel Prize in literature which quoting the Irish Nobel Laureate W B Yeats he calls the bounty of Sweden The prize paid for Walcott s retreat on St Lucia this house facing white combers that stands for hot rutted lanes far from the disease of power Second Walcott is playing off the celluloid The Bounty of Fletcher Christian and the white God Captain Bligh which rhymes in his mind with the ebb and flow of Caribbean tyranny and freedom The ribbed body with its cargo stalls in its doldrums the God captain is cast adrift by a mutinous Christian Finally a major theme of this slim book there is the recurring light of each Antillean day Bounty In the bells of tree frogs with their steady clamour in the indigo dark before dawn the fading morse of fireflies and crickets then light on the beetle s armour Despite its upbeat title The Bounty is a book of elegies a response to the many deaths nothing short of a massacre including the deaths of his mother and his close friend the poet Joseph Brodsky that Walcott has endured during his seventh decade As he improvises on themes from the Western elegiac tradition in which spring consoles for the losses of winter Walcott finds that certain notes don t sound in the tropics where there is no climate no calendar except for this bountiful day And he is surprised as elegists always are that earth rejoices in the middle of our agony If Omeros like its Homeric model was a poem about fathers The Bounty is Walcott s mother book an attempt to draw the veiled figure of Mamma entering the standard elegiac The seven part title poem is both an elegy for her and a poem about her island Walcott s mother country Its opening lines attempt to pry the beauty of the Antilles loose from advertising brochures that false paradise in which as Walcott wrote in his Nobel lecture the Caribbean is a blue pool into which the republic dangles the extended foot of Florida Between the vision of the Tourist Board and the trueParadise lies the desert where Isaiah s elationsforce a rose from the sand The thirty third canto cores the dawn clouds with concentric radiance the breadfruit opens its palms in praise of the bounty bois pain tree of bread slave food the bliss of John Clare torn wandering Tom stoat stroker in his county In those seven lines freighted with the layered voice of European culture Dante s vision of paradise is invoked both explicitly in the concentric radiance of the last canto of his Paradiso and implicitly in his braided terza rima three line stanzas rhyming loosely here aba bcb etc That paradise is linked in turn with Isaiah s prophecy of the imminent appearance of God in the desert a promise confirmed in the Christian view by Jesus birth But Walcott also wants an outsider s view on this exalted material and he finds it in the 19 th century English peasant poet John Clare whom he makes into a stand in for himself Walcott twins Clare who was driven mad by social injustice and consoled by the smallest beings in nature with mad Tom Edgar s disguise in King Lear who like Clare wanders the English countryside praising frogs and gnats I am moved like you mad Tom by a line of ants I behold their industry and they are giants This couplet sends us back to an already famous passage in Omeros in which women loading coal are compared to a line of ants and so on In the rest of The Bounty Walcott relinquishes such allusive density for the simple history erasing realities of life in the Antilles islands the mango trees that serenely rust when they are in flower the firefly that keeps striking matches This culture nature split corresponds in Walcott s personal mythology with a split in himself his European education and Caribbean childhood his two homes in Boston and St Lucia the two races white and black of his ancestry and the two languages I know one so rich in its imperial intimacies its echo of privilege the other like the orange words of a hillside in drought but my love of both wide as the Atlantic is large There s a risk of sentimentality in Walcott s praise of the Caribbean A little pun in his Nobel lecture appears to gloss over and even celebrate the privations of underdevelopment In the Antilles poverty is poetry with a v une vie a condition of life as well as of imagination Easy for him to say with that Nobel bought bungalow And again Visual surprise is natural in the Caribbean it comes with the landscape and faced with its beauty the sigh of History dissolves Well maybe the sigh but not the fact of history as Walcott knows quite well Such remarks in any case are part of Walcott s own emerging self definition as a writer In recent years he has increasingly aligned himself not with British or American poetry but with a multilingual and multiracial Antillean literature that includes such writers as Jean Rhys Lafcadio Hearn Saint John Perse another Nobel winner V S Naipaul and C L R James These writers in Walcott s view have managed to see the islands as they are in all their visual surprise and not as some fragment or falling off from European achievements Walcott s faith as expressed in The Bounty is finally a painter s faith that the poet s job is to write of the light s bounty on familiar things Walcott trained to be a painter like his schoolteacher father who died when Walcott was a baby and The Bounty is his most painterly book in method and theme If The Bounty is low on autobiographical detail or the dailiness of this poet s life and travels it is rich in acts of looking Walcott s keen eye is drawn repeatedly to the complementary blues and oranges of his native landscape there against the indigo blue Santa Cruz mountains the immortelle ignites its branches with orange blossoms however briefly while the incredible blue is as indifferent as ever The Bounty is studded with the names of painters especially those with a link to the Caribbean Willows in Amsterdam bud like crowds in Pissarro along a wet boulevard s branches Manet in Martinique evokes ghosts of French culture inhabiting the island Pissarro though Walcott doesn t mention it was a native of the small Jewish community in St Thomas in the Virgin Islands while the 17 year old Manet traveled the Caribbean as a sailor in training One of the strongest poems in the book the that begins I cannot remember the name of that seacoast city evokes Monet as Walcott reconstitutes with the help of one of his own watercolors a dimly remembered stippled seascape in northern France Wistful wry at times valedictory the Monet poem playfully offers the poet s own epitaph The Bounty is one of Walcott s most inviting volumes incorporating some of his best work since The Star Apple Kingdom of 1979 In his pleasure in the sheer variousness of paradises found and lost Walcott glories in what the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins called dappled things
