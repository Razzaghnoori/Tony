 El Ni Perhaps every era gets the weather it deserves Drought and dust storms coincided with the Great Depression Earth s weather was unusually tranquil during the tranquil 50s unusually chaotic during the chaotic 70s So it s fitting that El Ni o should return this fall its third visit of the decade El Ni o is weather for the 90s weather for an age of conspiracy theories As anyone who s tuned in a weather forecast this month knows El Ni o the child as in the Christ child was so named by Peruvian fishermen who noticed the warming of the waters of the eastern Pacific around Christmastime This Christ child is a monster El Ni o officially known as El Ni o Southern Oscillation ENSO works like this Every three to eight years for some inexplicable reason the trade winds that usually blow west from South America to Australia subside As a result the warm waters of the western Pacific a pool the size of Canada drift east toward South America The result worldwide weather chaos El Ni o is part of a larger cycle Periodically the conditions that produce El Ni o act in reverse This produces La Ni a which causes different but equally freaky global weather conditions Congress and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are holding emergency hearings about the new El Ni o and the media are covering it obsessively There is good reason to worry The eastern Pacific has heated faster this year than at any time in recorded history El Ni o 97 promises to be the most brutal climatic event of the century surpassing even El Ni o 82 83 which killed thousands and caused 13 billion in damage El Ni o is the Trilateral Commission of earth science the Bilderberg Group of climatology It explains everything The difference between El Ni o and the Trilats El Ni o really does explain everything Hollywood s disaster movie villains Dante s Peak the twisters the Titanic iceberg are pikers next to El Ni o Here is a partial list of events that El Ni o can be blamed for at least partially the ongoing drought in Australia New Zealand Thailand Malaysia and Papua New Guinea forest fires in Indonesia famine in North Korea the appearance of hurricanes along the Pacific coast of the United States the disappearance of hurricanes along the Atlantic Coast of the United States a mild winter in the Northeast a harsh winter in the Southeast the failure of the fish harvest in South America El Ni o seems to determine the corn production of Zimbabwe the coffee production of Sumatra and the cocoa production of the Ivory Coast It appears to spark of encephalitis cholera hantavirus bubonic plague rattlesnake attacks and shark attacks It could even influence immigration patterns in the Southwestern United States How Most migration to the Southwest has occurred in the past 20 years a period of frequent El Ni os El Ni os bring lots of rain to the region and if they subside there may be too little water to sustain the Sun Belt El Ni o in fact is a conspiracy so immense that it even explains the other weather conspiracy namely the jet stream The warm moist El Ni o air causes the jet stream to split as it flows eastward over North America One arm dips south giving the Gulf Coast a wet winter The other stays in Canada The Northeast is thus spared the jet stream s Arctic blasts and enjoys a lovely winter Despite implicating El Ni o in all these varied weather crimes scientists know surprisingly little about it This year s El Ni o is the first major one to have been Before El Ni o was identified weather consisted of a series of little mysteries Why is there a thunderstorm Why a drought Those mysteries have been solved sort of but they have been supplanted by a much bigger one What is El Ni o Weather mavens don t understand why El Ni o begins They don t know why it is occurring more frequently It used to arrive every five to eight years recently it s been coming every three to five years Scientists are befuddled about its relationship if any to global warming Some say global warming is making El Ni o more severe others say El Ni o is making global warming more severe El Ni o is a darling of greenhouse skeptics because it shows how mighty Mother Nature is compared with man If El Ni o a natural phenomenon we don t understand and can t control can shift worldwide temperatures and rainfall dramatically we should hesitate before blaming our own carbon dioxide emissions for the world s ills There is one other reason why El Ni o is a fitting weather pattern for the age On balance it rewards America at the expense of the rest of the world In Africa Australia India and Southeast Asia El Ni o parches land devastates crops and causes famine About 300 000 people in Papua New Guinea are starving because of the 97 El Ni o In South America El Ni o destroys the fishing industry Peru s economy shrank 5 percent during the 82 83 El Ni o It s true that El Ni o afflicts the West and Gulf Coasts with nasty winters and that it decimates the salmon population But fewer hurricanes will strike the Atlantic coast this year fewer tornadoes will touch down in the Midwest and more rain will fall on the Southwest Mild winters in the North and East will save billions on heating bills Thanks to the northward migration of Pacific marlin California sport fishermen will have an annus mirabilis And as for the surfing it will be awesome
