 The Unfairway Increasingly I fear that golf has become auto racing What makes it so riveting are the crashes The psychological breakdowns The spasms of self destruction The carnage We saw that a year ago at the Masters Tournament with the Greg Norman debacle Norman had always dreamed of winning the Masters and something had always gone wrong This time Norman went into the final round with a lead so commanding six shots it seemed to be even Norman proof What ended up happening was that he merely raised the standard by which other blown tournaments will now be judged Watching Norman that day was sickening like seeing Swede Savage crash at Indy or Lawrence Taylor break Joe Theismann s leg I remember calling old friends that night people I hadn t spoken to in a long time In a world of pain people need friends Until this past weekend Norman was the No 1 golfer in the world according to the Sony rankings He s won more money on the PGA Tour than anyone else in history yet he will go down in history as a man of extraordinary misfortune not so much a failure as a fatality a victim of golf s surgical ability to bring to the surface a man s mental weakness I still root for Norman but I also think of him as a cadaver He looks a mite gaunt and has been prone to fits of rage lately He screamed at a volunteer at the Kemper Open for making a joke about President Clinton blowing out his knee at Norman s house At another point he misheard a fan s comment thought he was being heckled and gave the fan the finger Then at the U S Open Championship he played two rounds in 14 over par a repulsive performance Our hero Two weekends ago at the Kemper Mark Wiebe had the tournament pretty well wrapped up It was 11 years since he had won a tournament With a one shot lead Wiebe played the 17 th hole perfectly hitting safely over a pond to the fat part of the green He lagged his putt to within about two and a half feet He had a straight uphill putt for par He could make a thousand such putts in a row on a practice green But golf is about the torture of the weak Wiebe yanked his putt left and lipped it out His wheels had come off He d hit the wall There was nothing left but shards of metal and the wails of the doomed He was still tied for the lead but that didn t matter since the devastation of missing that putt ensured that on the 18 th facing an almost identically easy putt three feet straight uphill he didn t even catch any lip missed it wide left game over The world is a dark cruel place A few days later at the U S Open Wiebe had a five putt green something so awful you almost never hear of it five putts on a single green before the fucking ball went in the fucking hole How did golf become a sport of woe and misery It may be that the media spotlight is that much more intense and golfers know how many cameras are trained on their quivering hands Maybe it is the purses a missed putt now can cost a golfer a couple of hundred thousand dollars Or maybe it is that the competition is so stiff that no single player can dominate like Arnold Palmer or Jack Nicklaus or Tom Watson did in their heydays No one out there has a prayer of winning 20 major tournaments like did Many golfers win just one tournament in their entire career some minor Kmart Classic sort of thing and even the golfers who are good enough to win the majors tend to win only one or two The window of opportunity is small and they all fear having it slam shut on their fingers The antidote to the recent trend of golf tragedy has been Tiger Woods Coming into the U S Open he had never lost anything that mattered to him He d won six USGA championships in six years three junior titles and then three consecutive U S Amateurs He d won his first major as a pro the Masters in April and had done so with such record smashing brilliance that he d actually exceeded the hype that had been built up around him When he arrived for the U S Open it was as though Jackie Kennedy had showed up Let s go over there and get Tiger s divot I heard a fan say one day referring to the tiny chunk of grass and dirt that Woods had scraped from the fairway on one of his shots The U S Open is the sport s biggest event The British Open has a longer history and the Masters is more familiar it s played on the same course every year and some of us can recite the yardage from tee to green on the back nine but the U S Open has the strongest field the toughest conditions Everyone was buzzing about the rough the dreaded rough the heinous and monstrous rough 5 inches officially but sometimes looking more like a dozen ravenous insatiable rough a form of grass so severely impairing a golf swing that it was more like an animal Woods never got close to leading the tournament much less winning I followed him some on the first and last days and he was spectacular No one has as much club speed and when he strikes a ball it whistles rockets out into space on a line and then astonishingly rises as though hitting another gear some kind of warp drive before parachuting to Earth uncannily close to where Woods wants it to go His problem was that the U S Open particularly Congressional Country Club s blue course rewards conservative risk averse players The way to win is to shoot pars on the fairway on the green two putt for par go to the next hole Woods played conservatively rarely using his driver but for all his genius he s not the straightest golfer in the world and he ended up in the spinach isn t it fun to use sports clich s too often That he didn t putt well ensured that he wouldn t be a factor He finished tied for 19 th and then told the press that the suffering s over that the course had humbled me big time He was still a superstar in fact the Sony computer bumped him to No 1 past the fading Norman but you could imagine that he was on his way to becoming just a golfer And eventually a broken man The final day I was appalled that the only people leading the Open were plodders and mopers and grumpers and nobodies They were men without color literally wearing gray and beige and brown The final four of the day were tied at 4 under par going down the back nine and it was obvious watching them labor away unsmiling that this was just an endurance test to see who could avoid crashing and disintegrating on national television You had to root for perennial nice guy Tom Lehman who d led after three rounds of the Open for the third consecutive year I could not bring myself to root for Jeff Maggert as his name bothers me sounding too much like a taunt Maggert Maggert Also he d committed the sin of winning a pile of money on tour 3 6 million while winning only a single tournament Ernie Els alone among the final four had won an Open but was a vanilla man plain looking and apparently without any emotions whatsoever And finally there was Colin Montgomerie a multiple failure in major tournaments surely the best player in the world never to have won one of these things First Maggert destructed He got on a bogey run that wouldn t quit and he grimmed his way right out of the tournament Then Lehman hit into the rough by the 16 th green and lost a stroke The next hole the 17 th we all watched in gut wrenching horror as Lehman hit his approach shot into the pond Nice guys finish third Lehman said afterward I feel an incredible amount of pain Just before Lehman s disaster Montgomerie had made the crucial mistake of the tournament He and Els were on the 17 th green tied at 4 under Montgomerie had a five foot putt He waited for the group on the nearby 18 th green to finish He waited and waited Minutes passed Sometimes a person in life is faced with a crucial decision a life choice a yes or no question a moment when action must be taken decisively without pause or excessive contemplation Everyone watching thought Hit the putt Just walk up and hit it Montgomerie wandered around the green waiting for total silence Tommy Tolles a golfer finishing on 18 made some gestures as though he was going to throw his ball in the lake and the crowd cheered him on which got Montgomerie flustered again The man just did not want to hit the putt Because he knew it wasn t going in He knew he was about to crash Finally he walked up and almost half heartedly tapped at the putt which missed and he lost and when it was over he cried
