 Like Sands Through the Hourglass At the end of the day a Wall Street Journal editorial writer observed recently about campaign reform we remain skeptics less so of McCain Feingold than of its advocates professions of nonpartisanship At the end of the day the Financial Times noted a few weeks ago after the European Union voted once again to keep Turkey at arm s length it is a greater loss to Europe than it will ever be for Turkey At the end of the day a sportswriter for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel presciently pointed out in advance of professional football s 1998 championship game what the AFC primarily has going for it in the Super Bowl is the law of averages What is this day that everyone is referring to It is not so much a unit of time as a unit of consummation and it highlights in a way our larger confusion about what chronological time is and what measuring it is good for The planet s most accurate time is kept by an atomic clock maintained at the U S Naval Observatory in Washington D C The clock is so accurate that every so often the time must be adjusted by adding a leap second to account for the gradual if modest slowing of the Earth s rotation This last happened on June 30 1997 It will need to happen again sometime next year The idea that time s passage has an objective dimension connected with diurnal rhythms is of course increasingly quaint and may eventually become obsolete Isaac Asimov in his futuristic Foundation Trilogy novels imagined a thickly settled universe where the familiar 24 hour day is an accepted convention presumably based on the rotation of humanity s planet of origin but where no one remembers any longer what the original planet was In language too time seems to have got out of hand Temporal language often depicts the passage of time not merely as fast relentless and irrevocable but also more and more as conceptually slippery The term our times and its portentous relative our time as in one of the most important movies books recordings of our time are rhetorically vast but temporally indeterminate even as they become trivialized by overuse One Texas newspaper not long ago called Henry Cisneros the former secretary of Housing and Urban Development now under indictment the most skilled politician of our times Decent interval another modern standby is an interval whose length no mechanical or atomic clock can measure the only instrumentation that works is emotional The Wall Street Journal s G Paschal Zachary observed last September that America or at least American journalism was awash in defining moments you know the Gulf War the Rodney King beating the death of Diana At this point in time a legacy of Watergate seems to be unequivocally specific but of course the subtext is that time is fluid that circumstances change and that truth could be different a little later on By comparison at the end of the day with the sense of when all is said and done or eventually or in the fullness of time has a shapeliness and finality about it It has been waxing in popularity since the early 1970s The term s proximate origin remains obscure some analysts have suggested an association with the world of sport or finance where activities are indeed governed by an actual daily cycle and where a metaphoric sense could easily have arisen out of the literal one As listeners to the BBC World Service can attest the usage has become widespread in the English spoken throughout the British Commonwealth An Australian politician last December At the end of the day the Australian people will decide whether or not this country becomes a republic A Kenyan politician also last December At the end of the day the ethnic consideration will rule the day The Chicago Tribune columnist Eric Zorn has theorized that the utility of at the end of the day has been augmented by the various unresolved episodes lumped under the word Whitewater which call for an economical way of expressing the thought when things finally get straightened out Robert W Burchfield the longtime editor of the Oxford English Dictionary treats the phrase with magisterial derision in The New Fowler s Modern English Usage 1996 he dismisses it as one of the ignoble clich s introduced into the language in the 20c first recorded in 1974 And yet the phrase though lately putting in overtime is not so young The Random House lexicographer Jesse Sheidlower has found a reference to it in a passage from Varieties of Religious Experience in which William James quotes words of Voltaire for which he gives the date 1773 All comes out at the end of the day and all comes out still more even when all the days are over That quotation itself calls attention to apocalyptic antecedents in the Bible where the end of the days or the last days meaning the end of the world is often much on people s minds Thus from the prophet Joel And in the last days it shall be God declares that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh Acts 2 17 And the Lord says to the prophet Daniel You shall rest and shall stand in your allotted place at the end of the days Daniel 12 13 Any cant word or phrase becomes tiresome which perhaps accounts in part for Burchfield s impatience with at the end of the day The word parse rapidly deployed in press conferences and commentary after President Clinton used an eyebrow raising tense to describe his relationship with Monica Lewinsky went from inert silage to spent husk in a matter of hours At the end of the day has its good and bad points Among the bad It imposes an implicit template of struggle and confrontation where none may exist It also implies the inevitability of resolution The good points include its realism Even as it invokes the traditional language of time it does not in fact insist on squeezing events into a rigid chronological mold In contrast consider the false concept of the week which James Fallows in Breaking the News castigated for having become the basic unit of political time a status ruthlessly enforced by the weekly schedule of political talk shows Also the whiff of eschatology that the phrase exudes is not inappropriate to the millennium s approach Are its days numbered William Safire who once addressed the phrase in passing seemed to think it a nonce expression enjoying an ephemeral vogue That was a decade ago Those inhabiting English s linguistic core may find the phrase cloying but its popularity in finance and sport and in the English spoken by non native speakers suggests that its colonizing power remains robust My guess is that it will achieve at the very least a kind of status that is going to be conferred on more and more English locutions as time goes on the status of a native idiomatic expression whose constituency is in fact an international group of English speakers At the end of the day its best days lie ahead
