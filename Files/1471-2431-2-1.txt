 Background Extensive bone marrow infiltration with cancer cells and anticancer therapy lead to immune incompetence in children with cancer 1 2 Since the prognosis and overall survival of children with cancer have dramatically improved during past 30 years 3 problems remain related to infections mainly during leukopenic periods 3 4 5 Causal pathogens of febrile neutropenia FN most frequently bacterial or fungal are identified and confirmed by culture in 25 35 of the cases 3 6 In other 15 25 of patients with FN bacterial or fungal pathogens are suspected clinically The remaining 50 of cases are classified as a fever of unknown origin FUO and may be caused by other pathogens namely viruses that are more difficult to detect by conventional diagnostic methods 7 8 9 Lymphotropic herpesviruses LH Epstein Barr virus EBV cytomegalovirus CMV and human herpesvirus 6 HHV 6 establish a lifelong persistent infection in a great majority of humans They usually produce inaparent infection or transient immune compromise in otherwise healthy hosts but are able to cause life threatening primary or reactivated infections in individuals with congenital or acquired T cell immunodeficiencies 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The spectrum of diseases caused by lymphotropic herpesviruses is well documented in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation BMT 8 9 10 11 or organ transplantation 12 13 and in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV 14 15 In patients undergoing conventional anticancer therapy without BMT the data focusing on EBV CMV or HHV 6 infection are scarcely documented and mostly reported as individual cases 16 17 18 19 With combined diagnostic approach of serology and viral DNA detection we performed a prospective study of children undergoing non BMT therapy for cancer to demostrate the incidence of LH infections Methods Patients and controls Two hundred and nine Caucasian children and adolescents 4 months to 17 years old at the time of cancer diagnosis were eligible for this prospective Institutional Review Board approved single center study performed at the Department of Pediatrics Masaryk University in Brno Czech Republic Inclusion criteria for patients included presence of cancer serology of EBV and CMV at least at the time of cancer diagnosis pre treatment sample and 2 months after the end of anticancer therapy post treatment sample Children with cancer undergoing BMT human immunodeficiency virus positive children and children who died while on anticancer therapy were excluded from the study All children were treated according to approved current protocols for therapy of pediatric malignancies Berlin Frankfurt M nster protocols for therapy of leukemia and non Hodgkin s lymphoma Histiocyte Society protocols for therapy of histiocytoses International Pediatric Oncology Society protocols for treatment of Hodgkin s disease and solid tumors except for neuroblastoma which has been treated according to Pediatric Oncology Group protocols As a supportive care leukodepleted containing 10 5leukocytes per one transfusion unit irradiated 50Gy blood products packed red blood cells platelets obtained by apheresis from one donor were given only Finally 186 children and adolescents 101 males and 85 females met the inclusion criteria remaining 23 children did not meet that criteria since they move or their initial or follow up samples were missing One hundred and sixteen consecutive patients were studied from 1993 through 1996 In addition in consecutive 70 patients studied from 1997 through 1999 serology of HHV 6 at the same time points as for EBV and CMV and monitoring of EBV CMV and HHV 6 DNA was also performed If a sample was positive for LH DNA repeated samples every 5 7 days were performed until negative During anticancer therapy samples of peripheral blood for serology and LH DNA study were taken as clinically indicated in the following situations 1 FN defined as a single episode of oral temperature 38 5 C or at least two episodes of oral temperature 38 C appearing at least 12 hours apart in a patient with absolute neutrophil count 500 ml 2 fever of unknown origin FUO defined as oral temperature 37 C lasting for at least 7 days and no infectious or non infectious cause of the fever has been identified 3 lymphadenopathy hepatomegaly or splenomegaly not associated directly with the diagnosis or relapse of the cancer 4 liver enzymes aspartataminotransferase or alaninaminotransferase elevation above 2 standard deviations of normal values 5 protracted 14 days bone marrow aplasia defined as presence of at least two of the following leukocytes 1 000 ml thrombocytes 30 000 ml hemoglobin 80 g l in peripheral blood without the evidence of chemotherapy or radiotherapy induced aplasia 6 gastroenteritis 7 atypical pneumonia 8 exanthema and 9 encephalopathy Infection associated with at least one of the symptoms mentioned above and confirmed by serology or in combination with viral DNA detection was designated as symptomatic infection The population was studied according to cancer diagnosis leukemia lymphoma and solid tumor and according to the age at the time of a particular sample has been taken Based on age at the time when a pre treatment sample was taken four age groups has been made 0 1 year old consisting of 25 children 2 5 years old 49 children 6 11 years old 52 children and 12 17 years old 60 children A total of 218 children 4 months to 17 years old 31 54 62 71 children in age group 0 1 2 5 6 11 12 17 years respectively and 165 adults 19 78 years old without infectious or febrile illness who underwent minor surgery procedure and provided a blood sample for that purpose served as a healthy controls for serology testing 64 children from that group provided samples of peripheral blood for LH DNA analysis too Informed consent has been taken from all adults and parents legal guardians of all the children Serology of LH All samples were tested by commercially available sets ELISA testing kit DIESSE Germany was used to test the EBV VCA IgM EBV VCA IgG EBV EBNA IgG antibodies 20 and ELISA testing kit MEDAC Czech Republic was used to test the CMV IgM and CMV IgG antibodies in patient sera 21 Immunofluorescence assay IFA kit BAG Germany was used to test the HHV 6 IgM and HHV 6 IgG antibodies 22 All tests were performed according to manufacturer s instructions To avoid misinterpretation of results all samples from each patient were titrated and tested at the same time The titer results were expressed semiquantitatively in four grades negative mildly positive moderately positive strongly positive for each antibody tested The presence of EBV VCA IgM positivity of any grade followed by EBV VCA IgG positivity of any grade or increasing EBV VCA IgG positivity with negative EBV EBNA IgG 14 21 days after an initial level was measured was considered as a recent primary EBV infection EBV EBNA IgG positive of any grade case with the presence of the same pattern of EBV VCA IgM and or EBV VCA IgG positivity as in the primary infection was considered as an EBV reactivation In case of CMV and HHV 6 the presence of IgM class antibody positivity of any grade followed by IgG positivity of any grade or increasing IgG positivity 14 21 days after an initial level was measured was considered as a primary CMV or HHV 6 infection IgM positivity of any grade in a patient previously IgG positive was considered as a reactivation of CMV or HHV 6 DNA analysis of LH Whole blood samples were collected

by serology results demonstrating recent LH infection 1 to 5 weeks later was considered as an active infection Statistical analysis Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed with pre treatment presence or absence of virus as the dichotomous outcome measure For this analysis group patients or controls age as a continuous variable and the interaction of age and group were the independent measures This analysis was repeated for each viral serology To control for age logistic regressions were performed within each age group 0 1 2 5 6 11 and 12 17 for each viral serology with group as the only independent variable These analyses provide estimates and confidence intervals of the odds ratios of seroprevalence for pre treatment cases versus controls adjusting for age The same set of analyses was performed with post transplant cases versus controls To study pre treatment versus post treatment patient samples a McNemar test was performed for each viral serology McNemar s test determines the degree of agreement between two paired variables This test was performed both overall ignoring age and then repeated within each age group For the comparison of transfused and non transfused patients chi square test was used 25 Results Serology of LH Before grouping the ages a logistic regression analysis was performed with each viral pre treatment sample as the dichotomous outcome measure and group patients or controls as the independent measure with age as a covariate and including the age by group interaction term There was no statistically significant difference in overall seropositivity between patients and controls for EBV VCA IgG 68 8 vs 72 0 p 0 47 and CMV IgG 37 6 vs 41 7 p 0 36 pre transplant samples There was a statistically significant difference in the age measure showing that the number of EBV and CMV IgG seropositive cases in pre treatment samples increases with age p 0 0001 resp p 0 0131 The interaction of age and group measure was not significant p 0 23 for EBV and p 0 60 for CMV Overall pre treatment IgG seropositivity for HHV 6 was significantly lower in patients than in controls 80 6 vs 91 3 p 0 0231 The age measure was also significantly different p 0 0001 demonstrating increasing HHV 6 IgG positivity with age The interaction of age and group measure for HHV 6 was not significant p 0 07 For each age group and each virus a logistic regression analysis was performed with pre treatment sample as the dichotomous outcome measure and group patients or controls as the independent outcome measure There were no statistically significant differences between pre treatment patient samples and controls in all age groups for EBV VCA IgG CMV IgG and in the 6 11 and 12 17 age groups for HHV 6 IgG The only differences were noticed for HHV 6 in the 0 1 and 2 5 age groups where patients had lower IgG seropositivity then the controls Statistical data including p values odds ratios and odds confidence intervals are summarized in Table 2 The same analyses were performed with post treatment patient samples and controls There was increased overall post treatment seropositivity that was significantly different from controls for EBV VCA IgG 86 6 vs 72 0 p 0 0004 and CMV IgG 67 7 vs 41 7 p 0 0001 No difference in the age measure was found demonstrating that the number of EBV and CMV seropositive cases in post treatment samples does not increase with age p 0 87 resp p 0 62 In case of HHV 6 IgG no difference was found between post treatment samples and controls 94 3 vs 91 3 p 0 58 The age measure was

respectively p 0 73 p 0 57 resp p 0 07 For each age group and each virus a logistic regression analysis was performed with post treatment sample as the dichotomous variable and group patients or controls as the independent variable There were statistically significant differences between post treatment patient samples and controls in the 0 1 and 2 5 age groups for EBV VCA IgG and in all age groups for CMV IgG demonstrating higher seropositivity in patients than in controls No differences were noticed in the 6 11 and 12 17 age groups for EBV VCA IgG and in all age groups for HHV 6 IgG Statistical data including p values odds ratios and odds confidence intervals are summarized in Table 2 Figure 1demonstrates LH IgG seropositivity in patient pre and post treatment samples and in controls To compare pre treatment and post treatment samples a McNemar test was performed for each viral serology This test was performed both overall ignoring age and then repeated within each age group Overall McNemar test demonstrated statistically significant difference between pre and post treatment patient samples for all three LH p 0 0001 There were also statistically significant

and 12 17 p 0 15 for HHV 6 The data are summarized in Figure 1 Using the McNemar test we compared IgG seropositivity between pre treatment and post treatment samples according to cancer diagnosis described in Table 1 i e leukemias lymphomas and solid tumors the group of histiocytosis was not analyzed this way since the number of subjects was too small for statistical analysis EBV VCA IgG CMV IgG and HHV 6 IgG seropositivity respectively was significantly different in the leukemia group p 0 0004 p 0 0001 resp p 0 0245 There was also a statistically significant difference for CMV IgG in the lymphoma and solid tumor groups p 0 0058 resp p 0 0008 No statistically significant difference was noticed for EBV VCA IgG and HHV 6 IgG in the lymphoma p 0 36 resp p 0 75 and solid tumor p 0 25 resp p 0 12 groups The data are summarized in Figure 2 Based on serology we were able to demonstrate the rate of primary infection and reactivation of LH in most of the patients during anticancer treatment The results are shown in Figure 3 Primary infection with EBV and CMV occurs in almost 50 of children less than 6 years of age Primary HHV 6 infection is less frequent In older children EBV and HHV 6 reactivation also occurs We were able to distinguish primary infection from reactivation in all cases of symptomatic EBV infection based on EBNA IgG status In case of CMV and HHV 6 there were 4 and 2 cases respectively where it was impossible to distinguish that In addition two of that cases showed CMV and HHV 6 crossreactivity Analysis of LH DNA and comparison with LH serology We examined 215 blood samples from 70 patients Sixty four healthy individuals served as controls Seventeen 24 18 26 and 21 30 patients were PCR EBV CMV and HHV 6 respectively to positive In comparison 2 3 1 2 and 5 8 healthy controls were PCR EBV CMV and HHV 6 respectively positive none was or positive All cases of PCR or positive results obtained from 10 8 and 13 patients with EBV CMV and HHV 6 active symptomatic infection respectively corresponded with serological findings of recent infection occurring 1 5 weeks following the first PCR positive result In case of PCR EBV CMV and HHV 6 positive result the serology finding of recent infection corresponded in 7 7 6 10 and 3 8 patients respectively Four and 5 patients were PCR CMV and HHV 6 positive respectively but lacking serological evidence of recent infection Since they had symptomatic infection we considered them being infected with a particular virus and all of them showed serological evidence of previous infection in post treatment samples Besides that there were 4 patients PCR EBV negative who demonstrated recent infection by serology One patient had coinfection of EBV and HHV 6 during anticancer treatment detected by PCR EBV positive HHV 6 with serological evidence of primary EBV infection and reactivation of HHV 6 Data summarized in Table 3provide the information about the differences in diagnosis of EBV and CMV infection By combination of serology and DNA analysis we were able to detect symptomatic infection more frequently in comparison to serology only p 0 013 for EBV p 0 007 for CMV As expected the rates of laboratory infection defined as the sum of the cases with symptomatic infection and positive seroconversion for each virus were not significantly different in these two groups Laboratory EBV and CMV infection was present in 65 34 9 and 66 35 4 of 186 patients respectively Laboratory HHV 6 infection was present in 23 32 9 of 70 patients The influence of blood products on LH infection One hundred fifty six children 83 9 were given at least one blood product transfusion during treatment Fifty four 34 6 and 57 36 5 children out of 156 transfused children were infected with EBV and CMV respectively Eleven 36 7 and 9 30 0 children out of 30 non transfused children were infected with EBV and CMV respectively In addition eighteen 29 5 out of 61 children transfused in the period from 1997 through 1999 were infected with HHV 6 while 5 55 6 children out of 9 non transfused children were infected with HHV 6 There was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of EBV p 0 64 CMV p 0 16 or HHV 6 p 0 24 infection in between transfused and non transfused patients Discussion Frequent infection with herpesviruses has long been recognized in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation 7 8 and in patients with acute leukemia 1 2 In patients with acute leukemia it has been reported that as many as two thirds of seropositive patients can develop reactivation of herpes simplex virus infection during remission induction therapy 26 The risk of CMV infection in acute leukemia patients was recognized almost 30 years ago 27 but is of particular concern in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation 2 28 EBV infection is frequently associated with post transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in T cell depleted grafts 29 As recently reported HHV 6 can also be associated with bone marrow supression 30 encephalitis and pneumonitis 7 8 after allogeneic transplantation Whether symptomatic LH infection occurs in chemotherapy and or radiotherapy treated cancer patients has not been reported This report demonstrates for the first time that LH infection affects more than one third of children treated for cancer EBV and CMV infection occurred in almost 50 of children younger then 6 years during anticancer treatment At the time of cancer diagnosis the rate of EBV and CMV seropositivity was not different in cancer patients and healthy controls On the other hand children in all age groups reached similar EBV and CMV seropositivity levels after anticancer treatment comparing to healthy adult controls It suggests that children immunosupressed by chemotherapy and or radiotherapy have high incidence of LH infection As expected primary infection was the most frequent in younger patients and reactivation occurred in older patients In case of HHV 6 infection which affects most of humans by the age of 2 years we were surprised with low frequency of IgG antibodies in pre treatment samples as compared with age matched healthy controls There might be at least two possible mechanisms involved First due to either lower sensitivity to detect HHV 6 IgG antibodies by IFA or due to immune supression at the time of cancer diagnosis but similar pattern was not seen for EBV or CMV Second due to the possibility that prior infection with HHV 6 might be directly or indirectly protective against tumor development This finding would be in agreement with Greaves hypothesis 31 32 which predicted an increased risk of B cell precursor ALL for those of higher socioeconomic level firstborn children and those with delayed or diminished exposure to common infections in infancy When we studied our patient population based on cancer diagnosis the only statistically significant difference between pre and post treatment samples was noticed in patients with leukemia p 0 0245 but not in patients with lymphoma or solid cancer Figure 2 To our knowledge there are no other data in the literature describing a protective effect of HHV 6 infection in infancy against leukemia Further studies would be needed to test this association As previously demonstrated the risk of transfusion acquired CMV infection can be significantly reduced by the use of CMV seronegative or filtered white blood cell reduced blood products 33 In an effort to illustrate the role of leukodepleted blood transfusions in transmission of LH infection in pediatric oncology patients we studied both populations a population of patients treated with leukodepleted irradiated blood products and a population of patients that did not required any blood transfusion during anticancer treatment No statistically significant difference for each LH virus was found in these two groups Those data are in accordance with recently published prospective study by Preiksaikis et al 34 where the risk of transfusion acquired CMV infection was estimated to be less than 1 in 698 donor exposures in children with cancer In the literature describing LH detection by PCR the results vary widely since different protocols have been used in different biological materials 7 8 9 10 14 PCR method was used in patients undergoing BMT or organ transplants but not in chemotherapy only and or radiotherapy only treated patients To our knowledge this report demonstrates for the first time a correlation of serological results with viral load detected by PCR in children with different types of cancer By using healthy controls and setting the threshold of PCR positive versus negative based on correlation with clinical symptoms and serology acute LH infection could be identified in most of the cases The highest incidence of LH infection occurred among patients with leukemia It probably corresponds with the length of neutropenia and severity of immunosupression that is greater in patients treated for leukemia compared to patients with lymphoma or solid tumor Conclusion This paper demonstrates that EBV CMV and HHV 6 infection is frequent in children treated for cancer is not transfusion dependant and is often associated with clinical symptoms Combination of serology and PCR method in detection of symptomatic disease is superior to serology alone Further studies are needed to identify patients at higher risk of severe LH infection to prevent disease associated morbidity and to test the hypothesis that HHV 6 infection early in the infancy may be protective against leukemia in the frame of Greaves hypothesis Abbreviations FN febrile neutropenia LH lymphotropic herpesviruses EBV Epstein Barr virus CMV cytomegalovirus HHV 6 human herpesvirus 6 BMT bone marrow transplantation
