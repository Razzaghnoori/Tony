 The Region And Its People Tucked away in the northwest corner of England 240 km 150 miles from London the Lake District nestles just below the Scottish border and backs up on the Irish Sea At just 2 300 sq km 3 710 sq miles the area is small enough that it can be covered by car north to south in just a few hours This little corner of England is such a beautiful and valued region however that policy makers and conservationists have worked tirelessly over the last hundred years to protect it The label the Lake District is actually a little misleading Although there are in fact many bodies of water much of the charm of the region lies in the landscapes produced by the high peaks majestic valleys swathes of forest and rugged fells highland plateaus or pastures that surround the lakes It is an English landscape that has enchanted many from hardworking farmers and sheepherders to vacationing naturalists to resident poets The area s natural beauty continues to inspire writers and artists Visitors come not only to view the mountains and the lakes but also to hear the words of poets who lived here and to learn about their lives After considerable study and touring in the Lake District German scientist Rainer Bramer declared that the region had the best views in the world He asserted that the area was blessed with the highest concentration of exactly those natural features that when combined create the most pleasing and relaxing vistas possible landscapes composed of lakes representing the source of life in water trees offering the promise of shelter smooth areas providing easy walking and a curved shoreline or path in the distance to stimulate curiosity Native Lakelanders and visitors alike know exactly what Bramer was talking about For such a small tract of land the geology of the Lake District is actually very complex The oldest rocks are 500 million year old slates found around the northern peak of Skiddaw where the mountains have smooth and rounded profiles Only a little farther south around Langdale Pikes for example the terrain is formed of volcanic rock much younger and more dramatic in appearance these mountains have rough crags and sharper peaks At the southern extremities of the National Park are areas of limestone with so called clint and grike patterns caused when rainfall erodes weaker fissures leaving high narrow ridges or overhangs of stronger rock Ancient glaciers eroded many of the valleys creating space for the lakes as they melted at the end of the last Ice Age approximately 8 000 b c Even today wind and water are still hard at work gradually but continually changing the landscape These various types of geological formations and activities have created a multitude of environments There are bare volcanic crags soaring from deep valley bottoms spectacular waterfalls high plateaus and ridged fells with bracken thickets of ferns and shrubs and heather Throughout the entire region high ground breaks up areas of rolling meadows and verdant pasture Deep valleys with babbling brooks and wooded copses give shelter to the small Lakeland communities Today thousands of kilometers of public footpaths and bridle ways extend to almost every valley and reach to every peak offering new delights at every turn in the road The Lake District is rich in mineral deposits that have been put to good use since ancient times and throughout much of the region s history mining was a major industry The iron ore mine at Millom on the coast southwest of Broughton in Furness was once one of the biggest in the world Farming has been another mainstay of the Lake District economy for centuries To provide grazing land for sheep which were raised for both wool and meat large tracts of the forest that originally blanketed the whole area were cleared Today the sheep on the hillsides and in the vales define the region as much as do the fells and the lakes The herds give a sense of proportion to the vast openness just as the scattered farmhouses and characteristic drystone walls add reassuring warmth to even the loneliest valley This is not an artificial landscape supported solely by tourism today s working farms help keep the Lake District vital and distinctive Throughout history the natives of this region carried on life in relative isolation from the rest of the country The steep fells protected the population but also made transportation of any kind difficult many of today s footpaths follow ancient pack horse trails which for centuries were the principal method of transport Even today it is easy to see why major roads bypass the area the only routes that traverse the region are smaller roads that twist and turn along the river dales and up through the craggy mountain passes For many locals a trip to the nearest market town would have been the farthest they would travel in a lifetime Not surprisingly this self contained region engendered a stalwart sense of self reliance and independence in its inhabitants When families live together for generations in the same town and valley especially when these communities have been forced to pull together in times of hardship a strong feeling of community is created as has been the case throughout the history of this rugged territory The traditional celebrations of rural life and the village sports days still give all members of local communities the chance to put their skills to the test and to enjoy each other s company Favorite Lake District competitions range from wrestling and sheep dog trials to jam and cake making Life in the Lakes is still organized by the seasons and the activities of lambing shearing taking goods to market and overwintering the local farmers term for surviving the winter Seasons of plenty alternate with leaner periods when the people prepare to mend and make do Even today when agricultural policies provide significant aid and resources farming is still a tough life There s little time for recreation in this sometimes harsh environment and though local residents may come across as pragmatic and single minded you ll find them in a more relaxed mood at the end of a hard day s work enjoying a pint of beer and game of dominoes at the local pub The farmer you see standing over his crook at the side of the road may not give you a wide smile of welcome but that short nod of his head and tip of his cap is equivalent to a heartfelt hug or handshake in other places Much of the farmland and many of the peaks and lakes are protected This happened in response to attempts on the part of 19th century industrialists and businessmen to exploit the area s natural resources One plan in particular a proposal to send a railway line through the heart of the region galvanized a small group of influential local men including poet William Wordsworth into action They succeeded in stopping the rail line at Windermere Since its founding in 1895 the National Trust has preserved nearly 100 farmhouses and the surrounding land as well as many other historic structures throughout the region In 1951 the Lake District National Park was created which extended this protection to a much wider area while imposing planning regulations and environmental guidelines and allowing further public access to the land Reacting in part to the effects of the Industrial Revolution a group of 19th century writers known collectively as the Lake Poets did much to raise England s national consciousness about the landscape and natural beauties of the Lake District City dwellers from northern England began to spend their free time here walking on the fells or enjoying boat trips on the lakes Their numbers have grown steadily ever since and today many thousands of visitors come to enjoy the countryside and to visit the sites first made famous by Romantic poets Tourism is now the biggest industry in the Lake District Hotels restaurants and shops have proliferated extending a warm welcome and the best of Lakeland hospitality to ever growing numbers of visitors This popularity is also a source of considerable concern to many residents of the Lake District Traffic jams overflowing car parks and eroded footpaths are all difficulties that need to be addressed The challenge is how to stop the landscape from being changed by the very people who come to marvel at it The National Trust and the National Park Authority both work on conservation projects and these along with innovative transportation policies devised by local councils are all designed to help minimize the potential negative impact of tourism Aside from these difficulties which are suffered by National Parks all over the world there is one other matter that can t be overlooked rain It rains regularly whatever the season so be prepared to experience some inclement weather during your visit The rain irrigates the forests and fills the streams waterfalls and rivers that feed the lakes so without it of course the magnificent landscapes would be altered forever Fortunately the Lake District retains its beauty in all types of weather and in all seasons Spring offers the fresh green of grasses in the valley and bracken on the hills Woodland floors are blanketed with swathes of bluebells and Gowbarrow Park immortalized by Wordsworth has its host of golden daffodils At lambing time the frolicking youngsters are enchanting Summer boasts long warm days with strong sunlight and hazy views Butterflies play among the blooms as day trippers enjoy a picnic or a lakeside walk Autumn brings the finest hues to the landscape when the leaves turn shades of apricot and copper the bracken changes to a burnt umber and the hillsides glow in the low sunlight reflecting perfectly in the glassy stillness of the lakes After the first snowfall of winter the fell tops turn white complementing the walls of the rugged farmhouses and the gentle plumes of smoke that rise from log fires into the crisp cold air Recognized by a few individuals as a very precious resource the Lake District has been praised in prose and verse and protected by wise policies so that the rest of the world can come and enjoy its particular beauty No one who comes here can fail to be awed by the landscape and charmed by the lifestyle of this small yet spectacular corner of England
