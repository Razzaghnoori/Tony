 Imprinting Baby Babysitter produced by Goodby Silverstein Partners for Hewlett Packard Babysitter for Hewlett Packard not only announces but also illustrates that HP has a photo quality color printer solution so effective that it s accessible even to computer phobes those modern day Luddites who cling to their yellow legal pads The spot is structured as a baby melodrama a problem becoming an apparently insoluble crisis An elderly baby sitting granddad is simultaneously bored and apprehensive His charge is asleep the grandfather clock ticks peacefully in the background but Gramps is too frightened to move lest he disturb the infant Tentatively awkwardly he reaches for the television remote control and taps it The set turns on in an explosion of sound The baby The baby The noise will wake the baby It does loud wails fill the room Under pressure Gramps can t handle something as simple as the remote control This man is technologically inept As even the dog flees the cacophony Gramps puts the crying baby into the playpen That will only make things worse doesn t he remember He tries everything An appeal Don t cry sonny don t cry Mom and Dad will be right back A placebo He shakes a toy frog in the kid s face then a doll whose head flies off Shot from the baby s point of view with a wide angle lens Grandfather looks every bit the monster as he tries to calm the storm As the wailing reaches a crescendo lights go on all across the neighborhood The helpless baby sitter seems caught in Murphy s Law Hell Everything is going wrong Confused frantic he whips a picture of the baby s parents off the piano and takes it out of its frame Then we see Grandfather s hand moving a mouse What can he be doing If he can t handle a television remote or even a doll can he figure out a computer He uses the mouse to click on the picture he wants and it rolls out of the HP printer enlarged and in brilliant color This process is simple easy accessible So he can operate technology even under stress The noise rushes on through all the activity a metaphor for the challenges of the 1990s The picture printed the racket is suddenly replaced by the striking sounds of calm the low hum of the grandfather s voice punctuated by the ticktock of the grandfather clock The baby is asleep and we think OK it s clever but a little phony One picture doesn t a contented baby make surely But next we see the reason Gramps is wearing mom s face as a mask a disguise that deceives even the dog who does a double take and scampers away when shushed The narrator finally appears on the scene to make the point explicit HP photo quality printers good enough to fool almost anyone The concluding frames break away from the drama the happy ending driving home the HP name and the idea that with this product the complexity of technology has become an engine of simplicity Built by engineers Used by normal people The appeal is credible because we ve just watched a technology impaired klutz use the new HP printer to become a faux mother and thus accomplish one of the most difficult of all tasks putting a crying baby to sleep We smile because we know it really wouldn t happen this way but we are persuaded that anyone can operate this device The message You don t even have to be able to play a video game to master this technology Robert Shrum
