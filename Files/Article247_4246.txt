 Brush Up Your Shakespeare i Please i It was inevitable that as the New York Times reports Shakespeare would come to rival Machiavelli as the most popular adviser in world literature for businessmen who want to lie cheat and scheme their way to the top The Brothers Grimm and A A Milne author of Winnie the Pooh dabble in that line of work too but their output is noncompetitive only one book to Machiavelli s and Shakespeare s several each It is also fitting that the character chosen by the authors of Shakespeare in Charge The Bard s Guide to Leading and Succeeding on the Business Stage as a role model for CEOs is Henry V Hal as he is called is widely acknowledged to be the playwright s most Machiavellian hero Most people like to think of Henry V as a jolly patriot who conquered France for England hurrah which is how Laurence Olivier and Kenneth Branagh play him in the two movie versions of Henry V But read the play more closely and you realize that the cheerfully successful king bears little resemblance to the man Shakespeare created At best Shakespeare s Henry V was as critic William Hazlitt wrote an amiable monster that is he was ready to sacrifice his own life for the pleasure of destroying thousands of other lives At worst he was a cold and cunning strategist without a glimmer of moral doubt a man as happy to humiliate his friends even execute them as he is to commit mass murder all in the name of consolidating power Just the sort of man a CEO should emulate you may be thinking Culturebox agrees The Shakespearean as opposed to the Oliverian or Branaghian Henry V embodies several telling bits of wisdom for he who would develop the character of a true blue businessman 1 Learn everything you can from your friends but drop them the minute they get in your way In Henry IV young Hal is a roustabout who keeps the company of a band of merry thieves led by the obese drunkard Falstaff who has been described by critic Harold Bloom as the life force incarnate Falstaff teaches Hal how to be a quick witter punster and a master of play he also teaches him a commoner s skepticism of power and its pretensions In short Hal learns from Falstaff a street savvy that will make him enormously popular later in life As soon as Hal ascends to the throne however he pretends not to know his old and embarrassing mentor I know thee not old man fall to thy prayers How ill white hairs become a fool and jester I have long dream d of such a kind of man So surfeit swell d so old and so profane But being awaked I do despise my dream 2 Don t worry about whether you have a good reason to initiate a hostile takeover simply having the means to do so will suffice Why does Henry V gather up an army and sail to France For no better reason than that he suddenly came upon a way to pay for it At the beginning of the play England s church officials offer to underwrite an invasion as a bribe to keep Henry from appropriating church lands Upon receiving the proposal he asks England s bishops several times to give him a clear justification for the invasion which will necessarily entail the deaths of thousands of men The bishops give him long winded answers that make no sense at all at the end of which he asks again confused May I with right and conscience make this claim More incomprehensible replies ensue The scene ends without good reasons having ever been offered after which he goes ahead and invades anyway 3 Threaten to loot pillage and rape the daughters of your competitors if they don t give up the fight as soon as you enter the field and explain that they have forced you to do so Consider Henry s speech before the town of Harfleur whose crime has been to hold out against a siege What is t to me when you yourselves are cause If your pure maidens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing violation What rein can hold licentious wickedness When down the hill he holds his fierce career 4 If a former friend has committed a crime however minor make sure he receives the maximum punishment in order to make an example of him Just before the great battle with the French at Agincourt Henry V is told that Bardolph a member of his old gang has been caught stealing a small statue of Christ from a local church For this act Bardolph is to be hanged Rather than pardon the poor fool Henry has him killed in order to show the French that his is an orderly army that means them no real harm 5 Take no prisoners But if you do kill them When Henry hears at Agincourt that the French have sent in reinforcements he orders his men to kill their French prisoners a terrifying act for men facing the prospect of imprisonment themselves As one soldier remarks Tis expressly against the law of arms tis as arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offer t Neither Shakespeare who alludes to the incident only in passing nor history offers any justification for this gross violation of the laws of war Was there as it was later claimed some sudden movement on the part of French cavalry which lead Henry to fear an attack from the rear It is possible though no such attack took place writes historian John Julius Norwich in his forthcoming book Shakespeare s Kings The Great Plays and the History of England in the Middle Ages 1137 1485 Norwich who calls the command the darkest stain on the historical Henry s reputation says that so many of Henry s men refused to obey his order that he was at last obligated to designate 200 of his own archers specifically for the task 6 Marry a woman appropriate to your station and say anything you have to to win her In wooing Katherine the French princess whose country and relatives he has just laid waste to Henry having never met the girl calls her an angel and claims to be in love with her When reasonably enough she objects he subtly menaces her No it is not possible you should love the enemy of France Kate but in loving me you should love the friend of France for I love France so well that I will not part with a village of it I will have it all mine and Kate when France is mine and I am yours then yours is France and you are mine To sum up then What does Shakespeare really have to say to businessmen who think that his kings make good role models rather than say troubling interesting morally questionable dramatizations of the effects of power Lord what fools these mortals be
