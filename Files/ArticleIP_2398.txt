 Blood Simple The Negro problem wrote Norman Podhoretz in 1963 would not be solved unless color itself disappeared and that means not integration it means assimilation it means let the brutal word come out miscegenation Coming after a lengthy confession of his tortured feelings toward blacks and coming at a time when 19 states still had anti miscegenation statutes on the books Podhoretz s call for a wholesale merging of the two races seemed not just bold but desperate Politics had failed us he was conceding now we could find hope only in the unlikely prospect of intermarriage Podhoretz s famous essay was regarded as bizarre at the time but 33 years later it seems like prophecy We are indeed intermarrying today in unprecedented numbers Between 1970 and 1992 the number of mixed race marriages quadrupled Black white unions now represent 12 percent of all marriages involving at least one black up from 2 6 percent in 1970 Twelve percent of Asian men and 25 percent of Asian women are marrying non Asians Fully a quarter of married U S born Latinos in Los Angeles have non Latino spouses We are mixing our genes with such abandon that the Census Bureau is now considering whether to add a new multiracial category to the census in the year 2000 This orgy of miscegenation has not yet brought the racial harmony for which Podhoretz longed But recent publicity about the intermarriage figures has stirred hope once again that our racial problems might be dissolving in the gene pool The Census Bureau s multiracial proposal has provoked strong reactions from civil rights activists who fear that many African Americans will defect to the new category thus diluting black political power But the debate properly framed is not just about light flight from the black community The debate is about our very conception of race For a multiracial box would be an admission that the five points of our modern day ethno racial pentagon black white Asian Hispanic Native American are not fixed or divinely ordained but fickle and all too man made Race you see is a fiction As a matter of biology it has no basis Genetic variations within any race far exceed the variations between the races and the genetic similarities among the races swamp both The power of race however derives not from its pseudoscientific markings but from its cultural trappings It is as an ideology that race matters indeed matters so much that the biologists protestations fall away like Copernican claims in the age of Ptolemy So the question as always is whether it is possible to break that awful circle in which myth and morphology perpetually reinforce one another The leaders of the fledgling multiracial movement say that their category and more broadly their lives represent the way out By marrying across the color line by raising mixed race children without regard to labels they promise to obliterate our antiquated notions of racial difference As a newlywed who has recently joined their ranks I hope they re right When the time comes I won t want to infect my Chinese Scotch Irish Jewish children with bloodline fever I won t force them to choose among ill fitting racial uniforms That said though there are plenty of reasons to wonder whether intermarriage can ever as one partisan put it blow the lid off of race Foremost is this reality Racialism is highly adaptive That is no matter how quickly demographic change proceeds we seem to find a way to reinvent and sustain our jerry rigged pigmentocracy A case in point is the term Hispanic Ever since this category was added to the census in 1977 we ve been told that Hispanic is merely a linguistic category that Hispanics can be of any race Today amid a boom in the Hispanic population we hear that caveat the same way smokers read the surgeon general s warning The story of the last 20 years is the way heterogenous Hispanics who ought to have exposed the flimsiness of racial categories became just another homogenous race The square peg by our thinking had been rounded off Will this happen to multiracials Their numbers are still small Despite the quadrupling of multiracial marriages since 1970 only 5 million people today qualify and that s counting racially distinct parents as well as their mixed race kids This may not be enough of a critical mass for multiracials to become a race of their own Moreover multiracials have less reason to cohere than Hispanics ever had they include every conceivable combination of races and they are not bound together by language Still in a nation accustomed to thinking of official races they ll feel pressure to form an interest group multiculturalism s latest aggrieved tribe One possibility is that all multiracials over time will find themselves the intermediate race a new middleman minority less stigmatized than pure blacks however defined but less acceptable than pure whites Their presence like that of the coloreds in old South Africa wouldn t subvert racialism it would reinforce it by fleshing out the black white caste system Again however the sheer diversity of the multiracials might militate against this kind of stratification Yet this same diversity makes it possible that multiracials will replicate within their ranks the white makes right mentality that prevails all around them Thus we might expect a hierarchy of multiracials to take hold in which a mixed child with white blood would be the social better of a mixed child without such blood In this scenario multiracials wouldn t be a distinct group they would just be distributed across a continuum of color Sociologist Pierre van den Berghe argues that such a continuum is preferable to a simple black white dichotomy Brazilians for instance with their mestizo consciousness and their many gradations of tipo or type behold with disdain our crude bifurcation of race Yet no amount of baloney slicing changes the fact that in Brazil whitening remains the ideal It is still better for a woman to be a branca light skin hair without tight curls thin lips narrow nose than a morena tan skin wavy hair thicker lips broader nose and better to be a morena than a mulata darker skin tightly curled hair Subverting racial labels is not the same as subverting racism Still another possibility is that whites will do to multiracials what the Democrats or Republicans have traditionally done to third party movements absorb their most desirable elements and leave the rest on the fringe It s quite possible as Harvard Professor Mary Waters suggests that the ranks of the white will simply expand to engulf the lighter or more culturally white of the multiracials The Asian American experience may offer a precedent As growing numbers of Asian Americans have entered the mainstream over the last decade it is increasingly said sometimes with pride sometimes with scorn that they are becoming white We could thus end up with three reconfigured races In the black box black black offspring In the mixed box black Latino black Asian black white and Latino Asian kids In the white box white white white Asian and perhaps white Latino issue Absurd One need only recall the baroque lexicon of quadroons and octoroons to know the absurd uses to which our powers of taxonomy can be put These cautionary scenarios demonstrate that our problem is not just race in the abstract Our problem is the idea of the white race in particular Scholar Douglas Besharov may be right when he calls multiracial kids the best hope for the future of American race relations But even as a multiracial category blurs the color line it can reaffirm the primacy of whiteness Whether our focus is interracial adoption or mixed marriages or class climbing so long as we speak of whiteness as a norm no amount of census reshuffling will truly matter We return then to the question of politics Perhaps we should abolish all racial classifications Perhaps we should supplement the five race scheme with a None of the Above category Perhaps we should replace affirmative action with a class based alternative Perhaps we need a leader of mixed heritage say Colin Powell to educate the public about the realities of race Whatever it takes though we need to do more than marry one another if we are ever to rid our minds of color consciousness The way of politics Podhoretz lamented a generation ago is slow and bitter Indeed But it is the only lasting way Our ideology of blood like blood itself is too fluid too changeable and too easily diverted to be remade by lovers alone
