          lets see did i press one   yes   did i okay i didnt know whether you could hear because i i have to take the phone away from my ear to do it   i guess that was one   did you hear it   i heard the beep   all right were on uh hey Rick whos your favorite team   uh i guess the Durham Bulls   oh okay and uh uh  were not to have much mutual interest there but im curious uh uh what class are they class A   yeah theyre i think a farm league of the Braves   oh okay   but uh theyre theyre the closest by team to Raleigh North Carolina   yeah do you go do you go see them very often   yeah actually uh we went a couple of times last year i havent gone they started i guess about a week ago   well i imagine theyre just starting   yeah   do you you know whats exciting about watching i never watched minor league teams until i came to Texas because i was raised one near Boston following the Red Sox and then i went to graduate school in Pittsburgh so i became a Pirate fan   umhum umhum okay   and i was never in a minor league city until i came Dallas we were a minor league city when i came here in fifty nine and i immediately bought season tickets uh to the class triple A uh uh Dallas Rangers   umhum okay   and then the class uh double A Dallas Fort Worth Spurs we later uh they went to the Texas league   um   and uh i just really enjoy it i guess i enjoy watching guys when they were very first starting out playing here and then seeing them a year or two later as as stars in the majors   yeah yeah   uh and i i think thats probably the fun of watching minor league baseball and the other thing is watching guys on the other end uh guys that i had seen play for both the Red Sox and Pittsburgh   um   uh they get to the other end of their career and now they come up and talk to you between innings of games i i think that was exciting too uh have you seen any minor leaguers come through uh any guys come through Raleigh that are now in the big time   yeah uh not not yet i mean i   not yet okay well of course youre at the class A level youre a few years away from that   yeah   uh hang on a second Rick i got to see who that is   okay   you still there Rick   yes   yeah uh uh do you follow any major league teams at all   sure   uh which ones   uh i like the Phillies and the Dodgers   oh okay okay well how do you think theyre going to do this year   um fair i dont know the Phillies are so uh unpredictable   fair huh yeah yeah   but i think the Dodgers will do well   well i think the Phillies picked up some good players in the free agent market didnt they   yeah yeah   and and the Dodgers i guess what surprised me most about the Dodgers was letting uh Valenzuela go   yeah i dont know hes getting old i think they got their money their moneys worth out of him though   yeah i think they probably did he probably i was reading the other day that what may have happened to him is he pitched too many innings too young   yeah   they say that if a guys pitching that that his arm is still developing until hes twenty five and if pitches a whole lot of innings before that it may take its toll later in life   um   of course ive been watching Nolan Ryan this afternoon and uh  it doesnt seem to bother him   yeah um   uh he he has to be an outstanding physical specimen to to do what hes done   yeah well have you heard anything about Jim Palmer   uh well Palmer tried a comeback and uh got sore arm early and they uh the Rangers are playing Baltimore this game that im watching and just the last inning they put the camera over on he and Brooks Robinson they are the broadcast team for the Orioles now   right right   and apparently apparently his uh his come back just didnt make it and that he got he got hurt early in the uh in the uh uh in the spring training uh   yeah um   oh the the Dodgers the Dodgers have got an interesting thing theyve got this uh rookie pitcher whats it Martinez his name that uh that pitched a bunch of innings last year as a nineteen or twenty year old year old and they were using what happened to Valenzuela as an example that they should be careful and not over work him this early of course i was really uh   right   uh a Dodger fan a couple of years ago when they won the World World Series and Hershiser won all those games in the World Series that was that was really a   the the year they beat the As yeah that was really dramatic they were   uh yeah the year they beat the As i was really and boy i can still remember that Kirk Gibson home run     they were such under dogs   yeah they were because everybody thought the As were the greatest things in the world and uh weve got were the only ones around here that got cable and that particular game was some reason or another was on a cable channel and uh my sons in high school and all his friends were here   yeah um um   were all sitting around we must have had ten people in our living room watching it gosh gosh everybody just erupted when that happened and uh that was uh uh strictly an outstanding game uh the uh   yeah yes   uh the Dodgers the Phillies im not uh you know the National League we have an American League team here so i dont get that much into the National League stuff here i see them on the game of the week occasionally and i havent seen the the Phillies   yeah   that much i know that Mike Smith retiring a couple of years ago left a big hole offensively who do the Phillies look to to drive in a lot of runs   yeah i dont even know anymore i i follow the Dodgers more than the Phillies but uh i i grew up in Philadelphia i guess thats why   who do they of course you know Mike Marshall was the big guy the year that uh uh they won the World Series and Kirk Gibson Who who are are the Dodgers big RBI guys now   umhum i think i um i dont know  i thought i dont know   yeah well im a im a Texas Ranger fan   yeah   and uh you you know they are O and four but i think theyre going to be one and four at the end of today theyre sitting here with two out in the ninth with a uh fifteen to three lead   uh i think thats pretty   that looks that was fairly comfortable yeah and it was why and Nolan Ryan pitched the first seven innings today and he gave up three runs in first inning and i said oh my God here we go again you know you know with two outs walk walk home run b ang were down three to nothing   pretty good guess huhuh   but they got four in their half of the first and then Nolan was invincible   hum   he went out after the seventh and had he had only give up those uh that one hit in the first inning and another hit so he went out after the seventh inning with a uh it at the time he had a uh i think uh a nine to three ten to three lead and uh   hum oh   uh he had only given up two hits and uh two walks and nine strike outs so hes hes back in the groove and a a guy his age this this afternoon here its about seventy nine degrees   hum umhum   a little bit humid clear blue sky and the sunshine and the Rangers dont play many afternoon games because of the heat we have here in the summer   right   but uh they try to play Sunday afternoons in April May and in September and uh uh with the bright sky like this where youve got a real bright day when hes out there throwing ninety four ninety five miles an hour hes almost invincible   right um   and uh thats just a exciting uh is really exciting sitting here watching him on TV this afternoon and   um wow often how often do you go out to the baseball park   uh well it different times different years because because because my uh uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most weve ever gone out and we had about uh the Rangers   um yeah yeah   won uh eighty three games last year which was just four more than they lost but we had an exciting time and that at one time in about the June July and August period we went to about eight straight wins   um wow     and we happen to go out there on win night and uh uh they and they got hot then and im not sure they put the prices up a dollar a ticket this year we may have to go less but   um um   what we like to do the uh the stands have got three tiers to them and we like to be in the third tier behind home plate about the second row   right um   and uh the the park holds about forty thousand people and uh i never go on a night when they think theres going to be forty thousand theres just too big crowds i i pick the games where they dont   yeah   expect to have a high attendance and uh what what about your your ball park in in Raleigh uh the minor league ball park in Durham   its uh its actually in Durham theyre theyre thinking about moving it to Raleigh but its it holds maybe four thousand  and its like three dollars to get in   yeah four thousand   so   oh that is great when i got here in the class triple A Rangers we used to   yeah   pay two and if you bought a season ticket it was only one dollar a game   yeah   and uh uh that is fine and not only that but you probably get some pretty good seats too   oh yeah were in the pretty much wherever you want to sit   yeah yeah what do they do they have times of the year where they have promotions and you get gigantic crowds like maybe four thousand where they actually sell the place out   yeah they they give out stuff and its have you ever seen the movie Bull Durham i mean its just like that exactly   yes   well a little more modern day but not much   yeah oh yeah   yeah   yeah i love that movie i absolutely love that and i guess the players uh you know the class A salaries are are really uh not anything a guy can live on too much so i guess theyve got to go out and find rooming houses and   yeah yeah   things like the guy in Bull Durham did With fairly economical accommodations   yeah   yeah and uh uh the other thing is that thats really hard but of course you recognize the minor league team exists for the purpose of the major league team and the problem we always had in triple A is you want to see the guys go good but then when they go good you know youre going to lose them   yeah yeah   you know during the season and i guess at at your level uh you lose them to the next level if if they decide to recall the the parent team the Braves decide to call to recall a guy from triple A then a double A guy goes up to replace him and a single A guy goes up to replace him   yeah yeah   and and and youve immediately uh now you got you you go out to the ball park and your favorite player is not there anymore and you say youve got youve got to learn his replacement but do you get any local uh do they broadcast games locally or televise them locally   yeah yeah no theres actually there may be an AM station that does it im not there may be an AM station that does it but im not im not really sure   no so youve youve got to uh uh yeah okay so so you youve pretty much got to the ball park uh uh to figure out but   yeah but its i mean you could you the game could be at seven thirty at seven fifteen and you could say hey lets go to the game and youll get a seat   yeah but yeah yeah uh uh theres probably thats pretty neat because i dont imagine Raleighs so big that you have big traffic jams going one way or the other   no i mean its its actually theres an interstate
