 At this moment of the year newspapers of the English speaking world become obsessed with roundups news quizzes retrospectives and predictions of one kind or another For example the Age of Melbourne Australia has published a very long feature called Another Year Down the Drain This is largely devoted to the failures of Australians in all walks of life but it also mentions Barbra Streisand s new hugely publicized relationship with actor James Brolin as discussed on television with Barbara Walters Pass the sick bag suggests the Age Other victims of the newspaper include Earl Spencer Princess Diana s brother what a bounder and a cad click here for Slate s Assessment Boris Yeltsin and Mike Tyson No country takes astrology more seriously than India but the Asian Age has moved on to tarot cards By Western standards the predictions are very precise For example in Health for Next Month i e January the Asian Age predicts colds and coughs for Aries a skin problem for Taurus a urinary problem for Gemini circulatory or liver problems for Cancer weight problems for Leo a wheezing problem for Libra chilblains for Scorpio hormonal problems for Sagittarius women a crick in the neck for Capricorn personal anxieties and work related stress for Aquarius and a sore throat or a loose tooth for Pisces The Times of India in an editorial takes issue with a Dutch university that has compiled a vast world database of happiness to judge the happiness of each country The HLE Happy Life Expectancy is calculated by multiplying a country s life expectancy in years with a 0 10 scale of average happiness the newspaper explains But for all the complications in arriving at the final figures they become simple enough when it comes to India and it is not good news or glad tidings in tune with the season of good will For the list of 48 industrialised countries lumps India almost at the bottom among the ten unhappiest countries only ahead of Lithuania Latvia Russia Belarus Nigeria and Bulgaria The list says the newspaper has annoyed almost as many as it has pleased for it has arbitrarily included almost the entire Scandinavian seaboard countries and the rich nations regardless of the extent of societal heartache caused by broken homes and dysfunctional families More paradoxical still is the fact that Northern Ireland has got in fairly near the top despite all its troubles Northern Ireland s troubles increased over Christmas with the murder in the Maze prison of King Rat the jailed Protestant terrorist Billy Wright and the subsequent retaliatory shooting in County Tyrone of a Roman Catholic Seamus Dillon While the conservative British newspaper the Daily Telegraph demanded the resignation of the Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam on the grounds that she was responsible for both these things Irish newspapers generally backed her up The Irish Times in fact sounded like a loyalist British newspaper when it demanded greater security at the Maze if the government any government loses control of the prisons it has lost everything and insisted that the British generated peace process may have to adjust to the wind but is unlikely to be sunk by the latest atrocities The great massacre of chickens in Hong Kong took place after an improvement in chicken sales from 10 percent to about 50 percent of normal since the avian flu crisis began according to the South China Morning Post Only one Hong Kong family was identified as having eaten chicken for the traditional Chinese winter solstice celebration Dec 25 but many other chickens were reported to have been bought though not eaten as traditional offerings to the gods The flu crisis caused the Cathay Pacific airline to stop serving chicken on its flights to Taiwan where panic was high though it continued to serve Brazilian frozen chicken on other flights In Hong Kong itself said the SCMP fast food chains and hotels had switched to serving frozen chickens from the United States According to the same newspaper Malaysian crime syndicates have been ripping off chicken deprived Hong Kong gourmets by passing off cheap fish as the highly prized red arowana Found only in certain Indonesian rivers red arowana retails for more than 5 000 per fish Common forms of yellow green and silver arowana were made to appear like red arowana by being treated with hormones imported from Singapore the fish were then smuggled into Japan Taiwan and Hong Kong Another food crisis was reported from Australia where the Sydney Morning Herald reported that an estimated 800 out of 30 000 flocks of sheep in New South Wales were infected with OJD Ovine Johnes disease a wasting disorder similar to leprosy in humans The crisis had been made worse by a dispute over compensation payments that had caused most sheep farmers in NSW to refuse to allow their flocks to be tested for the disease In South Africa which recently banned Hong Kong chickens the Johannesburg Star reported that a woman had been trampled and kicked to death by an ostrich at a farm near Cape Town while her husband already badly injured by the same bird lay helplessly by for hours on a dirt road The same newspaper reported the disappointment and grave concern expressed by South African President Nelson Mandela over the detention without charges on Christmas Day of the Zambian founder president and independence hero Kenneth Kaunda by the current Zambian president Frederick Chiluba who claimed that Kaunda had been implicated in an attempted coup d tat last October The opposition Zambian newspaper the Post which bills itself as Zambia s Leading Independent Newspaper published a long and lively editorial condemning the arrest of Kaunda as a national and international disgrace and a lasting shame which renders the entire Government of the Republic of Zambia utterly ludicrous It claimed that Kaunda s innocence of involvement in the coup had been confirmed previously to President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe by Chiluba whom it called a liar and crook and described as primitive and uncultured not even fit to be a village headsman In Britain the Sunday Telegraph reported exclusively that billionaire philanthropist John Paul Getty II 65 had sealed his love affair with Britain by taking out UK citizenship after 25 years residence in this country The heir to what was once the world s largest private oil fortune received his British passport in the week before Christmas and immediately revoked his US nationality the newspaper said The American Government is by contrast thought to be very disappointed by the development
