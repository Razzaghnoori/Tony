 America in the Doghouse A worldwide chorus of outrage greeted the U S Senate s refusal to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty but the Daily Telegraph of London was a rare dissenter In a rather limp editorial Friday it described Sen Richard Lugar R Ind an opponent of the CTBT as a scholarly moderate highly respected legislator whose views should be taken seriously The instruments for the control of the evil of nuclear proliferation must be effective it said It is such questions that the Senate vote has rightly raised The Telegraph also ran an article by Richard Perle a former U S assistant secretary of defense attacking British French and German leaders for trying to influence the Senate vote through an article in the New York Times Why didn t the Senate congratulate its friends Blair Chirac and Schr der on their wise and timely counsel he asked I suspect that one reason is that the Senators have actually read the treaty and understand how deeply flawed it is how unlikely it is to stop nuclear proliferation or even nuclear testing and how it has the potential to leave the United States with an unsafe unreliable nuclear deterrent In domestic affairs no one would seriously propose that the police and criminals come together and sign agreements under which they accept the same set of restraints on their freedom of action British papers were otherwise unanimous in their condemnation of the Senate In the liberal Guardian foreign affairs columnist Martin Woollacott said Republican senators sent out a dismal message of American selfishness American foolishness and American readiness to put her own safety first whatever the consequences for the rest of us A Times of London editorial said the vote was a serious blow to America s political and moral authority and that the Senate Republicans by exploiting the opportunity to inflict a very public defeat on a lame duck President have done their country and their allies a grave disservice The Independent ran an article jointly authored by Professor Harald Muller director of the Peace Research Institute in Frankfurt Germany and William Walker professor of international relations at the University of St Andrews Scotland who said the vote was deplorable and reflected a situation in which American policy is increasingly being shaped by people with isolationist or even worse a supremacist agenda They want to expand military programs weaken international institutions and run the world by flaunting power An op ed piece in the Financial Times said the vote underlined the extent to which international considerations have been pushed to the fringes of American politics The broad consensus about US responsibilities in the world has fractured In Paris Le Monde s main front page headline Friday was America Reopens the Nuclear Arms Race and the paper said in an editorial that in the essential area of nuclear nonproliferation the United States has set the worst possible example It concluded The world s greatest power will from now on be less credible on the international scene Le Figaro in a signed editorial by Pierre Rousselin used exactly the same phrase as Le Monde when it called the vote an unprecedented snub un camouflet sans pr c dent to a president of the United States Bill Clinton s credibility is now damaged perhaps irredeemably as he embarks on his last year at the White House French people will easily remember the United States virulent campaign against our nuclear tests in the Pacific Rousselin wrote At that time in 1996 Bill Clinton defended the CTBT to get himself re elected Today Washington has no lessons to give anybody In a report from Washington Le Figaro told George W Bush that he is now the candidate of a blind reactionary and inward looking party The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung of Germany said the vote was a rejection of security through international cooperation That after the Senate s decision is what the Europeans should be thinking about most The Washington correspondent of La Repubblica of Rome put some of the blame on Clinton for not resigning over the Monica Lewinsky crisis This terrible defeat more so for all of us than for the image of America was exactly what was feared might happen in those days of 1998 when Clinton was forced to admit in public to his own pathetic errors as a man and to his own unforgivable lies as a president and therefore had to undergo the indignity of a public trial over the Monica affair The price for his survival in office has been paid now and been paid by the rest of the world In one of the two nuclear powers on the subcontinent the Times of India said in an editorial that it is now absolutely certain that neither Russia nor China will ratify the CTBT It said Clinton s credibility abroad has suffered a very serious setback not only because of the Senate decision but also because of the Pakistani military ignoring US advice on restoring the democratic process in their country
