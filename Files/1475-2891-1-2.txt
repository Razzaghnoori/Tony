 Background Vitamin E is an essential nutrient the main lipid soluble antioxidant and plays a significant role in protecting biological membranes and lipoproteins from damage caused by free radicals generated during lipid peroxidation 1 2 3 Recent information suggests that vitamin E also has functions unrelated to its role as an antioxidant 4 Vitamin E is often equated only with alpha tocopherol since this form is the most potent in protecting the fetuses of pregnant female rats from death and resorption Vitamin E is however not a single compound and refers to at least four tocopherols alpha beta delta and gamma tocopherol and four tocotrienols alpha beta delta and gamma tocotrienol Alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol see Figure 1 are the two major forms of vitamin E found in human plasma and tissues Under in vitro conditions alpha and gamma tocopherol have very similar abilities to inhibit lipid peroxidation in large unilamellar liposomes 5 The dietary intake of gamma tocopherol is at least two times that of alpha tocopherol in Western diets The levels of alpha tocopherol in human plasma are nevertheless about four times higher than those of gamma tocopherol Both alpha and gamma tocopherol are absorbed from the intestine and secreted into chylomicrons equally well 6 7 The selective retention of alpha tocopherol in plasma is attributed to a number of factors such as the hepatic alpha tocopherol transfer protein alpha TTP which preferentially incorporates alpha tocopherol over gamma tocopherol into very low density lipoprotein 8 9 10 Indeed the affinity of the different forms of vitamin E for the alpha TTP protein appears to be a primary determinant of their plasma levels 8 In addition there is evidence suggesting that gamma tocopherol is preferentially catabolized to a water soluble form 2 7 8 trimethyl 2 beta carboxyethyl 6 hydroxychroman or gamma CEHC by side chain oxidation 11 12 It is also possible that a more rapid cellular uptake of gamma tocopherol and removal from plasma could contribute to the preferential maintenance of alpha tocopherol in plasma A more rapid cellular accumulation of gamma tocopherol compared to alpha tocopherol would also have major physiological consequences The protection of subcellular organelles and cellular DNA from free radical damage is likely to be primarily dependent upon intracellular vitamin E levels as opposed to plasma vitamin E levels Surprisingly there have been very few studies comparing the cellular uptakes of alpha and gamma tocopherol Tran and Chan 13 found a preferentially uptake three fold higher after four hours of incubation of gamma tocopherol compared to alpha tocopherol in cultured human umbilical endothelial cells In contrast Jiang et al 14 found a similar incorporation of both alpha and gamma tocopherol into RAW264 7 macrophages and only a slightly higher 30 incorporation of gamma tocopherol compared to alpha tocopherol in A549 endothelial cells In this investigation we studied the uptake and depletion of alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol as well as their quinone oxidation products see Figure 2 by RAW264 7 murine macrophages There are no previous studies on the cellular uptake tocopheryl quinones We found that gamma tocopherol was taken up more rapidly and accumulated to higher levels than alpha tocopherol in RAW264 7 macrophages In addition we found that presence of gamma tocopherol dramatically increased the cellular uptake of alpha tocopherol We also describe a novel high pressure liquid chromatography HPLC method for simultaneously separating and quantifying levels of alpha tocopherol alpha tocopheryl quinone gamma tocopherol and gamma tocopheryl quinone Methods Reagents and materials RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red cell

Enrichment of tocopherol or tocopheryl quinone in culture medium A 50 l aliquot of tocopherol or tocopheryl quinone solution in ethanol was placed in glass tube and dried under N 2 After the addition of 1 0 ml of 7 5 BSA the mixture was vortexed for 2 min 74 0 ml culture medium added and the mixture vortexed again for 2 min The final concentration of tocopherol or tocopheryl quinone in the culture medium was determined by HPLC see below Uptake and depletion of tocopherols or tocopheryl quinones in cells To define the time course of tocopherol or tocopheryl quinone accumulation adherent cells 2 10 6 well were subcultured in 12 well falcon tissue culture plates with medium enriched with about 5 M tocopherol or about 0 5 M quinone 3 ml well After 6 hr the uptake phase the medium was replaced with fresh medium without tocopherol or quinone and the depletion of tocopherols or quinones followed for an additional 4 hours the depletion phase During the course of the cell culture experiment a 400 l aliquot of medium was removed every 2 hr and placed in a glass vial for tocopherol or quinone measurement and the remaining medium removed The adherent cells in the well were washed three times with 1 0 ml of PBS and the cells overlaid with 400 l of lysis buffer 1 Triton X 100 in pH 7 5 20 mM HEPES buffer with 0 1 mM EDTA scraped and collected into a glass vial for tocopherol analysis by HPLC and for protein determination by the BCA protein assay Pierce Rockford IL For each experiment three wells were used per time point and each experiment was performed in duplicate Statistical comparisons were made by use of the Student s t test Tocopherol or tocopheryl quinone measurement by HPLC with electrochemical detection The medium sample or cell sample was mixed with 1 0 ml ethanol and 1 0 ml hexane containing 10 g ml 2 6 di tert butyl 4 methylphenol BHT and rac 5 7 dimethyl tocol as an internal standard The rac 5 7 dimethyl tocol internal standard was found to be very useful since it did not elute in the same position as gamma tocopheryl quinone as does tocol 2 methyl 2 4 8 12 trimethyltridecyl chroman 6 ol which is typically used as an internal standard After vortexing

Synthesis and purification of alpha tocopheryl quinone or gamma tocopheryl quinone FeCl 3 6H 2 O 1360 mg was dissolved in 30 ml ethanol and 530 mg of alpha tocopherol or gamma tocopherol was dissolved in 40 ml ethanol Both solutions were mixed and placed in water bath at 50 C After 3 hr a 35 ml aliquot of the reaction mixture was placed in a separatory funnel mixed with 50 ml of ether washed with 50 ml of water then washed with 50 ml of 0 15 M EDTA to chelate Fe ions After the ether layer was dried by evaporation in a rotary evaporator the crude quinone oil was dissolved in 10 ml ethanol and stored in a freezer at 20 C The crude sample of tocopheryl quinone was purified using a HPLC system equipped with a Dynamax PC UV M Multiple Wavelength Detector Rainin Woburn MA a model 2350 HPLC Pump a C18 Column 5 mm 250 mm ISCO Lincoln NE Results The uptake and depletion of tocopherols separately and together Confluent RAW264 7 macrophages were incubated with either 5 6 M alpha tocopherol or 4 9 M gamma tocopherol Figure 3A or with both tocopherols together Figure 3Bwith alpha tocopherol at 4 6 M and gamma tocopherol at 5 2 M and the uptake of tocopherols measured during 6 hours of incubation Uptake is defined as the net difference between tocopherol transported into the cells and loss due to catabolism and or in vitro oxidation After 6 hours the medium with tocopherols was removed and replaced with medium not containing tocopherols and depletion of tocopherols followed for 4 hours After 6 hours of incubating macrophages with either alpha or gamma tocopherol Figure 3A the intracellular levels of gamma tocopherol were at least six fold higher than the levels of alpha tocopherol p 0 001 A major goal of this research was to determine if alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol interacted with each other so as influence their uptake and depletion Figure 3Bshows the uptake and depletion of alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol when both were incubated together with macrophages It is clear compare Figure 3Ato 3B that the presence of gamma tocopherol considerably enhanced the uptake of alpha tocopherol p 0 001 The presence of alpha tocopherol did not however markedly enhance the uptake of gamma tocopherol After washing with fresh medium without tocopherols the macrophage levels of both alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol decreased but the depletion of gamma tocopherol was always faster than that of alpha tocopherol The changes in tocopherol levels expressed as nmoles well in the medium were also measured during both the uptake and depletion phases and these data are provided in Tables 1 for alpha tocopherol or gamma tocopherol and 2 for alpha tocopherol plus gamma tocopherol In order to make meaningful comparison Tables 1and 2also provide the cell content of tocopherols expressed as nmoles well The data in Tables 1and 2indicate that only a small percentage of the tocopherols lost from the medium during the uptake phase are recovered in the macrophages This suggests that a considerable amount of tocopherol is lost during incubation by catabolism oxidation The recovery of alpha tocopherol during the uptake phase was however greater when gamma tocopherol was present It is interesting that the depletion of alpha tocopherol from the medium during the uptake phase was always greater than that of gamma tocopherol yet the cellular uptake of gamma tocopherol was always greater than that of alpha tocopherol Tables 1and 2also indicate that gamma tocopherol decreases from RAW264 7 macrophages more rapidly than alpha tocopherol during the depletion phase Tocopheryl quinones see Figure 2 are likely products formed by the oxidation of tocopherols Table 3shows the initial distribution of alpha tocopherol or gamma tocopherol and their quinone products both in the medium and in cells as well as the distribution after 6 hr of incubation in the cell system These data show that the nmoles of tocopherol that accumulated in cells after 6 hr is very small compared to the amount in the medium For the data in Table 3 for example the original amount of alpha tocopherol in the medium was 17 0 nmole well but the amount present in cells after 6 hr was just 0 16 nmole well i e less than 1 0 of the original amount in the medium The original amount of gamma tocopherol was 14 8 nmole well and the amount present in cells after 6 hr was 0 86 nmole well which is 5 8 of the original amount in the medium If tocopheryl quinones were the only catabolic oxidation products formed during incubation with the macrophages then the nmoles of tocopherol plus the nmoles of tocopheryl quinone in the medium and in the cells should be constant Table 3clearly shows that the sum of the tocopherol and its quinone product decreased over the 6 hr experiment suggesting that products other than the tocopheryl quinone were formed during the experiment Moreover these data show that after 6 hr of incubation 1 cellular alpha tocopheryl quinone levels were generally higher than those of gamma tocopheryl quinone 2 cellular tocopheryl quinones levels were always much lower than cellular tocopherol levels This latter point suggests that the low cellular levels of alpha tocopherol compared to gamma tocopherol levels shown in Figure 3A as compared to Figure 3B cannot be explained by the simple cellular oxidation of alpha tocopherol to alpha tocopheryl quinone with no further catabolism or oxidation After 6 hr macrophages incubated with both alpha and gamma tocopherol accumulated about 0 5 nmole more alpha tocopherol than did macrophages incubated with alpha tocopherol alone If in the absence of gamma tocopherol 0 5 nmole of alpha tocopherol were converted to alpha tocopheryl quinone and no further catabolism occurred than this should be recovered in cells The data in Table 3indicate however a cellular accumulation of only about 0 03 nmoles of alpha tocopheryl quinone Moreover macrophages actually had a lower content of alpha tocopheryl quinone when incubated with alpha tocopherol alone then when incubated with both alpha and gamma tocopherol together Although gamma tocopherol promotes the cellular uptake of alpha tocopherol it clearly did not do so by dramatically protecting alpha tocopherol from oxidation to alpha tocopheryl quinone with no further catabolism oxidation of alpha tocopheryl quinone The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones separately and together RAW 264 7 macrophages were incubated with 0 6 M alpha tocopheryl quinone or 0 4 M gamma tocopheryl quinone alone Figure 4A or with both together Figure 4Bwith 0 6 M alpha tocopheryl quinone and 0 4 M gamma tocopheryl quinone and the uptake and depletion measured as described above Figure 4indicates that alpha tocopheryl quinone accumulates to higher levels than gamma tocopheryl quinone e g at 6 hours the difference is significant at p 0 001 Similarly alpha tocopheryl quinone was lost from the cells more rapidly during the depletion phase These results are consistent with those in Table 3 which always indicate a higher intracellular concentration of alpha tocopheryl quinone compared to gamma tocopheryl quinone Table 4shows the initial distribution of alpha tocopheryl quinone or gamma tocopheryl quinone in both the medium and cells and the distribution after 6 hr of incubation with each quinone separately or both quinones together Only a very small fraction of the gamma tocopheryl quinone lost from the medium was taken up by the RAW264 7 macrophages i e 2 when gamma tocopheryl quinone was incubated by alone and 2 when gamma tocopheryl was incubated along with alpha tocopheryl quinone In the case of alpha tocopheryl quinone there was substantially greater recovery i e 23 when alpha tocopheryl alone was incubated with the macrophages and 35 when alpha tocopheryl quinone was incubated along with gamma tocopheryl quinone The data in Table 4clearly show that gamma tocopheryl quinone was oxidized and or catabolized more rapidly than alpha tocopheryl quinone The data in Table 4also indicate that cellular quinone uptake of was not influence by an interaction between alpha and gamma tocopheryl quinones Discussion The uptake and depletion of tocopherols separately and together Our results consistently show that gamma tocopherol was taken up more rapidly and accumulated to higher intracellular levels than alpha tocopherol Moreover the presence of gamma tocopherol markedly promoted the uptake of alpha tocopherol by macrophages When macrophages were incubated with alpha tocopherol or gamma tocopherol individually the macrophage level of alpha tocopherol was just 10 20 of that of gamma tocopherol Figure 3A In marked contrast when macrophages were incubated with both alpha and gamma tocopherols together the cellular level of alpha tocopherol were 70 80 after 6 hr that of gamma tocopherol Figure 3B There were no marked changes in the levels of gamma tocopherol caused by the presence of alpha tocopherol Tocopherol quinones were considered to be likely oxidization products of the tocopherols The increased cellular uptake of alpha tocopherol caused by gamma tocopherol could be caused by gamma tocopherol protecting alpha tocopherol from in vitro oxidation to its quinone form However the data in Table 3show that gamma tocopherol does not slow the oxidation of alpha tocopherol to alpha tocopheryl quinone In the presence of gamma tocopherol the cellular levels of alpha tocopheryl quinone were even higher than in its absence Table 3 It is possible however that gamma tocopherol may protect alpha tocopherol from catabolism or in vitro oxidation into products other than quinones The data in Table 3certainly suggest that products other than quinones were produced when the macrophages were incubated with tocopherols Those metabolites could very possibly be water soluble products such as alpha CEHC or gamma CEHC that were not measured in this investigation It is not clear why our result differ from those reported by Jiang et al 14 who also measured the uptake of alpha and gamma tocopherol separately in RAW264 7 macrophages but not both together Since gamma tocopherol is depleted from macrophages more rapidly than alpha tocopherol the time interval between removal of the tocopherol enriched medium and cell harvesting could be an important variable Our results are however qualitatively very similar to those reported by Tran and Chen 13 for human endothelial cells although these investigators did not directly compare the results from incubating cells with alpha tocopherol and gamma tocopherol separately or together The uptake and depletion tocopheryl quinones separately and together When macrophages were incubated tocopheryl quinones see Figure 4 the cellular levels of alpha tocopheryl quinone were always found to be higher than that of gamma tocopheryl quinone independent of the presence of gamma tocopheryl quinone The data in Table 4suggest that alpha tocopheryl quinone is fairly stable in the cell incubation system compared to gamma tocopheryl quinone Physiological significance of the results It is not known if the in vitro results of this study are relevant to the in vivo conditions It is interesting however that in an animal model graded levels of dietary gamma tocopherol in a diet containing a constant level of alpha tocopherol were found to increase the levels of alpha tocopherol in serum and most tissues 16 This remarkable result has yet to be reproduced in humans but certainly suggests an interaction between dietary gamma tocopherol and alpha tocopherol similar to that reported here on the cellular level The potential health related significance of gamma tocopherol is being increasingly recognized 17 Conclusions Our data suggests that gamma tocopherol could play a significant role in modulating intracellular antioxidant defence mechanisms Moreover we found the presence of gamma tocopherol dramatically influenced the cellular accumulation of alpha tocopherol i e gamma tocopherol promoted the accumulation of alpha tocopherol If these results could be extrapolated to in vivo conditions they suggest that gamma tocopherol is selectively taken up by cells and removed from plasma more rapidly than alpha tocopherol This could in part contribute to the selective maintenance of alpha tocopherol in plasma compared to gamma tocopherol List of abbreviations TOH RRR alpha tocopherol TOH RRR gamma tocopherol TQ RRR alpha tocopheryl quinone TQ RRR gamma tocopheryl
