 The Last Gringo The hot news in Nicaragua these days The escalators at Managua s first two shopping malls are besieged by kids who enthralled by this new technology go up the down staircase Then there s the saga of the dozen crummy border villages that tried to secede and join Costa Rica where gasoline is cheaper Thanks but no thanks said the Costa Ricans Or political dirty tricks Nicaraguan style Did the Sandinistas really sic a swarm of killer bees on an enemy campaign rally If these stories didn t make your newspaper s front page it s probably because there s hardly anyone left here to report them A decade ago when the contras and Sandinistas were willing proxies for the final great showdown of the Cold War a Daniel Ortega press conference could easily draw 100 foreign reporters double that if he had a captured American spy or some other bauble to show off Everybody had a correspondent here I remember one reporter identifying herself as the bureau chief for Dance magazine as she asked a question at a press conference I guess she was checking out reports that the Soviets were using Nicaragua as a base to smuggle Bolshoi ballerinas to the guerrillas in El Salvador Today as the chief of the Miami Herald s bureau I m practically the last gringo journalist left in Managua The only other U S daily with a Central American bureau is the Los Angeles Times with an El Salvador office Sometimes the isolation makes me feel like I m trapped in one of those post holocaust movies from the 50s where the lead character wakes up to discover that everyone else has been wiped out by killer robots from Venus Not that there aren t consolations In the old days reporters begged in vain for interviews with the nine top Sandinista comandantes And correspondents who wrote unflattering stories about the Sandies I was one could find themselves tossed aboard a plane bound for Costa Rica These days the average Nicaraguan official would stand on his head and eat a bug if that would entice a foreign reporter to do an interview My fax machine fairly hums with offers of briefings from Cabinet ministers who can t quite believe their country is no longer the lead item on the White House daily briefing They are inevitably surprised that I don t want to drive eight hours across the country to see the first shovel of dirt turned for a new road linking two villages that most people in Managua have never heard of much less anyone in the United States In part my popularity may stem from the dread officials feel at dealing with the newly unchained local press Nicaraguan journalists muzzled under four decades of the Somoza dynasty and then 11 years of the Sandinistas have become the most aggressive in Central America They take the freedom to ask any question they want with a disconcerting literalness Last year Tomas Borge the sole surviving founder of the Sandinista Party was being interviewed on a Managua radio station After Borge droned on for a few minutes about the world economy the reporter broke in Comandante what everyone really wants to know is if the rumors all these years are true Do you just have one ball What are you talking about Borge replied My wife just had twins Here you want to see them He wasn t talking about his newborn infants As I tuned to another station the reporter was still pleading with Borge to keep his pants on Testicular journalism still isn t part of my beat But I have covered The opening of Managua s first McDonald s The vice president actually came out to dedicate it pronouncing the occasion as nothing less than the attainment of civilization When foreign investors see that big M they know we re not running around in loincloths The controversy that led to a fistfight at the Miss Nicaragua pageant right in front of Miss Congeniality s father as one scandalized local paper put it The winner was a blue eyed blonde naturally provoking protest that she was a gringa ringer The resurgence of Nicaragua s movie theaters which practically croaked when the Sandinistas made them show an endless parade of odes to Soviet industrial workers Nonetheless Daniel Ortega and the boys deserve some credit for a censorship policy that prevented their countrymen from being exposed to Oliver s Story which they saw as an example of class betrayal a heroic working class girl takes a place in the ruling class and Annie Hall too occupied with the trivial problems of the petite bourgeoisie In the 1980s you never traveled alone in the countryside if you could possibly help it you wanted help handy if you blundered into a firefight or a minefield Not that many of us would have known what to do in either situation our attempts at self protection were mostly laughable One regular precaution before driving out into the boonies used to be marking a giant TV with adhesive tape on the back and side windows which we believed was easy to spot shorthand for don t shoot I m a reporter In 1987 Stephen Kinzer of the New York Times encountered a contra patrol in northern Nicaragua chatted with the men amicably for an hour or so and then got ready to leave Could I ask you a question before you go asked the contra commander What the hell does TV mean anyway Lately the only time reporters banded together to travel outside Managua was during Hurricane Mitch and that had as much to do with crying on each other s shoulders as it did with self protection Police reporters in the United States complain about having to call up families of murder victims but try interviewing a kid who just saw 44 members of his family swallowed in a mudslide Happily the memory of the hurricane is starting to fade though it was rekindled in March when President Clinton came through Central America scattering relief programs in his wake like victorious GIs tossing chocolate bars to school kids in 1945 As the last gringo reporter in Nicaragua I naturally put in my bid for an interview with Clinton which was politely declined by the White House handlers All American reporters care about is Monica Lewinsky and we re trying to get away from that one U S official told me I wonder if he d heard Tomas Borge s radio interview
