 Lessons From Las Vegas Long standing oral traditions and Caribbean Stud video poker machines apparently don t mix that well Or so I d like to deduce from the recent decision of the Navajo Nation to reject casino gambling on its reservation land in Arizona and New Mexico After all Navajo culture is replete with stories cautioning against the dangers of gambling and this is the second time in three years that the Navajo have said no to casinos At a time when Las Vegas has become America s model of economic development the Navajo vote may seem a grand self defeating gesture But while Las Vegas is certainly a tremendous economic success story it s not clear that the story can be easily duplicated elsewhere That s not because playing the house s role in a gambling operation requires Feynmanian genius The economics of casino gambling are pretty straightforward Every day people walk through the doors mill around for a while and eventually leave and when they leave they have as a group somewhere between 78 percent and 81 percent as much money as they had when they came in That s it Some of the people of course lose more than 20 percent of their money and in doing so effectively transfer their cash to those who lose less or who rarity of rarities actually win But the casinos cut of the drop the total cash that s converted into chips or tokens is remarkably unvarying As a character in Mario Puzo s Fools Die puts it Percentages never lie We built all these hotels on percentages The percentage will always stand fast There is only one real exception to this rule the high roller and it is only a short term exception Click for some examples What this means is that running a casino is not really about gambling at all You do have to keep people from cheating and you do have to keep deadbeats like Adnan Khashoggi who bankrupted the Sands in 1983 by not paying his markers from skipping out on their debts But the real business of casinos is not about what happens once a player sits down at a blackjack table or in front of a slot machine The real business is about getting that player to sit down at your table and not the table at the casino across the street In that sense a casino is like a restaurant or a movie theater except that there s one crucial difference Every casino is selling the exact same product There are minor variations in the kinds of slot machines you ll find and casinos are always coming up with mindless variants on the classic table games but in essence what every gambler is buying is simply opportunity Or as a casino CEO has said they re buying time Time to win and of course time to lose Whether you re in Circus Circus or Luxor or the MGM Grand or the Golden Horseshoe though the time is the same McDonald s can sell a Big Mac to distinguish itself from Burger King but the Mirage can t advertise Blackjack to distinguish itself from Harrah s What the Mirage can and does advertise instead is itself Las Vegas is often described as the future of America because its entire existence depends on a service economy In another way though the city has already defined America s present From the start since casinos couldn t compete on price or essential product they competed on the basis of their brand names Nike vs Reebok is a global version of Caesars vs the Tropicana Branding in fact has driven the curious evolution of Las Vegas from gamblers paradise to neo Orlando The casino industry has certainly supported endeavors like MGM Grand s theme park and Excalibur s medieval jousts and its restaurant called Lance a Lotta Pasta as a way of attracting visitors who might otherwise gamble at their local riverboats But a more important factor behind Las Vegas ever more elaborate themed casinos is the competitive pressure to set oneself apart I m not convinced that knowing that there s a 150 foot replica of the Statue of Liberty in front of the New York New York casino makes the experience of playing blackjack inside any different but the statue is not the product The statue is just the advertising And it s advertising that has worked very well Much as we Rat Pack nostalgists might mourn the loss of the Flamingo and the Sands there s no quarreling with Las Vegas economic performance The city has led the nation in job growth for each of the past 15 years Casino revenue from gambling has risen every year since 1982 1983 and casinos are now deriving a greater percentage of their revenue from their hotel and restaurant business Something like 10 billion in new construction projects are currently underway in the city including Paris which will feature a 50 story replica of the Eiffel Tower Unlike Atlantic City where casinos have struggled for profitability since the mid 1980s Las Vegas has proven itself almost impervious to recession In part this is because Las Vegas has itself become one of the world s most powerful brand names And in part it s because Nevada s business climate is a supply sider s dream no corporate income tax no personal income tax no local earnings tax no inventory tax no capital stock tax no franchise tax no admissions tax no inheritance tax low property tax and a right to work state Difficult not to make money when you re the only game in town in a Third World city state It s a flippant comparison to be sure but it s one that illuminates the reasons why gambling has not been an economic panacea for other parts of the country parts where the New Deal actually had an impact for example More than that the comparison also gets at what may be the most interesting thing about Las Vegas namely that it s the economic equivalent of an exporting powerhouse In this particular case the buyers come to Las Vegas to purchase the goods rather than having them shipped out of the city but the economics are the same Casinos thrive not because of the business they do with local customers but because of the business they do with people from around the country and around the world Call Las Vegas a Far West Tiger and you wouldn t be too far off the mark Branded service driven globalized and unhindered by the state the Las Vegas casinos do sound uncannily like models for the economy into which we appear to be moving Hunter S Thompson once said of Circus Circus the casino where craps players and flying trapeze artists mingle beneath a billowing canopy that it was what hepcats all over the world would be doing on Saturday night if the Germans had won World War II But it might be that Circus Circus is already a version of what we all do not just on Saturday nights but rather every day of the week All of us but the Navajo that is
