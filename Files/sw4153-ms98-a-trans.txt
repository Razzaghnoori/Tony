        okay well um i used to work in a day care center i worked in um in all the different areas of the day care center and  it is     uhhuh   they can be deceiving to people i did not work there long because i couldnt handle the the treatment that the children got and this is supposed to be a very wellknown center here in Tyler who had two or three um centers   hm umhum   all over you know the um city and they would um be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left   yeah   so um i think you need to make you know if you do do day care centers you know you should make frequent checks and um to check in on them when theyre not expecting it because they do do things differently when youre not around       so   well that i know what the things that we kind of looked at is is you wanna see how many teachers you have   umhum   and and how many kids they have and how they break it up   right   because we had  we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in   umhum   it it was a really good one and in fact it worked out for us because my wife we kind of bartered my wife did artwork for them and then you know so we got our uh day care free   umhum   but they didnt have enough teachers   well this one was set up good i mean they had two teachers to every room   and uhhuh   um sometimes three and they had a good system like so when you walked in everything looks cool   umhum   the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough they did not show them care to these small children who are being left   umhum   um they one time i picked up this little boy who was crying and the owner came and just chewed me up one side and down the other you know he said you are gonna have every child in here wanting you to pick them up   hm     and i said no this child was crying and needed some comfort you know what is your problem   yeah   so um   did did they separate them by age group   yes   because id think you know i think thats one thing that was important   right they did they had like um the the crawlers the babies that didnt walk in one room the ones that were starting to walk in one room then they had like the um three three year olds     uhhuh   upper fours lower fours upper fives lower fives you know just like that   yeah   you know they really did separate them well it was just the teachers themselves   it it sound yeah it sounds like to me your  your concern would be to make sure that they are loving people   right but yeah that theyre not   affectionate people that theyre theyre kind of parents  maybe parents themselves or something   yeah their system right but their but their system was was great but um the   uh   you know the caring just wasnt there the one woman that taught that did the babies   umhum   i worked with her and she was fabulous she loved them babies and she loved them and cared for them but um every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and   umhum   um you know would make me a nervous wreck so you know   yeah i i i think thats probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and PhDs and all that kind of thing and you know know all the technical stuff but if they dont reach out and touch the kids then that doesnt do any good   yeah these kids are just in a day care center all day   yeah   and uh with no any type of emotional you know getting love getting care theyre just there   yeah   you know going through this routine which is lousy   and the other the other group that we had was kind of interesting the other one we went to the it was a husband and wife team and we knew them from other associations but   umhum   uh it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one and i think you know she would shed put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff you know but he was actually the more um the more uh what demonstrative type the more loving he would you know laugh with the kids and play with the kids and   umhum uhhuh   and it it it was kind of interesting to see that that that it was actually the man in the group that that did that side of it and   yeah you dont see that much   yeah so they had a really nice balance we liked that one in fact it was called Humpty Dumpty Play School or something but they also did   thats cute   they also did some of the teaching things and then they had um you know obedience obedience was important   yeah that has to be with a day care center   and you know so they used you know they used uh oh i think they used the you probably heard where you know where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself   ive never heard of that thats thats a new one on me   and its its its one uh i cant remember what they call it exactly but you you just stand them in front of the clock and you know it has a second hand that goes around   uhhuh   and they have to stand there
