 Weatherbox Although Chatterbox regards Slate as a near flawless source of news and commentary it does tend to neglect an important aspect of life the weather Not once has Slate ever run the headline Whew It s a Scorcher or posted in the middle of a cold weather snap a photograph of a Florida orange covered with frost Incidentally Chatterbox has long suspected the AP keeps on file a single photograph of a frost covered orange and uses it every year How would anyone know the difference These thoughts are inspired by the current miserable heat wave It s a scorcher According to USA Today America s newspaper of record on the subject of weather it s supposed to be upward of 100 degrees today on the Great Plains and in parts of the southeast and southwest Click here for USA Today s incomprehensible but gripping radar movie of the continental United States As the century draws to a close hottest summer records are being broken left and right making it harder and harder to pooh pooh evidence that greenhouse gasses are warming the planet However Chatterbox isn t really interested today in expounding on the terrifying menace of global warming It s too hot Instead Chatterbox finds himself wondering How hot can it get As is usually the case when interesting questions are raised the answer can be found on the Web in this case by consulting the National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration popularly known as NOAA and pronounced exactly like Chatterbox s last name Chatterbox has always felt that the usual way temperature records are expressed by comparing today s temperature in Topeka to the temperature in Topeka on this same exact day in previous years is a bit of a cheat With 365 days in a year and a limited database of temperatures recorded in Topeka during previous years you ve got a pretty decent chance of breaking weather records pretty frequently No doubt there are serious scientific reasons for recording all time temperature highs this way but a nonscientific reason may be that it makes it easier for weather authorities to soothe an aggrieved public There there You re right Nobody s ever had to endure what you re enduring today But Chatterbox wants to know What s the hottest it s ever been anywhere According to NOAA the hottest it s ever been anywhere on Earth at least as far as we know was 136 degrees Fahrenheit That was the temperature recorded in El Azizia Libya on Sept 13 1922 The second hottest it s ever been anywhere was right here in the United States when it hit 134 degrees at the Greenland Ranch in Death Valley Calif on July 10 1913 The third hottest it s ever been anywhere was in Tirat Tsvi in what would soon be Israel 129 degrees on June 21 1942 The coldest it s ever been anywhere interestingly was recorded in July July 23 1983 when it hit minus 129 degrees in Vostok Antarctica NOAA also has hottest ever data for America firsters who only really care about how hot it gets in the U S On the Temperature Extremes page go to All Time Temperature Maximums by State and click on Table PDF As previously stated the hottest day in the U S was July 10 1913 when it hit 134 degrees in Death Valley Calif The second hottest day in the U S was June 29 1994 when it hit 128 degrees in Lake Havasu City Ariz and 125 degrees Fahrenheit the third highest temperature ever recorded in the U S in Laughlin Nev The third hottest day in the U S was June 27 1994 presumably the same heat wave when it hit 122 degrees in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico Chatterbox assumes the temperature had nothing to do with the radioactivity of the WIPP s contents The second hottest and third hottest records would seem to support the theory that global warming is making the planet or at least the United States much hotter Probably the data isn t perfect Can it really be true that the hottest temperature ever recorded in Hawaii was 100 degrees on April 27 1931 Chatterbox has never been to Hawaii but was under the impression it had a warm climate Chatterbox would also like to take this opportunity to implore pedants not to write in and point out that during earlier geological eras the worldwide climate was vastly different from what it s been during the last century which is about as far back as record keeping goes Still the NOAA statistics do seem to show that hot as it is we should all stop bitching and get back to work It s been hotter
