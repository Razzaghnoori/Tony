                            The only people who dont know in  that animal research is irrelevant for human        disease are those who dont understand it or those who benefit from it As a physician        clinical researcher and former animal researcher I know that though they are our closest        genetic relatives primates have failed as research models virtually whenever they have        been used        As a partial list of failures allow me to submit the notorious forced smoking        experiments which allowed cigarettes to be promoted widely for decades the abject failure        of a quartercentury of primate research on AIDS to provide any useful insights the false        leads and dangerous vaccines produced during polio research verified by Albert Sabin        himself the failure of primate studies to improve risks for birth defects and premature        births and the failure of monkey studies to identify nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug        cardiovascular risk         The         PLoS Medicine editors state in hopeful language that the Lassa fever        vaccine was successful in four monkeys and thus is a suitable agent for human study         Recall that VaxGens AIDS vaccine AIDSVAX showed great success in primate studies but        was an abject failure in two human clinical trials including a trial of over         injection drug users in Thailand  and a multinational trial of over  highrisk        individuals         Consider the fruitless decadeslong effort to produce an AIDS vaccine in primates the        failure to produce even a single case of human AIDS in any primate studied or the failure        to identify even one useful AIDS drug from primate studies Genetic and physiological        imperatives dictate that no animal model even higher primates gives information        applicable to humans The Human Genome Project  tells us that there is sufficient        genetic diversity among humans that pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic techniques will        have an increasing role in overcoming problems related to polymorphisms and other        variations We cant even apply scientific findings uniformly to humans and         PLoS Medicine is now promoting monkey research        I am very disappointed that         PLoS Medicine has regressed to reporting animal research It is        discouraging that in this era of rapid biomedical advancement and appropriate relegation        of animal research to the historical dustbin PLoS has chosen to reintroduce an        anachronistic medically discredited and unethical research tool to its reporting
