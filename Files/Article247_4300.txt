 Bradley Stumps Editor s note Jacob Weisberg has filed from Wednesday night s debate between Al Gore and Bill Bradley Click here to read it BEDFORD N H I caught up with Bill Bradley here today having not seen him outside of his debates with Al Gore for a couple of months A couple of things struck me about his appearance at a New Hampshire forum for candidates known as a Politics and Eggs Breakfast actually a quiche lunch with a commemorative wooden egg laid at each place setting as a souvenir The first thing I noticed was how much Bradley has improved as a public speaker Most of the time in my experience Bradley comes across more eloquently on the printed page that in his own speaking voice which has all the effervescence of day old champagne Today it seemed just the reverse Comments that might read as platitudinous rang with quiet force and sincerity Bradley spoke for nearly 45 minutes and held the attention of a large mostly conservative audience throughout with a mixture of gentle humor anecdote and explicit policy talk Of course Bradley has always been the opposite of Gore in that he radiates a sense of inner calm and comfort with who he is What seemed different today was that he also seemed far more present and charismatic than usual as he hopped discursively from observations on globalization to stories about his childhood in Missouri to jokes about basketball to his substantive proposal of the day which was a plan to eliminate 10 billion a year in corporate tax subsidies The other thing that struck me about Bradley s performance was the somewhat inconsistent quality of what one journalist recently described as his streak of civic mysticism There were points in the speech were I found myself entirely swept up in Bradley s call to political reengagement In one particularly strong riff Bradley talked about the need to turn globalization and rising prosperity into a more inclusive narrative in which ordinary people can locate themselves Another fine bit was the meaty part of his speech in which Bradley talked about how the growth of the tax loopholes that he is proposing to eliminate fosters a corrosive distrust of government Still another was the part about race where Bradley quoted Toni Morrison on her vision of a world in which race exists but doesn t matter But at other times Bradley s soul stirring rhetoric sounds pretty much like hooey as when he answered critics of his proposals to end child poverty and extend health insurance to all by repeating the mantra that in a world of new possibilities guided by goodness we can Beware of policy proposals that include a change in human nature as one of their essential requirements There was more of this kind of thing in yesterday s address on America in the New Millennium which I read but did not hear him deliver Some people say we can never achieve our special destiny Bradley concluded But I say in a world of new possibilities guided by goodness we can and we will At the press conference following this morning s speech I couldn t resist asking Bradley what that was supposed to mean What is our special destiny and who are the people who say we can never achieve it Bradley actually filled out the clich rather convincingly I think that our special destiny is to lead the world by the power of our example as a pluralistic democracy and a growing economy and to do so in a way that is consistent with the promise of the Declaration he said And who disagrees with that view People who get caught up in the current moment and don t have a longer view of our history and our potential Bradley said I could put a number of the Republicans in there but I decided not to do that As I mentioned Bradley s serious policy proposal of the day was to save 10 billion a year and 125 billion over the next decade by cutting corporate tax subsidies and cracking down on tax shelters This is a perfectly reasonable idea but it is undermined by two big flaws Flaw No 1 is that Bradley wants to crack down on tax subsidies for mining oil gas and grazing but leaves ethanol untouched The reason is obvious he s running in the Iowa caucuses on Jan 24 But the inconsistency glares By proposing to cut off tax subsidies only in states that don t have early primaries Bradley has actually undermined his case for cutting any subsidies at all Bradley s new pro ethanol position means that instead of ending tax favoritism he is merely trimming it in politically convenient places In answering a question about this Bradley seemed to leave the door open to changing his mind on ethanol for a second time when he finished his answer by saying There are many other things in the tax code that I might be revisiting so you don t know But asked to clarify his position on the matter Bradley said he would not revisit the tax subsidy for ethanol Flaw No 2 is that Bradley s loophole closing isn t politically astute enough in a way that the tax reform he accomplished in 1986 was Tax reform in the 1980s was a grand bargain it eliminated tax favoritism for some in exchange for lowering tax rates for all Bradley s latest proposal holds no such broad based appeal To cut tax subsidies without reducing rates is a tax increase However defensible as a way to increase federal revenues it has no prayer of Republican support To my mind this insufficient idea only raises the question of why Bradley hasn t yet come up with a more ambitious tax reform proposal An offer to do what he did in 1986 once again would command widespread support It would shift the debate with Al Gore to a subject Bradley talks about with total confidence and authority And it would provide Bradley should he win the nomination with an answer to the non reformist tax cut plans emanating from the Republican side Perhaps tax reform doesn t appeal to the new spiritualized side of Bradley It s just good government without any civic mysticism in it at all
