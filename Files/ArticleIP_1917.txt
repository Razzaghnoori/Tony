 Vulgar Keynesians Economics like all intellectual enterprises is subject to the law of diminishing disciples A great innovator is entitled to some poetic license If his ideas are at first somewhat rough if he exaggerates the discontinuity between his vision and what came before no matter Polish and perspective can come in due course But inevitably there are those who follow the letter of the innovator s ideas but misunderstand their spirit who are more dogmatic in their radicalism than the orthodox were in their orthodoxy And as ideas spread they become increasingly simplistic until what eventually becomes part of the public consciousness part of what everyone knows is no more than a crude caricature of the original Such has been the fate of Keynesian economics John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker Yet one of his unfortunate if unintentional legacies was a style of thought call it vulgar Keynesianism that confuses and befogs economic debate to this day Before the 1936 publication of Keynes The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them But macroeconomics the study of economy wide events like inflation and deflation booms and slumps was in a state of arrested development that left it utterly incapable of making sense of the Great Depression So called classical macroeconomics asserted that the economy had a long run tendency to return to full employment and focused only on that long run Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation and the loanable funds theory of interest which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run these theories might indeed be valid but as he memorably pointed out In the long run we are all dead In the short run he asserted interest rates were determined not by the balance between savings and investment at full employment but by liquidity preference the public s desire to hold cash unless offered a sufficient incentive to invest in less safe and convenient assets Savings and investment were still necessarily equal but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output In particular if investment demand should fall for whatever reason such as say a stock market crash the result would be an economy wide slump It was a brilliant re imagining of the way the economy worked one that received quick acceptance from the brightest young economists of the time True some realized very early that Keynes picture was oversimplified in particular that the level of employment and output would normally feed back to interest rates and that this might make a lot of difference Still for a number of years after the publication of The General Theory many economic theorists were fascinated by the implications of that picture which seemed to take us into a looking glass world in which virtue was punished and self indulgence rewarded Consider for example the paradox of thrift Suppose that for some reason the savings rate the fraction of income not spent goes up According to the early Keynesian models this will actually lead to a decline in total savings and investment Why Because higher desired savings will lead to an economic slump which will reduce income and also reduce investment demand since in the end savings and investment are always equal the total volume of savings must actually fall Or consider the widow s cruse theory of wages and employment named after an old folk tale You might think that raising wages would reduce the demand for labor but some early Keynesians argued that redistributing income from profits to wages would raise consumption demand because workers save less than capitalists actually they don t but that s another story and therefore increase output and employment Such paradoxes are still fun to contemplate they still appear in some freshman textbooks Nonetheless few economists take them seriously these days There are a number of reasons but the most important can be stated in two words Alan Greenspan After all the simple Keynesian story is one in which interest rates are independent of the level of employment and output But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating You may quarrel with the Fed chairman s judgment you may think that he should keep the economy on a looser rein but you can hardly dispute his power Indeed if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years here it is It will be what Greenspan wants it to be plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God But putting Greenspan or his successor into the picture restores much of the classical vision of the macroeconomy Instead of an invisible hand pushing the economy toward full employment in some unspecified long run we have the visible hand of the Fed pushing us toward its estimate of the noninflationary unemployment rate over the course of two or three years To accomplish this the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other And so all the paradoxes of thrift widow s cruses and so on become irrelevant In particular an increase in the savings rate will translate into higher investment after all because the Fed will make sure that it does To me at least the idea that changes in demand will normally be offset by Fed policy so that they will on average have no effect on employment seems both simple and entirely reasonable Yet it is clear that very few people outside the world of academic economics think about things that way For example the debate over the North American Free Trade Agreement was conducted almost entirely in terms of supposed job creation or destruction The obvious to me point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be regardless of the U S Mexico trade balance never made it into the public consciousness In fact when I made that argument at one panel discussion in 1993 a fellow panelist a NAFTA advocate as it happens exploded in rage It s remarks like that that make people hate economists What has made it into the public consciousness including alas that of many policy intellectuals who imagine themselves well informed is a sort of caricature Keynesianism the hallmark of which is an uncritical acceptance of the idea that reduced consumer spending is always a bad thing In the United States where inflation and the budget deficit have receded for the time being vulgar Keynesianism has recently staged an impressive comeback The paradox of thrift and the widow s cruse are both major themes in William Greider s latest book which I discussed last month Although it is doubtful whether Greider is aware of the source of his ideas as Keynes wrote Practical men who believe themselves quite exempt from any intellectual influence are usually the slaves of some defunct economist It is perhaps not surprising that the same ideas are echoed by John B Judis in the but when you see the idea that higher savings will actually reduce growth treated seriously in Looking for Growth in All the Wrong Places Feb 3 you realize that there is a real cultural phenomenon developing To justify the claim that savings are actually bad for growth as opposed to the quite different more reasonable position that they are not as crucial as some would claim you must convincingly argue that the Fed is impotent that it cannot by lowering interest rates ensure that an increase in desired savings gets translated into higher investment It is not enough to argue that interest rates are only one of several influences on investment That is like saying that my pressure on the gas pedal is only one of many influences on the speed of my car So what I am able to adjust that pressure and so my car s speed is normally determined by how fast I think I can safely drive Similarly Greenspan is able to change interest rates freely the Fed can double the money supply in a day if it wants to and so the level of employment is normally determined by how high he thinks it can safely go end of story No to make sense of the claim that savings are bad you must argue either that interest rates have no effect on spending try telling that to the National Association of Homebuilders or that potential savings are so high compared with investment opportunities that the Fed cannot bring the two in line even at a near zero interest rate The latter was a reasonable position during the 1930s when the rate on Treasury bills was less than one tenth of 1 percent it is an arguable claim right now for Japan where interest rates are about 1 percent Actually I think that the Bank of Japan could still pull that economy out of its funk and that its passivity is a case of gross malfeasance That however is a subject for another column But the bank that holds a mortgage on my house sends me a little notice each month assuring me that the interest rate in America is still quite positive thank you Anyway this is a moot point because the people who insist that savings are bad do not think that the Fed is impotent On the contrary they are generally the same people who insist that the disappointing performance of the U S economy over the past generation is all the Fed s fault and that we could grow our way out of our troubles if only Greenspan would let us Let s quote the Feb 3 Business Week commentary Some contrarian economists argue that forcing up savings is likely to slow the economy depressing investment rather than sparking it You need to stimulate the investment decision says University of Texas economist James K Galbraith a Keynesian He would rather stimulate growth by cutting interest rates So increasing savings will slow the economy presumably because the Fed cannot induce an increase in investment by cutting interest rates Instead the Fed should stimulate growth by cutting interest rates which will work because lower interest rates will induce an increase in investment Am I missing something To read the reply of Vulgar Keynesian James K Galbraith in which he explains green cheese and Keynes click here
