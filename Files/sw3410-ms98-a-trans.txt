                 okay   okay what do you feel are everyday occurrences that are invasion of privacy in your opinion   well uh i guess uh one that comes to mind is um the way the credit bureaus operate   i i agree one hundred percent especially whenever its like  they keep stuff on your record like for seven years and they dont bother like   yeah   i know at one time i was unemployed or something and and they kept they kept it on my record for like seven months even though that i seven years even though that like you know i i um yeah they sent a letter in but they didnt bother to include the letter  for the explanation where i got behind or anything like that   yeah yeah we had a problem with them back oh i dont know five or seven years ago where it uh some stuff was on there that was incorrect and it was and it was real hard to   and well that too   get it  get it fixed  but they um they share that information with a lot of people that   well that happened with me i um i had had a a doctors appointment at at uh University of Chapel Hill Hospital   uhhuh   and there was two William Parrishes and they were charging me for this other person and i went through like six months of you know because they kept billing me and billing me and billing me i was like  you know im not this person im not seeing  seeing  you why are you charging me   uhhuh   and i mean they turned me into the Credit Bureau they even held my taxes   oh they did   yeah i mean it went a long ways and it   you mean they held your uh refund   over my refund that you you know and it was it was a mess and finally i got it straightened out but it it took me almost a year to get that straightened out and it was for something you know uh   huh   another William Parrish that wasnt paying his bills or either else they wasnt you know charging him   yeah   but it was really weird   huh well lets see um   i think the biggest thing i think that are is not just well not for the average person i i think like the medias is is getting a little bit overboard on the invasion of privacy on like different on public figures yeah that  some of the stuff that theyre theyre like   on public figures   like the tabloids and stuff are are saying that its like really like i think Joan Collins i believe is believe right now is having a lawsuit against   yeah   think its the National Enquirer for taking pictures of her when she was getting undressed in her bedroom and  published them and   oh yeah huh   i some things i think should be private i would hate to know if i was getting undressed in the bedroom somebody was taking pictures of me you know   yeah someone someone between the curtain was huh   and i believe theyve got  something now i read in some science magazine or something where they have a infrared camera that can take pictures like with inside your house to see if you have any drugs or anything like that i think thats kind of an invasion of privacy too   hm yeah i guess um another thing comes to mind is some of the quote unquote routine uh traffic stops they do that man they did that around Raleigh all the time   yeah   you know they set those roadblocks up   oh yeah to see if youve been drinking and driving   yeah yeah and you know and and uh boy they just you know they have no reason to be stopping you and they just uh they stop you and and uh look in your car a little bit you know lean in the windows anyway   well i i i had something like that happen to me too um i worked for the Hilton for a while as a banquet waiter and um one night whenever i got off work you know it was like two or three in the morning  it was a big party and you know i pulled out of that little road where you know pull out of the Hilton on the old Wake Forest Road going home   umhum umhum   and i looked up and it was i seen you know blue lights on and i thought God i just pull on the road it cant be me so you know like i pulled off the road and i pulled you know pulled off the side road and the car followed you know the police car followed you know pulled me over and next thing i know there was eight cop cars and they all got out with guns and everything   youre kidding   and it it really scared me really bad   and they were just stopping you because you were leaving a a night spot probably   well uh they they said that i it was suspicious behavior and i looked at you know the highway patrol and i said how could it be suspicious behavior of me uh waiting to a light was green making a left hand turn in the correct lane whats to make you know and they had they went all through my car   yeah     and you know while  the highway patrolman pulled me back there or and and i i think they gave me a ticket for driving without my license   they did search your car though   they did yeah without my permission   oh huh   so i i thought id i was really offended by that i thought that was a severe invasion of privacy   yeah   and i think some of the laws that theyre trying to pass right now um especially in North Carolina uh i mean we
