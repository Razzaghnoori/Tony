                                 Someday Maybe Youll Buy Cars on the Web                        The promise of the Internet from a business perspective is the promise ofa frictionless economy in which buyers and sellers are able to meet withoutmediation And since perhaps the most disliked mediators out there are cardealers they would seem to be natural and inevitable casualties of consumersmigration to the Internet Very few people like bargaining with car dealersAuto companies dont like their nowalmostrequired reliance on rebates to movecars And the whole phenomenon of the huge dealership with acres of cars eachdepreciating by the minute seems like an archaic way of handling distributionand since someone has to make all those cars production            At the same time the smartest auto manufacturers like Ford and Toyota arealready working hard at integrating the Internet into their operations anddeveloping buildtoorder systems Eventually you should be able tocommunicate directly with Ford pick out the car you want with the options youwant and have it delivered to your door just like a Dell PC Ford wont haveto make cars its not going to be able to sell and you wont have to hagglewith some dealer This was what I was imagining at the end of the lastMoneybox when I wrote about GM truly becoming an Internet company            The only problem with this picture of the future is that its currentlyagainst the law Just about every state in the United States in fact hasstrong franchise laws that limit the size and scope of dealerships effectivelyregulate the allocation of vehicles to dealers bar largevolume discounts andprevent dealers from selling across state lines Needless to say actuallybuying a car on the Internet is therefore impossible which is why all thecarbuying services on the Net are actually local filtering devices allowingyou to comparisonshop Thats an obvious advance over the old days but itsstill a long way from a real Internet market            In essence local car dealers have been able to create and maintaingeographic oligopolies through the use of franchise laws Thats one reason whythe categorykiller approach to carselling exemplified by AutoNation whichjust announced it was closing its usedcar superstores has floundered sobadly If WalMart werent able to offer lower prices in its stores because itwas barred from getting volume discounts from its suppliers it would hardly bea powerhouse retailer Economics of scale come into play only if things getcheaper the bigger you get Otherwise youve just got more overhead            But while the demise of the car superstore should probably be lamented thereally nefarious impact of the state franchise laws is unquestionably on thenotyetexisting Net market Those laws are in part a product of older concernsabout vertical integration so that they served the function of keeping theautomakers from selling direct to consumers And they also allow states tokeep a tight grip on the tax revenue from auto sales But they are almosttextbook examples of bad regulation which accomplish nothing but putting lotsof money in dealers pockets            Even if Congress say were to pass a law permitting the direct sale ofcars that wouldnt mean that automakers would embrace direct sellingimmediately An article in the new Fast Company  for instance suggeststhat Toyotas management was hesitant to Webify the company precisely becauseit was afraid that would lead to direct sales which would alienate dealersand break the law And its plausible that a car is such a big purchase thatmany people are going to be uncomfortable buying one online sight unseen Butas an alternative one can easily imagine something like what Gateway does nowwith its Country Stores where you can testdrive a PC and then order itimmediately online There will of course be auto manufacturers that even adecade from now are still working through the traditional dealer system But ifyou look at the PC industry and the difference between the success ofdirectselling Dell and Gateway and the struggles of dealercentric Compaq andIBM the idea that those auto manufacturers who stay tied to dealers willflourish seems dubious indeed            Of course first all those laws have to be changed
