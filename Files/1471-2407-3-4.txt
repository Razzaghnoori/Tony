 Background Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck is diagnosed in over 40 000 Americans each year resulting in over 12 000 annual deaths 1 Carcinomas of the head and neck are often associated with multiple areas of dysplasia or carcinoma in situ CIS in noncontiguous mucosa as well as with the development of second primary cancers of the aerodigestive tract The concept of field cancerization hypothesizes that regions of the mucosal epithelium although normal in appearance are preconditioned by chronic exposure to carcinogenic agents thus priming them for the subsequent development of invasive lesions 2 The use of modern molecular biological techniques has supported and greatly expanded our understanding of the cancer field effect Analysis of X chromosome inactivation in female patients with multiple head and neck cancers shows that distinct tumors arise from regional clonal growths of phenotypically normal mutated preneoplastic cells 3 4 5 a phenomenon similar to that also observed in liver cancer patients with cirrhosis 6 Long term smoking and alcohol abuse are strongly associated with these clonal growths in the upper aerodigestive tract reviewed in 7 Frequent allelic loss at chromosomal locations 2q 3p 4q 6p 6q 8p 8q 9p 11q 13q 14q and 17q is observed in head and neck cancer 4 8 9 10 11 Molecular studies of hyperplastic dysplastic CIS and invasive head and neck lesions indicate that loss of heterozygosity at chromosomal locations 3p 9p and 17p are early events in head and neck carcinogenesis 4 12 Specific tumor suppressor genes such as FHIT 3p14 2 p16 9p21 p53 17p13 1 and RB1 13q14 2 have also been shown to be mutated in head and neck cancer 4 13 Nevertheless the large number of additional chromosomal regions with high frequencies of allelic loss in head and neck cancer strongly suggests that many suppressor genes still remain to be identified The mannose 6 phosphate insulin like growth factor 2 receptor M6P IGF2R maps to chromosome location 6q25 27 14 a chromosomal region predicted to contain a head and neck tumor suppressor gene 10 11 It encodes for a receptor that functions in intracellular lysosomal enzyme trafficking transforming growth factor beta activation and IGF2 degradation reviewed in 15 16 Granzyme B internalization by the M6P IGF2R is also required for cytotoxic T cells to induce apoptosis in cells targeted for death resulting in this receptor being referred to as a death receptor 17 Elevated IGF2 levels during murine development arising from M6P IGF2R deficiency result in cardiac abnormalities cleft palate fetal overgrowth and perinatal lethality 15 18 Furthermore large offspring syndrome frequently observed in cloned animals is associated with epigenetic changes in gene regulation and decreased M6P IGF2R expression 19 Thus the M6P IGF2R plays a crucial role in regulating mammalian fetal growth and development The M6P IGF2R is also mechanistically involved in the genesis of human cancer 6 20 21 22 23 24 M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity coupled with intragenic loss of function mutations in the remaining allele is a common event in human cancers 6 20 21 22 Inheritance of a tandem repeat polymorphism in the 3 UTR of M6P IGF2R furthermore predicts for enhanced susceptibility to oral cancer 25 Moreover tumor cell growth is inhibited when M6P IGF2R expression is restored to normal while it is increased when gene expression is reduced 26 27 28 29 The results of these mutational and functional studies clearly demonstrate that the M6P IGF2R possesses the characteristics necessary to be classified as a tumor suppressor gene 30 We tested in this investigation the hypothesis that M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity in locally advanced non metastatic squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck is associated with poorer patient prognosis The patients used in this study were enrolled in a randomized trial of twice daily radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy 31 We report herein that M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity occurs frequently in head and neck cancer and that it predicts for poor therapeutic outcome Methods Patient Population and Treatment Patients with locally advanced but non metastatic squamous carcinoma of the head and neck who participated in or who met eligibility criteria but declined enrollment in a phase 3 trial of hyperfractionated irradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy constituted the study population Details of their treatment and outcome have been published previously 31 Briefly patients receiving radiation therapy alone were given a continuous course of 125 cGy twice daily to a total dose of 75 Gy Patients assigned to combined modality treatment received 70 Gy via a split course of 125 cGy twice daily They also received two cycles of cisplatin and 5 fluorouracil during the first and sixth weeks of irradiation All protocols were approved by the Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board Tissue Microdissection and M6P IGF2RLoss of Heterozygosity Analysis Microdissection of malignant and surrounding normal non mucosal tissue was performed as previously described 6 20 21 tumor histology was confirmed by a pathologist R T Volmer Paraffin embedded sections 10 m in thickness were microdissected following deparaffinization and the tissue was then digested by proteinase K in tris EDTA buffer at 55 C for 4 hr Six different gene specific polymorphisms were used to assess head and neck tumors for M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity 32 33 A tetranucleotide ACAA insertion deletion polymorphism in the 3 UTR of the M6P IGF2R 34 was detected with 2 rounds of nested polymerase chain reaction PCR The forward and reverse first round PCR primers were KK ACAA F1 5 GGAGAGTTTGCCTGTTCTATGCC 3 and KK ACAA R 5 CAAATCAATCTTTGGGC AGG 3 respectively The forward and reverse second round PCR primers were KK ACAA F2 5 AGTCAGGAATGGCTGCACC 3 and KK ACAA R 5 CAAATCAATC TTTGGGCAGG 3 respectively the KK ACAA F2 primer was end radiolabeled with 33P dATP prior to PCR Each round of PCR consisted of 31 cycles at 94 C for 20 seconds 55 C for 40 seconds and 72 C for 45 seconds Platinum Taq DNA polymerase GibcoBRL Baltimore MD was used for DNA amplification The PCR product 5 l containing the 3 UTR ACAA insertion deletion polymorphism was mixed with 5 l of formamide based stop buffer heated to 95 C for 10 min placed on ice electrophoresed on a 6 acrylamide gel and then exposed to film Five identified single nucleotide polymorphisms c 901C G exon 6 c 1197A G exon 9 c 1737A G exon 12 c 2286A G exon 16 and c 5002A G exon 34 were also analyzed following 2 rounds of nested PCR the exon specific forward and reverse primers have been previously described 32 33 The exons containing these polymorphisms were PCR amplified from genomic DNA using PCR conditions identical to those described above The single nucleotide polymorphisms used to determine M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity were assessed by direct sequencing of PCR products according to the manufacturer s protocol Thermo Sequenase USB Corporation Cleveland OH Figure 1 M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity frequency is independent of the polymorphism used for its estimation p 0 3 Taq DNA polymerase can introduce sequence errors during PCR amplification and unequal amplification of the two alleles can result in false positive detection of loss of heterozygosity Thus both the normal and tumor DNA templates were amplified in three independent PCR reactions and assessed for tumor M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity Due to the potential of contaminating the tumor tissue sample with normal stroma allele loss in informative patients was defined as a 50 decrease in the ratio of the polymorphic band intensities in the tumor tissue versus that in the surrounding normal stromal tissue this was quantified using a densitometer Statistical Analysis Relapse free survival represented the primary clinical endpoint Locoregional control was evaluated as a secondary endpoint since the vast majority of head and neck cancers recur either locally at the primary site or regionally in the neck cause specific survival was also assessed All curves were computed using the Kaplan Meier method starting from the time of study entry Curves for different subgroups were compared by the Cox Mantel test A chi squared test was used to compare the clinical characteristics between M6P IGF2R informative and excluded patients and informative patients with and without M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity A p value 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant Results M6P IGF2RLoss of Heterozygosity Analysis The study population consisted of 116 patients enrolled in a phase III randomized clinical trial comparing radiation alone versus radiation plus concurrent chemotherapy for advanced head and neck cancer 31 plus an additional 23 patients who met all the entrance criteria but declined enrollment A total of 52 tumors could not used in this investigation because either the tissue slides were unavailable or the DNA could not be PCR amplified Of the remaining 87 patients 56 64 were informative i e polymorphic and the tumors in 54 30 56 of these patients had M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity Figure 1 The M6P IGF2R informative patients and those not used in this study were insignificantly different from each other for the clinical characteristics of gender age race smoking history baseline hemoglobin Karnofsky performance status tumor resectability treatment tumor stage nodal stage overall staging and site of primary tumor Table 1 Clinical Outcome The median follow up for surviving patients enrolled on this trial 31 is now 76 months range 2 to 128 months M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity was associated with significant reductions in 5 year relapse free survival 37 95 CI 20 to 54 vs 65 95 CI 46 to 84 p 0 05 locoregional control 46 95 CI 28 to 64 vs 76 95 CI 58 to 94 p 0 03 and a non significant reduction in cause specific survival 43 95 CI 25 to 61 vs 69 95 CI 49 to 89 p 0 1 Since the clinical trial demonstrated a significant benefit for patients receiving radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy 31 outcome was also analyzed according to whether or not patients received chemotherapy Figures 2 3 4 Patients in the radiotherapy RT loss of heterozygosity LOH group had significantly lower 5 year relapse free survival 23 95 CI 2 to 44 vs 69 95 CI 46 to 92 p 0 02 Figure 2 locoregional control 34 95 CI 11 to 57 vs 75 95 CI 54 to 98 p 0 03 Figure 3 and cause specific survival 29 95 CI 5 to 53 vs 75 95 CI 54 to 96 p 0 02 Figure 4 than those in the RT non LOH group These results indicate that M6P IGF2R allelic loss results in poor patient outcome when RT alone is employed since all other measured clinical characteristics of the head and neck cancer patients were comparable to those in patients with a non mutated M6P IGF2R tumor suppressor gene Table 1 Patients in the RT LOH group also fared worse than those in the combined modality CM LOH group although the differences were not statistically significant in these smaller subgroups 5 year relapse free survival 23 95 CI 2 to 44 vs 54 95 CI 26 to 82 p 0 18 locoregional control 34 95 CI 11 to 57 vs 61 95 CI 34 to 88 p 0 25 and cause specific survival 29 95 CI 5 to 53 vs 59 95 CI 30 to 88 p 0 12 Patients in the CM LOH group had 5 year relapse free survival locoregional control and cause specific survival that were statistically indistinguishable from those in the CM non LOH group p 0 2 Combined modality therapy also did not provide any significant benefit over radiation alone for patients with a non mutated tumor M6P IGF2R p 0 2 Thus patients with a non mutated M6P IGF2R who received RT alone had the same long term outcome as the overall population of patients who received RT and concurrent chemotherapy 31 This implies that M6P IGF2R allelic loss may help to identify a group of head and neck cancer patients who can be adequately treated with RT alone without exposure to the added morbidity of combined modality therapy The development of second primaries was independent of the M6P IGF2R mutation status in the primary tumor p 0 8 Three of the 30 10 patients with M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity and two of the 26 8 patients without loss of heterozygosity at this locus developed second primaries Discussion M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity occurs frequently in human breast liver and lung cancer 6 20 21 22 and the remaining allele of 30 to 50 of these tumors contains an intragenic loss of function point mutation in the ligand binding domains 35 The M6P IGF2R is also commonly mutated in gastrointestinal and endometrial malignancies because its coding sequence contains a poly G region that is a mutational target in tumors with mismatch repair deficiencies and microsatellite instability 23 24 Functional studies show that the introduction of an exogenous wild type M6P IGF2R into human colorectal cancer cells with a single inactivated allele significantly decreases growth rate and enhances apoptosis 26 Conversely loss of M6P IGF2R expression promotes cancer cell growth by increasing intracellular signaling from both the insulin like growth factor I receptor and the insulin receptors 36 We demonstrate herein that loss of heterozygosity at the M6P IGF2R locus in head and neck cancer is also associated with poor patient prognosis Loss of heterozygosity in cancer can occur either because of chromosomal deletion or somatic recombination resulting in uniparental disomy 37 Comparative genomic hybridization studies in head and neck cancer 10 38 demonstrate that 6q deletion frequency 50 is similar to that which we observed at the M6P IGF2R locus This provides evidence that M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity in head and neck cancer is due primarily to either gene deletion or chromosomal loss rather than somatic recombination Since chromosomal deletion can affect more than one gene M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity alone does not rule out the possibility that other adjacent genes also have a tumor suppressor function in head and neck cancer However our previous finding that both alleles of the M6P IGF2R are mutated in greater than 50 of squamous cell carcinomas of the lung 22 supports our postulate that the M6P IGF2R is a key head and neck cancer tumor suppressor gene at chromosome location 6q The clinical trial from which the tumor specimens used in this study were derived showed improvements in relapse free survival locoregional control and overall survival for those patients randomized to combined modality therapy 31 This investigation established that patients whose tumors had M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity and were treated with radiotherapy alone had a significantly worse prognosis than their counterparts with a non mutated allele Conversely patients with an intact M6P IGF2R had a similar prognosis whether they received radiotherapy alone or combined modality treatment Thus our findings suggest that head and neck cancer patients with tumor M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity would benefit most from combined modality treatment The mechanism by which M6P IGF2R allelic loss in head and neck tumors increases the effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy is presently unknown but it is clearly of clinical importance A primary function of this receptor in placental mammals involves the degradation of extracellular IGF2 M6P IGF2R allelic loss would therefore result in enhanced cellular bioavailability of this potent growth factor thereby potentially increasing both cell proliferation and resistance to apoptosis 29 The M6P IGF2R also facilitates the activation of TGF a potent cell growth inhibitor that is secreted in an inactive form reviewed in 15 16 M6P IGF2R mutation is therefore one mechanism by which cancer cells can become refractory to TGF s mitoinhibitory effect We have previously shown that M6P IGF2R mutation in squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is highly correlated with increased TGF concentrations in both the tumor and patient plasma 39 Elevated TGF in the latter stages of tumor progression directly contributes to enhanced tumor angiogenesis metastasis formation and a decreased host immune response reviewed in 40 Together these findings predict that tumors with a mutated M6P IGF2R would be more resistant to therapy than those with an intact receptor Moreover if some chemotherapeutic agents are not only directly cytotoxic to cancer cells but also reduce tumor production of growth factors such as IGF2 and TGF adjuvant chemotherapy would be more useful in treating tumors with a mutated M6P IGF2R as observed in this study M6P IGF2R is normally imprinted in mice with only the maternal copy of the gene being expressed 41 In contrast both copies of the M6P IGF2R are expressed in humans because genomic imprinting at this locus was lost in the primate lineage approximately 75 million years ago 42 Importantly restoration of biallelic M6P IGF2R expression in mice results in a marked reduction in offspring weight late in embryonic development that persists into adulthood 43 This demonstrates that M6P IGF2R allelic loss or haploid insufficiency markedly enhances cell proliferation and or survival during fetal development Therefore mutation of even a single allele of the M6P IGF2R in human somatic cells is predicted to also promote cell growth Haploid insufficiency for tumor suppressor genes such as Nf2 p27 Kip 1 p53 Ptch Pten and TGF is known to promote tumor formation reviewed in 44 45 Yamada et al 6 demonstrated that in patients chronically infected with hepatitis B and or hepatitis C viruses the M6P IGF2R is mutated not only in hepatocellular carcinomas HCCs but also in the phenotypically normal hepatocytes adjacent to these tumors Interestingly only one M6P IGF2R allele is inactivated in the adjacent cirrhotic tissue even when both alleles are mutated in the HCC These findings are consistent with normal appearing preneoplastic hepatocytes forming clonal masses in the liver because M6P IGF2R haploid insufficiency affords them with a selective growth and or survival advantage relative to normal hepatocytes 46 The liver is not the only organ in which regions of normal appearing tissue have a clonal origin Entire lobules and large ducts of normal breast tissue can be derived from a single progenitor cell 47 and LOH at various chromosomal locations is frequently detectable in morphologically normal lobules adjacent to breast tumors 48 Lung tumors and head and neck tumors that develop in a localized region also often have a common clonal origin 3 4 49 The high frequency of M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity observed in the head and neck tumors in this study suggests that the phenomenon of field cancerization first described by Slaughter and his colleagues 2 in 1953 may in part result from the clonal proliferation of mucosal epithelial cells with M6P IGF2R allelic loss Conclusions The observations in this study raise the intriguing possibility that selection of head and neck cancer patients for concurrent chemotherapy can be based upon the intratumoral mutational status of M6P IGF2R Furthermore since M6P IGF2R loss of heterozygosity in squamous cell carcinomas is highly correlated with an elevated plasma TGF level 39 patient prognosis may potentially be assessed by a simple blood test This would be desirable since the morbidity of combined modality therapy is greater than that of radiotherapy alone 50 51 Competing interests None declared Authors Contributions TAJ conceived of the study performed LOH
