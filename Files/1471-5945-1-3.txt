 Introduction Non melanoma skin cancer which includes squamous cell carcinoma SCC and basal cell carcinoma BCC is the most common type of cancer in the United States and results in substantial morbidity and treatment costs It is estimated that 1 2 million new cases of non melanoma skin cancer occur each year in the United States and the majority of these are believed to result from heavy exposure to ultraviolet UV light from the sun 1 The incidence of skin cancer is predicted to increase even further because of the depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer 2 The development of chemopreventive strategies for skin cancer is thus a high public health priority Residents of Arizona experience a three to seven times greater incidence of non melanoma skin cancer than the general population in the United States 3 Our goal is the development of oral agents that will complement primary skin cancer prevention Black tea has been shown to have a preventative effect against skin carcinogenesis in animal models 4 5 6 7 8 9 Of particular interest are the accumulating data that reflect similar potential health benefits associated with both the epicatechins of green tea and the theaflavins of black tea 10 11 Several mechanisms may be responsible for the anti initiation and anti promotion properties of black tea 5 10 11 12 13 14 15 Citrus in addition to providing an ample supply of vitamin C folic acid potassium and pectin contains a host of active phytochemicals The mutagenicity reducing activity per weight of peels of citrus fruits was considerably higher than that of their juices 16 The two main compositional differences between peel and juice components are that the peel contains a higher concentration of ascorbic acid than the juice and that the peel also contains higher concentrations of active components d limonene hesperidin naringin and auraptene than do the juice and pulp d Limonene which comprises 90 of citrus peel oil has demonstrated chemopreventive activity against a variety of chemically induced rodent cancers 17 18 19 20 21 22 Several mechanisms of action may account for the antitumor activities of d limonene 23 24 25 Among citrus bioflavonoids hesperidin and naringin have been tested as potential chemopreventive agents 26 27 In our previous studies we showed that citrus peel use 28 and consumption of hot strong black tea 29 were each independently associated with reduced risk of skin SCC Neither study however explored the potential for a joint or synergistic effect of tea and citrus consumption Therefore the present study sought to examine the independent and interactive roles of citrus peel use and black tea consumption in skin SCC in Arizona a population at high risk of skin SCC Subjects Methods Study population Subjects and methods of the Southeastern Arizona Health Study SEAHS have been described previously 28 29 Briefly SEAHS is a population based case control study that was conducted from 1994 1996 with cases of SCC of the skin randomly selected from persons identified through the Southeastern Arizona Skin Cancer Registry Cases were eligible if they were 30 years of age had a histo pathologically confirmed non metastatic SCC of the skin diagnosed within the past 4 months with no prior history of a skin cancer Control subjects were recruited through a random digit dialing process to reflect the age and gender distribution of the cases One control per household was invited to participate using modified Waksberg criteria 30 Control subjects were considered eligible if they had no prior history of skin cancer lived within the Tucson region and were within the age gender and ethnicity grouping All subjects 404 cases and 391 controls completed an extensive interview for demographic behavioral and past ultraviolet exposure information A subset of the total study population n 566 namely those who also completed 24 hour dietary recalls were asked to complete the citrus and tea consumption questionnaires yielding 450 subjects 234 cases and 216 controls in this study tea citrus Citrus tea questionnaires Citrus CQ and tea TQ questionnaires were developed after a series of focus groups Both questionnaires were tested for short and long term reliability as well as relative validity diet methods CQ asked detailed information on consumption of each type of citrus fruit and juice In addition the questionnaire asked how the juice was stored i e types of containers and whether citrus juices and citrus peel were added during food preparation and or food serving 28 TQ asked about usual tea intake over the past year as well as a lifetime consumption pattern and how the past year intake differed from the lifetime pattern amount or type or preparation techniques Detailed information was collected for the past year s tea intake for each type of tea consumed black green or herbal and hot or iced 29 Other variables All participants completed a structured interview detailing personal behavioral and demographic characteristics This interview instrument sought information on skin characteristics sunburns and tanning history use of suntan lotions and sunscreens residential history UV exposure during past year family history of skin cancer past medical history tobacco and alcohol use physical characteristics and demographic information All subjects also completed four 24 hour dietary recalls which included 4 randomly selected days within two weeks of the clinic visit Daily mean nutrient intakes were calculated with the use of the Minnesota Nutrition Data System 31 Quality control All interviews were conducted by trained experienced interviewers One interviewer conducted over 90 of the personal interviews and 100 of the dietary recalls and citrus and tea questionnaires At the time of CQ and TQ the interviewer was unaware of the case control status of the subjects She was given a computer generated list that included only names and phone numbers of subjects After each interview questionnaires were reviewed for completeness and coded Data entry was through screen based entry programs that included range checks Data analyses Distribution of demographic characteristics and potential risk factors were compared between cases and controls using t tests for continuous variables and Chi square X 2tests for categorical variables Chi square X 2tests for trend were also calculated To assess the risk of skin SCC with citrus peel use and black tea intake crude and adjusted odds ratios ORs with their 95 percent confidence intervals C I were estimated with logistic regression models We assessed the potential confounding effects of age sex education energy intake kcal day fat intake mean percent of kcal as fat retinol

vitamins vitamin A E and C or carotenoid intake alcohol intake smoking status education and daily hours of sun exposure did not alter any of the results and were excluded from the final model Age sex inability to tan after prolonged sun exposure number of current freckles on the arms and history of diagnosed and treated actinic keratosis AK were included in the final multivariate model All statistical analyses were done using STATA computer software 32 Results A total of 263 men and 187 women who had participated in the SEAHS are included in this current study Since this evaluation of citrus peel and tea consumption in relation to skin SCC was completed in a subset of the original participants we compared subjects who participated in this study with those who did not participate We found no statistically significant difference between the two groups in relation to case control status gender education smoking average hours in sun per day in past year and tanning ability Participants in the current study did report more AK history than subjects who did not participate in the study with the increase being consistent for cases and controls Table 1shows the distribution of cases and controls according to sex age smoking status alcohol intake reported tanning ability history of AK number of current freckles on the arms and daily hours of sun exposure during the past year Information from CQ and TQ as citrus peel use hot and iced black tea consumption are also included The study population is an older educated Southwestern United States population with 68 8 of

on the arms citrus peel use and hot black tea consumption showed a significant difference between cases and controls In this Arizona population 66 4 and 34 5 reported some tea drinking and some citrus peel use respectively during the past year Controls were more likely than were cases to report citrus peel use 39 2 versus 30 2 with an OR of 0 67 and hot tea intake 35 7 versus 26 1 with an OR of 0 79 Table 2shows the ORs for citrus peel use and tea intake controlling for the other variables The OR of skin SCC associated with any citrus peel use was 0 67 95 CI 0 45 0 99 Adjustment for hot tea intake resulted in a decrease in the OR to 0 55 95 CI 0 34 0 91 while adjustment for iced tea consumption did no change the OR OR 0 69 95 CI 0 45 1 05 Further adjustment for age gender AK tanning ability and number of current freckles on the arms resulted in marked decrease in ORs to 0 34 95 CI 0 18 0 62 and 0 54 95 CI 0 33 0 89 among hot and iced tea drinkers respectively Taking non tea drinkers as the reference group the OR of skin SCC was 0 79 95 CI 0 49 1 26 for drinkers of hot tea compared to 1 14 95 CI 0 76 1 72 for drinkers of iced tea After adjustment for citrus peel use the ORs increased to 0 87 95 CI 0 54 1 39 and 1 22 95 CI 0 81 1 84 for drinkers of hot and iced tea respectively However in the final model the ORs of skin SCC decreased to 0 65 95 CI 0 37 1 15 and 1 06 95 CI 0 37 1 15 among hot and iced tea drinkers respectively The independent and combined effects of citrus peel and hot black tea consumption are shown in Table 3 Among those who did not consume citrus peel 38 8 38 98 of the cases compared to 44 3 39 88 of controls consumed hot black tea p 0 44 Whereas among those who did report citrus peel use 59 0 23 39 of cases compared to 58 5 38 65 of controls consumed hot black tea p 0 96 On average 21 of the subjects reported consumption of both citrus peel and hot tea 16 8 in cases vs 24 8 controls Compared with those who did not consume hot black tea or citrus peel the adjusted ORs associated with sole consumption of hot black tea or citrus peel were 0 60 95 CI 0 30 1 23 and 0 30 95 CI 0 13 0 72 respectively Subjects who reported consumption of both hot black tea and citrus peel had a significant marked decrease in risk of skin SCC OR 0 22 95 CI 0 10 0 51 Similarly the independent and combined effects of citrus peel and iced black tea consumption are shown in Table 4 Among those who did not consume citrus peel 56 5 78 138 of the cases compared to 55 9 62 111 of controls consumed iced black tea p 0 92 Whereas among those who did report citrus peel use 74 6 47 63 of cases compared to 62 5 45 72 of controls consumed iced black tea p 0 13 On average 24 of the subjects reported consumption of both citrus peel and iced tea

0 46 1 45 and 0 32 95 CI 0 14 0 75 respectively Subjects who reported consumption of both iced black tea and citrus peel had lower risk of skin SCC OR 0 58 95 CI 0 30 1 12 Discussion Arizona has one of the highest risks of skin SCC worldwide and tea beverages as well as citrus products are commonly consumed by Arizonans This older Arizona population offered a unique opportunity to study potential associations between consumption of tea and or citrus peel and risk of skin SCC In this population two thirds of all subjects reported black tea consumption in the previous year compared to about one third reporting citrus peel use Our data showed that persons without skin cancer significantly consumed more citrus peel and hot black tea than did cases of skin SCC We have previously demonstrated that among Arizonans 29 black tea beverages were prepared and consumed in various ways and that iced tea beverages were more likely to be prepared diluted Laboratory investigations support the capability of citrus peel or its major constituents d limonene and also the ability of tea extract or its constituents tea polyphenols to reduce not only the incidence and tumor size of chemically induced tumors at several sites 4 8 9 17 18 20 22 but also the growth of various tumor cells in culture 11 33 Both d limonene representative of citrus peel and tea polyphenols representative of black tea are known to impact antiproliferative effects including apoptosis on neoplastic cells 4 34 35 36 37 Dietary d limonene has been shown to be effective in the chemoprevention and chemotherapy of cancer As a result its cancer chemotherapeutic activities are under evaluation in Phase I human clinical trials 38 39 Moreover much research has been focused on the potential use of flavonoids in citrus and tea as inhibitors of neoplastic transformation 40 and as free radical scavengers to prevent oxidative skin damage 41 42 Oxidative damage is one of the many mechanisms leading to skin cancer and other chronic diseases Black tea is a good source of antioxidants and addition of lemon to tea increases its antioxidant potential 43 Our data indicates that among older Arizonans citrus peel use and hot black tea intake were each independently associated with reduced risk of skin SCC However among these study subjects citrus peel use was associated with a more than 70 reduced risk for skin SCC whereas hot black tea consumption alone conferred 40 reduced risk for skin SCC Moreover the present study suggested that a dietary pattern that includes the consumption of both hot black tea and citrus peel markedly decreased the risk of skin SCC ORs 0 22 0 58 Even though iced black tea consumption alone was not associated with reduced risk of skin SCC OR 0 91 consumption of both iced black tea and citrus peel was associated with lower risk of skin SCC OR 0 58 Among Arizonans citrus peel was reported to be frequently consumed along with iced tea beverages at meals Some limitations and strengths of the study deserve consideration In case control studies the possibilities for recall and interviewer bias are a major concern Differential recall of tea and citrus consumption between cases and controls can lead to biased estimates of effect Furthermore since there was a lag between diagnosis of the skin cancer and interview average of 4 months there is potential for cases to have altered their behavior and to then report their recently changed behaviors Several steps were taken to reduce potential bias Standard questionnaires were administered to all subjects by a trained interviewer who was not aware of the case control status of the subjects at the time of the tea and citrus questionnaire administration There is some evidence however that skin cancer cases did recently alter their behavior for risk factors they thought were related to skin cancer For instance they reported similar recent past year exposure to the sun to the controls The interview did not record information on sun exposure experiences in the more distant past however given that skin SCC is related to other measures of high UV exposure i e history of actinic keratosis history of sunburns then the lack of a finding for a differential sun exposure history for cases and controls argues for a change in behavior since the diagnosis of the skin cancer However while it appears that the cases did modify some of their behaviors there is no evidence that they recently altered their consumption of tea or citrus products Also since there have been no prior studies of skin cancer occurrence and tea or citrus consumption it is unlikely that this population would have considered tea or citrus peel consumption or lack of consumption to be related to their risk of skin cancer Public perception of tea and citrus consumption has been that there would be no difference in the potential effect of tea or citrus based on different products This study controlled for important confounding factors including history of physician diagnosed actinic keratosis tanning ability and number of current freckles on the arms Consumption of citrus peel along with black tea appeared to be generally protective Significant independent inverse associations between citrus peel use and skin SCC were observed Moreover a synergistic and or additive effect s on skin SCC risk was observed when both citrus peel and black tea were consumed While this study was only of moderate sample size particularly when exploring relationships within subgroups of different consumption patterns we were able to observe a significant protective effect for citrus peel and hot black tea consumption in relation to skin SCC Competing interests Have you in the past five years received reimbursements fees
