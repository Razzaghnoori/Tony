 Who Pays for the Internet Even a fairly short midday telephone call from say Los Angeles to Paris can cost 10 Yet that same amount will buy you a month of an online service that includes unlimited e mail all over the world For 20 you can make one to three hours of long distance telephone calls Or for the same 20 you can surf the Web day and night for a month download as much data as your modem can handle enjoy unlimited e mail and even if you own the right software make as many telephone calls to New York or Paris or Timbuktu as your heart desires How is this possible Worldly cybernauts may find the question na ve though fewer know the answer than think they do To newcomers the economics of the Internet is among its greatest mysteries Herewith a primer First the wrong answer that the Internet is high tech pork The Defense Department created the Internet in the late 60s and the government supported the Internet heavily from the 70s till the early 90s But no more The last major subsidy ended in 1995 Now except for a few small shrinking and unnecessary federal grants the Internet is a commercial concern Telecommunications companies computer companies and Internet service providers ISPs built own and operate all the phone lines and computer networks that comprise the Net The real explanation of the Internet s cheapness lies in the difference between the telephone system and the Net A note The rest of this article applies to the United States The same basic rules apply to Internet users elsewhere except that they probably pay more for Internet service and lots more for phone service Consider a typical long distance telephone call from me in Washington D C to my aunt in San Francisco My long distance company which happens to be MCI gives me an uninterrupted real time circuit between my house and my aunt s In exchange I pay MCI about 20 cents for every minute I m connected Of that 20 cents MCI pays about 2 or 3 cents to my local phone company Bell Atlantic for carrying the call from my house to MCI s lines It pays another fraction probably 5 cents to Pacific Bell for delivering the call the last few miles to my aunt s house MCI pockets the rest The actual cost of a long distance call after all capital costs have been counted is only slightly more than that of a local call But for decades Congress and the FCC have mandated artificially cheap local phone service and artificially expensive long distance service MCI s payments to local phone companies called access charges are a subsidy It costs Pacific Bell less than a cent to deliver my call The other 4 cents are payback for giving my aunt cheap and unlimited local calls Now consider the Internet In one very important way using the Net is no bargain You need 2 000 worth of computer hardware to connect to it about 1 960 more than the price of a telephone But once you ve got the gear the Internet beats telephone costs for three significant reasons 1 The Internet exploits low local phone rates Unless you live somewhere remote you reach the Internet by making a local call to your Internet Service Provider Your ISP in turn leases super fast long distance fiber optic cable from MCI Sprint AT T regional Bells and other telecommunications companies These firms have plenty of fiber to spare These fiber optic lines carry your Internet traffic around the country delivering it to Network Access Points which link different networks like highway interchanges When your data reach a Network Access Point they hop on a line owned by another company and travel to their destination But because the Internet travels on leased lines the data entirely avoid the long distance phone companies own networks and therefore avoid the access charges the long distance companies must pay to local phone companies on normal telephone calls 2 Talk isn t cheap but data are ISPs can offer unlimited access on their lines for two reasons First it saves them billing costs telephone companies by contrast spend billions every year calculating who used what line and when Second Internet data transmission is remarkably efficient When you make a 10 minute long distance voice call the phone company maintains an open circuit from end to end You pay for every second even if you re on hold When you go online to check out a Web page you may spend 10 minutes reading the page and 10 minutes dialed into your ISP But you only use the Internet for a few seconds the time it takes to send your request to the page s Web server and for the server to deliver the page to you For the other 9 minutes and 50 plus seconds the ISP s long distance line is free Many Internet users can share a line that would need to be occupied full time by a telephone call 3 There are no guarantees on the Internet Telephone service is a promise You can be almost certain that you can complete a call immediately to anyone else with a phone Internet service is a shrug You can be reasonably sure but no more that you can send your data to another Internet user pretty quickly The Internet is an uncertain network because it is packet switched This means that data are broken up into small pieces or packets Each packet seeks the cheapest route at the instant it is sent to the destination When all the packets arrive at that destination a computer reassembles them Packet switching is a frugal efficient way to send data from point a to point b albeit via points c d q and k But packet switching is not terribly reliable Packets routinely get lost or delayed crippling communication Internet telephony one of the coolest new online applications illustrates packet switching s drawbacks If two Internet users own the right software they can talk by telephone over the Net It is miraculously cheap Speech is digitized packet ized and sent over the Net for no more than the cost of online access But because the Net gets clogged and packets are waylaid the sound quality is low and interruptions are common The Internet may soon be less of a bargain It is clogging as more and more Net heads use packet intensive real time applications such as Internet telephony and RealAudio These streaming applications swallow enormous chunks of bandwidth for long periods of time eliminating one of the Net s chief economies There are three principal remedies for Internet congestion 1 ISPs can lease more and bigger lines 2 Customers who want to ensure fast access can replace their modems with pricey high bandwidth ISDN lines T1 lines cable modems and so on 3 ISPs can discriminate between heavy and light users Customers will pay a premium to use streaming applications or send high priority messages Remedies 1 and 2 are already taking place The third is coming soon All of them will make the Internet easier to use And in the short term all of them will make the Internet more expensive
