                well um preferred benefits um i worked for a large corporation in the past and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because right now im working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there and uh theres a lot of profit thats coming in but when it comes to uh small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quick quickly or whatever or however you wanna say it and uh the benefits arent as great as when i worked for a big corporation because the big corporations seem to look at its employees and say okay weve got this amount of money lets put into this plan this plan you got Four O One K plans you have uh better vacation plans uh you have just in general maternity leave plans that that kind of thing big corporations are able to do that versus   umhum   small corporations uh you know they just dont have the money or just uh feel that there isnt a need for it so ive worked for both big and small so ive had a chance to kind of take a look at uh the pros and cons of both   right well ive worked for uh well i worked for H and R Block here in Massachusetts for awhile and the only they even hate to give out unemployment   sure umhum sure umhum   at the end of tax season because they you know theyre fairly even though theyre a large scale company theyre very the offices individual offices are very small     sure uhhuh   and now i work for the Framingham school teacher uh school system because im a teacher and uh we have much better benefits   uhhuh sure   you know in the system we have a good pension plan um let me see we have a profit sharing plan to a degree   uhhuh thats pretty good for you know being a a school district type program   right and we have the eye glasses the health care and the whole kit and caboodle because what they did is they threw the all the town employees in together   umhum wow thats extremely good   yeah   because like like the small corporation that i work for theres no pension plan theres no type of uh savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for   really   theres really i think youre allowed so many times uh i think two or three days a week a year its not accumulative type of sick leave   oh   um you know things like that so ive been looking at big corporations and saying the big corporation that ive worked for in the past had the pension plans had the big health health care uh you had your insurance and you didnt have to pay in as much as if you go to a a very small place um they dont have as good as insurance packages as big corporations   right the only trouble weve had here in Massachusetts is the town and state employees have run into problem especially the retired ones my fathers retired from the town of Framingham   and umhum sure   and he said that they havent gotten a a cost of living raise in over five years   no yeah yeah   and he said thats the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired and but i hear that bill is in the Senate right now and its   uhhuh sure sure   hopefully will go through   yeah yeah   but um you know i think the schools are at where the schools isnt just the school system and not just the teachers they took in the whole town plus all you know   umhum is it a union   uh we have the teachers union which helps out a lot but the town of Framingham pays the benefits and   umhum oh thats pretty good   thats all the town workers water and sewer and where its a very large town its actually should be a city but they kept it a town   umhum sure   um where its extremely large they were able to offer a little bit more which was really great because we dont have to pay a mayor   yeah uhhuh yeah yeah i know what you mean and thats true i mean yeah it it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position sure   right because most of our you know the town employees as far as uh electoral positions are part time   uhhuh   so it works out good because we reap the benefits of it and um   sure uhhuh   but as far as shopping for a job id rather shop for the benefits than the salary   well thats it you know and and ive kind of looked around uh at that uh too because uh salary wise i dont think im making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large im talking like huge companies like Three M um im Honeywell uh uh Texas Instruments  i know people that are that have vacation times and benefits benefits that   right   i wouldnt even dream of in this small corporation you bring it up to the owner and its like come on you know partly its because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer   right   and and of course when its a small corporation it also wants to expand so that moneys spent in a
