 Hilary d Out Dear Jodi As a proud resident of a Manhattan neighborhood that I pray will always be called the Upper West Side and as a Times reader who has never deigned to look at Circuits I m afraid that I don t have much to add to your clever insights from the F train The story in today s papers that caused me to mentally brake to a halt was a front page piece in the Washington Post by Alan Sipress about how the Los Alamos National Laboratory is now busily researching traffic patterns Since we have all marveled maybe grumbled might be a better word at the way bottlenecks appear and disappear with no apparent cause I sped through the story in hopes of discovering a telling insight Alas all that the scientists at Los Alamos and in Germany seem to have come up with is a series of new metaphors to describe traffic jams Are they like water molecules freezing into ice Or is traffic movement akin to the remarkable darting motion of a school of fish The article though did have one memorable bit of deadpan humor A scientist Chris Barrett is described as the man who convinced Los Alamos that traffic was a matter of grave national security Unmentioned in the Post was that Dwight Eisenhower used the same flimsy national security excuse to build the interstate highway system I m indebted to Republican political maven Rich Galen and his e mail newsletter Mullings for putting the Hillary interview in its proper context It s the media s August story an overhyped journalistic frenzy designed to cover the fact that when the shrinks go on vacation there is virtually no real news Galen who is a friend makes his insights available to the world at www mullings com A typical August story which I remember from my early days at Newsweek was the 1983 democracy in peril scandal called Debategate There were breathless charges never fully proved as I recall that someone from the 1980 Reagan campaign had swiped Jimmy Carter s debate notebook I realize that yesterday in my haste to wrap up our correspondence in a timely fashion I never got a chance to explain why Hillary s Senate race makes me so uncomfortable Let me count the ways 1 After an impeachment tinged year in which the Clinton marriage drowned out all other news admittedly with a generous assist from Kenneth Starr and Paula Jones Hillary s decision to run for the Senate forces the country to trek yet again through that tiresome swamp Maybe the first lady wants vindication but as a New Yorker I simply crave relief from this entire topic 2 Yes running for public office while serving as first lady does trouble me in ways that go beyond legalistic questions of whether White House funds are used for her travel and campaign expenses The law for example does not require reimbursement for the extensive costs of Secret Service protection when she campaigns Nor is there a way to wall her White House staff off from all political concerns Al Gore of course has the same problem But at least the vice president was elected to his current post 3 Despite being the crucible of the feminist movement New York ranks I believe 49th in the nation in terms of women being elected to public office No woman in New York history has ever been elected to a statewide post more august than lieutenant governor So why don t I hail Hillary s candidacy as an important feminist breakthrough Because like Liddy Dole and in sharp contrast to say Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer Hillary owes her celebrity solely to her husband s political career New York will never develop its own cadre of women political leaders if people like Congresswoman Nita Lowey are shut out of the glamour races 4 As a baseball fan I was appalled by the cynicism with which Hillary suddenly declared her secret yen for the Yankees Back in 1993 I had a lengthy discussion with the first lady about baseball In all her rhapsodies about the Chicago Cubs Hillary never mentioned any American League allegiance to the Yankees 5 I do have some lingering problems with the carpetbagger issue As a teen ager I was in my jejune fashion totally opposed to Bobby Kennedy s 1964 Senate candidacy And I certainly didn t cotton to Connecticut transplant Jim Buckley s 1970 Senate victory on the Conservative ballot line That said I am now officially Hillary d out Over to you Jodi
