        he uh well do you use a budget     uh i do at times off and on right now im probably in one of the more the more off times   any particular reason uh that you get off of it or does it seem to work for you   oh it works fine its just i i think sometimes i you know you get busy you slack off a little bit and then you know theres no more uh i mean you know then its work to catch up   yeah   uh you know then the two or three times where ive got to the point i really needed one i created one and stuck by it   and you do stick by it when you do it huh   yes how about you     well i tend to have a monthly budget and basically what it is i list all my income coming in and the expenses and whatevers left over i spend   hm   you know i just that just kind of seems to be the way it works   the budget i stuck on the most   pardon me   was the the budget i was on the most was what was called the ten twenty seventy budget   and   and basically ten percent of your income goes to uh uh longterm savings   umhum   twenty percent goes toward uh basically shortterm you know doing going out to dinner like going to the movies uh maybe you know saving that part up toward like going on you know something something a little little more shortterm than like the longterm budget and then the other and then seventy percent goes toward uh uh you know paying debts and and and that kind of stuff with the whole idea being that you pay yourself first youre more likely to stick with it   yes and i know that that theory unfortunately neither im married married and neither my husband or myself have the greatest amount of selfcontrol in the world   hm   and uh so that makes it pretty easy not to stick with the budget at times you know instead of thinking oh well save it this month well think well oh gee well buy this lamp or this whatever you know   sure   so uh our savings our savings plan sometimes goes down the drain but are you married   uh i will be a week from next Monday   oh do you think this is going to change the way you budget your money in any way   no not really   have you kind of discussed this already with your fiancee   yeah yeah so far for now i think uh i mean for now weve still got our own money really uh and thatll probably itll probably be that way till uh you know we like buy our own house together or something   uhhuh   in which case you know its very convenient to once again throw everything together uh   well i agree its uh maybe for us anyway its easier just to to put it all in one big pot and not worry about who makes what or who you know who donates what to it   right right   but uh but we just kind of started out that way and   yeah and and right now in my case its more situation that uh that she uh uh has still got a lot of debt and its easier for me to kind of like just shoulder   oh   the normal stuff   uhhuh   and let her concentrate on getting herself out of debt   well thats a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too     well i was the year before and that was the last time i really got on a budget was to really fight being in debt because i didnt like it   uh no its not a whole lot of fun   so   i think its people in general yeah you have a tendency thats a tendency to do it when you can uh one of the ways i insure my longterm savings is the fact that you know ive got a K plan so ive got uh five percent of my income going into that uh thats actually five percent before taxes   umhum umhum   uh that could you know so thats even more and then ive also uh uh you know got a few other miscellaneous automatic deductions   which i think is really the easiest way to save because once you have the money in your hand in the check youll think oh well i just wont put anything   yeah absolutely   or you know even if its of course most of us are direct deposit anymore anyway im sure but once it goes into the checking account its awfully hard to transfer it over   right well ive ive even got a uh fifty dollar a month uh uh mutual fund automatic transfer on the twentieth of every month   thats a good idea   you know once again you know you know its there you know its going to happen its a uh an easier way to uh to save   umhum and uh your fiancee is shell she goes along with the savings part too even though uh shes managed to get herself into debt   no she has no saying           but youre going to manage to make her stick to your plan right   well sure you know you know like you said for right now we really kind of each have our own money which is maybe a weird way to do your budgeting but     umhum   i i think until you know were were both growing  because you know of that i think itll probably stay away for awhile   well actually i know some people a a girlfriend of mine who was married probably about three three or four years ago and they still have separate checking accounts thats the way they prefer it uh you know uh she doesnt go into detail as to why they prefer it that way or anything but its everybody as long as i think uh your   right
