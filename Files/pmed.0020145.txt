                            A link between high levels of homocysteine a sulfurcontaining amino acid and heart        disease was first suggested in the s when it became clear that patients with inborn        errors of homocysteine metabolism were prone to develop severe cardiovascular disease in        their teens and twenties Treatment with homocysteinelowering substances such as folate        vitamin B and betaine reduces the incidence of heart attacks and strokes in these        patients        This led to the hypothesis that mildly elevated levels of homocysteine might contribute        to vascular disease Subsequently several studies have found higher mean homocysteine        levels in patients with coronary peripheral and cerebral vascular disease particularly        in those with vascular disease not readily explained by conventional risk factors such as        high lowdensity lipoprotein LDL cholesterol diabetes or smoking Several studies then        sought to determine whether elevated homocysteine levels were a cause or effect of        cardiovascular disease and evidence for a causal relationship is accumulating However        whether reduction in homocysteine levels translates into a reduction in heart disease is        still an open question        We are keenly awaiting the results from several ongoing trials In the meantime our        group is trying to determine the risks and benefits associated with different        homocysteinelowering nutrients said Margreet Olthof She and her colleagues at the        Wageningen Centre for Food Science analyzed four independent placebocontrolled        randomized intervention studies that examined the effects of betaine folic acid and        phosphatidylcholine on plasma homocysteine concentrations in healthy volunteers They        combined blood lipid data from the individual studies and compared changes in blood lipid        concentrations between individuals taking homocysteinelowering nutrients and those taking        placebo        They found that that betaine supplementation while effective at lowering homocysteine        also increased LDL cholesterol and triacylglycerol        This raises the possibility that any potential benefits for cardiovascular health would        be undermined by the adverse effects on blood lipids and make betaine less suitable as a        homocysteinelowering agent in healthy individuals The data on phosphatidylcholine were        inconclusive but supplementation of folic acidthe most common way to lower homocysteine        levelsdoes not seem to affect blood lipids The researchers conclude that folic acid        therefore remains the preferred treatment for lowering of blood homocysteine        concentrations in healthy individuals
