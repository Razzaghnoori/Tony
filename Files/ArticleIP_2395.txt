 Party of One I wish we could sit around my kitchen table just Bill Bob Hillary Liddy and me Actually I might be pressed for time so it would work better if we could stand around my kitchen table while I chug half a pint of takeout Szechwan shrimp no MSG before I run out to meet a friend who has also come home late from work to gulp something before we connect for a concert and dinner But in my spare 10 minutes while I have all the major presidential candidates and their significant but loving spouses gathered I d tackle what the first lady told the Democratic National Convention matters most in our lives and in our nation children and families Because the Democrats were mostly triangulating their children and families message to duel with the similar message that came out of the Republican National Convention a few weeks before I d tackle Sen Dole next Dole imagines himself a bridge to a time of tranquillity faith and confidence so I d ask him to what village or America his bridge will carry folks like me seeing as folks like me don t have children or traditional families Soccer Moms are desirable voters this election year but single women are off the charts just a rung below homosexual men who are contemplating but denied marriage At our kitchen confab which would probably I m sorry to say take place not around the table since many single people live in apartments where the kitchen is the size of a linen closet but around the counter I might suggest that the first lady ask Janet Reno or Donna Shalala if they ever feel stressed out or over committed even though they aren t packing lunches dropping the kids off at school and going to work The first lady who detailed so eloquently the pressures faced by working mothers might be surprised to know that the current attorney general and the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services working singles also make dinner pay the bills and feel a little tired when on top of all their other responsibilities they have to take the dog to the vet American politics were a little more inclusive when campaign rhetoric revolved around it s the economy stupid Yes Americans must feed their children but Americans married and single must feed themselves too But once the Republicans and Democrats decided that the goal of all Americans must be family and child rearing an unpremeditated exclusionary process began At the Republican Convention Dole urged us to practice right conduct every day Well it s pretty hard to practice right conduct when the very fabric of your personal life is judged to be second rate But it s not too late to redeem single nonparents We could change the tax code to deter their behavior and balance the budget by slapping a 15 percent tax hike on every American who has not procreated and married Are you listening Mr Dole You could even punish the teachers unions for their sinful ways with a 15 percent tax hike of their own Single nonparent members of these unions could be slapped with a 30 percent tax hike Why are single people are so vilified Many of them have more time than the married with children crowd to contribute to the community I wonder how many from each group volunteer for the Republican and Democratic campaigns and how the figures compare Does Dick Morris know Mr Morris architect of triangulation as well as of the vice president s and first lady s family values speeches might have consulted his companion Miss Rowlands during his off hours at the Jefferson Hotel about whether she felt included in the Democrats agenda It is precisely our current president s generation the me boomers who in unprecedented numbers opened the doors for gay and women s rights and therefore postponed or rejected traditional family values It seems disloyal even a sign of self loathing for this president s campaign strategy to work overtime to gain the admiration and respect of the center while ignoring his own backyard If Mr Dole insists on playing footsie with the religious right shouldn t Mr Clinton acknowledge his lifestyle left Perhaps it s time for both parties to consider rectangularization to include in their focus groups voters who care about health care and education but not necessarily about getting married or having children At the Republican Convention Bob Dole commended as right conduct any screenwriter who refuses to contribute to the mountains of trash Well I m one writer who would promise Bill Bob Hillary and Liddy personally at my kitchen table well kitchen counter not to contribute further to the trash this year But on one condition Both parties must return to a genuine debate and stop bickering over who can present a better image of wistful middle American family life It s irritating to be ignored But it s painful to be living a life which both political spectrums deem as virtually un American It takes a citizen to make a village Not just a parent
