 Times Hits Runs Dear Katharine Before you do anything else today grab the Wall Street Journal and read the front page profile of the new Jerry Brown mayor of Oakland It s a masterpiece on Brown s transformation from reform driven eco visionary into pragmatic city pol In an overly felicitous phrase that I nonetheless wish I d written Peter Waldman says Gov Moonbeam has become Mayor Pothole Gone is the 100 limit on campaign contributions gone are the denunciations of the prison industrial complex Now Brown boasts of his crackdown on crime and says I don t talk about sustainable development I talk about downtown development I confess to harboring some soft sentiments for Brown though my West Coast friends have always said he s easier to admire from 3 000 miles away And now for a rant combining my old energy as Village Voice press critic with my new Industry Standard obsessions The New York Times prominently published a story yesterday suggesting that AT T was playing footsie with America Online This is important because as faster so called broadband Internet access becomes more widespread there will be a fierce battle to control both the data pipes that come into our homes and the content that goes through them Excite Home which is now largely owned by AT T is sort of an early experiment in what companies might look like if they combine an Internet company Excite with a broadband service Home Trouble is both companies are kind of small potatoes compared to AOL s 17 million users Hence many people believe that AT T will want to ease out of its deal with Excite and move toward the masses represented by AOL I didn t bring this story up yesterday in part out of modesty a Standard colleague of mine published a story months ago suggesting that an AT T AOL alliance was practically inevitable So OK The Times prints the story Monday saying these talks are under way and not surprisingly Excite Home s stock price drops like Liddy Dole s poll numbers investors figure that Excite Home will be the unwanted third wheel Midway through the day both AT T and Excite Home issue statements saying that the companies will honor their exclusive agreements through 2002 If you re the New York Times you re ideally suited and journalistically obligated to publish a second day story You ve moved markets and forced denials from two major communications companies But in today s Times there s nothing at all It s as if the whole thing never happened Even though these are huge companies there seems to be the attitude that it s just the Internet I ll bet you d never get this kind of sketchy coverage if the businesses in question were GM or Citibank And while of course we know that institutional jealousy is never a factor it s interesting to note that Excite Home has a market capitalization of about 9 5 billion which contrasts intriguingly with the New York Times 6 5 billion Yours Jim
