 January 9 2000 Name Address City Dear As a former donor you may know that the IRT has enjoyed a strong start to our season and we thank you for your interest and support We depend on friends like you to help us bring outstanding productions to the stage We just finished producing A Christmas Carol for the fourth consecutive year enabling thousands of families and students the opportunity to celebrate the holidays together It is your support and our commitment to low prices for youth 5 14 that makes that possible In total because of the gifts given last year we were able to discount tickets for nearly 11 000 children who would ordinarily not be able to enjoy the wonders of live theatre And do our productions impact education By reaching students whom are not otherwise being reached through school and other community institutions It is a proven fact that the arts contribute to higher scores on the SAT and other standardized tests By transforming the environment for learning school lessons become opportunities of discovery when performed live on stage By providing new challenges for those students already considered successful and helping them surpass boredom and complacency which are barriers to success So far we ve been very successful in our service to the community but we need your financial support right now to complete the season with the same gusto Your last gift was We hope you ll help us with more this year Every dollar that you contribute makes a big difference It s thrilling to have such a strong impact on the community It s now your opportunity to be a partner in our work We have been selected again this year to participate in two special challenge matches one with the National Endowment for the Arts to support our education programming for youth who will match every contributed dollar up to 33 000 and one with the Lilly Endowment who will match up to 70 000 of new or increased gifts This is free money that only you can help the IRT obtain Your gift will assure us of receiving over 100 000 of grant money You have heard from us twice by mail this season requesting your support This letter is to let you know that we still need your help to continue our record of strong fiscal management vibrant theatrical productions and outstanding educational programs We have a long way to go before we reach our goal of 365 000 from friends and subscribers such as yourself Your gift and the doubling of these dollars through the two challenge matches will help us reach this goal Ticket sales and subscriptions cannot finance our complete season in fact they only count for 53 of our income Soon a representative of the IRT will be calling you to take your pledge over the phone We hope you will enjoy talking to them but you can save the IRT administrative money by sending your gift in the return envelope today Either way it s important that we hear from you during this last fundraising drive of 1999 2000 season Please consider sending your donation in today Thank you Sincerely Brian Payne Managing Director P S Your contributed support directly benefits the IRT s outreach programs and leverages match gift monies Please give generously
