 Background The dihydropyridine receptor DHPR of skeletal muscle consists of 1S 2 1a and 1 subunits 1 The 1 subunit is a large four repeat transmembrane protein of 220 KDa that contains the basic functional elements of the L type Ca 2 channel including the Ca 2 selective pore and S4 voltage sensing transmembrane segments in each of the four internal repeats 2 subunits are 65 kDa cytosolic proteins essential for membrane trafficking modulation of channel kinetics and for excitation contraction EC coupling 3 4 The 2 subunit is a highly glycosylated 175 kDa protein formed by two disulfide linked peptides 5 whereas the 1 subunit is a 32 kDa skeletal muscle specific protein of four presumptive transmembrane domains with almost unknown function 6 7 Skeletal muscle cells utilize the voltage sensors formed by the S4 segments to trigger a rapid elevation of cytosolic Ca 2 thus coupling membrane excitation to muscle cell contraction Subsequent to charge movements in the voltage sensors a conformational change in the DHPR is transmitted to the ryanodine receptor RyR1 presumably via protein protein interactions 8 Ultimately there is a brief opening of the RyR1 channel resulting in the release of Ca 2 from the sarcoplasmic reticulum SR Numerous observations have lent support to this view and especially significant are the functional expression studies in dysgenic myotubes lacking 1S The dysgenic myotube is devoid of L type Ca 2 current charge movements and EC coupling All three are restored in the dysgenic myotube by expression of 1S 9 10 11 These results corroborated the essential role of 1S in the mechanism of EC coupling of skeletal muscle cells The mechanism by which the DHPR signals the RyR1 is poorly understood 12 13 Domains in the cytoplasmic linker between repeats II and III have been clearly implicated 14 15 16 17 18 19 and some regions such as Thr671 Lue690 were suggested to trigger RyR1 opening by binding to RyR1 15 However extensive deletions within the II III linker that eliminate the RyR1 binding region and other suggested signaling regions in the II III loop 16 do not entirely eliminate EC coupling 20 21 Hence additional domains of 1S and or other DHPR subunits appear to be engaged by the voltage sensor and contribute to an EC coupling signal In this respect the contribution of the 1a subunit of the DHPR to EC coupling in skeletal muscle cells has been extensively documented 4 22 23 24 In the present report we characterized a frame shift mutant of 1S that expresses two complementary fragments of 1S Complementation between the two 1S fragments produced recovery of EC coupling in dysgenic muscle cells lacking 1S The results suggest the EC coupling voltage sensor of skeletal muscle is modular in function and can be assembled from separate hemi Ca 2 channel fragments Results and Discussion Expression of a frame shift mutation of 1Sin dysgenic myotubes Primers for the frame shift mutant fs 1S were originally designed to delete the 20 mer Thr671 Leu690 in the cytosolic loop between repeats II and III of 1S and to generate a full length 1S carrying this internal deletion A proofreading error during a PCR reaction resulted in an amplified DNA with the desired deletion but also containing an additional thymidine following the TTG codon for Leu670 Fig 1A The one base shift in reading frame introduced a serine at position 671 followed immediately by a stop codon Fig 1B This frame shift mutation was re ligated into an otherwise full length 1S subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pSG5 and transfected into dysgenic 1S null myotubes Fs 1S was abundantly expressed in primary dysgenic myotubes in culture Fig 1C and produced the expected truncated 1S protein Fig 1D Western blots using N terminus T7 tagged fs 1S and T7 tagged full length 1S showed that the expressed full length 1S protein migrated with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 185 KDa under reducing conditions This result is consistent with the mobility of the native purified skeletal muscle 1S subunit 25 The fs 1S migrated with a molecular weight of approximately 90 KDa which is entirely consistent with the theoretical molecular weight of the expressed fragment which was 85 6 KDa Furthermore 5 fold overloading of the SDS PAGE gel failed to detect any fragment of a size comparable to full length 1S not shown Recovery of EC coupling by the frame shift a 1ScDNA EC coupling was investigated in voltage clamped myotubes with simultaneous monitoring of intracellular Ca 2 using confocal fluorescence of fluo 4 26 Controls shown in Fig 2Aindicated that the overwhelming majority of non transfected dysgenic muotubes 13 of 15 cells did not produce detectable Ca 2 transients 0 1 F Fo or Ca 2 currents 20 pA cell in response to depolarization under voltage clamp This is shown in the line scan images of fluo 4 fluorescence in Fig 2Aand the corresponding traces of ICa 2 during a 50 ms depolarization to 30 mV and 90 mV delivered at the start of the line scan in the same cell However in two cells 2 of 15 cells we observed Idys the low density endogenous Ca 2 current previously described in dysgenic myotubes 27 28 The reason for the low abundance of this current in these cultured myotubes is unknown Ca 2 currents and stimulated fluorescence for one of the cells expressing Idys is shown in Fig 2B We observed a peak ICa 2 density of approximately 0 8 pA pF and a barely detectable fluorescence signal which in Fig 2Bis indicated by the arrow in the trace of integrated fluorescence at 30 mV This small fluorescence signal disappeared entirely at 90 mV suggesting it might be contributed directly by Idys or might be due to SR Ca 2 release induced by Idys The voltage dependence of the fluorescence signal and ICa 2 are compared in Fig 2Cfor the two cells expressing Idys and for the vast majority of cells which altogether did not express intracellular Ca 2 transients or ICa 2 The maximum fluorescence signal contributed by Idys when Idys was present was 0 2 F Fo units Furthermore the shape of the fluorescence vs voltage relationship was bell shaped and a mirror image of the ICa 2 vs voltage curve These controls indicated that non transfected dysgenic myotubes are low background cells that do not express voltage activated Ca 2 signals of major consequence for the present studies Fig 3shows that fs 1S recovered a significant fraction of the voltage activated Ca 2 transient compared to that express by full length wt 1S The magnitude of the fluorescence signal expressed by fs 1S was approximately 5 fold larger than the largest Ca 2 transient detected in non transfected myotubes expressing Idys 20 fold larger than the average Ca 2 transient detectable in non transfected cells and about 1 3 of the maximum SR Ca 2 release expressed by the control wt 1S construct Thus we are confident that the voltage evoked Ca 2 transient in cells transfected by fs 1S cells was a direct consequence of the expressed protein Also shown in Fig 3is ICa 2 activated by the 50 ms depolarization used to activate the Ca 2 transient fs 1S did not express L type Ca 2 current even though it was consistently able to activate the Ca 2 transient in 15 of 15 cells Absence of ICa 2 was further verified using longer 500 ms depolarizing pulses not shown The skeletal nature of the EC coupling expressed by fs 1S is shown in Fig 4A The peak Ca 2 vs voltage relationship expressed by fs 1S like that of wt 1S was sigmoidal in shape reaching a maximum at large positive potentials 50 mV a range in which ICa 2 is progressively small The line scans of Fig 4Bfurther confirmed that a Ca 2 transient of similar shape and magnitude was observed in a fs 1S transfected myotube in the absence of external Ca 2 Hence the signaling mechanism like that reported in normal myotubes and dysgenic myotubes expressing wt 1S was Ca 2 entry independent 29 We also expressed fs 1S in cultured myotubes from two available gene knock out KO mice lacking the endogenous 1a isoform of the skeletal muscle DHPR 30 and lacking RyR1 31 As shown in Fig 4B we failed to detect EC coupling in these KO cells transfected with fs 1S In summary the EC coupling expressed by fs 1S is strictly skeletal type and requires RyR1 and DHPR 1a fs 1Sexpresses two complementary protein fragments The EC coupling recovered by fs 1S could be due either to the activity of the N terminal half of 1S alone or to protein protein complementation between the N terminal half and a fragment expressing the C terminal half of 1S The C terminal half of 1S could have been translated by the fs 1S expression vector if the ATG codon Met701 which is downstream from the TGA termination codon and is in frame with the wild type message Fig 1B served as open reading frame for translation of the second half of the wt message Although this would be unusual the fact that the codon for Met701 is only 25 bases downstream from the termination codon could have substantially increased the possibility of a re start of the translation of the second half of the message at Met701 This phenomenon has been described in eukaryotic cells and in viral infected mammalian cells and is known as translation by leaky ribosomal scanning 32 33 To test this explanation the presumptive restart condon Met701 was mutated to Ile701 in the fs 1S template If fs 1S recovered EC coupling by virtue of expressing a single protein fragment then fs 1S M701I should also recover EC coupling since the mutation was introduced downstream from the stop codon Fig 5shows that this was not the case Fs 1S M701I did not recover Ca 2 transients in 9 of 9 tested cells consistent with leaky ribosomal scanning As a positive control we coexpressed fs 1S M701I and the C terminus half of 1S namely 1S 1 700 cloned into a separate pSG5 vector The results in Fig 5indicated that 1S 1 700 alone was inactive However when myotubes were cotransfected with fs 1S M701I and 1S 1 700 each in a separate pSG5 vector there was a robust recovery of Ca 2 transients in 5 of 5 cells Fig 6Ashows fluorescence vs voltage relationships for the fs 1S M701I mutant and for this mutant coexpressed with 1S 1 700 The combined expression of the two complementary fragments of 1S resulted in a robust recovery of EC coupling with sigmoidal Ca 2 release vs voltage characteristics A summary of the maximum fluorescence during the Ca 2 transient in response to a depolarization to 90 mV is shown in Fig 6B The magnitude of the Ca 2 transient expressed by fs 1S M701I 1S 1 700 was indistinguishable from that of wt 1S t test significance p 0 671 see figure legend To confirm expression of the C terminus half of 1S in cells transfected with fs 1S we used the II III loop polyclonal antibody SKI 34 directed against epitope Ala739 Ile752 which is downstream from Met701 Fig 6Cshows that the II III loop antibody recognized the C terminus half when cells were transfected with fs 1S but not when myotubes were transfected with fs 1S M701I The C terminal protein migrated with a molecular weight of approximately 126 KDa which is consistent with the theoretical molecular weight of 132 KDa Finally Fig 6Dshows that fs 1S M701I was abundantly expressed in myotubes in the absence or presence of the C terminal fragment This indicated that the absence of EC coupling observed in myotubes expressing fs 1S M701I was not due the production of a labile protein In summary the recovery of EC coupling by coexpression of two functionally inactive proteins Fig 5 taken together with the immunoblots Fig 6C favor the explanation that 1 fs 1S recovers DHPR function by virtue of expressing two complementary fragments of 1S and 2 the expression of the C terminal half of 1S by fs 1S is likely to occur by leaky ribosomal scanning Implications for EC coupling in skeletal myotubes Except for the magnitude the SR Ca 2 release signal expressed by fs 1S was entirely typical of skeletal myotubes with sigmoidal voltage dependence proceeding in the absence of external Ca 2 and requiring RyR1 A comparison of the maximum fluorescence F Fo max at 90 mV Fig 6B shows that the signal generated by fs 1S was significantly smaller than that generated by the control construct wt 1S vs fs 1S t test significance p 0 014 and smaller than that generated by the two coexpressed fragments fs 1S vs fs 1S M701I 1S 1 700 t test significance p 0 013 These observation suggests that the magnitude of the Ca 2 release appears to be limited by the low yield of expression of the C terminal fragment achieved by leaky ribosomal scanning of the second half of the fs 1S message To test this explanation further we coexpressed fs 1S and the C terminal half of 1S each in a separate pSG5 vector We found that fs 1S and 1 S 1 700 together expressed Ca 2 transients with a F Fo max similar to wt 1S control not shown Thus we are certain that the EC coupling expressed by fs 1S is mechanistically similar to control skeletal type EC coupling but limited in magnitude by a comparatively lower density of functional DHPRs that are assembled in cells expressing fs 1S It is conceivable that the functional integrity of the fragmented 1S protein is maintained in part by the subunit of the DHPR which spans both halves of the 1 pore subunit by binding to the I II loop and the C terminus 35 36 Consistent with this explanation we failed to detect EC coupling recovery when fs 1S was expressed in 1 null myotubes Earlier studies in the voltage gated Na channel had shown that pore function was not compromised when the II III linker or III IV linker was cut and the two fragments were coexpressed each in a separate vector 37 We would thus conclude that in the case of the Ca 2 channel an intact II III loop is essential for this function since neither fs 1S nor the combined expression of the two truncated fragments not shown was able to rescue Ca 2 current This result is entirely consistent with the identification of the II III loop as critical for enhancement of L type Ca 2 current expression by the RyR1 38 However EC coupling per se can clearly proceed with a cut in the II III loop This was shown here by the behavior of the fs 1S construct and elsewhere by expressing the N terminal half 1S 1 670 and the C terminal half 1S 701 1873 each with entirely wt sequence and each in a separate expression vector 20 The fact that Thr671 Leu690 region known as Peptide A 15 is missing in fs 1S suggests this 20 mer domain is not critical for the conformation change transmitted from the DHPR to the RyR1 To test this further we generated an in frame deletion of this region as originally intended that showed normal function 20 Another domain critical for EC coupling is Csk35 downstream from Peptide A Leu720 Gln765 This region was identified using chimeras of 1S and 1C 16 Since Csk53 is present in 1S 1 700 and was detected by the II III loop antibody which is directed against the center portion of Csk53 34 the participation of this domain in the EC cannot be ruled out In eukaryotic cells translation starts at the AUG codon nearest to the 5 end of the mRNA and this initiator site is found by sequential ribosomal scanning in the 5 to 3 direction 32 However translation initiation at internal AUGs due to leaky ribosomal scanning has been documented especially for mRNAs consisting of a short leader ORF upstream from the main ORF In some cases reassembly of a new ribosomal initiation complex after the terminator codon of the leader ORF serves to re initiate translation at the initiator AUG codon for the main ORF and thus two proteins are generated 39 In other cases leaky scanning by the ribosomal initiation complex bypasses the 5 located leader ORF entirely and only the internal ORF is translated 32 In the case of fs 1S we are not entirely certain which mechanism best applies A bypass of the ORF at the 5 end of the 1S mRNA in favor of a presumed ORF at Met701 is unlikely because a C terminal fragment of the size expressed by 1S 1 700 has not been detected in skeletal muscle with the SKI antibody 34 or other antibodies 25 Thus Met701 is not an internal initiation site under normal circumstances Entry of a new ribosomal complex at Met701 seems a more likely explanation However re initiation after a stop has only been described for cases in which the leader ORF is no longer than 30 codons because initiation factors fall off shortly after recognition of the initiator AUG 32 In the case of fs 1S what can be considered the leader ORF encodes for a protein of 671 residues Hence we are not certain if re initiation of translation after a stop signal as currently described in the literature would apply here At the same time it is important to point out that in the present studies fs 1S expression is under the control of a viral promoter and that in this hybrid viral mammalian expression system the rules pertaining to leaky ribosomal scanning may be different The mechanism of translation of the fs 1S clearly deserves closer scrutiny in the future Conclusions The present studies show EC coupling recovery by a frame shift mutant of 1S due to protein protein complementation of the N terminal and C terminal halves of 1S The N terminal half houses repeats I and II with the adjoining cytosolic loop and the C terminal half houses most of the II III loop along with repeats III and IV with the adjoining loop Protein protein complementation between the N terminal and C terminal fragments produced a DHPR capable of functioning as EC coupling voltage sensor thus suggesting the presence of at least two functional modules within 1S Recent evidence suggests that the four internal repeats of the voltage gated Na channel which is closely related to the L type Ca 2 channel encoded by the DHPR have non equivalent functional roles because the S4 segments of repeats I and II move much faster than those of repeats III and IV 40 By analogy the fast moving module of the DHPR would be represented by the N terminal fragment and the slower moving module by the C terminal fragment Interactions between these two modules are likely to be critical for intramembrane charge movements in the assembled four repeat channel and for coupling the movement of the S4 gating charges to the opening of the RyR1 channel Future studies of gating currents in each hemi Ca 2 channel fragment should provide valuable information on how the fast and slow gating modules interact during EC coupling in skeletal muscle The C terminal fragment was generated by an unusual restart of translation of the fs 1S message at M701 presumably by leaky ribosomal scanning and was eliminated by a M701I mutation Hence a premature stop codon in the II III loop upstream of M701 may not necessarily cause a loss of DHPR function because in these cases function would be recovered by complementation between protein fragments expressed by the same cDNA From a methodological perspective leaky scanning could be further used as a means to control protein expression to desired levels since restart of translation after a premature stop codon is sensitive to the number of nucleotides separating the stop and restart codons 39 By changing the position of the restart methionine relative to the premature stop codon it might be possible to significantly change the level of expression of the distal protein fragment and hence functional protein as a whole Thus leaky scanning remains as an attractive possibility for boosting or depressing protein levels in a transfected cell Materials and Methods Primary cultures of mouse myotubes Primary cultures were prepared from hind limbs of day 18 embryos E18 as described
