 JFK as Forrest Gump Growth Jobs produced by National Media Inc for the National Association of Manufacturers Broadcast by the National Association of Manufacturers during the now resolved debate over cutting federal taxes this timely pointed spot extends history s reach in an effort to push for the tax breaks favored by the NAM The opening shot of Growth Jobs takes us back to 1963 and John F Kennedy Black and white footage invokes a past that thanks to the image of a man who remains a compelling symbol of hope is not pass Targeting Democrats and the middle class voters who were at the time being told by President Clinton that the Republican version of the tax cut was unfair the spot challenges their confidence in the president Whom do you believe it seems to ask Clinton or Kennedy Clinton later compromised with the GOP and the final bill included many of the latter s proposals This nation needs a tax cut JFK says nothing new here given the climate This need for a tax cut seems to have asserted itself in every post Reagan campaign In the very different context of 1963 however Kennedy was the first president to call for a tax cut with the explicitly Keynesian purpose of creating a deficit to stimulate the economy JFK was concerned about an economy in crisis current lawmakers don t have to be JFK s tax cut was designed to result in a deficit the current cut in keeping with the supply side doctrine of the Republicans was part of a deficit ending package Moving to a full screen chyron of Kennedy s words etched in an appropriately antique font the spot transitions seamlessly to another section of the speech Back then to a shot of JFK who now links a tax cut to buying power It s true that buying power isn t exactly a problem in today s economy credit card debt is at an all time high but most viewers won t stumble over the words which are quickly absorbed by a visual transition to 1997 and what appears to be a scene in a contemporary factory JFK s voice continues to extol the tax cut predicting that it will bring more production and the jobs the nation and the workers we see need At this point the spot fesses up via a crush of chyrons that it s the Republican Tax Cut Plan that s at issue here JFK s words imply that he s for the plan or at least for something very like it in fact the three Kennedys currently in Congress opposed the Republican version and were split on the final compromise Details of the plan are listed in order of polling appeal starting with the 500 per child tax credit a proposal Clinton campaigned on in 1996 and spiraling to the far less popular capital gains tax cut that Holy Grail of the Gingrich revolution The ad s euphemism for capital gains tax cuts for economic growth and jobs testifies to its proponents paranoia They don t want to talk it up and probably assume that it will be lost in the crowded screen Against the background of validating words and what seem to be specific details Growth Jobs responds explicitly to Clinton s accusation that the plan served the wealthy 76 of the tax relief is aimed at middle income taxpayers Aimed lets the spot skirt the charge critics of the plan argued that 60 percent of the population would get little or nothing Kennedy urges that voters accept the tax cut we re talking about History is the more persuasive when the facts are blurred Lost is the fact that JFK proposed to cut the top rate from 90 percent to 60 percent whereas the 97 Republican bill reduced the capital gains tax from 28 percent to 20 percent and even lower Legally required to carry a disclaimer the spot eventually identifies its sponsor the National Association of Manufacturers which believes that t ax relief is a good idea then a good idea now Ironies abound The NAM didn t think JFK was a good idea then His address to the 1961 NAM convention included this dig It would be premature to ask for your support in the next election and untrue to thank you for it in the last one And it is also true that most of the association s corporate clients opposed the 63 tax cut But for most viewers the varnish remains Growth Jobs follows the Reaganesque strategy of invoking Kennedy s words on behalf of a very different kind of tax cut Republicans revel in quoting JFK to Democrats and especially to the Kennedys now in the Senate and the House It also follows an American tradition In the Lincoln Douglas debates both sides quoted Jefferson Anyone can cite Jefferson or Lincoln or Roosevelt or Kennedy for his own purpose and will It s not clear what if any effect this spot had on the outcome Growth Jobs seems to make a good job of it the devil is in the details Robert Shrum
