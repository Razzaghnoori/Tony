 Turning Off Plugging Out Hi Jim My heartfelt condolences at the passing of one of your beloved two fat ladies not to mention your poker losses One other notable feature of the Times obit Nemy takes pains to point out the negative results of the Times own taste test of the recipe book Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies A writer found that no less than all six of the six recipes she tested didn t work It is their rapid rise here of course that makes this careless effort at a cookbook so regrettable the obit quotes the 1998 Times piece Excuse the expression This is a fine example of the Times having its cake and eating it too Even in death there s opportunity to tut tut about the ill effects of celebrity run amok namely unleashing bad recipes on the masses while simultaneously celebrating that celebrity in the form of a prominent obituary complete with a photo of both ladies with their motorcycle and sidecar Still you can t find that much fault in an appreciation of a life that ends with this quote from the surviving fat lady about her deceased partner in cuisine She didn t see the point of flowers She d rather have caviar As a coda to our conversation yesterday about the perils of technology run amok see today s Work Family column in the Wall Street Journal in which A Technology Junkie Learns To Live Life a Little Less Plugged in We hear the tale of a project manager for US West who s spent his career finding ways for businesses to use technology but in the process found himself a slave to the machine In the emergency room for chest pains this tech junkie panics about his lost cell phone not the about state of his health The piece is about how one man learned to find the off button without quitting his job Here s a hero for the digital age a guy who saw the light and while he still reads e mail and listens to voicemail on the weekend and on vacation he sometimes doesn t even respond to it Can you imagine To be fair the profile subject says of himself I m not a success story yet but I recognize the issues As for your ruminations on the effects of competitive jealousy on news judgment I d have to agree that there s something out of whack if a story like the Paducah Kentucky bomb factory goes so wildly under reported in other papers just because the Post broke it Readers don t really care who broke a story only other journalists do But I ask the business question Can you see any way that papers might change how they operate to better balance such behind the scenes professional competition with serving readers After all no one wins awards for putting out me too stories KM
