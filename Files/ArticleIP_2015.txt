 Shadow Boxing The good news for Sky Dayton 24 year old chairman of one of the fastest growing companies in the world is that the Internet is a place where a smart young man can become a tycoon overnight The bad news for Sky Dayton is that the Internet is a place where anyone with a home computer a modem and some animus can make your life miserable and perhaps do real damage to your business The bad news for the rest of us is the larger moral of Dayton s story The famously egalitarian properties of the Net have a creepy and oppressive flip side In 1994 Dayton founded an Internet access provider called EarthLink not to be confused with The Earthling the name of this column In less than two years EarthLink s staff has grown from two to 400 its annual revenue to more than 30 million and its customer base to 140 000 If you research Internet access providers you ll discover why No company that matches EarthLink s network of nationwide access points beats its price But if you do your research on the World Wide Web you ll probably discover something else too a Web page ominously titled earthlink net and Scientology The Links Subtitle Sky Dayton s Scientology Training With EarthLink preparing for its first public stock offering this is not good publicity On the Net the Church of Scientology is the antichrist It slaps lawsuits on church critics who post quotes from copyrighted church documents sometimes getting federal marshals to search homes and seize computer disks There s no evidence that the church currently uses extralegal weapons against online critics pries into their e mail say Still among the desirable qualities of an Internet access provider the company whose computers all your e mail and cyberwanderings pass through Church of Scientology affiliated does not rank high Is EarthLink Church of Scientology affiliated Apparently not but we ll get to that later First note that this isn t just another case of accusations speeding across the Net hopping from newsgroup to newsgroup e g last year s rumor that Mrs Fields had supplied free cookies for O J Simpson s acquittal party There s a subtler dynamic at work here a property not of the Net at large but of the Web in particular This dynamic will affect more of us as the Web grows and more people s reputations are mediated there On the Web anyone can construct a kind of shadow identity for anyone else not just an unkind characterization but an unkind characterization that sticks to your cyber identity like glue Suppose for example that some business heavyweight is pondering a business deal with Sky Dayton or is just curious about him having met him at a cocktail party She revs up a Web search engine say Alta Vista and types in Sky Dayton and EarthLink And there it is on the first page of listings earthlink net and Scientology The Links As long as this shadow page contains key words that are in Dayton s home page and EarthLink s home page it will be seen by almost everyone who finds either of those pages through a search engine This is the cyberspace equivalent of hanging a sign around someone s neck saying Scientologist or child molester bedwetter whatever Except that in the physical world the victim can remove the sign Shadow pages in contrast are indelible Sky Dayton is victim of an oft applauded trend As copying and transmitting data get cheaper the distribution of power grows more equal After publishing technology evolved from its scribbling monks phase to its Gutenberg phase a form of power once dominated by popes and other big shots was diffused and the Reformation happened Now the power over reputations is passing from magazines radio stations and so on to well to everybody It can be fun watching the Davids take on the Goliaths the Kmart sucks web page for example authored by the guy who ran Kmart s own web page until Kmart fired him Mistake But remember Kmart could be you You may doubt that someday you ll have a Web page but you may also have doubted two years ago that someday you d need e mail Your cyber tormentor could be a nutcase former client an envious former colleague an aggrieved ex spouse or ex lover Their technological empowerment may take some of the thrill out of your own empowerment On the Web every man can be president and every woman Gennifer Flowers Note to gender police You know what I mean Of course you can always shadow your shadow identity with a rebuttal so that people who see the charges against you also see your reply When I mentioned this to a legal scholar friend he joyously declared cyberspace a perfectly efficient information market His apparent assumption that bringing all relevant information to bear on an issue fixes Truth in the minds of observers reflects a touchingly pre postmodern view of human objectivity Alas the news from evolutionary psychology is less touching Natural selection did not in fact design our brains to apprehend Truth Our moral evaluations of people are often subordinate by design to our social agendas and as a result our whole machinery for appraising other people is gunked up with unconscious bias Anyway Sky Dayton faces something more elusive than lies It s true that he s a Scientologist like John Travolta Chick Corea etc I practice my personal right to choose my own beliefs he says Some of the shadow page s other specific claims also are true But there s no evidence that as the shadow page intimates EarthLink is an arm of the church The company s CEO is Southern Baptist and its chief financial officer is Roman Catholic Scientology is a large religion says Dayton If I were to ask you if because you were a Jew your company was owned by the state of Israel everybody would laugh at me In a way truthful shadow pages are the scariest of all As many have noted these days much of your private life is vulnerable to intrusion E mail is less secure than snail mail or a phone call Most financial transactions don t involve cash and are thus recorded Your wanderings on the Web leave more footprints than you may realize Much of this vulnerability may eventually be neutralized by encryption and other tricks But until then technology will in some ways be pushing us backward in time The Net though celebrated as a libertarian institution can also be the opposite It can be a bit like a claustrophobic small town where your private life is part of the public dialogue Winesburg Ohio like cyberspace was a perfectly efficient information market
