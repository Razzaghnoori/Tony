              Springtime       Dear Friends of the pelicans      Twelve baby pelicans were hatched and raised this year just outside      our pens by the wild pelicans that hang around the Seabird Station The       permanently injured pelicans inside our pens are still waiting for the      approval of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the      U S Fish  Wildlife Service approval before they can breed One      little pelican was abandoned by his parents in their haste to start a      second mating and nesting in the same season He was about two weeks      short of being old enough to fly but still afraid of people and very      difficult to catch so that we could continue feeding until he was      selfsufficient After five days of selfimposed starvation Harry      cornered him behind an aviary and fed him and he immediately jerked      away running and flapping to the waters edge where he sat with a pouch      full of fish      The next morning and every day for the next two weeks he was in the      corner behindthe aviary waiting for Harry Now he comes running out from      there whenever he sees Harry How quickly they learn bad habits Our      problem now is how to teach him to go out and catch his own fish instead      of waiting to catch Harry behind the aviary      The smallest baby duck we have ever seen was brought to our door about      three weeks ago We think it is a wild mallard duck The rescuer said the      mother abandoned this baby We put the little fellow in an indoor cage      and fed it for about a day until we noticed that it was getting entirely      too attuned to people peeping a little greeting whenever someone passed      his cage This can lead to a condition called imprinting where the baby      grows up thinking it is a people instead of a duck Although this results      in a cute pet it is a disaster to the duck because it looks to people      for its normal social interaction even the most intimate kind      In an effort to avoid imprinting we enlisted the aid of a regular      barnyard muscovy duck that was hanging around the Seabird Station We put      the baby mallard in a small aviary with the halfgrown muscovy and it      worked We were delighted to see the muscovy sitting down and just the      head of the baby mallard peeking out from under its breast The next day      when we went out to the aviary we were concerned that we didnt see the      baby even when the muscovy stood up and walked to the other corner of      the aviary until the baby fell out from under its wing The baby mallard      will probably think its a muscovy when it grows up but thats better      than imprinting as a people      begin R Weve had about  cases of botulism among the       sick or injured pelicans that weve received in the last two months      which is about as many botulism cases as we normally get in an entire      year Weve only been able to save about  of those  birds by      supporting them with IV fluids given through the wing bones the      preferred method in birds Botulism is caused by the toxins excreted      from bacteria that sometimes occurs naturally when vegetable matter      decays anaerobically without oxygen under the mud It then bubbles to      the surface of the water and a small amount is ingested by the pelican      when he eats The Botulism Research Laboratory at the University of      Pennsylvania gave us  doses of experimental botulism antitoxin about      two weeks ago The trick is to catch the botulism in the very early      stages before the toxin attacks the nerves and causes progressive      paralysis The problem here is that some paralysis is usually the first      visible symptom Well let you know if this antitoxin turns out to be      the silver bullet that solves the botulism problem      Our sincere thanks to all of you and to Kate  Jon Sage for      another successful fish drive      Sincerely      Darlene  Harry Kelton and all the other pelicans
