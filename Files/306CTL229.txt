 Springtime 2000 Dear Friends of the pelicans Twelve baby pelicans were hatched and raised this year just outside our pens by the wild pelicans that hang around the Seabird Station The 38 permanently injured pelicans inside our pens are still waiting for the approval of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the U S Fish Wildlife Service approval before they can breed One little pelican was abandoned by his parents in their haste to start a second mating and nesting in the same season He was about two weeks short of being old enough to fly but still afraid of people and very difficult to catch so that we could continue feeding until he was self sufficient After five days of self imposed starvation Harry cornered him behind an aviary and fed him and he immediately jerked away running and flapping to the water s edge where he sat with a pouch full of fish The next morning and every day for the next two weeks he was in the corner behind the aviary waiting for Harry Now he comes running out from there whenever he sees Harry How quickly they learn bad habits Our problem now is how to teach him to go out and catch his own fish instead of waiting to catch Harry behind the aviary The smallest baby duck we have ever seen was brought to our door about three weeks ago We think it is a wild mallard duck The rescuer said the mother abandoned this baby We put the little fellow in an indoor cage and fed it for about a day until we noticed that it was getting entirely too attuned to people peeping a little greeting whenever someone passed his cage This can lead to a condition called imprinting where the baby grows up thinking it is a people instead of a duck Although this results in a cute pet it is a disaster to the duck because it looks to people for its normal social interaction even the most intimate kind In an effort to avoid imprinting we enlisted the aid of a regular barnyard muscovy duck that was hanging around the Seabird Station We put the baby mallard in a small aviary with the half grown muscovy and it worked We were delighted to see the muscovy sitting down and just the head of the baby mallard peeking out from under its breast The next day when we went out to the aviary we were concerned that we didn t see the baby even when the muscovy stood up and walked to the other corner of the aviary until the baby fell out from under its wing The baby mallard will probably think it s a muscovy when it grows up but that s better than imprinting as a people begin R12 We ve had about 10 cases of botulism among the 105 sick or injured pelicans that we ve received in the last two months which is about as many botulism cases as we normally get in an entire year We ve only been able to save about 5 of those 10 birds by supporting them with I V fluids given through the wing bones the preferred method in birds Botulism is caused by the toxins excreted from bacteria that sometimes occurs naturally when vegetable matter decays anaerobically without oxygen under the mud It then bubbles to the surface of the water and a small amount is ingested by the pelican when he eats The Botulism Research Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania gave us 30 doses of experimental botulism anti toxin about two weeks ago The trick is to catch the botulism in the very early stages before the toxin attacks the nerves and causes progressive paralysis The problem here is that some paralysis is usually the first visible symptom We ll let you know if this anti toxin turns out to be the silver bullet that solves the botulism problem Our sincere thanks to all of you and to Kate Jon Sage for another successful fish drive Sincerely Darlene Harry Kelton and all the other pelicans
