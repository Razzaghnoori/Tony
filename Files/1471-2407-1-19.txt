 Background Prostate cancer PCA is the leading cause of death in the American male over age 55 according to recent data 1 To date the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of this disease including how normal prostate cells become neoplastic remain unidentified Moreover the treatment efficacy of this disease remains limited especially when it recurs A thorough understanding of the neoplastic process could facilitate earlier detection of the disease lead to more specific therapies for PCA and ultimately improve survival PCA is one of several types of cancers in which IL 6 has been found or is thought to play a pathophysiological role Some researchers think IL 6 may play a role in PCA because of what IL 6 does in other model systems of cancer biology For example early investigators observed that transfection of untransformed B cells with a plasmid for constitutive expression of IL 6 conferred the tumorigenic phenotype on the cells 2 IL 6 is a key factor in myeloma progression and survival 3 4 and also in Kaposi s sarcoma a solid tumor 5 In myeloma the standard therapy for treatment includes prednisone which acts by inhibiting IL 6 synthesis Experimental anti IL 6 therapies for myeloma and B lymphoproliferative disorders have been shown to be of some use in limited clinical trials 6 7 8 9 10 11 therefore this is an intensely studied target for myeloma therapy As mentioned above IL 6 is a cytokine that functions as a necessary growth factor in several cancer types most studied in multiple myeloma 12 It is an essential factor in the development and maintenance of B cell neoplasms 13 and likely plays an important role in many other types of cancer IL 6 signals through a set of signaling proteins of the JAK and STAT kinase families 14 The JAK and STAT kinases are activated by phosphorylation initiated by the homodimerization of the IL 6 IL 6 receptor complex on the cell surface The major IL 6 signaling intermediates are JAK2 and STAT3 15 Homodimerization of the IL 6 receptor complex induces the autophosphorylation of JAK2 The now activated JAK2 phosphorylates STAT3 which forms homodimers can cross the nuclear membrane and function as a transcription factor inducing various genes including genes involved in the cellular transformation process 15 An association between autocrine IL 6 and PCA has been known for some time 16 17 The change in prostate cell phenotype from paracrine IL 6 stimulated to autocrine IL 6 stimulated is believed to be a contributing factor in the progression from benign hyperplasia to neoplasia 17 IL 6 is also implicated in the development of cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy in PCA patients 18 19 In other studies a chimeric protein consisting of an anti IL 6 Ab fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin was found to inhibit proliferation of prostate carcinoma cell lines 20 Exogenous IL 6 activated androgen responsive gene expression in the absence of androgens in human LNCaP cells 21 More work is needed to clarify the role of IL 6 in prostate neoplasia While there is some evidence suggesting IL 6 mediated neoplasia in PCA development 17 22 a system suitable for following the transformation of prostate cells during PCA development remains lacking We chose to use the NRP 152 and NRP 154 cell lines derived by Danielpour et al 23 to examine the question of IL 6 mediated neoplastic progression via STAT3 activation The 2 lines were derived from the same part of the rat prostate following treatment in vivo with N methyl N nitrosourea The NRP 152 cells are immortalized but not transformed require several growth factors for in vitro survival and do not give rise to tumors in vivo The NRP 154 cells are transformed grow in the absence of exogenous growth factors and are tumorigenic 23 24 25 26 27 These lines come from epithelial cells While prostatic epithelium is resistant to neoplastic transformation it is not resistant to the development of hyperplasia Studying the neoplastic transformation events in a cell type inherently resistant to this type of change can yield much valuable information about the transformation process in prostate cells Materials Methods Cell lines and growth media The tumorigenic NRP 154 and non tumorigenic NRP 152 rat prostate epithelial cell lines were the gift of Dr David Danielpour Ireland Cancer Center University Hospital of Cleveland Case Western Reserve

streptavidin for 45 min on ice After washing three times cells were analyzed on the flow cytometer Treatment of NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells with AG490 The tyrphostin protein kinase inhibitor AG490 was purchased from Calbiochem It was dissolved in DMSO and stored at 20 C in single use aliquots NRP 152 and cloned NRP 154 cells were placed in 60 mm wells and treated with AG490 for 48 hrs The cells were removed with trypsin and stained after washing with FITC annexin V 5 l 10 6cells Caltag for 15 min at room temperature Apoptotic cells cells staining with FITC annexin V were quantified by measuring green fluorescence in FL1 on the flow cytometer CellQuest software was used to acquire and analyze the data STATView software was used to perform statistical analyses Results Determination of the phosphorylation state of STAT3 in NRP 152 NRP 154 cells We had very preliminary data from a microarray experiment comparing the RNA of NRP 152 to NRP 154 cells which indicated that STAT3 might be over expressed on NRP 154 cells relative to NRP 152 cells data not shown Since STAT3 is active only when phosphorylated we decided to confirm these preliminary results by looking for phospho STAT3 in both cell lines by intracellular flow cytometry We observed that STAT3 was constitutively phosphorylated in NRP 154 but not NRP 152 cells Even when treated with testosterone as described in Materials and Methods NRP 152 cells did not exhibit phosphorylated STAT3 Figure 1 These data indicate that the over expressed STAT3 observed in NRP 154 cells in the gene microarray was putatively active as a transcription factor since the amount of phospho STAT3 in NRP 154 cells was increased relative to NRP 152 cells IL 6 is produced constitutively by NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells In order to determine if IL 6 was the activating ligand for phosphorylation of STAT3 we examined IL 6 expression in untreated NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells by intracellular flow cytometry While both cell lines made IL 6 NRP 154 cells displayed a different pattern in that there was a peak of cells negative for IL 6 Figure 2 This may have been due to heterogeneity of the NRP 154 cells since the parental lines had not been subcloned by us Therefore we derived 16 clones of NRP 154 cells by limit dilution cloning and examined these for level of IL 6 expression We observed that 9 clones were highly positive for IL 6 while the rest expressed little IL 6 thereby accounting for the 2 peaks we observed in the parental NRP 154 line Figure 3 IL 6 receptor was expressed on the surfaces of NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells When we examined NRP 152 and uncloned NRP 154 cells for expression of the IL 6 receptor we observed that all NRP 152 cells expressed the IL 6 receptor while the uncloned NRP 154 cells had a population that apparently did not express the receptor Figure 4 In studies currently underway we are analyzing the 16 NRP 154 clones we derived for differences in IL 6 receptor expression and to see if there is any correlation with levels of IL 6 expression Effect of dexamethasone treatment on NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells To examine the role of autocrine IL 6 on NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells we looked at the effect of dexamethasone treatment on IL 6 expression on both cell lines and on high and low IL 6 expressing clones of NRP 154 cells Dexamethasone is known to inhibit IL 6 synthesis by acting at the steroid response elements of the IL 6 promoter NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells were routinely grown in the presence of dexamethasone so the effect on proliferation was not quantified In the following experiments we used dexamethasone free medium and also treated the serum twice with activated charcoal to remove endogenous steroids stripped serum then added defined amounts of dexamethasone for carying out the experiments We observed that dexamethasone treatment of NRP 152 cells inhibited IL 6 synthesis without affecting NRP 152 growth as expected In contrast dexamethasone treatment of NRP 154 cells did not inhibit IL 6 synthesis instead dexamethasone treatment apparently enhanced IL 6 production panel B This effect was observed for high and low IL 6 expressing clones of NRP 154 Figure 5 panels C and D and therefore was independent of IL 6 production by the cells However clones expressing low amounts of IL 6 expressed less enhancement of IL 6 production that clones expressing high amounts of IL 6 Figure 5 panels C and D Inhibition of JAK2 induced apoptosis in NRP 152 but not NRP 154 clones In continuing our studies on the role of IL 6 in STAT3 phosphorylation we used the JAK2 phosphorylation inhibitor AG490 to see if inhibiting JAK2 phosphorylation would inhibit survival of NRP 152 or NRP 154 cells as had been described for LNCaP cells previously 29 We examined clones of NRP 154 selected by amount of IL 6 expression each had 2 high IL 6 expressing clones and 2 low IL 6 expressing clones were used for these experiments Treatment with the JAK2 inhibitor for 48 hrs induced apoptosis measured by cellular binding of FITC annexin V in NRP 152 but not NRP 154 clones Table 1 We detected no effect of the vehicle DMSO at the highest concentration used Our data imply that JAK2 mediated phosphorylation of STAT3 was essential for the survival of NRP 152 cells but that NRP 154 cells did not require activated JAK2 for survival regardless of amount of IL 6 produced by the cell Further experiments are underway to determine if STAT3 requires phosphorylation by a different kinase such as JAK1 in NRP 154 cells Discussion We observed that STAT3 was constitutively phosphorylated in NRP 154 but not NRP 152 cells Figure 1 Treatment of NRP 154 cells with testosterone did not increase the level of phosphorylation in NRP 154 cells data not shown Even after testosterone treatment STAT3 was not phosphorylated in NRP 152 cells data not shown There is evidence that androgen treatment may increase the survival of PCA cells through activation of STAT3 29 Further experiments are underway to test this possibility STAT1 another signaling intermediate in the IL 6 pathway has been observed to be activated in non tumorigenic cells and may function as a check for STAT3 phosphorylation a possible oncogenic event 30 31 We are investigating whether or not STAT1 is phosphorylated by JAK2 in NRP 152 cells and whether STAT1 phosphorylation is required for the survival of NRP 152 cells These results would explain why we saw an effect of AG490 on NRP 152 cells in the absence of phospho STAT3 in these cells Table 1 We looked at the effect of anti rat IL 6 Ab on both NRP 152 or NRP 154 cell growth rate but were unable to detect an effect using 3H thymidine incorporation to measure proliferation data not shown We think this is due to failure to reach high enough Ab commercially available anti rat IL 6 concentrations necessary to neutralize the IL 6 produced by the NRP 154 cells highest concentration achieved was only 20 g ml We are limited in performing Ab studies by the lack of commercially available rat specific reagents However we are using alternative strategies in more experiments currently underway to determine the role of IL 6 in STAT3 activation to answer this important question in NRP 154 cells We found that dexamethasone treatment of NRP 152 cells inhibited IL 6 synthesis without affecting cell growth In contrast dexamethasone treatment of NRP 154 cells did not inhibit IL 6 synthesis instead dexamethasone treatment eliminated the IL 6 negative peak and enhanced IL 6 production albeit to a smaller extent in low IL 6 expressing clones Figure 5 panel D Enhancement of IL 6 production by dexamethasone treatment has been previously observed in Kaposi s sarcoma cells 32 In the case of NRP 154 cells the steroid responsive element for dexamethasone on the IL 6 promoter may have been mutated to a form that does not bind steroid receptors Mutations in the IL 6 promoter region may play a role in the tumorigenic effects of constitutive IL 6 expression in prostatic carcinoma cells 33 Such polymorphisms have been described for the IL 6 receptor in Kaposi s sarcoma and are believed to play a role in IL 6 mediated progression of this type of cancer 32 We observed that inhibition of STAT3 activation by treatment with AG490 which inhibits JAK2 activation resulted in apoptosis of NRP 152 but not NRP 154 cells Table 1 A possible explanation of the data would be the use of JAK1 for phosphorylation of STAT3 in NRP 154 cells which would not be inhibited by AG490 IL 6 receptor binding activates JAK1 as well as JAK2 which in turn phosphorylates STAT3 14 This in fact has been shown to be the case for v src transformed fibroblasts 34 Another hypothesis is that STAT3 activation in NRP 154 cells is not dependent upon a signaling cascade but is constitutive possibly due to a mutation not unlike that contained within the cSTAT3 plasmid generated by Bromberg et al 35 We are investigating in detail the signaling pathway in NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells to answer these important questions The importance of STAT3 activation via IL 6 in prostatic cancer development has been suggested by previous investigators For example IL 6 acting via its receptor has been shown to activate STAT3 in LNCaP cells IL 6 given exogenously since LNCaP cells do not produce IL 6 resulted in increased growth of the cells concomitant with activation of STAT3 36 LNCaP cells transfected with a plasmid conferring constitutive IL 6 expression demonstrated increased growth relative to untransfected or sham transfected cells 36 However other investigators have observed that IL 6 treatment of LNCaP cells reulted in terminal differentiation and inhibition of growth associated with STAT3 activation 17 37 38 The molecular basis for the apparent contradiction is unknown at this time Continued use of the NRP 152 and NRP 154 cell lines in parallel experiments should be useful in elucidating the discrepancies among various laboratories It is possible that exogenous or autocrine IL 6 is not required for constitutive STAT3 activation in NRP 154 cells For example viral IL 6 might be incorporated into the genomes of prostatic carcinomas as has been described for Kaposi sarcoma 5 32 33 39 40 41 The route of introduction of the viral IL 6 is believed to be through previous herpesvirus infection 39 41 Another possibility is that the insertion of the oncogene BRCA1 results in the constitutive activation of STAT3 in NRP 154 cells as has been described in Du 145 prostate cancer cells 42 Du 145 cells do not make IL 6 nor are they dependent upon it for continued proliferation in vitro However they were dependent upon STAT3 activation for survival as demonstrated by experiments in which anti sense oligomucleotides for STAT3 were incoporated by Du 145 cells 42 We are currently performing similar experiments to determine if IL 6 is a necessary ligand for the activation and survival of NRP 154 cells In summary we have demonstrated that a major difference between NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells is that NRP 154 cells over express the gene for STAT3 relative to NRP 152 cells and untreated NRP 154 cells Furthermore NRP 154 cells express constitutively activated STAT3 while NRP 152 cells do not Moreover we found that while both cell lines synthesized IL 6 constitutively only the IL 6 production of NRP 152 cells was inhibited by dexamethasone treatment Figure 5 Finally we demonstrated that while both cell lines expressed the IL 6 receptor on their surfaces the patterns were different NRP 154 cells had a subpopulation of cells which did not stain with anti IL 6 receptor Ab while all the NRP 152 cells stained with Ab to the IL 6 receptor Although the results presented above give us more insight into the role of IL 6 in PCA they do not tell us if constitutive STAT3 activation is a determining factor in the change to prostate neoplasia or if anti apoptotic factors induced by STAT3 play a role in prostatic neoplasia Conclusions We have shown that NRP 152 and NRP 154 cells exhibit fundamental differences in the regulation of IL 6 production by dexamethasone and in the requirement for JAK2 mediated events for survival The tumorigenic line NRP 154 expressed phospho STAT3 under normal growth condition while the non tumorigenic line did not These data indicate a very important role for STAT3 in conferring the neoplastic state on prostatic epithelial cells and point out the future direction of our laboratory s investigations List of abbreviations PCA prostate cancer DMEM Dulbecco s modification of Eagle s
