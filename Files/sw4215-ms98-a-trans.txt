                okay so we are talking about recycling   recycling yeah   i i just move down from uh up near Boston   oh you did   yes and up there theyre doing quite a bit   uhhuh   they they one of the thing that theyve tried doing is theyve had it they got a uh deposit on all uh plastic container you know bottle what not and   you mean like bottles of what kind   i mean like Coke bottles things like that uh and also cans so its a five cent deposit on all of those uh which you know encourage some what for people to bring them back   oh Coke bottle okay yeah oh that terrific   there also in area up their that mandated uh separating your garbage   yeah so you have to separate separate the glass from the plastic from the   uh from the paper i believe even right   from the paper oh thats really   so i know that theyre doing and up there and several community down here theyre not doing a hole lot down here uh their actually are some community where they mandating that uh most i think its aluminum from everything else   yeah   and also its against the law anywhere in the county down here to uh deposit uh yard trash like you know clippings and stuff in the trash   yeah yeah   so thats what theyre doing here what are they doing there   well i im very interested in this because i think its its extremely necessary and i ive tried to you know from the beginning i i started you know um trying to recycling even before they had any program you know they they just sort of had voluntary trash uh you know bins you could put your plastic in and now they its theyre trying to have um a city wide program where theyre actually have special trucks to pick up your separated um plastic and glass and uh newspapers   but it but it still voluntary   but well theyve theyve got trucks for part of the city and and they havent gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of Plano so some of the people in Plano do have that recycling and its pick up at their door and you know at their driveway and we dont so we still have to take it voluntarily to the library where they have the you know glass bin and the and the aluminum and and uh but there they dont take plastic   what of the other thing that there was been done up in Massachusetts that was very good well several of the grocery store chain were uh instituting a five cent credit if you brought back your bags and reuse them   oh thats great   uh   see were we dont have that either yet either im trying you know i keep trying to remember to bring my little canvas bag into the store with me but i cant remember to do it       its real hard to break that habit   sure   you know just going into the grocery for five or six thing and then you get in there you think why i dont have the bag with me you know   you havent seen any i havent seen any of that down here   but we have you know a lot now i saw one lady not to long ago with five or six of those canvas bags and she had them all with her and she took her grocery home in those which i thought was great   sure   but nobody does that i mean its you you just never see anybody with them   right my parents uh live in Little Rock Arkansas   so oh they did yeah thats not to   yes well they do and they uh and i i sent my mom a couple of those canvas bags just so she can do that because they you know they look at her like she was crazy there   oh they do okay yeah well good for you yeah yeah they they really we we need to encourage i mean i know in New Jersey where im from originally im from there and you know theyve been doing um the glass you know the pickup of separating trash and mandatory for a long time theyve theyve been doing it for a year or two   sure   but um but Plano needs to get more of these trucks   unfortunately i think that what we are seeing though is like areas like Plano i where it is not densely populating uh you know the whole area   yeah   that it is a lot easier for people to uh you know ignore the landfill problem where as New Jersey Massachusetts you know New England   oh yeah see they have to do it yeah New Jersey especially i mean that a really populated highly populated state i guess Massachusetts is to   right Massachusetts is getting there well  Boston is like Massachusetts is very heavily populated you know western Massachusetts is not   is not is that where youre from originally is that where you were born   no no actually not i was i was born in Alabama and i lived in Oklahoma where we didnt do any recycling i lived in Arkansas Massachusetts now Florida   yeah yeah so youve been around   so Massachusetts is probably like like i said the best of what i seen there   well its i just i just think the more you you know you just each person have to consciously think about doing of something little or something big whatever you can do   sure well  theres theres actually some other good ideas that have come up where for example i think this was actually originated in Oklahoma city on the uh where they scrap the uh top of the roads off and they actually remixed that and use it again   but   you know for the asphalt they having to uh you know trash out   oh yes oh thats a neat idea i never would have thought of that   so why dont Oklahoma city thought of that   well thats the thats the thing that there are thing you can do that you cant you know nobody thinks about   sure   there are these thing that people would get their minds working and just you know brainstorming that you just its a whole new way of thinking   sure i i believe in Baltimore theyre recycling glass and using it as part of the asphalt   are they really well thats neat   yes which they also think it is good because it make the roads prettier   oh for heaven sakes thats right thats amazing because we use to live in Baltimore   because they sparkle   we lived there for a while before we came down and we lived in Pennsylvania and then we came here about fifteen years ago   my sister is born in Baltimore   she was where she was at what hospital   born in Baltimore i i dont know
