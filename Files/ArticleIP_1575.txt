 The Warner Brothers Lisa produced by Trippi McMahon and Squier Of course they aren t brothers but two Warners John and Mark Republican and Democrat are running against each other in Virginia for John s Senate seat On the surface this 60 second ad for Mark is what political consultants call a bio spot Underneath however it is an implicit comparative in which every favorable item about Mark is an unspoken for the moment push off against John The spot attempts to define the race it s a road map to where Mark s campaign intends to go John is older 69 and a career politician 31 years in public office 18 of them in the Senate Mark is 41 and a high tech entrepreneur The spot begins with Mark today emphasizing that he s created a multimillion dollar business He s trying in effect to give John a gold watch to cast him as a senator for the past a strategy often discussed in politics but seldom fully executed as challengers usually turn to harder edged negatives Here Mark is graphically portrayed as the future the spot tells us this visually not only with his looks but with its look right down to the cyberesque chyrons the writing on screen and the moving cursor Both John and Mark are wealthy John is Virginia hunt country and the former husband of both a Mellon heiress and Elizabeth Taylor Mark the spot tells us is different first in his family to college which was paid for with loans and part time jobs His wife Lisa vouches for his effort to keep that old car running and pay off the student loans polls show that if you had them you better have paid them This common man theme is also a pre emptive defense Mark will spend millions of dollars of his own money against John the odds on favorite who also has the clear fund raising advantage But Mark wants voters to know that he earned every penny himself A skeptical electorate tends to resist claims made in political ads So as this spot returns to the present it relies on an increasingly standard technique It invokes third party verifiers independent journalistic sources to tell voters that Mark deserves credit for building the information highway A second source is used to prop up this improbable claim while a short sleeved Mark casually reaches over a workstation in a postmodern office Now the spot moves from Mark the private sector innovator to Mark the public policy innovator in health care The images convey a sense of compassion and inclusion The young guy cares about the elderly and minorities And again the implicit comparison with John Mark has new ideas and even better for a Democrat they re not about big government but about a public private partnership Finally the spot weaves together the common man theme Mark himself replays it to camera the future theme watch the blinking cursor and a visual and verbal appeal to family values With this Mark is fishing for stray conservative voters increasingly alienated from the twice divorced now unmarried John who is pro choice on abortion voted against Clarence Thomas for the Supreme Court and adamantly opposed Oliver North s 1994 Senate bid Is that the subliminal message of the slogan The Right Warner for Virginia s Future Just kidding the operative word here is Future Robert Shrum
