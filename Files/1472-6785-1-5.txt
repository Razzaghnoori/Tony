 Background Early recognition of the contrast between the stabilizing influences of density dependent population regulation and potentially de stabilizing influences of environmental variation 1 laid a foundation for theoretical modeling of population stability in stochastic environments 2 that assumes renewed relevance in light of current developments in ecology and climate research 3 Recently for instance numerous studies have documented the influences of global scale climatic variation on the population dynamics of vertebrates in widely diverse ecosystems see e g 4 5 for reviews including species interactions at the community level 6 7 8 To our knowledge however no study has yet documented a simultaneous and direct influence of large scale climate on the dynamics at all trophic levels in a single system Such a pervasive influence could pose consequences for the persistence of biological communities if the climatic influence at any trophic level or multiple levels were strong enough to alter its dynamical stability 3 Here we use empirical data on a three trophic level system involving predators herbivores and vegetation and a community level model to test for the influences of climate on the dynamics at and among individual trophic levels while simultaneously accounting for the roles of intrinsic density dependent and interspecific interactions Previously we identified correlations between large scale variation in winter climate the North Atlantic Oscillation NAO 9 and predation efficiency of wolves Canis lupus mortality of old moose Alces alces and growth dynamics of balsam fir Abies balsamea on Isle Royale 6 Additionally we have documented influences of the NAO wolf predation and density dependence on the intrinsic rate of increase in the moose population on Isle Royale 10 Hence the current analysis was motivated by the results of these earlier attempts to dissect the relative contributions of intrinsic and extrinsic processes to the dynamics of this community as well as by a more general interest in developing a community level model of climatic effects at and among multiple trophic levels that may subsequently contribute to our understanding of the implications of climatic change for community stability Quantifying the role of climatic variation in the dynamics at multiple trophic levels requires however a modeling framework that first accounts for the influence of interspecific and intrinsic processes on the dynamical structure at each level so that the influence of intrinsic processes on the autoregressive AR structure of the time series data is not mistaken for a lagged influence of environmental stochasticity 11 Based on the approach used in the development of previous bivariate population models 12 13 14 we developed and applied a model testing for the direct influence of large scale climate on the dynamics at individual trophic levels and interactions among levels Figure 1 This graphical model was used to express mathematically the predicted autoregressive structure of the time series data at each level on the basis of interspecific density interactions at adjacent trophic levels 12 as well as the time lags at which climate might influence dynamics at each level see equations 1 4 in Methods below The time series we analyzed comprise 30 years of data 1958 88 from the monitoring study on Isle Royale on the population dynamics of wolves and moose and interannual variability in growth increments of balsam fir 6 15 16 Though the data extend to the present estimates of moose density beyond 1988 have not been adjusted by cohort reconstruction see ref 6 so we constrained our analysis to the first 3 decades Results The corrected Akaike Information Criterion AIC c 17 scores of the pure time series data at each level of the Isle Royale community indicate that the AR dimension of the data for the period 1958 88 is one for wolves three for moose and one for fir AIC c scores of the first second and third order autoregressive models i e AR 1 AR 2 and AR 3 are for wolves 4 2 7 1 10 6 for moose 64 6 63 9 67 1 and for balsam fir 26 0 22 1 21 6 The lowest AIC c score indicates the most parsimonious dimension at each trophic level In full agreement with the pure AR structure of the time series the most parsimonious ecological model of wolf dynamics was an AR 1 model with current year climate as a covariate Table 1a the best model of moose dynamics was an AR 3 model with current year climate as a covariate Table 1b and the best model of fir dynamics was an AR 1 model with current year climate as a covariate Table 1c Each of these models provided a good approximation of the dynamics at the individual trophic levels Table 1 Figure 2 Note however that for moose a good approximation of the dynamics was afforded by an AR 2 model with the same covariates as the best AR 3 model in Table 1 R 2 0 96 AIC c 63 9 and so might be favored over the AR 3 model on the basis of parsimony Direct density dependence was slightly stronger at the middle trophic level moose than at the top or bottom levels though none of the tests for differences between these coefficients was significant Figure 3 In contrast the influence of large scale climate was significantly weaker at the middle trophic level than at either the top or bottom trophic levels Figure 3 Discussion The results of our analysis corroborate previous observations of the limiting influences of winter climate in moose population dynamics 18 of the mediating influence of winter climate in wolf moose interactions 19 of the roles of wolf predation and density dependence in moose dynamics 10 20 and of the direct influence of winter climate on growth dynamics of balsam fir 6 on Isle Royale To our knowledge however this study constitutes the first documentation of direct and simultaneous influences of large scale climate on the dynamics at multiple trophic levels in a single system Although many studies have documented influences of winter weather particularly snow conditions on wolf prey interactions e g 19 21 22 23 we are unaware of studies showing an influence of winter climate on wolf population dynamics Evidence of influences of snow on wolf movement social tendencies 24 and predation rates 6 suggests however that winter climate might affect wolf survival While we wish to avoid speculating as to potential mechanisms underlying the direct influence of the NAO on wolf dynamics indicated by our analysis Table 1 it may be worth considering that residual variation in annual wolf mortality after accounting for the influences of wolf density and pack size 6 correlates negatively with the current year NAO index standardized r 0 52 t 2 22 P 0 038 Trophic theory 25 statistical ecology 26 27 and our model Figure 1and equation 4 in Methods predict that the embedding dimension i e the number of time lags we must look back upon in order to find a correlation with the current year s density of the dynamics at each trophic level should reflect the number of species influencing the dynamics at each level as several recent analyses have also demonstrated 14 28 29 In this perspective we found however lower dimension i e first order at both the predator and vegetation levels than expected Table 1 while dynamics at the herbivore level displayed the higher dimension predicted by our model Interestingly dimensionality in this large mammal system parallels the dynamic structure of the lynx hare system of the Canadian boreal forest at the herbivore level but not at the predator level 28 The embedding dimension of lynx which are affected by many species other than snowshoe hare across the boreal forest of Canada is generally two or higher 28 30 The contrasting simplicity of wolf dynamics on Isle Royale reflects we suggest the comparatively insular nature of the Isle Royale system and relative scarcity of additional species influencing the dynamics of wolves there 31 Despite having low dimension the top and bottom trophic levels displayed complex dynamics Table 1 Indeed spectral analysis of the wolf and moose time series reveals significant periodicity at both levels that is apparently driven by phase dependent predation a process that is endogenous to wolf dynamics but exogenous to moose E Post N C Stenseth R O Peterson J A Vucetich A M Ellis in review Fir dynamics on Isle Royale are moreover tightly linked with changes in moose density 6 16 which could contribute to exogenously generated periodicity at that level 27 The low dimension of the dynamics at the top and bottom trophic levels masks in a sense interactions with the adjacent herbivore level that were captured in these models Note however that in the most parsimonious model of wolf dynamics Table 1 the lag one autoregressive term quantifying direct density dependence includes the coefficient of self regulation in moose 1 b 1 and the coefficient of the lag one pack size term includes the coefficient quantifying the interaction between moose density and wolf density coefficient a 2 from Equation 2a As well in the most parsimonious model of fir dynamics Table 1 the lag one autoregressive term includes the coefficients quantifying the influences of moose on fir coefficient c 2 from equation 2c and of fir on moose coefficient b 3 from equation 2b Hence an important conclusion of this analysis is that while interactions between adjacent trophic levels lead to predictions of higher order dynamics during the derivation of the community model Figure 1 the act of following the coefficients from the individual trophic level models sensu 32 allows us to observe that trophic interactions may also appear in first order density dependence Conclusions Experimental evidence from microcosm studies indicates that climatic change may alter community stability if individual populations composing the community exhibit weak density dependence or if climate change influences interspecific interactions 33 While we caution against drawing general conclusions from this analysis our results suggest that climatic change has the potential to influence the stability of this community by altering the dynamics and stability at any single or all three of the individual trophic levels Because self regulation i e direct density dependence was relatively weaker at the top and bottom trophic levels though not significant statistically it may be these levels at which climate change alters stability of the community It is worth recalling however that theory predicts that population stability depends on the relative strengths of intrinsic and environmental influences on population dynamics 2 In this regard it may be the observation that climate exerted its greatest influence on the dynamics of the top and bottom trophic levels Figure 3 that is most relevant because even if self regulation were equivalent at all three levels it is at the levels most responsive to climate where we will see the greatest effects of climate change on dynamics and stability 3 Moreover it appears that in this system the two trophic levels with the simplest dynamics predator and vegetation also displayed the greatest response to climate Whether community stability in a changing climate relates to dynamic complexity at individual trophic levels as opposed to complexity of entire food webs sensu 34 should prove to be a fruitful and important pursuit in future research Methods We expressed the dynamics of predator density P herbivore density H and incremental vegetation growth V as see Figure 1 P t P t 1 exp f X t 1 Y t 1 U Dt U Pt 1a H t H t 1 exp g X t 1 Y t 1 Z t 1 U Dt U Pt 1b V t V t 1 exp h Z t 1 Y t U Dt 1c where X t Y t and Z t are the log e transformed P t H t and Z t respectively and where U Dt is a climate variable here U Dt is the NAO winter index see 9 and where U Pt represents wolf pack size which correlates with winter climatic conditions and pack kill rate moose killed pack day 6 and which incorporates social structure and associated non predatory behavior that could affect dynamics of both wolves 35 and moose 6 The choice of the ecological functions f g and h is not straightforward considering the variety of functional forms that have been suggested 36 However for the subsequent purposes of estimating statistical density dependence it is biologically reasonable to assume that the functions may be approximately linear in X t Y t and Z t that is we may assume that population and vegetation growth rates are approximately linearly related to log density 12 14 37 38 Hence we may re write equation 1 as X t a 0 1 a 1 X t 1 a 2 Y t 1 a 3 U Dt a 4 U Pt 2a Y t b 0 1 b 1 Y t 1 b 2 X t 1 b 3 Z t 1 b 4 U Dt b 5 U Pt 2b Z t c 0 1 c 1 Z t

the full model at each trophic level we used autoregressive analysis with maximum likelihood estimation and backwards elimination of non significant covariates and lagged autoregressive terms to arrive at reduced models that minimized the corrected Akaike Information Criterion AIC c 17 We considered changes in the AIC c scores of less than one to be insignificant improvement of the models 37
