 Hillary s Underwear and Other Matters of State Massa Honey Your plane ride sounds amazing Were I you I would ve looked at it this way Nothing will happen to this plane because the news value of a crash would be too astounding Are you old enough to remember Bishop Sheen We were once on the same aircraft with several nuns and I took that to be the same kind of indemnity not the religious factor the fame This thinking is flawed I know but that s the way my mind works Or doesn t I m holding off reading the Times today a mini boycott because yesterday they made Nelson Rockefeller vice president in someone s obituary He wasn t was he If he was I think I need to go back and read the Dean Acheson book I love the Hillary and Chappaqua carryings on Well make that Hillary and Chappaqua and Tina Brown Seems that the editrix declared Hill a loser in her intended race Bet Hill s sorry now that she gave Tina her innermost psychobabble for the premiere issue of Talk As if being declared a loser by a former sycophant weren t bad enough the first lady was just selected 1999 s Most Boring Celebrity by the Boring Institute in Maplewood NJ Not that they re a heavy hitter group but still My concerns about Chappaqua however are not political They are concerns any woman would have about moving into a new home Will she be able to find her underwear with all those boxes piled up I know she intends to find it but you never know And will she be given a good phone number and will the phone even work on the first day I hate to say this because it s politically incorrect at least in my circles but you gotta love Lucianne She and a few other reporters implied that the White House equivalent of the store dick ought to keep an eye on Hill so she doesn t try to furnish her house with things from 1600 and Camp David But just to show that I am not totally down on Hill I hope that like some of the royals she ll have a fling a ling with one of the bodyguards God knows the girl could use some uh well whatever What I really want is for the Clintons to just go away Far away And quietly Fat chance xxM
