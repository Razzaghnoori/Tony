 what kind of coins do you primarily collect um basically i my preference is Arab coins hum and ancient coins hum i ve got a uh i ve got a few i don t know i don t know i don t even know if they re real but they seem to be very old Greek or Roman coins that somebody gave me as i when i was a kid never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box um hum i m mostly into uh American gold and silver dollars and stuff like that oh very interesting um over the years of course by uh my grandparents used to give me silver dollars so i ve got a few of those tucked away but um hum um your Greek and Roman coins might you know if if they re um in good condition might be worth something you might want to drag them out and i keep meaning to do that everytime i go to a show i keep saying well i ll take them with me and let somebody look at them they just they just feel phony you know they feel like they re made of lead or something and uh they don t have any sort of it s it s got a it s got a like a picture on it um hum but there s no uh inscriptions or or dates or anything else that would be the Greek ones yeah okay because i think most the Roman ones have had something on them right right so this yeah it had a it had a had a has a bust of somebody on there but uh no sort of identifying marks or anything um hum um it the are they silver or no i don t no they re not they re it s it s too heavy for silver it s it s more like lead i think fairly soft bronze oh interesting yeah i think they re fakes did did somebody go over to the Middle East where they could have picked up some fakes pretty easily probably i don t know where they got them from they just came up gave me a whole bag of these things oh um hum it s probably about thirty or forty of them in there gee that s yeah they you might be sitting on a gold mine wouldn t that be something right um i don t know a lot about um Greek and Roman although i m a member of an organization and that is the the primary interest of some ancient uh Numismatic Society Club um hum and so most of the people collect Roman with a few collecting Greek so every now and then we have a program so i ve picked up a bit hum but um if it if they re really soft and very early they could be uh i think they call them Lydian coins huh and um gosh all these years i ve been thinking they were fakes maybe they re real right i don t uh you know i i guess they say that a lot of people in the in the Middle East particularly can pick up fakes um hum you know if you go to um uh a fight and then the people say oh look what i just dug out of the ground and they sell you something they made last night um hum but um i think that s fairly recent phenomena probably sounds like some of the coin dealers i know now now they re supposed to they re supposed to be licensed and the um above board right i used to be a coin dealer so i i i know i know those guys you know oh i see oh and you made your own yeah i got a whole roll of Krugerrands here would you like to buy i just made them last night here s a nice uh twenty dollar gold eagle uh just just manufactured in Lebanon last year was uh was the gold worth i mean was it really gold yeah that they they are gold they re just of course the the twenty dollar gold pieces go for coin value not the bullion value right and amazingly enough you re you re into Middle Eastern sort of coins the the largest amount of fakes of US gold is made in Lebanon oh really yeah is that uh still still true yeah still is wow yeah that s sort of like a cottage industry industry over there um hum uh and and there s some very specific things you can find you can even narrow narrow it down to where it was made i mean people are so aware of these things that there are certain identifying marks on there that would not be on a real one and uh you you can almost tell the area somebody probably even knows the guy who made them you mean make oh i suppose he he has to protect himself too so that somebody can t say you know when he s selling them that somebody else made it i mean it s so that he gets his own profits yeah well the yeah coin dealers are supposed to be smart enough not to fall for that gimmick but i i have seen a few of them sell these things and course you have to you have to be able to prove they they knew it was counterfeit and that s always very difficult hum oh i see otherwise the the buyer is responsible i mean responsible well he can he can usually go back to the dealer but if if it s an unscrupulous dealer he ll just say hey you know you you had an opportunity to see it you know it s yours course you can always turn around and sell it in court and but you d have to go in on a fraud count and that wouldn t uh huh fraud is very difficult to prove um hum um hum because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it right and that s all he s got to say is well in my in my professional judgment it was a it was a real coin um hum so you know it s his word against mine right right that s one of the reasons i got out of the business there was too many shenanigans going on oh that s interesting because i m more interested in the research and i m doing some dye link analyses of of these early coins from the six and seven hundreds and so and so i m not into the the buying and selling business um hum um it sounds like i m wise yes yeah nowadays the the the way the uh the market is and the and the way the uh grading systems have changed over the last few years that s primarily what got me out of it they they kept changing the grading systems on coins and you know you go out and buy a very nice silver dollar collection and you ve graded it at the current grade and then the next year they ve changed the grading system and now these things are worth a fourth of what you paid for them you know it s just it it just got it just got ludicrous after a while oh um hum um hum uh what what what the the standards for for an uncirculated silver dollar changed so many times in three years and a lot of people lost lots of money on that course the the persistent dealers will just sit there if they graded them as M S sixty five then by golly they re M S sixty five i don t care what you say um hum um hum and they ll keep them until some fool comes along and buys them right at inflated prices um hum i think that s that s the the hardest thing is that people who don t really know feel sometimes a sometimes for example i know um you know the ancients better but because it s old they figure it s got to cost you know thousands of dollars oh yeah yeah i mean it s really it s it silly i mean i i i used to have people walk into my shop with um Indian head pennies you know um hum and they say wow you know this is really old yeah well it s not worth anything i ll give you a nickel for it you know oh and even even some of the rare coins that a lot of people have never even seen like um like two cent pieces right right and things like that those are not those are not even expensive i mean you can pick up very nice ones for eight nine dollars oh really i didn t know that oh yeah yeah they re cheap they re super cheap um oh that several i mean it s it s it it s funny the way the business works because there re so many things that are enormously out priced um hum um some some later proof sets because they have a slight error in them are are worth hundreds of dollars you know and and the coins themselves aren t worth very much at all face value basically um hum uh and then of course the silver coins are more and more being traded for bullion than anything else um hum uh you can you can buy bags of silver coins a a bag has a thousand dollars face value in it and it s traded for silver oh yeah so basically if if someone isn t really interested in the coins it s not some an investment no it s it s more of a uh it s a commodity purchase really um hum uh it is fun though to buy these bags and go through them because you do find some some uh nice coins i mean people who are starting out collections and need to fill holes in their books can fill a whole bunch of them with these uh with these bags um hum uh especially you you want to get a mixed bag of course dimes quarters and halves um hum uh but you could fill a whole bunch of uh holes with these things i used to i used to advertise buying wheat pennies um i d give a dollar a roll which two cents a piece which is basically overpriced um hum um but i used to go through i i d get loads and loads of these things i ended up one time with about uh about about twelve bags of these things and i d gone through all of them and i found a couple of them i found a nineteen O nine VDB oh and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce i found several good ones out of there um hum people s giving it to me for two cents i uh that s okay right turn around and sell it for fifteen dollars
