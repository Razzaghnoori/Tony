        and     all right well   i mean short term i dont think anythings gonna be done about it   well i   or probably should be done about it   uh are you saying you didnt think anything should be done in the short term   uh the short term the recession is getting getting top attention   yeah well i i think that youre absolutely right there the other thing is is that weve got these um these all these bank defaults going on and and savings and loan defaults and and uh uh   and that effectively adds to it whether its officially on the books or not   right exactly um   and thats got to be paid   exactly and and uh so this creates a pretty serious problem thats going to continue to be with us for a while to come um im not really uh sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing for instance tax reductions because it seems to me that if if if theyre talking about reducing uh the tax that needs to be paid or the taxes taxes currently being paid then that cant it seems to me it cant possibly  you know help with the the deficit picture   it can only hurt the deficit picture   yeah exactly   um and the the severity of the deficit picture already limits the options available or limits the degree of tax cutting you can do without uh bringing on on serious problems for the longer term   yeah exactly   so that that thats the current predicament   yeah it seems seems like its its a kind of a catch twenty two i mean its its the um my understanding is what theyre trying to what what supposedly theyre trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes theyll have more money to spend uh and if they have more money to spend then that will be a a spur to productivity particularly commercial productivity uh which in turn will generate revenue but it it seems like like uh its sort of a uh a spiral an unending spiral and it it uh im im not sure that theres any real genuine truth to the uh the idea that that uh that decreasing taxes particularly the kinds that are are being recommended by by the Bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to uh result in substantial amounts of money you know for consumers to spend       and uh   yeah im not sure how i feel about tagging them to share the cost of yeah the the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point its partly a judgment of how bad the recession is   yeah it uh it would seem to me that that there are other things that the administration could do   well look first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession as indeed it has with interest rates   umhum umhum i think thats been a positive development i think what thats done is its its its helped keep inflation from   umhum   um uh   well at the moment were doing very well on inflation   yeah exactly and its a sort of a piece of luck   thats the sort of upside to the deficit thats thats the upside to the recession   yeah um i dont know what kind of things do you think can be done in in uh in the long term   and the longer well can be done or will be done are two different things um at various places to look for for cutting the budget first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned   sure   depending on the world situation but there are various other areas such as as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed ah a lot of entitlement programs like education aid i think ah they shouldve put a in the Reagan administrations took took took  layoff such entitlements to the to the poor but left them for the middle class   umhum   ah in the longer term ah we we wed do well i think to make to make uh reductions there also somewhat related  is to collect money thats owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed   right i think that i i think that that i agree with you certainly in the second situation and i think certain entitlements i im inclined to agree with you too education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to um uh   a lot of the education aid has gone to so called trade schools   uhhuh   which are so there not colleges but schools that teach you trades you know beauticians whatever at more and often exists only because of the federal programs that they can take people and tell them they can get loans for their full tuition   oh i see what youre i see what youre saying   ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they dont provide very much education and uh   and then the and then the people default on the loans   yes   well i i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that uh around uh and i i i cant confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing but but but taking what youre saying at face value then i would have to agree with completely   yeah
