 May 3 2000 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Mr X Thank you so much for calling me to ask about corporate partner opportunities with our organization There are many ways to become involved with the Indianapolis Zoo and White River Gardens Corporations are involved in a wide variety of projects that make a huge impact on our institution including underwriting projects marketing sponsorships inkind donations volunteer projects etc We strive to create good matches for our partners projects that fit the company goals themes and interests Enclosed in this packet you will find information on our Society and a few different partnership options I hope that you agree that the Indianapolis Zoological Society enhances this community and helps to make it a safe and happy environment for people to live work and raise families The mission of the Indianapolis Zoological Society is to provide recreational learning experiences for the citizens of Indiana through the exhibition and presentation of natural environments in a way to foster a sense of discovery stewardship and the need to preserve the Earth s plants and animals In short the Society is about connecting animals plants and people The wonderful connections formed each day are made possible through the support of Society operations New in 1999 On June 13 1999 The Indianapolis Zoological Society introduced a sister institution to the Indianapolis Zoo This unique Dow complex White River Gardens is an extraordinary facility that adds a beautiful cultural attraction to Indianapolis It also provides the city state and nation with a unique educational resource for garden design plant material selection and plant husbandry especially for those in the Zone 5 growing region As gardening is the number one hobby in the United States the White River Gardens will further the Society s mission by nourishing the vital connection between people and their natural landscapes In July 1998 the Indianapolis Zoo announced a milestone in elephant conservation the first conception of a female African elephant by artificial insemination The 22 year old virgin female named Kubwa was confirmed pregnant on July 24 1998 by transrectal ultrasonography The artificial insemination technique was developed in cooperation with the Institute for Zoo Biology and Wildlife Research in Berlin Germany The difficulties of the anatomical structure of elephants made what is considered a common procedure among domestic animals extremely problematic The new technique was performed at the Zoo over Memorial Day weekend 1998 The gestation period for the African elephant is 22 months which makes Kubwa s expected delivery date in March 2000 On January 29 1999 the Zoo received the exciting news that a second elephant 17 year old Ivory had also conceived a calf This calf is expected in September of2000 The significance of this wonderful news is that researchers now know that they have developed a technique that is both effective and replicable This is extremely important to the long term survival of elephants in human care as well as the wild Connection through Animals You can see almost 4 000 animals at the Indianapolis Zoo but what you won t see are any cages Our Zoo was designed using the concept of biomes which simulate the natural habitats in which animals live Creating natural habitats does more than enhance the beauty of the Zoo It allows the animals to feel more relaxed and encourages their natural behaviors Our keepers help to provide opportunities for increased foraging environmental stimulation and social contact by using a wide array of scents objects and food Enrichment activities include hiding special treats like honey or peanut butter or giving animals blocks of ice indestructible balls or browse leafy tree branches with which to interact Understanding an animal s natural behavior increases conservation opportunities particularly captive breeding efforts of endangered species The Species Survival Plan SSP is a cooperative population management and conservation program for selected species in zoos and aquariums By keeping detailed records stud books zoo staff can make intelligent decisions on how to match individual animals to avoid inbreeding and maintain a healthy and genetically diverse captive population Staff members of the Indianapolis Zoo coordinate the national SSP s for the African elephant rock iguana cyclura and the ring tailed lemur The Indianapolis Zoo houses 13 SSP animals 16 species that are endangered and 6 that are threatened As mentioned earlier research is another important component to the preservation of endangered species The Indianapolis Zoo makes significant contributions with the global impact to a variety of species Besides the incredible work with African elephants we also contribute to the conservation of rare iguanas A young boy in the Hellshire Hills near Kingston found one specimen of Jamaican Iguana thought to be extinct unti11990 There are now 80 living specimen in captivity at Hope Zoo in Jamaica Internationally recognized for its successful breeding program of Ricord s and rhinoceros iguanas the Indianapolis Zoo was one of six zoos selected to help save the Jamaican iguana Our Zoo houses a trio of these iguanas and along with the Hope Zoo and five other zoos are developing a breeding program for the animals The Indianapolis Zoo recently became the first zoo to breed successfully the critically endangered Grand Cayman blue iguana Connecting through Plants Since the Indianapolis Zoo opened in 1988 its botanical collection has been integrated throughout the grounds of our 64 acre complex Our naturalistic approach to displaying animals and plants together has caught on with the public particularly those who are looking for a new approach to gardening The Indianapolis Zoo s botanical collection is unique because it is the only habitat botanical garden in the country This means that our plants are grouped together in displays that replicate or duplicate the ecology of the world s major environmental zones The Society wanted to continue to enhance the garden experience for visitors in an innovative and exciting way June 1999 marked the grand opening of the Zoo s new sister institution White River Gardens This stunnngly beautiful 3 3 acre landmark botanical attraction combines the best of gardening ideas plant information and inspiring landscape design Visitors will have the opportunity to view changing shows in the Hilbert Conservatory including Butterflies Are Free Wizard of Oz Toyland and Flights of Fantasy Over one and a half miles of flowered pathways pass through five unique theme gardens a design garden a shade garden a sun garden a water garden and a wedding garden Our expert horticulturists will answer personal garden questions and guests will also be able to obtain gardening tips in the Dick Crum Resource Center Connecting through People Over one million visitors are expected to tour the grounds of the Indianapolis Zoological Society in 1999 Being an institution that promotes education and learning through the connection of people and the natural world around them the Society is actively preparing for continued success in the future Our institution continues to offer top quality education programming including student workshops overnights and distance learning sessions We know that we are in the midst of a technological revolution and we are working hard to keep pace with the constant changes that surround us We are laying the groundwork that will enhance our connection to visitors of all kinds and insure our stability and public presence well into the millennium The Indianapolis Zoological Society has developed a new state of the art website showcasing White River Gardens www whiterivergardens com and is currently updating its zoo website www indyzoo com By providing interactive information links with all our visitors we strengthen our connection to the public We are becoming an institution without walls Many of our traditional education programs will be enhanced through the Gardens Zoo websites providing us with fresh new vehicles
