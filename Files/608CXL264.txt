interests Enclosed in this packet you will find information on our      Society and a few different partnership options I hope that you agree      that the Indianapolis Zoological Society enhances this community and      helps to make it a safe and happy environment for people to live work      and raise families      The mission of the Indianapolis Zoological Society is to provide      recreational learning experiences for the citizens of Indiana through the      exhibition and presentation of natural environments in a way to foster a      sense of discovery stewardship and the need to preserve the Earths      plants and animals In short the Society is about connecting animals      plants and people The wonderful connections formed each day are made      possible through the support of Society operations      New in  On June   The Indianapolis Zoological Society      introduced a sisterinstitution to the Indianapolis Zoo This unique Dow      complex White River Gardens is an extraordinary facility that adds a      beautiful cultural attraction to Indianapolis It also provides the city      state and nation with a unique educational resource for garden design      plant material selection and plant husbandry especially for those in the      Zone  growing region As gardening is the number one hobby in the      United States the White River Gardens will further the Societys mission      by nourishing the vital connection between people and their natural      landscapes      In July  the Indianapolis Zoo announced a milestone in elephant      conservationthe first conception of a female African elephant by      artificial insemination The  yearold virgin female named Kubwa was      confirmed pregnant on July   by transrectal ultrasonography The      artificial insemination technique was developed in cooperation with the      Institute for Zoo Biology and Wildlife Research in Berlin Germany The      difficulties of the anatomical structure of elephants made what is      considered a common procedure among domestic animals extremely      problematic The new technique was performed at the Zoo over Memorial Day      weekend  The gestation period for the African elephant is  months      which makes Kubwas expected delivery date in March  On January       the Zoo received the exciting news that a second elephant       yearold Ivory had also conceived a calf This calf is expected in      September of The significance of this wonderful news is that      researchers now know that they have developed a technique that is both      effective and replicable This is extremely important to the longterm      survival of elephants in human care as well as the wild      Connection through Animals You can see almost  animals at the      Indianapolis Zoo but what you wont see are any cages Our Zoo was      designed using the concept of biomes which simulate the natural habitats      in which animals live Creating natural habitats does more than enhance      the beauty of the Zoo It allows the animals to feel more relaxed and      encourages their natural behaviors      Our keepers help to provide opportunities for increased foraging      environmental stimulation and social contact by using a wide array of      scents objects and food Enrichment activities include hiding special      treats like honey or peanut butter or giving animals blocks of ice      indestructible balls or browse leafy tree branches with which to      interact Understanding an animals natural behavior increases      conservation opportunities particularly captive breeding efforts of      endangered species The Species Survival Plan SSP is a cooperative      population management and conservation program for selected species in      zoos and aquariums By keeping detailed records stud books zoo staff      can make intelligent decisions on how to match individual animals to      avoid inbreeding and maintain a healthy and genetically diverse captive      population Staff members of the Indianapolis Zoo coordinate the national      SSPs for the African elephant rock iguana cyclura and the ringtailed      lemur The Indianapolis Zoo houses  SSP animals  species that are      endangered and  that are threatened      As mentioned earlier research is another important component to the      preservation of endangered species The Indianapolis Zoo makes      significant contributions with the global impact to a variety of species      Besides the incredible work with African elephants we also contribute to      the conservation of rare iguanas A young boy in the Hellshire Hills near      Kingston found one specimen of Jamaican Iguana thought to be extinct      unti There are now  living specimen in captivity at Hope Zoo in      Jamaica Internationally recognized for its successful breeding program      of Ricords and rhinoceros iguanas the Indianapolis Zoo was one of six      zoos selected to help save the Jamaican iguana Our Zoo houses a trio of      these iguanas and along with the Hope Zoo and five other zoos are      developing a breeding program for the animals The Indianapolis Zoo      recently became the first zoo to breed successfully the critically      endangered Grand Cayman blue iguana      Connecting through Plants Since the Indianapolis Zoo opened in       its botanical collection has been integrated
