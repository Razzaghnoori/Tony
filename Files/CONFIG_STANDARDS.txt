Bodies DSPB s 1 should consider and that the Legal Services Corporation will use in considering the configuration of a state s legal services delivery system 2 Determination of the most appropriate configuration of programs in a given state is a part of the broader state planning process and cannot be divorced from consideration of the overall goals of the state delivery system the state s past performance current status and progress towards and plans for achieving those goals The Legal Services Corporation expects its grantees in each state and territory to work with one another and with a broad spectrum of other equal justice stakeholders3 to develop comprehensive integrated statewide civil legal services delivery systems which are responsive to the most compelling needs of eligible clients and client communities ensure the highest and most strategic use of all available resources maximize the opportunity for clients throughout the state to receive timely effective and appropriate legal services in the present and in the future and operate efficiently and effectively 4 1 A Designated State Planning Body is an entity that has been established and charged with responsibility for coordinating state legal services delivery planning Such planning entities are generally composed of an array of civil equal justice delivery stakeholders including but not limited to representatives from the state bar association state IOLTA funding entity staffed legal services programs LSC and non LSC the pro bono community client organizations clients and others with an interest and commitment to effective delivery of civil legal services to poor and vulnerable people in the state 2 For LSC s policies regarding internal review of configuration recommendations see Legal Services Corporation Reconfiguration Review Process September 21 2001 3 State planning processes including the participants will vary from state to state and LSC does not require the same process or participation in each state However LSC continues to encourage broad civil equal justice stakeholder participation at the state level and expects its grantees to do the same 4 For a fuller articulation of these goals see LSC Program Letters 98 1 98 6 and 2000 7 and Strategic Directions 2000 2005 adopted by the LSC Board of Directors on January 28 2000 While LSC will continue to utilize a variety of approaches LSC views service area configuration as a key structural component of a comprehensive set of strategies employed to promote the creation and sustainability of comprehensive integrated state civil equal justice communities LSC has and will continue to require its grantees and encourage DSPB s to critically examine the degree to which the configuration of LSC grantees in any given state promotes these ends The determination of the configuration that will best serve clients throughout a particular state ultimately involves a balancing of factors and the application of judgment to a host of considerations Each state is different and in a number of states intra state regions differ significantly as well Some standards relevant to decisions affecting configuration can in context suggest different conclusions depending upon the state or geographic region involved Each state s configuration must be viewed on the totality of the circumstances LSC values the judgments of designated state planning bodies that have addressed the question and will normally give great weight to those judgments that have been developed through an inclusive thoughtful and client centered process LSC will only adopt a different configuration based upon good and substantial reasons clearly articulated in writing and tied to the specific standards enumerated herein These standards shall guide the state planning process on reconfiguration and shall serve as the criteria for decisions of LSC Under these guidelines LSC will exercise its statutory responsibility to insure that grants and contracts are made so as to provide the most economical and effective delivery of legal assistance to persons in both urban and rural areas 5 II LSC s Statutory Responsibility LSC operates under a
