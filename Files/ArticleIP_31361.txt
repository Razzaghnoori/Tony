 The Life and Vines of Tarzan What s Wrong With Being a Momma s Boy Michael Lind needs to get a grip It s a kids movie my friend and it is as true to the original text as it can be in our politically correct times A more feminized society is not the repressed horrible existence Lind portrays why are less violence less aggression less machismo less extremist Darwinism and greater sensitivity bad things Let s face it people like Hitler took their survival of the fittest theory out of hand and the result was far from pretty And anyway a guy who knows how to treat his mother well is way sexier than a guy who thinks he s too cool and manly to care for his family Maybe Lind is grumpy because he wouldn t look quite so hot in a loincloth by conventional standards of beauty Ann Stanton Euclid Ohio Book Clubbing Might I respond to Eric Alterman s sarcastic remark that I graciously declined to reply to a column by him in The Nation attacking my New Republic Diarist on Yale University Press and its series on communism For the second time the first was in a letters exchange in The Nation Alterman has somehow inferred that my silence connoted acquiescence with his article Since Alterman did not point out any factual inaccuracies in my Diarist and since he defended the notion that Russians were sent to the Gulag legally I thought his article too trivial and silly to merit a response But because Alterman ungraciously persists in depicting me as having repudiated my own article I feel obliged for what it s worth to note that I think it holds up perfectly well Jacob Heilbrunn Senior editor the New Republic Washington Eric Alterman replies Jacob Heilbrunn has messed up yet again I intended no sarcasm in crediting him with sensibly refusing to defend what was clearly a shoddy and indefensible piece of work I thought he was showing some class Heilbrunn calls my objections to his Diarist trivial and silly Let s say he s right Why then did conservative historians Harvey Klehr and John Earl Haynes feel a need to condemn Heilbrunn as well in letters published in TNR s own letters section Why did the equally conservative Richard Gid Powers call Heilbrunn s accusations against Yale absurd and existing only in the minds of the pathologically suspicious on the same page Why did even the venerated anti Stalinist historian Robert Conquest call Heilbrunn s article unfair and exaggerated Why did the director of Yale University Press John Ryden insist in a letter to more than a hundred people that TNR s Editor in Chief Martin Peretz has admitted that Heilbrunn s piece is unfounded and should not have been published Peretz denies this Are the criticisms of Harvey Klehr John Earl Haynes Robert Conquest and if Ryden is to be believed even Heilbrunn s boss Marty Peretz among many others all too trivial and silly to merit a response as well Or was a strategic silence really the right response for Heilbrunn after all Criticizing the Kosovo Critics Thank you for William Saletan s brilliant analysis of the war As a lifelong conservative and Republican who feels that President Clinton defamed the office of the presidency I was amazed that all the major conservative commentators and politicians were against the U S action After all the previous Republican administrations had sent troops into Somalia for humanitarian reasons and yet the operation was largely a failure I believe the prevailing Republican opinion was largely generated from an anti Clinton feeling particularly after a failed attempt at removing him from office One commentator said that we should have provided the Kosovo Liberation Army with weapons but not sent our troops Imagine if the United States had adopted this isolationist policy during World War II The face of Europe might look quite a bit different Gary Spiegel Los Angeles Retire the World s Policeman William Saletan showed more than a little bias in the piece about the Republican condemnation of the Clinton administration s actions in Kosovo What were we really doing bombing Serbia Maybe extending the ideas of a New World Order in which hard working Americans are expected to pay the price not only of our freedom but of the freedom of the whole world We had no business in any of the NATO actions there was no real possibility of this expanding throughout the region as everyone in the administration was spouting It didn t concern our energy supply not much oil comes out of Kosovo They were not a direct threat to our national security They were not a world threat such as Germany or Japan was in World War II So what were we really doing there And what of the atrocities Were they going on before the bombing started Do we have proof of that Maybe these atrocities began from the outrage of the Serbians knowing that their cities homes and factories were getting bombed and their brothers and sisters being killed Gary W Meadows Spring Texas Buckley Barks Back Last week William F Buckley Jr read a Slate Book Club about his latest novel The Redhunter A Novel Based on the Life and Times of Senator Joe McCarthy and decided enough was enough One of the Clubbers Eric Alterman had called Buckley s book a lumbering themeless pudding of a novel that forces one s eyelids shut like an invisible vise The other Ronald Radosh had described it as heavy and plodding without any real juice to it Buckley weighed in defending his work against all charges aesthetic historical and ideological and quoting a critic writing in Buckley s own National Review who deemed the book wonderfully readable a witty fast moving yarn Now Buckley has asked Slate to run the following excerpt from the book so that readers can judge for themselves We are delighted to oblige Click for the excerpt
