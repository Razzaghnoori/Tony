 okay um i m real happy with the car i have i have a a Hyundai oh really what kind of car do you have oh uh huh and i bought it in uh eighty no no no eighty eight or eighty seven eighty eight it s an eighty eight and uh i m i ve taken real good care of it and i m real uh huh happy with it but if my financial situation was different there s probably other cars i would like to have oh really yeah me too many many cars i d like to have too um i bought a car around the same time in eighty eight and it was a um a Toyota Corolla so uh huh and um i like it pretty well except it s not real comfortable it doesn t give a comfortable ride you know it s it s a cheaper car and it gives a cheaper ride and it s not the luxury car so if i bought one i d probably want something like a a new Maxima oh that a Nissan is that a Nissan i have a friend that has one that s just gorgeous yeah they not and then oh they do ride nice too in fact when yes really right you don t hear wind noise and all that yeah when i i was sitting i was sitting here waiting for for her to find somebody i was trying to think what kind would i and Nissan Maxima came into my mind uh huh yeah she has a real pretty one it s kind of a oh it s not white and it s not beige it s kind of a cream color oh God it s pretty it s got a sun roof in it yeah it s a nice car but boy she must have paid a fortune for it yeah really yeah well i m almost convinced that you pay for what you get because my car in eighty eight was like ten thousand five hundred dollars and it was okay when i bought it you know it was great running around town it s a great little run around car town car because i get good gas mileage yeah but when you re out on the road on a trip like my parents live like five hundred miles away you are exhausted by the time you get there yeah because it s just uh huh oh really the seats aren t real soft and comfortable and there s only so many positions you can get in and your body gets tired plus you hear the road road noise a lot so yeah i probably do too i like the way my car rides though uh course i have a sun roof and i open it up so i hear i hear the wind uh huh oh yeah yeah yeah and but it s comfortable to drive i i really don t have much problem with that i think it s comfortable i m really sold on i you know i i don t remember what i paid pretty close to ten thousand i think with everything all together it came to eleven with tax and everything you know but i m i m real pleased with it uh huh uh huh uh huh and it did you buy it here in Dallas yeah i bought it at Eagle uh huh well and i get great service there yeah oh really well that means a lot see i used to work at Lemmon Avenue so i that s right across the street from it uh huh so i just walked across the street and bought a car so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because i d just pull it in during the day you know i worked second shift at that time and i d just leave my car you know yeah got to see them all the time uh huh and let them work on it i d bring it in and go to work and then pick it up i d go out on break at five thirty and pick up my car it was you know real convenient now it s not so convenient uh huh yeah well um like how many have you had any major repairs or anything you ve had to do to it no not a thing because you know my car s about same age as yours and i ve been lucky i haven t had any major anything happen it s been me neither and i ve i ve been really careful to take it when it needs service i do what the book says and i take it in i took you know for the valves uh huh for the adjustments at fifteen thousand and thirty thousand and i change the oil every two to three thousand miles and i take real because i figured it was going to have to last me a while you know so i decided no matter what if i had to let a bill go i would take care of my car right yeah because you have to get back and forth you know no matter what yeah and i get good gas mileage and it s just been a great car it s i m i m real pleased with it i have no no qualms about and i wouldn t mind buying another one if i had to you know the yeah yeah well that sounds good because you know Hyundai is a fairly new car uh huh compared to you know Ford and everybody so i i didn t know anyone that had one that s good to hear there s a lot of people at Lemmon Avenue that have them i think a lot of people walked across the street but uh yeah uh there s a couple people that have gone a hundred thousand miles on theirs and it s still in good shape so and yet i know someone that had to have a valve job on their valves and that s about six seven hundred dollars but they didn t take it in and have it serviced when they were supposed to um hum yeah oh um hum and you know and i do that i think if you take good care of your car you know i ve got thirty a little over thirty two thousand miles on mine how much how many miles do you have on yours that s about what i have thirty two or thirty four i can t remember i just turned over one one or the other do you have the oil changed a lot and everything yeah luckily my husband is real good at that and he knows how and he changes it regularly and gives it tune ups you know replaces the spark plugs and and uh yeah i know that no see i don t have a husband so i have to have it done you know when i did have a husband he didn t like to do stuff like that but i didn t have this car but uh i don t know yeah i bet the sun roof is great i love it i love it that is something i would really want and you know if i bought a new car i would want a sun roof yeah i made i you know i gave up the automatic transmission when i test drove the car i i didn t like the automatic transmission because it didn t have any get up and go and i uh huh i like to shift so i i got a five speed and the automatic transmission was three hundred dollars and so was the sun roof so i was kind of a trade well i ll take the standard shift but i want the sun roof um hum oh i see yeah well that s good so oh and i love that sun roof i use it all the time i really do oh yeah i think i would too because you know even i have to drive seventy five every day ooh so i i do i drive seventy five every day so i would i would still you know where do you live up in Plano okay so you come down seventy five right i come down seventy five and then i have to come up in five o clock traffic you know ooh which where do you work which part the Dallas site expressway there at seventy five and six thirty five so you re in the which building uh SC oh you re in the SC building uh huh i m in i m over in payroll so we re we re in Park Central oh yeah so you are you you re in Dallas yeah Park Central Five you know just across i come to the SC dock every afternoon deliver checks and to go out on the on the trucks so um hum yeah you know i m just across the road but i live in Oak Cliff so i drive the toll road every day oh oh yeah that d be the only way and it s great you know there s never very much well there s traffic but it s never stop and go unless there s a wreck you know i would never drive Central Expressway uh huh about how many miles is that i go twenty miles one way twenty miles one way yeah see i have about twenty five round trip is what it is yeah that s not too that s not too bad about twenty five miles a day yeah yeah i d uh i still want that sun roof though that d be good yeah i d i like i wouldn t mind having a convertible well i saw a pretty little convertible the other day on the toll road a red one oh gosh it was so cute no it was i don t oh what was it i think it was a Mustang Hyundai or was it um um hum if i m not mistaken i think i noticed it was a Mustang and it was new and it was pretty oh yeah so i also like the Rabbit uh convertibles i think they re kind of cute yeah oh i just had a friend buy one and he loves it i bet he does he does he and it s convertible he puts that top down and it s just a fun car oh yeah they are i couldn t believe what he paid for it it was like sixteen thousand dollars they re expensive uh oh my God you know and hear i am thinking this car is smaller than my car and i and i bet it s not comfortable is it comfortable no not really i mean it s you know the seats are typical Volkswagen seats that s right the vinyl you know that s all that is i know but that car is so expensive but you know talking to my husband and he was real impressed with the car the motor and everything in it is just fabulous supposedly it s one of the best built cars yeah i i hear the Volkswagen engine you know is really good well isn t it made by um uh huh uh huh oh God Mercedes yes and Kharman Ghia uh it was the little sports car i used to have a Kharman Ghia red one at one time and i loved that car i i wish now i hadn t sold it oh really those are the best supposedly the best built cars so this little Volkswagen that he has he s loving it yeah i d like to have a Mercedes i i can t see paying as much for a car as you could buy a house for i know i know uh sixty seventy thousand dollars for a car just a little bit out of my league yeah i i can just see parking it at TI you know and then somebody smashing it smashing it with their door makes me so angry or breaking into it we have such a rash of break ins right right it d be gone in a week so they have we had we they have had to put security really heavy in our parking lot and people sitting up in the windows watching security because they were coming around smashing the windows and stealing stuff just in our parking lot you know and our parking lot s not um so huge like what you all have over there you know and they we look right out my office looks right out onto the parking lot and i didn t see anything going on and i m always looking out the window uh huh and they were doing in broad daylight boy i ll tell you what people just really have a lot of nerve you know break into cars just broad daylight no and it just ruins you too you just makes you sick and then you have insurance you know goes up and it s terrible right i know it and you all had a lot of problems over there too didn t you for a while oh yeah yeah
