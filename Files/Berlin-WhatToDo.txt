great command of the German language any enthusiastic theatergoer can enjoy some stirring performances In Germany major theaters often maintain several productions in repertory so that in any one week you will be able to see the same troupe perform contemporary or classical drama There are over 150 theaters in the city so there s a vast range to choose from The city s most audacious and versatile repertory is based at the Schaub hne Ku damm and Lehninerplatz It achieved international renown for its almost brutally uncompromising performances of classical avant garde and experimental theater The plays of Berlin s best known playwright Bertolt Brecht naturally dominate the repertory of the theater he founded the world renowned Berliner Ensemble Bertolt Brecht Platz 1 although it does expand to other mostly modern classics and promises to further enhance its outstanding reputation under the new artistic director Claus Peymann Contemporary plays are staged at the Maxim Gorki Theater Am Festungsgraben 2 and the classics at the Deutsches Theater Schumannstra e 13a the former home of theater producer Max Reinhardt Commercial theater is not to be sneezed at either For the equivalents of Broadway or Shaftesbury Avenue musicals operettas and comedies try the very professional Theater am Kurf rstendamm Kurf rstendamm 209 the Kom die Kurf rstendamm 206 the popular Theater des Westens Kantstra e 12 and the new Stella Musical Theater Marlene Dietrich Platz 1 Other entertainment Another long standing Berlin tradition at its heyday in the 1920s satirical cabaret has always by its very nature had to struggle for its existence Berlin has seemed to provide the necessary raw material a perennially turbulent history to which reunification has not put a stop Two survivors among the countless fly by nights are Die Stachelschweine The Porcupines Europa Center and Die Distel The Thistle Friedrichstra e 101 However unless your German is excellent and you have an in depth understanding of the political scene this kind of cabaret will be almost impossible to follow Nightclubs range from garish girlie shows to conventional discos In between are the transvestite shows which can be saucy often witty occasionally outrageous but only rarely offensive They offer an amusing perspective of Berlin s past with their impersonations of the great Marlene Dietrich and other such figures As befits a city which every February hosts a major International Film Festival Berlin is endowed with a huge number of cinemas showing a variety of films ranging from the usual Hollywood blockbusters to avant garde works of art Most foreign language films are usually dubbed into German though some cinemas will occasionally show films in the original language The letters to look for
