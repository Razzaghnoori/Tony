                            RNA interference RNAi has been called one of the most has exciting discoveries in        biology in the last couple decades and since it was first recognized by Andrew Fire et        al in  it has quickly become one of the most powerful and indispensable tools in the        molecular biologists toolkit Using short doublestranded RNA dsRNA molecules RNAi can        selectively silence essentially any gene in the genome It is an ancient mechanism of gene        regulation found in eukaryotes as diverse as yeast and mammals and probably plays a        central role in controlling gene expression in all eukaryotes In the lab RNAi is        routinely used to reveal the genetic secrets of development intracellular signaling        cancer infection and a full range of other phenomena But can the phenomenon hailed by        the journal         Science as the Breakthrough of the Year in  break out of the lab        and lead to novel therapies as well Pharmaceutical giants are hoping so and several        biotech companies have bet their futures on it but not everyone is sanguine about the        future of RNAi therapy        At the heart of its promise as a powerful therapeutic drug lies the exquisite        selectivity of RNAi like the fabled magic bullet an RNAi sequence seeks out and        destroys its target without affecting other genes The clinical applications appear        endless any gene whose expression contributes to disease is a potential target from viral        genes to oncogenes to genes responsible for heart disease Alzheimers disease diabetes        and more        But for all its promise RNAi therapy is a long way from entering the clinic While it        is a proven wunderkind in the lab to date no tests have been done in humans and only the        most modest and circumscribed successes have been demonstrated in animals The road to        clinical success is littered with great ideas that have come a cropper along the way        including two other RNAbased therapies antisense and ribozymes both of which showed        promise at the bench but have largely stumbled before reaching the bedside Is RNAi also        likely to fall short Or is it different enough to make this third try the charm                    Clinical Navet Mysterious Mechanisms        To be a successful drug a molecule must overcome a long set of hurdles First it must        be able to be manufactured at reasonable cost and administered safely and conveniently        Then and even more importantly it must be stable enough to reach its target cells before        it is degraded or excreted it must get into those cells link up with its intracellular        target and exert its effect and it must exert enough of an effect to improve the health        of the person taking it And finally it must do all this without causing significant        toxic effects in either target or nontarget tissues No matter how good a compound looks in        the lab if it fails to clear any one of these hurdles it is useless as a drug        For RNAbased therapies manufacture has been seen as a soluble problem while delivery        stability and potency have been the most significant obstacles There was a lot of        clinical navet in the early days of antisense and ribozymes according to Nassim Usman        Vice President for Research and Development at Sirna Therapeutics in Boulder Colorado        Compounds were pushed into the clinic prematurely Sirna began as the biotech startup        Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals which tried to develop ribozymes to treat several conditions        including hepatitis C A ribozyme is an RNA molecule whose sequence and structure allow it        to cleave specific target RNA molecules see Figure  The initial results with hepatitis        C were not that inspiring says Usman because the molecule they used had low potency and        a short halflife once in the body Despite enormous doses the viral load was not        significantly affected It just didnt have the characteristics to be a drug he says No        ribozyme has yet been approved for use by the United States Food and Drug Administration        FDA        Similarly despite much initial enthusiasm attempts to develop antisense drugs have        been largely disappointing Antisense is a single strand of RNA or DNA complementary to a        target messenger RNA mRNA sequence by pairing up with it the antisense strand prevents        translation of the mRNA see Figure  At least that was the theory and early clinical        results seemed to support the theory antisense drugs effectively reduced tumor sizes in        anticancer trials and viral loads in antiviral trials But closer inspection revealed these        results were largely due to an increase in production of interferons by the immune system        in response to high doses of the foreign RNA rather than to specific silencing of any        target genes The relatively high proportion of CG sequences in antisense mimics        bacterial and viral genes thus triggering the immune response When the antisense dose        was lowered to prevent the interferon response the clinical benefit largely disappeared as        well Thus rather than being a highly specific therapy antisense seemed to be a general        immune system booster        But as long as patients were getting better does it matter what the mechanism was It        doesnt matter if you are a patient but it does matter if you are trying to develop the        next drug says Cy Stein Associate Professor of Medicine and Pharmacology at Columbia        University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City Stein has researched        antisense for more than a decade If you get the mechanism wrong youre not going to be        able to do it        To date only one antisense drug has received FDA approval Vitravene from Isis        Pharmaceuticals in Carlsbad California is used to treat cytomegalovirus infections in the        eye for patients with HIV Vitravene is actually a DNA antisense drug which binds to viral        DNA though says Usman its unclear whether it actually works by an antisense        mechanism Stein expresses a similar skepticism about the mechanism of a second antisense        drug Genasense Genasense is a DNAbased treatment that targets Bcl a protein expressed        in high levels in cancer cells which is thought to protect them from standard        chemotherapy The FDA is currently reviewing an application for Genasense based on        promising results in the treatment of malignant melanoma                    RNAi A Natural Alternative        Growing disillusionment with antisense and ribozymes coincided with the discovery of        RNAi and the realization that it was a far more potent way to silence gene expression RNAi        uses short dsRNA molecules whose sequence matches that of the gene of interest Once in a        cell a dsRNA molecule is cleaved into segments approximately  nucleotides long called        short interfering RNAs siRNAs see Figure  siRNAs become bound to the RNAinduced        silencing complex RISC which then also binds any matching mRNA sequence Once this        occurs the mRNA is degraded effectively silencing the gene from which it came Details        of the structure and function of the RISC are still largely unknown but it is thought to        act as a true enzyme complex requiring only one or several siRNA molecules to degrade many        times that number of matching mRNAs        The extraordinary selectivity of RNAi combined with its potencyin theory only a few        dsRNAs are needed per cellquickly made it the tool of choice for functional genomics        determining what a gene product does and with what other products it interacts and for        drug target discovery and validation By knocking down a gene with RNAi and determining        how a cell responds a researcher can in the course of only a few days develop        significant insight into the function of the gene and determine whether reducing its        expression is likely to be therapeutically useful But does RNAi have a better chance to        succeed as a drug than antisense or ribozymes        The fundamental difference favoring RNAi is that were harnessing an endogenous        natural pathway says Nagesh Mahanthappa Director of Corporate Development at Alnylam        Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge Massachusetts the second of two major biotech company        developing RNAibased therapy The exploitation of a preexisting mechanism he says is        the main reason RNAi is orders of magnitude more potent than either of the other two types        of RNA strategies                    Delivery Delivery Delivery        More potent in the test tube at least But stability and delivery are also the major        obstacles to successful RNAi therapy obstacles that are intrinsic to the biochemical        nature of RNA itself as well as the bodys defenses against infection with foreign        nucleotides For the strongest reasons you cant get away from this says Stein The        problem is that a charged oligonucleotide will not pass through a lipid layer which it        must do in order to enter a cell John Rossi Director of the Department of Molecular        Biology at City of Hope Hospital in Duarte California who has worked on RNAbased        therapies for  years concurs The cell doesnt want to take up RNA he says which        makes evolutionary sense since extracellular RNA usually signifies a viral infection        Injected into the bloodstream unmodified RNA is rapidly excreted by the kidneys or        degraded by enzymes        To solve the problem of cell penetration most researchers have either complexed the RNA        with a lipid or modified the RNAs phosphate backbone to minimize its charge Mahanthappa        thinks the complexing approach is unlikely to be a simple solution since drug approval        would require independent testing of the lipid delivery system as well Instead Alnylam is        pursuing backbone modification Some minimal modification is going to be necessary to        increase cell uptake and to improve stability in the blood stream Mahanthappa says What        we have learned from the antisense field is that even without other delivery strategies        when you administer RNA at sufficient doses if its stable it gets taken up by        cells        Anything that can be done to increase halflife in circulation would improve delivery        says Judy Lieberman a Senior Investigator at the Center for Blood Research and Associate        Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School in Cambridge Massachusetts But that may        not be the only problem she cautions Liebermans lab recently demonstrated the ability of        RNAi to silence expression of the Fas gene in mice protecting them from fulminant        hepatitis Fas triggers apoptosis or programmed cell death in response to a variety of        cell insults In her experiment Lieberman delivered the RNA by highpressure injection        into the tail The RNA got to the liver silenced Fas and protected the mice from        hepatitis However a significant fraction of animals died of heart failure brought on        because the injection volume was about  of the mouse blood volume Such a delivery        scheme simply will not work in humans Delivery to the cell is still an obstacle        Lieberman explains Unless you really focus on how to solve that problem youre not going        to get very far                    Unanswered Questions        Even assuming delivery problems can be solved other questions remain including that of        whether therapeutic levels of RNAi may be toxic Mahanthappa says The conservative answer        is we just dont know The more aggressive answer is theres no reason to think so Rossi        isnt so sure The target of interest may be in normal cells as well as cancer cells he        says Thats where you get toxicity        But if small RNAs can be delivered to target cells efficiently and without significant        toxicity will they be effective medicines Usman of Sirna is confident they will be If        you can get it there and if its in one piece there no doubt in our minds that it will        work he says To date numerous experiments in animal models suggest RNAi can        downregulate a variety of target genes effectively However there are still two unanswered        questions about whether that will translate into effective therapy        The first is whether RNAis exquisite specificity is really an advantage beyond the        bench Its unclear whether highly specific drugs give you a big therapeutic effect says        Cy Stein For instance he says most active antitumor medicines have multiple mechanisms        of action The more specific you make it the less robust the therapeutic activity is        likely to be Rossi agrees Overspecificity has never worked he says        The second question is what effect an excess of RNA from outside the cell will have on        the normal function of the RISC the complex at the heart of the RNAi mechanism The number        of RISCs in the cell is unknown and one concern is that the amount of RNA needed to have a        therapeutic effect may occupy all the available complexes We are usurping a natural cell        system that is there for some other purpose for knocking out endogenous gene function        says Rossi With the introduction of foreign RNA will the system continue to perform its        normal function as well or will it become saturated Thats the big black box in the        field he says                    Looking Ahead to the Clinic        Despite the questions and unsolved problems Sirna Alnylam and several other companies        are moving ahead to develop RNAi therapy indeed some outstanding questions are probably        only likely to be answered in the process of therapeutic development The first        applications are likely to be in cancer targeting outofcontrol oncogenes or viral        infection targeting viral genes To avoid some of the problems of delivery initial        trials may deliver the RNA by direct injection into the target tissue for a tumor for        instance or ex vivo treating white blood cells infected with HIV for example        Having spent a decade trying to develop ribozymes says Usman Sirna is prepared for the        rough road it faces We havent solved all the problems but we know how to proceed to        work through them Its no surprise to usweve seen this movie before Usman expects        Sirna to file an Investigational New Drug Application with the FDA by the end of  and        to have a human clinical trial in progress in  Without a doubt there will be an        RNAibased drug within ten years Usman predicts        Stein isnt so sure and thinks that too much is still to be learned about RNAi and the        bodys reaction to it to be confident that RNAbased therapies will ultimately be        successful The whole field was founded on the belief it was rational but there are huge        gaps in our knowledge and so you need a bit of luck to be successful he says I think        people are surprised at how complicated it is but why should it be any other way Its an        intellectual conceit to think that nature is simple
