 Background Within the long DNA molecules of eukaryotic chromosomes some replication origins fire more frequently than others In most cases it is not clear why certain origins are preferred In several species however fruit flies Drosophila melanogaster 1 2 budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae 3 4 5 6 and fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe 7 evidence suggests that sequences called replication enhancers stimulate nearby origins This stimulation is independent of enhancer orientation and within a limited range independent of distance to the origin Replication enhancers in fruit flies control the programmed amplification extra rounds of replication in non cycling cells of chorion gene clusters on the third and X chromosomes On the third chromosome several cis acting sequences ACE3 and AER a through AER d are essential for amplification 1 2 Of these ACE3 is quantitatively the most important Its ability to stimulate amplification is both orientation and within 1 5 kbp distance independent It has been localized to a 320 bp region and the effects of internal deletions suggest that it contains multiple partially redundant internal domains 2 Whether it can stimulate non chorion replication origins has not to our knowledge been tested In budding yeast replication enhancers have been found near several different chromosomal replication origins In several cases the enhancers bind transcription factors 3 4 5 In all cases tested so far budding yeast enhancers have proved to be origin specific they stimulate only the origin with which they are normally associated in the chromosome 5 6 The replication enhancer that has been studied in fission yeast is part of the ura4 origin cluster a group of three origins called ars3003 ars3002 and ars3004 in their order from left to right upstream of the ura4 gene in the left portion of chromosome III green boxes in Fig 1 7 8 9 We recently found that ars3002 and ars3004 overlap by 400 bp between the Eco RI and Hin cII sites Fig 1 7 The overlap region is essential for ars3004 to function as a replication origin in plasmids In contrast the 800 bp Eco RV Eco RI fragment containing core ars3002 without the overlap is sufficient for plasmid origin function However addition of the overlap region to core ars3002 dramatically increases its plasmid origin activity 7 Moreover although the overlap region has no plasmid origin activity of its own it strongly stimulated the plasmid origin activity of all other tested origins ars3001 and ars3003 and it did so in a relatively distance and orientation independent fashion 7 For these reasons we call the overlap region a replication enhancer yellow RE in Fig 1 We consider the enhancer to be a functional part of both ars3002 and ars3004 We found that the enhancer could not be substituted by a DNA fragment of the same size and base composition but different nucleotide sequence 7 This observation suggests that specific nucleotide sequences within the enhancer are required for its function Previously we characterized sequence elements within core ars3002 that are important for its activity as a plasmid replication origin 10 Now we have asked whether the sequence elements previously identified as important are also important when core ars3002 is combined with the replication enhancer to form extended ars3002 We have also determined which sequences within the enhancer are most important for its ability to stimulate ars3002 Results Effects of deleting consecutive 50 bp stretches throughout extended ars3002 To determine which nucleotide sequences are most important for core origin and enhancer function we constructed consecutive 50 bp deletions throughout extended ars3002 To simplify production of these deletion mutants we destroyed the Eco RI site between the core ars3002 and the enhancer and introduced a Cla I linker see Materials and Methods This manipulation did not cause any detectable change in plasmid origin activity data not shown All deletions were constructed in this altered plasmid They are called 1 22 Their locations are shown in Figure 2 which also shows the positions of the inactivated Eco RI site light orange highlight and of the introduced Cla I linker yellow highlight Note that 1 15 are located in core ars3002 and correspond in position precisely to the 50 bp deletions previously studied in this region 10 Figure 3ashows the average values of four independent transformation experiments with constructs containing from left to right intact extended ars3002 Ext 50 bp deletions 1 22 core ars3002 lacking the replication enhancer and vector alone All results were calculated relative to the values generated by extended ars3002 Blue bars indicate relative transformation frequency number of colonies generated per 100 ng input DNA and gold bars indicate the relative average areas of the transformed colonies which is a reflection of colony growth rate In general the more efficiently a plasmid replicates the greater the number of transformed colonies and the faster those colonies grow under conditions that select for plasmid maintenance 7 10 11 12 Notice that the replication efficiencies of all the deletions except 10 are greater than those of intact core ars3002 core Fig 3a which was the subject of our previous study 10 For comparison purposes the results from our previous study of core ars3002 are displayed in Fig 3b In the previous study we measured replication efficiency only by the transformation frequency assay blue bars The results were expressed relative to those obtained for intact core ars3002 Note that our new results Fig 3a show that the transformation frequency of intact core ars3002 is only about 40 that of extended ars3002 Thus the heights of the blue bars in Fig 3bare exaggerated compared to those in Fig 3a The previous transformation frequency results Fig 3b revealed that the 4 14 regions are important for the transformation activity of core ars3002 and the 8 and 10 regions are essential Our new transformation frequency results blue bars in Fig 3a show that in the context of extended ars3002 with its replication enhancer none of the 50 bp deletion regions within the core is individually essential for transformation activity and only the 10 region is important As discussed in detail below we have found that when plasmid origin efficiency is generally high colony size measurements are more sensitive indicators of small differences in origin activity than are transformation frequency measurements For that reason we interpret the colony size reductions produced by deletions 11 14 Fig 3a to indicate that these deletions cause a small decrease in plasmid origin activity even though these deletions have no effect on transformation efficiency Thus the transformation frequency and colony size results show that sequences within the enhancer partially or completely suppress the negative effects of deletions 4 14 on the plasmid origin activity of core ars3002 The simplest explanation of this observation is that sequences within the enhancer in combination with other core sequences are partially or fully competent to carry out each of the replication functions mediated by each of the 50 bp regions within the core Note that the enhancer must work in combination with the core because the enhancer by itself has no plasmid origin activity 7 It is interesting that deletion 15 which is part of the core but was not previously tested due to a cloning problem 10 has a slight stimulatory effect on colony size implying that region 15 may be a mild suppressor of plasmid origin activity The stimulatory effect of deleting region 15 is more obvious in the double and triple deletion analyses to be presented below Fig 5 The results in Fig 3aalso indicate that there is considerable sequence redundancy within the enhancer itself None of the 50 bp deletions within the enhancer 16 22 reduces transformation frequency Therefore none of these regions is uniquely essential for enhancer activity However some of the deletions 16 20 moderately reduce colony size indicating that each of the corresponding regions 16 20 makes a modest unique contribution to enhancer activity Comparison of colony size measurements with plasmid retention rate measurements In Fig 3awe used both transformation frequency and colony size to evaluate plasmid origin activity Transformation frequency is the standard assay for plasmid origin activity in S pombe 9 12 13 Colony size measurement is usually more reproducible than transformation frequency measurement compare the error bar sizes in Fig 3a but colony size measurement is a newer assay and not yet so widely used 7 11 12 Furthermore the results obtained with the two assays are not identical Two of the mutants studied in Fig 3a 19 and 20 produce elevated transformation frequencies combined with slightly reduced colony sizes Other mutants 11 14 16 yield normal transformation frequencies and significantly reduced colony sizes Only in the cases of 10 and core ars3002 are transformation frequency and colony size simultaneously reduced For these reasons it seemed important to check the validity of colony size measurement by comparing it to an alternative well established indicator of plasmid origin activity plasmid retention rate under selective conditions reviewed in 12 Plasmid retention rate is the proportion of cells containing plasmid during exponential growth in selective medium To simplify our measurements we divided the mutants into three groups based on the relative colony size data in Fig 3a The mutants in group C 10 13 and 14 generated the smallest colonies 20 38 of the area of those generated by the control which was intact extended ars3002 The mutants in group B 7 11 12 16 20 produced larger colonies 50 79 of control The rest of the mutants were in group A colony size 80 of control Then we selected three mutants from each group and tested plasmid retention rate in selective medium for two to five independent transformants for each of the selected mutants Our results reveal a correlation between colony size panels on the left side of Fig 4 see also the relevant gold bars in Fig 3a and plasmid retention rate right column in Fig 4 The plasmid retention rates of the 3 tested mutants in group A largest colonies are 60 70 for group B medium size colonies they are 38 65 and for group C smallest colonies they are 17 29 This correlation suggests that colony size measurement provides a valid assay of plasmid origin activity in fission yeast Note however that none of the tested group A mutants had a plasmid retention rate as high as that of extended ars3002 98 despite the fact that both their transformation frequencies and their colony sizes were equal to or slightly greater than those of extended ars3002 Fig 3a We do not have an explanation for this discrepancy It is possible that plasmid retention rate is more sensitive than colony size or transformation frequency to small differences in the plasmid origin activity of highly efficient replication origins We also do not have an explanation for the fact that the 7 mutation led to colony sizes in the medium group B range but plasmid retention rates in the higher group A range Fig 4 In the case of origins of somewhat lower but still high replication efficiencies these and previous results 7 11 suggest to us that colony size may be a more sensitive indicator of plasmid origin activity than is transformation frequency These results also suggest that transformation frequency may be a good indicator of plasmid origin activity only when replication efficiency is relatively low Consider for example deletions 11 14 In Fig 3a where the effects of these deletions were measured in the context of extended ars3002 with enhancer efficient replication these deletions had no effect on transformation frequency but did reduce colony size Fig 3bshows that when these same deletions were assayed in the absence of the enhancer so overall replication efficiency was much lower each deletion significantly reduced transformation frequency 10 Qualitative results presented in our previous publication 10 showed that each deletion also reduced colony size Thus colony size and transformation frequency measurements seem to vary together when replication efficiency is sufficiently low Effects of larger deletions on enhancer activty Because deletions of stretches of 50 bp within the enhancer had no effects on transformation frequency and only mild effects on colony size Fig 3a we also tested 100 bp deletions double deletions of adjacent 50 bp stretches Fig 5a and 150 bp deletions triple deletions of adjacent 50 bp stretches Fig 5b in the enhancer region The data in Figs 3aand 5suggest that regions 16 20 all make individual contributions to enhancer activity Although individual deletion of region 21 does not have a measurable effect Fig 3a loss of region 21 along with region 20 Fig 5a does significantly reduce enhancer activity Regions 15 and 22 appear to suppress enhancer activity Although their individual loss does not have much effect just a slight stimulation of colony size 15 or transformation frequency 22 their loss is capable of totally suppressing the negative effects of simultaneous deletion of adjacent sequences 16 and 17 or 20 and 21 respectively Figs 3aand 5 Region 16 is the 50 bp region whose deletion most affects enhancer activity Fig 3a However deletion of region 16 by itself affects only colony size In contrast deletions of two 100 bp stretches 16 17 and 20 21 severely reduce both colony size and transformation frequency Fig 5a Two 150 bp deletions 16 18 and 19 21 have even more severe effects reducing both transformation frequency and colony size to the levels of the enhancerless core within experimental error Fig 5b The progressively more severe phenotypes of single double and triple deletions indicate partial redundancy of function between the three 50 bp stretches of which each of the two essential 150 bp regions is composed Discussion This paper describes the first attempt in any organism to determine how the presence of a replication enhancer next to a core replication origin alters the relative importance of the sequences within the core origin It also describes the first attempt in any yeast to map the nucleotide sequences important for function within a replication enhancer We have previously shown that ars3002 is the most active of the three replication origins in the ura4 origin cluster on the left end of fission yeast chromosome III Fig 1 7 8 We have also shown that core ars3002 is no more active as a plasmid replication origin than is ars3003 whereas extended ars3002 is more active than ars3003 in the chromosome because the core activity is stimulated by the adjacent replication enhancer Fig 1 which is also part of ars3004 but which has no plasmid replication origin activity of its own 7 As a first step toward understanding the mechanism of replication enhancement we have generated consecutive 50 bp deletions throughout the ura4 replication enhancer Fig 2 and we have tested the effects of these deletions on the activity of ars3002 as a plasmid replication origin Fig 3a We also tested the effects of 50 bp deletions within core ars3002 The effects of these deletions within core ars3002 had previously been measured for core ars3002 by itself Fig 3b 10 Here we determined their effects for extended ars3002 core ars3002 plus enhancer These experiments showed that enhancers deleted for each of the 50 bp stretches within the enhancer were nevertheless capable of stimulating core ars3002 Thus none of the 50 bp stretches within the enhancer is essential for enhancer activity However deletion 16 at the core proximal end of the enhancer significantly reduced plasmid origin activity as measured by the colony size assay Fig 3a These experiments also demonstrated that many of the 50 bp stretches that are important for core ars3002 function Fig 3b are not important for extended ars3002 function The 50 bp stretch that proved most important for extended ars3002 function is region 10 Its deletion 10 in Fig 3a dramatically reduced plasmid origin function by both the transformation frequency and colony size assays Region 10 contains a stretch of 20 consecutive adenines in the top strand Fig 2 Short runs of adenines and thymines are also present in multiple locations elsewhere in ars3002 Fig 2 These may be binding sites for the S pombe Origin Recognition Complex ORC whose fourth largest subunit Orp4 contains a multiple AT hook domain which permits it to bind with high affinity to DNA containing runs of adenines or thymines in one strand 14 15 In fact the largest subunit of S pombe ORC Orp1 has been mapped by chromatin immunoprecipitation to ars3002 and also to ars2004 which like ars3002 contains multiple asymmetric A T rich stretches 16 17 We do not yet know the functions of the other sequences regions 11 14 and 16 20 that according to the results in Fig 3 also contribute though to a lesser extent than region 10 to the plasmid origin activity of extended ars3002 What is clear however is that the functions of all of the 50 bp stretches are at least partially redundant None of the deletions even 10 eliminates origin activity In each case other sequences within extended ars3002 must be capable of providing at least a portion of the function of the deleted region The redundant nature of the sequences within S pombe replication origins has previously been amply noted 10 11 16 18 However this is the first time that redundancy has also been found within a yeast replication enhancer ACE3 the amplification enhancer for the chorion gene cluster on chromosome 3 of Drosophila melanogaster also contains multiple redundant sequence elements 2 In an attempt to reduce the redundancy in the enhancer and identify combinations of 50 bp deletions that together would completely eliminate replication enhancer function we constructed double and triple deletions so that each 50 bp stretch was deleted in combination with one or two flanking 50 bp stretches to the left and to the right These analyses showed that the double deletions 16 17 and 20 21 were especially effective at reducing origin activity Fig 5a and the triple deletions 16 18 and 19 21 were even more effective Fig 5b In fact these two triple deletions reduced the activity of extended ars3002 to the level of core ars3002 In other words they abolished enhancer activity The fact that the enhancer contains two non overlapping essential 150 bp regions 16 18 and 19 21 indicates that these two regions cooperate with each other to generate enhancer function Neither provides complete enhancer function by itself Each is essential for enhancer function However none of the three 50 bp regions that together comprise each essential 150 bp region is individually essential suggesting internal redundancy within both of the 150 bp essential regions What could be the sequences that contribute to enhancer function within these essential regions Several laboratories including ours have identified consensus sequences that are often found in S pombe replication origins 9 10 11 13 18 All of these are A T rich and are asymmetric in the sense that most of the adenines are in one strand and most of the thymines are in the complementary strand Previous origin deletion scans similar to those in Fig 3 have shown that the regions most important for S pombe origin function frequently contain clusters of these consensus sequences 10 11 16 18 To test whether the ars3002 replication enhancer is similarly organized we scanned it for near matches to the four characterized consensus sequences 9 10 11 13 18 We found several potentially interesting consensus matches within the important portions of the enhancer Fig 6 In region 16 the 50 bp region that seems most important for enhancer function Fig 3a there is a 10 11 match to the consensus sequence identified by Maundrell et al 13 which is highlighted with light green in Fig 6 Although this consensus like the three others has not been found to be completely essential for any tested S pombe origin a 10 bp linker substitution in ars3001 the S pombe rDNA origin that removes a Maundrell consensus sequence reduces origin activity about 30 fold 11 Consequently there is a good chance that this sequence contributes significantly to whatever role region 16 plays in enhancer function Spanning the junction of regions 20 and 21 is a 20 30 match to a 30 bp sequence found by Clyne and Kelley 18 to be important for ars1 plasmid replication origin activity blue in Fig 6 In addition region 21 contains several overlapping 11 12 matches to the consensus sequence of Zhu et al 9 11 highlighted with light magenta in Fig 6 Overlapping matches to this consensus are also found in region 10 Fig 2 which is highly important for ars3002 function Fig 3 9 11 These two consensus sequences are therefore good candidates for playing important roles in the enhancer activities mediated by regions 20 and 21 Note that all three of the consensus sequences and also many additional regions within the enhancer contain runs of adenines or thymines and thus are potential binding sites for S pombe ORC It has recently been demonstrated that the Drosophila amplification enhancers ACE3 and AER d bind Drosophila ORC 19 Thus it is possible that ORC binding is an aspect of enhancer function conserved from fission yeast to animals Testing this hypothesis or any other hypothesis concerning the mechanism of enhancer function will require identifying and characterizing the proteins that bind to the cis acting sequences described here During the past decade much progress has been made in identifying proteins that bind to core origins reviewed in 20 This progress provides grounds for optimism that the trans acting proteins that bind to enhancers will also be identified in the relatively near future Materials and Methods Strains and media Escherichia coli DH5 cells were used for cloning mutated ars3002 plasmids The S pombe strain ura4 D18 ura4 D18 leu1 32 end1 h 21 was used as the recipient strain for transformation assays Cells were grown at 30 C in EMM 22 supplemented with uracil and leucine 150 mg each per liter when not under selection or leucine 150 mg per liter when under selection for uracil prototrophy Plasmid construction To construct the plasmid pUra4script ars3002 ext which contains the extended 1 2 kbp ars3002 7 the 1 kbp Eco RI fragment containing the replication enhancer Fig 1 was cut and blunt ended by treatment with Klenow polymerase New England Biolabs and dNTPs The gel purified fragment was ligated with Cla I linker and then cut with Cla I and Hin cII to produce the 400 bp fragment containing the enhancer 7 The gel purified 400 bp fragment was inserted into the Cla I and Hin cII sites of p3002PCR the plasmid containing core ars3002 generated by PCR 10 The resulting plasmid was then cut with Eco RI blunt ended with Klenow polymerase and dNTPs and self religated in order to destroy the Eco RI site at the boundary between core ars3002 and the enhancer that was regenerated during the process of Cla I linker addition The insert sequences were confirmed by sequence analysis Generation of 50 bp internal deletions Deletions 1 14 are the same as previously described 10 To evaluate these deletions in the context of extended ars3002 the 400 bp Cla I Hin cII fragment containing the replication enhancer from pUra4script ars3002 ext was inserted between the Cla I and Hin cII sites of the deletion constructs 1 14 previously described 10 For deletions 15 22 the two step PCR procedure and cloning strategy described previously 10 11 was employed All primer sequences are available upon request Generation of double and triple deletions within the enhancer region Double and triple deletions were constructed according to the same two step PCR and cloning strategy except that the choices of internal forward and reverse primers for the first amplification step were different For example the rightward pointing forward primer used in constructing 16 and the leftward pointing reverse primer used in constructing 15 were chosen as internal primers at the first step PCR to obtain the double deletion 15 16 and so on Transformation of S pombe cells and colony number and size analysis S pombe D18 cells lacking the ura4 gene were transformed 23 with equal amounts of DNA 100 ng from the plasmids under test All analyses were performed as described previously 7 10 except that transformation plates were analyzed after 4 5 days since the growth rates of colonies transformed with enhancer containing plasmids are faster than those with core ars3002 alone which was used in the previous experiment 10 All results shown are an average of four independent experiments with standard deviation shown as error bars Plasmid retention rate measurement under selective conditions To determine the percentage of exponentially growing cells containing plasmid the transformants were grown in selective medium EMM uracil to 1 2 1 5 10 7cells ml Then 500 cells were plated onto selective and non selective EMM uracil plates to determine the fraction of cells containing plasmid
