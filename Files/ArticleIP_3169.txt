 The Ebonic Plague I mean really it seem like everybody and they momma done had something to say on the subject The sentence comes from Geneva Smitherman a professor of English the director of the African American Language and Literacy Program at Michigan State University the author of the books Talkin and Testifyin 1977 and Black Talk 1994 and one of the people quoted most frequently by reporters and commentators seeking context for the national controversy over ebonics a form of Black English recently granted official recognition as a separate language by the Oakland Calif school board As it happens though Smitherman s words have nothing to do with the Oakland school board s action They were written two decades ago when the vernacular used by many blacks in America s inner cities and the rural South was receiving its first round of national attention partly as a result of influential works of scholarship such as J L Dillard s Black English 1973 A few years later in a widely publicized ruling a Michigan court ordered local school districts to take account of Black English The most remarkable element of this story in other words is how unchanging it is The central pedagogical problems low achievement by large numbers of black students and how to reach these students the scholarly arguments how should Black English be characterized the flashes of racial feeling the sober and dyspeptic public commentary one could transplant it all from one era to another without risk of anachronism To recap the events of the present era then briefly On Dec 18 1996 the Oakland Unified School District unanimously endorsed a resolution whose ulterior intentions remain unclear but which at the very least declares that the primary language spoken by many of its 28 000 black students is not English It is a distinct language not a dialect not nonstandard speech called ebonics a combination of ebony meaning black and phonics The resolution asserts that deficiencies in black educational achievement cannot be remedied unless the prevalence of ebonics is recognized and somehow dealt with What might somehow dealt with involve Representatives for the Oakland schools have given answers that sometimes conflict with the wording of the resolution itself on such issues as whether ebonics would or should be a language used in formal instruction as opposed to something that teachers simply should be given financial incentives to be aware of and conversant in whether ebonics would itself be taught as a subject and whether claiming the status of a distinct language for ebonics was in fact a ploy to shake loose federal bilingual education dollars an outcome immediately ruled out by Richard W Riley the secretary of education Needless to say the confrontational language of the Oakland resolution and the ill advised statement that ebonics is genetically based did nothing to stifle criticism Click to read the full text of the resolution The educational politics of this issue will no doubt play themselves out in the usual messy American way and with luck they will do so beyond the glare of publicity that being where experimental educational programs that involve the inner city vernacular but avoid the manifestos are already taking place Two points deserve mention First the word ebonics which dates back to the early 1970s and has been used even in some public school settings without controversy for years may seem to be putting on airs but what many linguists prefer to call Black English Vernacular or African American Vernacular English is a major linguistic stream that has been flowing within recognizable channels for centuries Benjamin Franklin and before him Cotton Mather left simulations in their writings of the speech of some American blacks that anticipate vernacular renderings today There is of course no single Black English there are various black Englishes in Africa and the Caribbean for instance and Black English Vernacular is not considered a separate language by most language specialists or for that matter ordinary people As one commentator has recently noted the complaint about rap lyrics is not that they can t be understood But the black American speech at issue in Oakland however one categorizes it as a language or a dialect not only is pervasive but also displays features that one finds nationwide owing to its roots in the black migration from a common region the South There are telltale characteristics widely if not universally present the replacement of an initial th with a d sound dis dem and of a medial or final th by an f or other consonant sound with becomes wif brother becomes bruvah a reduction of consonant clusters in general so that first becomes firs and hand becomes han the replacement of a final r sound with a vowel sound summah for summer and mo for more the prevalence of so called plosive consonants making a word such as bill sound more like beel the placement of stress on a first rather than a second syllable DEE troit the disappearance of the final s from third person singular verbs what go round come round the dropping of the copula I here the coffee cold and of certain tense inflections altogether The ancestry of vernacular elements such as these is diverse and includes antique forms of English and slave trade era maritime lingua franca but an African origin for many of them has been persuasively argued for West African languages to give just one example also tend not to make use of a th sound Second disagree as one might with the highhanded approach taken by the Oakland Unified School District the linguistic challenge confronting urban schools defies armchair comprehension Discussions around the holiday dinner table in Greenwich or Grosse Pointe may characterize ebonics as an issue mainly of laziness or sloppiness something whose rectification should be a matter merely of better habits or self control like standing up straight or looking another person in the eye The front line literature from America s classrooms belies that notion Those interested in acquiring some sanitized sense of how great is the task even in the absence of any other social problems that faces a teacher wishing to impart mainstream speaking and writing skills to black students who don t have them might consult the soon to be published English An African American Handbook A Guide to the Mastery of Speaking More and Better English by Savannah Miller Young a black elementary school principal in St Louis The book will be available in mid January Address queries to P O Box 11704 Clayton MO 631005 3098 After several brief introductory chapters the book settles into a detailed program of lessons and drills The therapeutic lesson plan I suggest for speakers of standard American English Imagine what would be involved in undertaking this program yourself in reverse William Labov a professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of an early study The Social Stratification of English in New York 1966 has been arguing for years that whatever its original sources the language of poor urban blacks is becoming ever more divergent from that of other Americans as de facto racial segregation and social isolation become the permanent lot of a vast subgroup of African Americans The widespread use of the so called invariant be to indicate continuous or habitual action he be late for instance is not a historical legacy but a development of the last 50 years Ebonics may not merit the status of a distinct language now his research seems to imply but just give it time
