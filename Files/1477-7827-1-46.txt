 Background The luteinizing hormone receptor LHR plays a fundamental role in ovarian responsiveness to pituitary LH The LHR consists of a 335 residue extracellular domain which contains six N linked glycosylation sites 1 Posttranslational changes in glycosylation and phosphorylation result in several LHR variants migrating between 93 and 44 kDa 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 Lower molecular weight forms 48 and 44 kDa species appear to represent a glycosylated extracellular domain expressed in mammalian cells truncated receptor and retain hormone binding specificity They are not secreted from cells but remain trapped intracellularly 18 In addition to various glycosylated LHR variants western blotting also yielded a 170 kDa band representing an LHR dimer 19 LH binds to LHR variants with different affinities and highest affinity appears to be associated with the fully glycosylated receptor 90 kDa 19 Chorionic gonadotropin CG which is important for corpus luteum CL rescue and maintenance of pregnancy also binds to LHR although with a 10 fold lower binding affinity compared with that of LH 20 The mouse anti rat LHR monoclonal antibody mAb clone 3B5 was developed against purified rat LHR 21 The antibody showed immunoreactivity with rat granulosa cells of mature preovulatory follicles ovarian thecal and interstitial cells granulosa lutein cells of developing mature and regressing CL and with testicular Leydig cells and no reactivity with rat kidneys 22 During the last ten years affinity purified 3B5 antibody has been used in several immunohistochemical studies 23 24 25 26 To our knowledge however no analysis of the 3B5 antibody by western blot has been reported In porcine ovaries LHR expression was detected in granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles but not in granulosa lutein cells of the mature CL 27 In human ovaries LHR expression was also detected in granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles but mature CL showed strong expression in luteal cells which disappeared during luteal regression CL from early human pregnancies showed various intensities of LHR expression from weak to intense on the surface and in the cytoplasmic regions of luteal cells 24 LHR expression was also detected in nonpregnant human uterus glandular and luminal epithelial cells stromal cells myometrial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells syncytiotrophoblast of midterm but not term human placenta fetal membranes and decidua 28 human and rat brain 29 30 rat prostate 14 15 human trophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast from early pregnancies 31 porcine fallopian tubes and umbilical cord 16 32 ovarian decidual endometrial and luteal macrophages 22 33 and ovarian cancer cell cultures and tumor tissues 34 Beside its involvement in the regulation of ovarian function the LHR appears to be involved in some additional effects LHR immunoreactivity in porcine fallopian tubes was confined to the epithelium and smooth muscle cells and in vitro LH treatment caused relaxation of the oviduct 35 Also LHR stimulation plays a role in the induction and maintenance of myometrial quiescence 36 37 38 Since smooth muscles belong among important compartments of the pelvic floor high LH levels after menopause might be involved in the increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders a common condition in postmenopausal women 39 Since the brain was reported to express functional LHR 29 30 there is also a possibility that high LH levels in aging individuals may in some way participate in the development and progression of neurodegenerative process of several degenerative neurological diseases including Alzheimer s disease The aim of the present study was to investigate subcellular LHR distribution and determine LHR protein variants identified by 3B5 mAb in various rat human and porcine tissues During cellular differentiation a transition from cytoplasmic to perinuclear surface nuclear and no LHR immunoreactivity was detected In protein extracts from rat porcine and human ovaries six distinct LHR bands were observed migrating between 92 and 48 kDa Materials and Methods Rats Rats of the CII ZV strain born and maintained in the Laboratory of Biology of Reproduction Zaragoza Mexico were maintained on a 14L 10D cycle lights on 0500 1900 h The postnatal rats were weaned at 21 days of age and they attained sexual maturity during the 6th week of life Ovaries were studied in proestrous rats at the age of two months Daily vaginal smears were collected for about ten days prior to sacrifice Porcine tissues Twenty porcine ovaries with fallopian tubes and some additional porcine tissues were obtained from a local abattoir and tissue samples were frozen within one hour With respect to the follicular and luteal development porcine ovaries were macroscopically classified as follows Early mid follicular medium sized antral follicles 3 5 mm accompanied by shrinking fibrous corpora lutea of similar size late follicular large antral follicles 5 mm not accompanied by any luteal tissue early mid luteal large corpora lutea 10 mm characterized by yellowish color and late luteal CL of diminishing size 7 mm with massive bleeding into the central cavity bluish color and no accompanying follicles Human tissues Frozen blocks of human tissues from previous studies were obtained as described previously 40 41 42 43 44 Some tissues also originated from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network Columbus Ohio Functional stage of ovaries was classified according to the endometrial morphology 45 Ovaries and endometrial samples were obtained from hysterectomy specimens We also utilized frozen blocks and protein extracts from human placental chorionic villi and protein extracts from trophoblast cultures and cultured amniotic fibroblasts and placental mononuclear cells 46 Placental mononuclear cells were collected from the first digestion which contains no trophoblast cells 46 The study was approved by the Institutional

Results Rat tissues Figure 1 In rat ovaries the LHR immunoreactivity was detected in the mature and regressing CL MCL and RCL Fig 1A and ovarian interstitial cells i follicular theca interna t Fig 1B and mature granulosa cells mg Fig 1Bvs control 1C Note a lack of immunoreactivity in ovarian vessels v Fig 1A The antibody also identified granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity in immature granulosa cells ig Fig 1B of preantral and early antral follicles suggestive of early LHR synthesis This may represent synthesis of a receptor extracellular domain not yet associated with the cell surface but remaining trapped intracellularly 18 Maturation of preovulatory follicles was associated with a transition of scarce granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity ig Fig 1D to LHR accumulation in more differentiated granulosa cells dg LHR immunoreactivity was also found in surface epithelium of the rat uterine cavity epithelium of uterine glands se and ug Fig 1E nuclei of stromal cells arrowhead and in uterine vessels v The latter contrasted with a lack of staining of ovarian vessels see above Human tissues Figure 2 During follicular selection mid follicular phase as determined by endometrium morphology dominant follicles in human ovaries showed granular cytoplasmic LHR expression in granulosa cells g Fig 2A similar to those in immature rat follicles see above Theca interna ti showed more distinct LHR immunoreactivity characterized by accumulation of LHR cytoplasmic granules Follicular vessels vascular layer vl and thecal vessels tv were virtually unstained Some LHR immunoreactivity was also detected in theca externa cells te Early luteal development fresh CL was associated with very strong cytoplasmic LHR immunostaining of granulosa lutein cells migrating into the follicular cavity gl Fig 2B Adjacent theca lutein cells tl also exhibited prominent staining but showed distinct vacuolization No LHR expression accompanied developing luteal vessels v In the mature CL granulosa lutein cells showed diminution of cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity and strong surface staining Fig 2C Luteal cells in the old CL late luteal period showed marked diminution of LHR expression Fig 2D Regression of luteal tissue CL investigated during the follicular phase showed residual staining of theca lutein cells and no staining of regressing granulosa lutein cells Fig 2Evs ctr In CL of pregnancy CLP 3 months less or more distinct granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity arrowhead Fig 2Fvs ctr and no surface staining was detected This suggests that high CG levels accompanying early pregnancy may preserve CLP through the cytoplasmic receptor In other words selective pick up of CG through the surface LHR expression in granulosa lutein cells during the luteal phase after conception appears not to be required if the circulating CG is very high In fallopian tubes distinct cytoplasmic LHR expression was associated with the luminal aspect of epithelial cells arrowhead Fig 2G In endometrium late follicular phase note stromal edema LHR immunoreactivity was associated with endometrial glands g Fig 2H and with the surface epithelium of the uterine cavity se There was also granular cytoplasmic expression in endometrial stromal cells s precursors of decidual cells and similar granular staining was observed in smooth muscle cells of late follicular phase myometrium data not shown 3B5 antibody also stained human brain vessels v Fig 2I and showed strong LHR immunoreactivity with microglial cells arrowhead see Fig 8 Porcine tissues Figure 3 Porcine preovulatory follicles showed distinct LHR staining of theca interna lack of LHR expression in vascular layer under the follicular membrane and transition of granular cytoplasmic to surface LHR immunoreactivity in granulosa cells Fig 3A 3B 3C vs control D Mature CL showed strong surface LHR immunoreactivity of luteal cells Fig 7E and old corpora lutea showed diminution of LHR immunoexpression Fig 3F Ovarian surface epithelium the source of most ovarian tumors was also stained arrowhead Fig 3G In porcine fallopian tube Fig 3H the LHR immunostaining was similar to that in human oviduct Strong LHR immunoreactivity in vascular walls was detected in the skin Fig 3I which does not represent a classic LH CG target This contrasted with a lack of staining in ovarian vessels except weak nuclear staining of endothelial cells arrowhead Fig 3J Insets in Fig 7E 7F 7G 7H 7I 7Jshow the control procedure Observations of LHR immunoreactivity in porcine tissues indicate that LHR distribution is similar to that in human tissues They also show LHR expression in the ovarian surface epithelium not investigated in human ovaries and astonishing differences in vascular walls of nonclassic strong LHR in skin vessels and classic LHR targets week expression in ovarian vessels see Ref 40 and Discussion beneath for a role of vascular LHR expression in the LH CG delivery Multiple rat human and porcine LHR protein variants Figures 4and 5 Western blot analysis of protein extracts from normal rat ovaries and human and porcine mature CL with 3B5 antibody showed six distinct bands migrating between 92 and 48 kDa lanes 2 4 and 6 Fig 4 see also Fig 5A Although weak some LHR immunoreactivity was also detected in the rat kidney protein extract lane 1 This observation is consistent with a lack of LHR immunoreactivity in rat kidney cryostat sections reported previously 22 Distinct LHR expression was detected in rat proestrous ovaries lane 2 Fig 4 which contain LHR CL at various stages of development and regression and developing and mature preovulatory follicles However in porcine preovulatory ovaries late follicular phase which contain numerous preovulatory follicles but no luteal tissue very strong LHR immunoreactivity was also detected lane 3 Fig 4 Regression of porcine luteal tissue RCL lane 5 was associated with a marked decline of LHR expression This confirmed immunohistochemical observations In human tissues mature CL MCL lane 6 showed LHR bands similar to that in mature porcine CL Very strong expression of all six LHR variants was detected in the fallopian tube FT lane 7 which is the site of first contact with the developing embryo secreting CG a signal required for CL preservation Placental chorionic villi CV lane 8 also showed six distinct bands similar to those detected in the rat human and porcine ovaries However time 0 and early and late trophoblast cultures derived from the same placenta lanes 9 11 showed additional high molecular weight LHR variants 170 kDa possibly LHR homodimers 19 which were barely detectable or undetectable in other tissues including placental CV Moreover there were additional bands detected in trophoblast cultures 85 60 and 46 kDa species and a lack of a 52 kDa variant as compared to the luteal FT and CV protein extracts The 44 kDa species probably a partially degraded form from LHR turnover 18 was observed in placental cultures lanes 9 13 and pelvic floor compartments lanes 14 16 We also investigated cultures of placental mesenchymal cells MC which are always associated with trophoblast cultures 40 41 and amniotic fibroblasts FB Placental mesenchymal cells showed a prominent LHR band at 68 kDa lane 12 Note the virtual lack of other bands characteristic of trophoblast cultures Placental amniotic fibroblasts showed two distinct LHR bands migrating at 59 and 48 kDa lane 13 Similar 59 and 48 kDa species were distinctly expressed in trophoblast cultures Western blot analysis of pelvic floor compartments showed strong expression of 92 and 68 kDa species in protein extracts from the vaginal wall VagW lane 14 which consists of vaginal epithelium longitudinal and circular smooth muscle cell bundles and connective tissue A less prominent band was detected at 80 kDa Three similar bands were also found in human levator ani muscle and fascia lanes 15 and 16 These observations indicate that pelvic floor compartments represent potential targets for the LH CG effect Absorption with porcine ovaries resulted in severe diminution of 3B5 reactivity with rat porcine and human tissues in western blots Fig 5Bvs 5A Altogether these data indicate that the 3B5 antibody identifies six LHR protein variants showing distinct expression in rat porcine and human tissues including human placenta with some variants also detected in human female pelvic floor compartments Human chorionic villi and placental membranes Figure 6 In normal placentae at term the LHR immunoreactivity in mature chorionic villi was found in mononucleated cytotrophoblast cells under the syncytial layer arrowheads Fig 6A and villous vascular sinusoids v but most of the syncytiotrophoblast was virtually unstained white asterisks vs black Mononucleated trophoblast cells showed variable nuclear LHR immunoreactivity Fig 6B detail from A The most prominent nuclear staining was found in trophoblast cells merging with the syncytium full arrowheads vs white The red arrowhead indicates diminution of LHR expression in the cell which joined the syncytial layer Staining of villous sinusoids was associated with basal abluminal aspects of endothelial cells arrowheads Fig 6C Developing immature chorionic villi were occasionally observed and showed more pronounced granular cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity in the syncytial layer asterisk Fig 6D a feature also detected in immature granulosa cells see above In contrast to normal placentae granular cytoplasmic staining of the syncytial layer dominated in some moderately abnormal placentae asterisks Fig 6E which showed mild compensatory dilatation of villous sinusoids v see Ref 52 for definition of placental abnormality In such placentae the LHR mononucleated trophoblast cells were barely detectable as well as LHR expression in villous sinusoids white arrowheads Differences between placental types were more obvious at lower magnification Figure 6F vs control 6I shows normal placenta with prominent LHR staining of villous sinusoids full arrowhead and no staining of syncytium white asterisk Figure 6Gshows LHR immunostaining of syncytium black asterisk and lack of vascular LHR white arrowhead resembling immature chorionic villi immature placental phenotypes characteristic for intrauterine growth retardation and maternal diabetes 52 note lack of dilatation of villous sinusoids Figure 6Hshows that neither surface white asterisk nor significant vascular LHR immunoreactivity white arrowhead was detected in placentae with extreme dilatation of villous sinusoids aged placental phenotype 52 In placental membranes occasionally found multilayered amniotic epithelium showed no or fine granular cytoplasmic staining of epithelial cells adjacent to the basement membrane full arrowhead Fig 6J followed by perinuclear yellow arrowhead and nuclear LHR immunoexpression red arrowhead Cells most distant from the basement membrane showed no staining white arrowhead Extravillous trophoblast cells in placental membranes and placental basal plate Fig 6K exhibited usually perinuclear full arrowheads and occasionally nuclear LHR expression data not shown In contrast however nuclear or no staining was prevalent in adjacent decidual cells white arrowheads Fig 6Lshows a semi parallel section stained for Thy 1 glycoprotein a characteristic marker of human decidual cells 46 Note Thy 1 decidual cells white arrowhead and unstained extravillous trophoblast cells full arrowhead Dual color immunohistochemistry for LHR brown and CD68 blue Fig 6M indicates that LHR decidual cells also show expression of CD68 white arrowhead note brown and blue color of decidual macrophages red arrowhead i e marker also characteristic for regressing luteal cells 40 Note a lack of macrophages among trophoblast cells Pelvic floor Figure 7 Previously documented LH dependent relaxation of the porcine oviduct 53 raises a question if high LH levels in postmenopausal women do not contribute to the relaxation of the pelvic floor and hence to the increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders in these females We investigated connective tissues and muscular compartments of the pelvic floor in order to determine cellular equivalents to LHR bands detected in western blots and possible cellular targets for the LH effect Strong cytoplasmic and nuclear LHR immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells in the vaginal wall Fig 7Avs ctr Vaginal connective tissue fibroblasts white arrowhead Fig 7B and other stromal elements full arrowhead as well as vaginal vessels red arrowhead also showed distinct LHR immunoreactivity In vaginal epithelial layers a model for differentiation of epithelial cells 42 basal stem cells were unstained b Fig 7C dense cytoplasmic staining was found in parabasal immature cells full arrowhead followed by perinuclear yellow arrowhead and cell surface LHR immunoreactivity green arrowhead Nuclear staining was found in lower superficial cells red arrowhead in adjacent panel and cornified superficial cells showed overall diminution of LHR immunoreactivity white arrowhead Additional pelvic floor structure the levator ani fascia was studied and exhibited nuclear LHR immunoreactivity in principal cells fibroblasts white arrowhead Fig 7D and other mesenchymal cells with rounded nuclei full arrowhead most probably resident macrophages see below Mesenchymal cells in levator ani muscle also showed LHR immunoreactivity full arrowheads Fig 7Eand 7F In addition nuclear LHR staining was also detected in levator ani striated muscle fibers some of which were centrally abnormally located in this sample white arrowheads Fig 7Eand 7F Note unstained muscle vessels v accompanied by LHR stromal cells Distribution of resident macrophages as shown in Fig 7G 7H 7I suggests that rounded mesenchymal cells showing LHR immunoreactivity in pelvic floor connective tissues might be represented by this type of cells Note association of some resident macrophages with vasculature v These observations indicate that principal components of the pelvic floor smooth muscle cells fibroblasts and striated muscle fibers which are responsible for pelvic floor integrity are potential targets for LH CG hormonal effects Additional cells exhibiting LHR immunoreactivity in pelvic floor connective tissues appear to be resident macrophages Human brain Figure 8 Neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s disease also show increased incidence in aging individuals Therefore a question arises if the rise in LH reflecting diminution of sex steroids can also contribute to the initiation and progression of neurodegeneration We studied LHR expression in the gray matter of the human parietal lobe cortex Strong LHR immunoreactivity was associated with small cells with flattened nuclei yellow arrowheads Fig 8A and numerous spiny processes full arrowhead Adjacent nerve cells were unstained green arrowheads Fig 8B but distant nerve cells showed moderate staining red arrowheads Staining for the leukocyte common antigen Fig 8C and observation for characteristic morphology and nuclear shape Fig 8Ivs 8F 8G 8H Fig 8Kvs 8J adapted from Ref 54 as well as expression of CD68 of resident macrophages Fig 8L indicate that LHR immunoreactivity in Fig 8Aidentifies microglial cells of mesenchymal mesodermal origin Yet Fig 8Mindicates that these cells do not express CD14 of monocytes and primitive tissue macrophages 42 This suggests that they are highly differentiated dendritic type cells Figure 8Dshows diffuse expression of Thy 1 in the cortex identified with anti human Thy 1 antibody Figure 8Eis a control using the anti rat Thy 1 antibody not reacting with human tissues These data indicate that microglial cells and some nerve cells in the gray matter of the human brain cortex may be influenced by LH CG proteohormones Yet loss of gray matter from areas of the parietal and temporal lobes is the most obvious consequence of Alzheimer s disease 55 56 Discussion Our observations indicate that the 3B5 anti LHR antibody reacts with rat porcine and human tissues In western blots the 3B5 antibody identifies six distinct bands migrating between 92 and 48 kDa and this reactivity with protein extracts from all three species diminishes when the antibody is preabsorbed with porcine ovaries We also show changes in subcellular LHR distribution during differentiation of various cell types To our knowledge LHR expression in fibroblasts striated muscle cells and microglial cells CD68 resident macrophages in the central nervous system is presented for the first time We also report tissue differences in vascular LHR expression During cellular differentiation subcellular LHR distribution changed from granular cytoplasmic to perinuclear surface and nuclear staining virtually no staining was detected in stem cells and most differentiated and aged cells Yet cell surface staining was observed only on classic LH CG targets granulosa and theca cells of preovulatory follicles and mature luteal cells but also in the vaginal epithelium This indicates that these cells are prepared for the selective accumulation of LH CG signals from the circulation There was also a striking difference in vascular LHR expression between ovaries and other tissues In ovarian and also striated muscle vessels the LHR expression was virtually absent Fig 1A 2A 3J while other tissues investigated including uterus brain skin and vagina showed distinct vascular LHR immunoreactivity We also reported previously that in the rat the endothelial LHR expression is absent in testicular vessels and vessels in other tissues involved in LH CG transport into pituitary and from the blood kidney 22 Saturation of LHR in ovarian targets may be dependent on the precise delivery of small amounts of circulating LH CG from the blood into the extravascular space A receptor mediated endothelial transport of hCG has been suggested to represent a model for general involvement of specific receptors in transport of other plasma proteins 57 58 Yet application of this theory on our data will indicate that the LH CG will be delivered to the uterus brain skin and vagina rather than to the ovary Hence the opposite mechanism should be considered endothelial LHR expression may suppress the transport of LH CG from vessels to the extravascular space The LH CG molecule is smaller than that of albumin or IgG i e proteins exhibiting ubiquitous distribution so there is no need to enhance rather only prevent LH CG transport to inappropriate sites Binding of LH CG to endothelial cells expressing LHR may prevent LH CG transport from circulation by electrostatic forces and the lack of endothelial LHR expression may be associated with LH CG transport mediated by a general mechanism involved in protein exchange 40 We report that normal term placentae show virtually no LHR expression in trophoblastic syncytium while syncytium of some abnormal placentae immature phenotypes exhibits LHR immunoreactivity This resembles high LHR expression in first trimester placenta 28 which is a source of high hCG levels 59 Yet hCG levels fall during the second trimester and elevated maternal midtrimester hCG is associated with higher rates of maternal and neonatal complications pregnancy induced hypertension preeclampsia gestational diabetes and perinatal death 60 61 62 63 Hence some abnormal term placentae appear to preserve syncytium in a younger state accompanied by high secretion of hCG In contrast vascular LHR expression was detected in sinusoids of chorionic villi from normal term placentae but was virtually absent in all abnormal placentae If the vascular LHR expression represents a barrier for hCG transport from chorionic villi to the fetal blood see above lack of this barrier may cause high levels of fetal hCG resulting in perinatal morbidity and mortality 63 regardless of normal or abnormal hCG production Western blot analysis of placental villi and trophoblast cultures indicates that cultured trophoblast cells show additional bands including 170 kDa species possibly an LHR homodimer 19 Although the 170 kDa species persisted in late cultures other additional LHR variants diminished This suggests an activation of isolated trophoblast cells and enhanced LHR synthesis with formation of additional glycosylated LHR variants particularly in time 0 and early cultures When compared to chorionic villi trophoblast cultures showed stronger 59 and 48 kDa species characteristic for cultured fibroblasts Indeed it has been reported that differentiation of cultured trophoblast is associated with activation of accompanying fibroblasts 64 Early differentiation of granulosa luteal and other cell types expressing LHR was associated with cytoplasmic LHR immunoreactivity reflecting receptor synthesis prior its surface expression In addition the CL of pregnancy the function of which is highly dependent on CG also showed cytoplasmic expression Hence it is possible that high levels of circulating LH CG e g during pregnancy and after menopause may influence not only cells with surface LH expression but also cells with cytoplasmic and perhaps exclusively nuclear LHR expression pelvic floor compartments including striated muscle In other words cells lacking surface LHR may not be influenced by temporary increase of LH production during the preovulatory period of the ovarian cycle due to the cell membrane LHR barrier and the LH effect is probably also prevented by the vascular LHR barrier Yet high CG levels during pregnancy may pass the cell membrane barrier and act through the cytoplasmic LHR in the CL of pregnancy and other cells with cytoplasmic expression and such effect could be enhanced if the vascular LHR barrier is absent abnormal placentae of aged phenotype and similar putative age related vascular changes in other tissues But the LH CG action through the cytoplasmic perinuclear and nuclear LHRs opens a possibility of more direct LH CG action within the cells which may not require a classic second messenger pathway cyclic AMP dependent signaling mechanism involvement or this system can act through the intracellular LHRs Evidence is accumulating that a number of other factors modulate the actions of gonadotropins in the ovary and testis via activation of alternative signaling pathways and via LHR protein variants and alternative second messenger pathways for the transmission of the LHR activation effect exist which may not include stimulation of cyclic AMP levels 65 66 67 68 69 A question also arises if the nuclear LHR expression in terminally differentiated cells e g striated muscle fibers may not indicate a possibility of the direct effect of LH CG on modulation of protein synthesis reflecting certain effects of sex steroids on their nuclear receptors LH CG causes a relaxation of smooth muscle cells which express LHR 36 37 38 Fig 7A The data presented also indicate that additional principal cell types in the pelvic floor show LHR expression including stromal and fascial fibroblasts and striated muscle cells This is associated with relatively high expression of LHR protein in western blots and a fully glycosylated 92 kDa species in particular Interestingly strong 59 and 48 kDa proteins expressed in cultured fibroblasts were not detected in pelvic floor lysates but a distinct 68 kDa band from mesenchymal cells was apparent We speculate that a 92 kDa species in the pelvic floor is a result of interaction of resident macrophages with pelvic floor fibroblasts The hCG secreted by trophoblastic syncytium during pregnancy may play an important role in the physiologic adaptation of the body and preparation of the pelvic floor for labor in particular However when compared to hCG LH has a 10 fold higher LHR binding affinity 20 Consequently high LH levels after menopause may cause pathologic relaxation of the pelvic floor resulting in pelvic floor disorders Strong LHR expression in microglial cells in the brain cortex is of particular interest Microglial cells are resident macrophages in the central nervous system and LHR expression has been described in other types of human resident macrophages ovary decidua endometrium and corpora lutea 22 33 Pathological activation of microglia has been reported in a wide range of conditions such as Alzheimer s disease cerebral ischemia prion diseases multiple sclerosis AIDS dementia and other degenerative neurological diseases 70 71 Some of these degenerative diseases are associated with advanced age and high levels of circulating LH High LH levels might pass the presumptive LH barrier of brain vessels expressing LHR or vascular LHR expression might diminish with age as in abnormal term placentae Yet elevated maternal mid trimester chorionic gonadotropin is associated with fetal cerebral blood flow redistribution and adverse perinatal outcome 63 In addition estrogens which are known to cause a diminution of high LH levels in postmenopausal women have been reported to be effective in the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer s disease 72 73 74 Microglia belong among cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system 75 Since CG increases secretion of a variety of cytokines by monocytes and induces their inflammatory reaction and phagocytic activity 76 77 78 79 high LH levels in aging individuals may also activate resident macrophages in the central nervous system and contribute to the development of Alzheimer s disease and other inflammation mediated neurodegenerative diseases Outside of the area occupied by microglial cells in the grey matter of the cerebral cortex weaker LHR expression was also detected in some nerve cells This suggests that such nerve cells could be directly influenced by LH CG proteohormones with unknown consequences while the nerve cells among microglial branching processes are protected from such an effect Conclusion In conclusion our observations concur with and expand current knowledge on LHR expression in gonadal and nongonadal tissues reported by other investigators We show that the 3B5 antibody identifies six distinct LHR protein variants in three different mammalian species Subcellular LHR localization varies during cellular differentiation In contrast to the theory on the role of vascular hormone receptors in preferential pick up of circulating hormones there may be no need to enhance selective pick up rather only prevent LH CG transport to inappropriate sites Abnormal placental LHR expression may play a role in the development of abnormal pregnancy and fetal outcome and expression of LHR in the pelvic floor compartments suggests that high LH levels in postmenopausal women may contribute to pelvic floor relaxation and increased incidence of pelvic floor disorders High LH levels in aging individuals may also participate in the development of inflammation mediated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer s disease
