 Kyle s Mom Is a Bitch An Exegesis Good morning all Roger Doubtless Elvis will be responding to you about Michael Clarke Duncan in The Green Mile but I ve got to say I flinched when I read that his function is essentially to absorb and process white pain suffering disease and guilt which he does visibly which is a novel change from the decades of films in which black characters have done the same thing invisibly That s exactly what drives some of us crazy about that character that he has no autonomous existence that he s there solely to help process white pain Poitier might have humanized Steiger but Mr Tibbs is nominally flesh and blood a man with a full range of emotions John Coffey is another of Stephen King s mystical black martyrs with extra sensory perception In the scene in which he heals Patricia Clarkson he hovers over her bedridden form in a way that s meant to summon up rape fantasies of fragile white Southern flowers menaced by darkies and to miraculously invert them But to me a miraculous inversion of a rape fantasy is almost as cheap and false as the thing itself the black saint as much of an unhealthy projection as the black demon Before I drop the film vs video reverie vs hypnosis issue let me say that a I m salivating over your home theater setup and b I m slightly wary of anecdotal evidence Your fears about the medium might be warranted and let s find out before all those theaters get converted but the tendency to trance out in front of a boob tube even a mega mega boob tube has a lot to do with the setting and the quality of your attention You can stretch out glance around the room go to the toilet read a newspaper and even if you don t you know you have the option I ve had most of my really intense aesthetic experiences at live theater and a few at the opera and I ve always figured that s because I d been forced to make more of an investment in what I was watching to commit to it in a way I don t when I watch TV I want to apologize Roger if I gave the impression yesterday that Joel Siegal and John Simon were making fun of Magnolia at a showing of that film They were each discussing it not discreetly but not publicly at a screening for critics of The Talented Mr Ripley and I m certain that they didn t think some smartass like me would report the gist of their conversations to the world I gather however that Joel Siegal has lambasted the picture on an upcoming program of yours And John Simon has never been ashamed to have his opinions widely broadcast I suppose I invoked them because they represent such wildly divergent sensibilities one populist the other defiantly highbrow and both were united in a kind of ebullient loathing of this poor picture I m glad you re putting Magnolia on your 10 best list because it needs champions it seems to me so poignantly vulnerable to ridicule Sarah In your final post yesterday you asked Can it really be that difficult to write a song called Kyle s Mom Is a Bitch I bet any number of people reading this exchange could do as well or better I don t wish to discourage anyone from doing as well or better my mailbox is open as I m sure is yours Sarah But I d like to speak up for that number which is emblematic of many of South Park s strengths Kyle s Mom Is a Bitch is an infantile playground chant raised to the level of comic art by a Cartman s speed freak squalling baby vocal b the sophisticated Broadway style orchestration and c the happy notion that people in other cultures the Netherlands Holland China Africa would come out in full national regalia to sing about Kyle s mom being a bitch In form it s a showbizzy patter song but because of its lightning tempo which makes the words barely intelligible and the steady repetition of bitch on the downbeat it has the primal force of an incantation Kyle sMomisaBITCHshe sabigfatBITCH she sthebiggestBITCHinthewholewideworld OnMondayshe saBITCHonTuesdaysshe saBITCH OK it s not Noel Coward but it makes me as blissful as anything has since I was toilet trained Yours David
