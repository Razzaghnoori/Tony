 Front Runners Among Non Candidates What part of no don t you understand Minnesota Gov Jesse Ventura asked a group of businessmen at a lunch in Tokyo on Thursday The erstwhile pro wrestler wasn t showing off his excellent grasp of the English language no he was executing a rhetorical flourish to underscore his commitment to not running for the U S presidency I am not a candidate for president he said I do not want the job Indeed Ventura who recently admitted he wanted to be reincarnated as a bra told his lunch mates that he could never be president because the job is simply too restrictive The president is the leader of the free world but he probably has the least freedom of anyone in the country Ventura said I ve lost my freedom a great deal being governor Jeez he s never going to be happy as a brassiere with that kind of thinking Boxer shorts perhaps While I d rather be discussing your superb piece in this morning s Times on the limits of online grocery shopping so that s why we didn t have lamb shanks for dinner I can imagine the flames and charges of nepotism and conflict of interest So instead I d like to discuss all the people who aren t running for president a list I might point out that s always far more interesting than the jokers and sad sacks who are running for the highest office in the land Remember how exciting it was when Mario Cuomo wasn t running for president Now that was a non race Or that lovely general Colin Powell is he not running again this year I haven t heard that he s not running so I suppose I have to assume he isn t not running which would be a shame since he was such a great non candidate Here s my current favorite Warren Beatty He s been doing a fabulous job of not throwing his hat in the ring yet CNN ran a clip of him this morning in fact speaking at Harvard last night I believe in which he says that if he were really running he d be a lot more organized but he s not He said all he s doing in fact is reminding people of bedrock liberal positions that seem to have been forgotten along the way Is Donald Trump still not running Who cares Remember how Teddy Kennedy always used to not run Kind of sad that he no longer doesn t One thing I m looking forward to more computer guys getting into the whole non candidacy thing Don t you think that our old friend Jim Barksdale would make a spectacular non presidential hopeful
