 The New Death Penalty Last Friday on Iowa Public Television George W Bush was asked to summarize the message of his campaign I understand governments don t create wealth Bush began Governments create an environment in which entrepreneurship and producers can flourish That s why I support cutting the tax rates That s why I support getting rid of the death penalty Hold it right there Did Bush just say he s against the death penalty And what on earth does that have to do with creating wealth He did say it and it has everything to do with creating wealth A few years ago Republicans not only supported the death penalty they campaigned on a promise to apply it more often Days after the GOP s victory in the 1994 elections Speaker to be Newt Gingrich pledged to bring every plank of the Contract With America to the House floor including an effective enforceable death penalty beginning to phase out the marriage penalty in the tax code allowing senior citizens to earn up to 39 000 a year without penalty from Social Security a capital gains cut and indexing Along the way the two penalties merged Republicans began to use the phrase death penalty like the phrase marriage penalty to describe a tax pegged to one of life s most sacred passages The inheritance tax which had been known as the estate tax became the death tax which in turn by association with the hated marriage penalty became the death penalty Two years ago Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott R Miss told the U S Chamber of Commerce he would do something about unfair taxes starting with the death penalty Four weeks ago House Majority Leader Dick Armey R Texas declared on Fox News that Congress could use the surplus to address a serious unfairness in the tax code such as the marriage penalty the death penalty taxes on senior citizens Last weekend Bush adopted the same phrase The transformation of the inheritance tax into the death penalty provides more grist for satirists who wonder whether Republicans having condemned the marriage penalty for discouraging marriage now worry that the inheritance tax is discouraging death For a head start on the satire check out the work of Slate necro economists and But the true import of the new death penalty is the demise of the old one In 1994 Bush Lott and Armey would never have called the inheritance tax the death penalty because the death penalty meant something else Today they can speak out against the death penalty without confusion or irony and without being asked for clarification because the traditional meaning of that phrase is no longer plausible Capital punishment is no longer a live issue What killed it Two things Incomes went up and crime went down Americans stopped feeling scared and started feeling comfortable The GOP stopped talking about saving your life and started talking about your life savings As for Democrats they don t complain much about the death penalty anymore The last guy who did that was Michael Dukakis and look what happened to him Now every serious politician either supports the death penalty and makes a show of it as Bill Clinton has or keeps his mouth shut The old death penalty debate was profound and heated Liberals called the practice murder Conservatives called it the only fitting punishment for unspeakable crimes It was a moral struggle of the highest consequence But these days unspeakable crimes are no longer spoken of murder is what happens to your portfolio on a bad day family values are debated through the Internal Revenue code and the death penalty is a tax issue It may be a perfectly worthy topic in an age of affluence But it s hardly a matter of life and death
