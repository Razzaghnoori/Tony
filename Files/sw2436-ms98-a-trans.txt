 well i haven t had too much of a chance to watch TV lately so probably everything i m going to say is kind of dated yeah well i can understand that it s it s that time of the year uh we just uh my wife and i just recently moved into our house so we re yeah oh spend a lot of time on the house and out in the yard and things but um i like to keep up to date too um i guess yeah yeah uh huh in the since i got out of college which was about five years ago i ve my TV viewing started to tend more towards uh documentary news programs things like that something that s going to keep me up to date i ve kind of kind of gotten away from uh being a series watcher having to keep up to date with uh um hum um hum oh yeah i think when you re in college you kind of you have more of a regular schedule in terms of you can watch every week um hum yeah that makes a big difference so so yeah i i used to when my kids were real little and i was home i watched uh i was home more i watched things on a more regular basis but right now the last thing i watched regularly was Thirty Something when it first came out did y all ever watch that okay yeah i yeah started too and uh kind of kind of worked away from that yeah yeah i i have a hard time sticking with something like on on on on TV because it like it gets real aggravating if you miss it for a week or two you feel kind of left out but um yeah yeah yeah right right i know but i ll tell you what um we re really strict with our kids about television and one night a couple of weeks ago um hum it was just a just happened that we were exhausted and they wanted to watch and we said okay well we ll sit down and we ll you know look at what you want to see let s just turn it on and see what s on we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it i believe that and so we you know and it was prime time it was what seven thirty eight o clock on a week night and no we have cable and there wasn t anything on any channel and and the stuff that was on the prime the networks you know ABC NBC CBS um hum um hum was it was just um dribble yeah do you know i mean it wasn t even funny it wasn t creative it it was the worst i ve seen i mean i have not watched prime time week night TV i guess in a real long time because i was shocked that s right yeah well i i know exactly how you feel you know what i m saying that s right i i uh when i first moved down here uh moved into the apartment and got cable and uh i guess i sort of kind of became numb numb uh nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the TV you know and then all of a sudden i started paying paying attention to um um hum to network TV again once in a while right now we don t have cable and it s surprising how much it s changed the you know the the whole moral situation everything is just just gone one whole complete direction different right right um hum yeah and uh we we don t have any kids yet but i i feel the same way it s really tough to find something um hum um hum that s that s uh that s going to be good and interesting for the kids even even cartoons um you you know you you watch uh you watch some of the cartoons and right right oh yeah kids kids aren t even going to understand half the humor that s in there it none of it s probably damaging lot of times but uh right right it s just it s just uh like a necessary evil i mean when we when our children were younger when they were like four years old three years old five years old we we just had Sesame Street and that was about it you know right right but now in order to seem you know humane and normal we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff but it s just one of those things you know you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something because those drive you crazy if you re oh yes yeah that s right if you re in the room so but it s such a shame because it could be so good i i don t understand why first of all why the public puts up with it and second of all why the networks think that that s right well that s true you know we enjoy that kind of stuff i can t it s hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that that can t be the problem it must be the marketing pressures and uh huh you know their demographic studies that they do that show you know that everybody s IQ has dropped dramatically or something that s i m glad you said it and i didn t have to but that that that s the i feel the exact same way i sit i sit and watch some shows and uh and i m embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show you know why do you do this to yourself i know why do you do this yeah i know i m trying to think if there s anything i do you like uh i like stuff that s on Great Performances and i we used to watch mystery quite quite a bit and enjoyed that okay yeah stuff i guess that s mostly public on public TV as a matter of fact you know when i was a kid excuse me my parents used to have we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular TV that we watched we had to watch an hour of public TV right now there s an idea that was just the rule and if they saw us watching something they d say all right what did you see on What s New or there was some other the children s program i think at the time was called What s New so we had to give a little oral report before we could um okay yeah watch our program but do you watch do you watch sports on TV are you a sports fan yeah yeah that s that s pretty good i can t handle it very long i i mean i m i m a sports fan but it s yeah yeah uh huh well it s kind of it s kind of like reading magazines any more If half of the time wasn t spent watching commercials it probably wouldn t be so bad but uh it it s you re missing an awful lot i d rather personally rather watch um hum right yeah yeah see a game on T V than fight the crowds at the stadium but uh but uh no i don t sit down i ll sit down for the big games the Super Bowl and the championship yeah that s true the traffic um yeah yeah you know things like that But i don t follow any team i check the scores the next morning and i know how everybody s doing and that suffices me But um hum um hum yeah yeah i like i like good comedy good humor once in a while yeah i i enjoy that but what do you where do you well oh do you get the comedy you don t have cable now i was going to say they have a comedy channel now but again you re in a situation where you re watching mostly uh commercials and then you re no we don t yeah yeah you know trying to pass the time to wait till the next comedian comes up you know what i did there was a time there where i could um tape things and then i d fast forward through the commercials saved a lot of time that way right uh huh yeah it works you bet yeah but that takes too much planning yeah no i don t know if there s any any series that i pay attention to i try to watch Cheers once in a while um now that yeah is that still real good it used to be real good is it yeah it is in fact it s i think it s on tonight i just got in from outside so i so i m kind of oh oh okay out of it Things like that and i consider that fairly intelligent humor you know yeah yeah yeah you can tell they pick up the words every once in a while right right right isn t it such such a long running yeah program yeah they do have a good they do have good writers for that oh that makes me think do you watch Saturday Night Live at all i try to yeah we try to stay up too yeah if it s getting harder and harder ten years ago wasn t so hard to stay up to watch it well yeah you know and and it was it was just automatic too no matter where you were you stopped and and sat down and watched it i think it s come around again it s gone through cycles but uh yeah right yeah yeah it was it we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there but we started watching again uh huh but it s a real different show than it was when it started it s it s funny now and it s better but it s real different than what it used to be but you can t be uh so um you can t be outrageous yeah that s right that s right right you know if you keep that same format there s only so long that you can be outrageous so that s for sure that is for sure so well i guess there s a few things around still but uh yeah you have to hunt hard for them i guess yeah sounds like we pretty much agree yeah i guess so well well its been uh good talking to you yeah good talking to you okay take care bye you too bye
