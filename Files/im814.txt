 Preface The federal government depends heavily on a variety of information technology products and services to serve the public Each year the government spends billions of dollars on computer equipment services software and telecommunications The success or failure of information system acquisitions affects executive agencies credibility with the Congress and the public as well as their abilities to carry out their missions effectively and efficiently The General Accounting Office GAO and offices of inspectors general have consistently identified problems with information technology acquisitions Problems identified in numerous evaluations include information systems that do not meet users needs exceed cost estimates or take significantly longer than expected to complete This guide provides a logical framework for evaluating information technology acquisitions It incorporates a risk assessment methodology intended to reduce audit planning time and ensure that significant issues are included It is based on a model of the acquisition process developed by GAO in cooperation with a wide range of federal and private sector officials 1 The model outlines the process used to acquire information technologies and identifies elements of the process that are essential for planning and carrying out acquisitions This guide is intended for use in planning and conducting risk assessments of computer hardware and software telecommunications and system development acquisitions A risk assessment is the process of identifying potential risks in a system under development and then determining the significance of each risk in terms of its likelihood and impact on the acquisition s cost schedule and ability 1Information Technology A Model to Help Managers Decrease Acquisition Risks GAO IMTEC 8 1 6 August 1990 to meet the agency s needs Such assessments may have their greatest impact if carried out early when an agency can more easily alter its acquisition plans and strategy to manage and control the identified risks The audit guide consists of 10 chapters with appendixes Chapter 1 introduces the purpose of the guide explains its essential concepts and techniques and provides direction in tailoring the guide for use on specific assignments Chapters 2 through 10 address specific activities in the acquisition process The nine chapters present audit guidance on management and user support project staffing needs requirements specifications alternatives acquisition planning solicitation document source selection contract management and test and acceptance Each chapter lists audit objectives commonly expected documentation detailed audit questions and references to federal regulations and guidance The chapters are intended to assist in the identification of specific risk areas and to contribute to an overall assessment of how well an agency is meeting its acquisition objectives This audit guide is also available in a software format accompanied by reference materials such as the GAO model of the acquisition process relevant federal acquisition regulations General Services Administration GSA guidance and Office of Management and Budget OMB circulars The software version utilizes a hypertext software package to help auditors quickly and flexibly review Page 2 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks all the included

This audit guide is based on and incorporates GAO s information technology acquisition model The model describes three phases in the acquisition process presolicitation solicitation and award and postaward It sets out essential activities in each phase along with critical factors related to those activities The model is intended to give managers an overview of the acquisition process and to help them decrease acquisition risks The model s critical factors were drawn from the judgment and expertise of a wide range of knowledgeable individuals from government and private industry Compliance with these critical factors can increase the likelihood that an acquisition will meet an agency s needs at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner This guide is intended to help auditors conduct more Objectives focused reviews of information technology acquisitions by enabling them to quickly identify significant areas of risk Using this guide will help auditors identify critical factors not addressed by management make a general assessment of any procurement risks and provide rapid feedback to agency officials so they can take corrective action in a timely and efficient manner Use of the guide should be selectively tailored to the requirements of particular reviews and adapted to the status of the acquisition Auditors will need to exercise professional judgment in assessing the significance of audit results or findings For example the guide assists auditors in determining how an agency identified and defined its requirements Professional judgment is necessary to evaluate this information and determine if the agency conducted an adequate requirements analysis Page 8 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks Some areas of assessment will require the expertise of auditors with specific technical skills and experience These specific areas include knowledge of solicitation procedures benchmarking and other performance or capability validation techniques and knowledge of technical areas such as database management and telecommunications networks These areas are identified within the guide The audit team should include experienced members with enough knowledge of information technologies to satisfy the Government Auditing Standards requirement that auditors have appropriate skills and knowledge The audit approach described in this guide is intended to result in a risk assessment of an acquisition project at any point in its development The auditor will be trying to determine whether a project will result in a specified product or level of performance and will be delivered at a specified time and cost An auditor should use this guide to identify areas that are most likely to result in technical failures unmet user needs cost overruns or schedule delays Those risks should then be brought to the attention of appropriate agency officials The audit steps and questions provided are directed toward assessing whether an agency has sufficiently addressed critical factors including support from managers and users adequate project staff and controls over the acquisition s scope before and after a contract is awarded Approach Assignment Planning When planning a risk assessment the auditor should first review the agency s acquisition policies and directives to identify the organizations and individuals responsible for approving procurements Approval thresholds for example should show which officials have the authority to review and approve acquisitions Page 9 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks Organization and Use of the Audit Guide The agency s directives should also show the specific milestones and documentation required for a procurement The auditor should also review previous studies or audits of the acquisition project and of the agency s information resources management functions Reports by GAO or other auditing institutions can provide valuable background information The auditor should also determine whether previous recommendations have been carried out The chapters of this audit guide focus on logically distinct steps of the acquisition process as described on page 10 of GAO s acquisition model 1 The following table identifies the appropriate chapters for reviewing the various steps of an acquisition In general the auditor will want to concentrate on the steps that are relevant to the phase of the acquisition being reviewed However regardless of how far the acquisition has advanced at a minimum the auditor should always ascertain whether senior managers and users were involved in the project s initiation The auditor should also verify that the agency has defined its needs and requirements to support its mission and that those requirements continue to be valid as the acquisition progresses through contract award and contract management 1GAO IMTEC 8 1 6 August 1990 Each of the following chapters provides references to regulations and other guidance relevant to material in the chapter In addition each chapter identifies specific audit objectives and documentation expected for the major activities at that point in the acquisition process The documents listed may exist with different names than those used here The auditor should refer to agency specific requirements for more information Finally each chapter sets out audit steps to help plan and conduct the assessment of an acquisition The questions may need to be tailored to Page 11 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks the particular circumstances of an audit using the subject agency s requirements The appendixes provide further information for use in planning and conducting an acquisition audit Appendix I contains a worksheet called an acquisition profile to summarize essential information about the acquisition project The worksheet should contain such information as the names and locations of units responsible for the acquisition the project purpose and the expected cost and time frames The completed profile should be kept available for later reference If a profile exists from an earlier assignment the auditor should review and update it Appendix II of this guide describes techniques to use in identifying software development risks of delays and cost overruns known collectively as management metrics or indicators These techniques require information about the size of the system being developed and about progress after development has begun Thus the techniques are only appropriate for use after the agency has completed its design and progressed into developing the system An auditor using this guide to review an acquisition that includes significant software development and has a contract in place should review appendix II for techniques to help identify variances from the agency s cost and schedule estimates In some cases the project team may be unable to complete a project on time due to an unrealistic schedule The cost models described in appendix II can be used to make a rough estimate of how long a system development may require Such an estimate can be compared to agency plans to see if the agency has committed itself to unrealistically short time frames In other cases delays in completing scheduled activities such as system design coding and testing can lead to project Page 12 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks Application of Audit Guide to Prototyping Methodology slippage later on Auditors will need to tailor the use of the tools described in appendix II to the circumstances of the audit Appendix III provides a comprehensive list of references cited throughout the guide as well as publications that may be useful for technical information Finally a glossary is attached that defines a wide range of technical and procurement terminology This acquisition guide is intended for use in reviewing any information technology acquisition regardless of the system development methodology being used The guide is structured around the federal acquisition process and is independent of development methods for information systems An auditor should recognize that there are different system development models that may be used when a system development effort is acquired Such models may include the waterfall model rapid prototyping or evolutionary development Some of the documents required under different development approaches may differ Prototyping for example may act as part of the requirements definition process helping the agency identify and control areas of high uncertainty and technical risk In this situation the auditor should 1 focus on determining how one or more prototypesor incremental versions function to define the agency s requirements and 2 determine how the system development methodology used by the agency controls the prototyping process One approach to using prototyping as part of the system development process has been described as a spiral model of system development 2 The spiral 2For a description of prototyping and the spiral model see Roger S Pressman Software Engineering A Practitioner s Approach 3rd ed New York McGraw Hill Inc 1992 pp 26 34 Presenting Conclusions and Recommendations model portrays a process in which an agency iteratively 1 determines its objectives alternatives and constraints 2 evaluates its alternatives and identifies and resolves risk issues 3 develops and verifies its next level products and 4 plans its next phases Prototypes are developed or modified as part of the second phase As part of this model a prototype is developed or revised whenever a risk analysis shows that significant areas of uncertainty remain that pose substantial risks to project success When the system has been defined well enough to manage risks effectively the agency develops and tests a full scale system In order to review an acquisition that is using prototypes the auditor should determine what regulations or guidance the agency has to define a prototyping methodology This methodology will establish the documentation and approval points that agency officials should meet The auditor can then measure the progress of the prototypes against the agency s criteria The auditor should conclude the review by identifying outstanding areas of risk and the agency s actions to address those risks Note should be made of how well the agency has addressed the critical factors in GAO s 1990 model of information technology acquisitions as well as agency compliance with acquisition regulations standards and other federal guidance 3 Results of the review should be communicated to agency officials for their comment in accordance with government auditing standards The auditor should also recommend changes to ensure that the agency is properly addressing the critical factors in the GAO model For example the 3GAO IMTEC 8 1 6 August 1990 auditor may recommend a greater role for users if they are not involved in approving alternatives or validating system requirements Similarly the auditor should recommend that the agency take appropriate actions where senior management involvement seems lacking or where the project organization is unstable and subject to high turnover The recommendations should be reviewed with agency officials and be appropriate to the probability and significance of the risks identified Chapter 2 Management and User Support This chapter focuses on levels of commitment and support for a planned acquisition by senior managers and users two key stakeholders in an acquisition Senior managers include those who have overall agency responsibility for strategic including information related objectives Users are those who operate or rely on agency information resources and include the managers and staff responsible for agency policies and programs supported by the acquisition The involvement and support of senior management throughout an acquisition is essential for success Senior management should envision the agency s acquisition goals define strategic objectives and oversee the projects that implement the overall vision One or more senior managers should act as system sponsors with sufficient authority to ensure that applicable resources are available for the project Users should also be involved and provide support throughout the acquisition to ensure that their requirements are understood and that the resulting system is both accepted and used User involvement should be sustained from the needs determination phase through final acceptance and implementation User involvement in the acquisition process will help avoid the development of products that ultimately do not meet agency requirements The audit steps in this section should be used to assess the potential risks posed by the lack of management or user support An acquisition that lacks either or both of these elements is at risk of incurring unnecessary cost overruns not meeting its planned delivery schedule and not satisfying agency needs Audit Objectives 1 To ensure that senior managers support and areactively involved throughout the development and implementation of an acquisition 2 To ensure that users support the acquisition byactively participating in defining procurement requirements developing the solicitation document and verifying that the equipment and or services contracted for meet the agency s needs Decision papers memoranda or other records of Documentation senior management oversight and approval ofRequired acquisition objectives and plans Program management directives or other written directives from senior managers stating goals and objectives of the acquisition and delegating authority to carry out the acquisition Budget exhibits and plans

Representatives Chapter 2 FIRMR Bulletin C 5 Delegation of Procurement Authority for a Specific Acquisition Chapter 4 Needs Requirements Specifications The purpose of this chapter is to guide the auditor in determining whether the agency has developed an accurate description of its information technology needs The acquisition should be clearly linked to program needs to the agency s overall strategies and to governmentwide policies and standards The agency should expand on its basic description of needs to define specific requirements so providers of information technology can respond with meaningful solutions In some cases an agency may use prototypes to help define or validate its requirements The requirements then form the basis for even more detailed specifications In identifying its requirements an agency should plan for testing the information resources it needs These plans should cover acceptance security and certification requirements The test plans developed at this point form the basis for later evaluations of contract performance Failure to clearly and accurately define information technology requirements poses high risks for any agency For instance improperly defined requirements may preclude alternatives restrict competition increase the risk of cost and schedule overruns and lead to systems that are inconsistent with an agency s overall architecture and incompatible with other agency systems The hardware or software purchased may also be inconsistent with government standards Designing and implementing a system is also more difficult if input output and processing specifications are incomplete or inaccurate In addition if security and internal control requirements are not well defined control over sensitive information or other assets may be lost Page 25 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks Chapter 4 Needs Requirements Specifications Audit Objectives 1 To ensure that the acquisition is based on clearlyunderstood needs or opportunities and that it is consistent with the overall strategy and architectures used by the agency 2 To ensure that the agency defines its requirements based on the needs identified earlier and validated by functional users well enough to support the acquisition of hardware software telecommunications and system development services These requirements should primarily be expressed in functional terms in accordance with FIRMR policy 3 To ensure that system specifications clearly andaccurately summarize the agency s requirements Documentation Needs statement Required Requirements

FIPS Publication 101 Guideline for Lifecycle Validation Verification and Testing of Computer Software Chapter 5 Alternatives Audit Objectives After identifying its requirements the agency should assess alternatives for cost effectively meeting those requirements The approach selected should reflect an understanding of what is available in the commercial market as well as what is available within the government Approaching the acquisition this way will lessen but not eliminate the risk that an agency may select an alternative that does not fully meet user requirements or that is unnecessarily complex and expensive 1 To determine if the agency has considered allreasonable alternatives for meeting its needs 2 To determine if the agency identified the risks costs and benefits of each alternative 3 To verify that the agency selected an alternativebalancing expected benefits against costs time and risks of failure Documentation Required Record of alternatives analysis such as a system decision paper Economic and risk analyses should accompany or be a part of the decision paper Market survey research conducted to identify alternatives for meeting user needs and to support cost estimates Findings and approvals statements to support restrictions on specifications such as compatibility limited requirements Cost benefit analysis to justify the selection of the alternative selected over other alternatives in dollar terms or in terms of some other criteria such as effectiveness 1 Assess the involvement of responsible parties andAudit Steps verify whether a Users agreed with the range of alternativesconsidered and were involved in validating those alternatives against the original requirements For related information on this and the next point see ch 2 steps 2c and 2d under User Involvement b Users agreed with the alternative finally selected c Appropriate senior management approved thealternative selected See ch 2 step 2 under Top management Support for more information d The Contracting Officer or other contracting personnel participated in the alternatives analysis to ensure that a feasible acquisition approach was selected e Project staff conducted market surveys to determine how industry can best meet the agency s requirements 2 Ensure that the agency considered as appropriate the alternatives included in GAO s acquisition model and FIRMR 201 20 203 1 3 Assess how the agency evaluated alternatives bydetermining whether a The agency consistently analyzed alternatives usingthe same criteria for each alternative b The alternatives are described in sufficient detail to support time and cost estimates and cost benefit analyses c The alternatives considered fit within the agency s information architecture d The range of alternatives considered was restricted by resource assumptions staff or funding limitations 4 Determine whether the agency consistentlyanalyzed the costs and benefits of each alternative Ensure that the economic analysis includes present values for costs and benefits and is updated periodically Identify the system life used as a basis for evaluating alternatives and determine whether it appears realistic in light of user needs expected changes in the technology expected availability of maintenance and other support and the time needed to prepare subsequent acquisitions Verify that the economic analysis includes a sensitivity analysis to identify factors that affect the choice of one alternative over another The costs and benefits considered for each alternative should include a Conversion costs b Personnel costs c Operation and maintenance costs d Nonrecurring but quantifiable benefits in terms of information processing administration and support these may include cost reductions resulting from improved system operations or value enhancement through improved use of resources e Recurring and quantifiable benefits on a monthly and or quarterly basis over the system life from reductions in such items as salaries fringe benefits supplies utilities and space occupancy Page 36 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks f Any nonquantifiable benefits such as improved service and enhanced organizational image 5 Determine whether the agency analyzed thefollowing noncost factors for each feasible alternative a Obsolescence strategies for avoiding outdatedresources over the system life A technology upgrade clause is one way to avoid obsolescence by allowing an agency to buy advanced versions of equipment or software when they become available b Availability to what extent the system will beavailable to users c Reliability how frequently the system requirescorrective maintenance d Maintainability the ease with which failed systemcomponents can be repaired taking into account the level of service personnel support and supplies needed e Expandability the ease with which the system canbe enhanced to meet anticipated growth f Flexibility the extent to which the alternative can accommodate changes in the nature of the work load g Security the ability to prevent unauthorized access and tampering and consideration of national security and emergency preparations h Privacy the extent to which the privacy ofpersonnel related data can be maintained Page 37 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks i Affect on personnel the impact on the level of support personnel needed including the skills required j User acceptance the overall impact on the user community including the amount of change to user procedures k Accountability the ability of the alternative toallow system activity to be tracked and measured 6 Review the risk analysis to see if it identifiessensitive data and vulnerabilities Verify that the magnitude of each vulnerability has been stated Determine whether or not the risk analysis conforms with the standards identified in FIPS Publications 65 and 73 and OMB Circular A 130 7 Verify that each alternative is evaluated forfinancial technical and schedule risks Financial risk refers to the extent to which each alternative is subject to unexpected additional costs Technical risk indicates the probability that each alternative s technical objectives will prove difficult to achieve in whole or in part Schedule risk is the extent to which each alternative is subject to unexpected schedule delays and slippage in meeting the system s technical objectives regardless of cost 8 Ensure that the agency has selected the mostadvantageous and realistic alternative with respect to benefits costs and risks based on steps 4 and 7 9

Applications Chapter 6 Acquisition Planning Acquisition planning is the process of coordinating and integrating the efforts of personnel responsible for acquisitions A major objective of acquisition planning is to promote and provide for full and open competition To ensure that the planning is accomplished in an effective economical and timely manner the agency should prepare an acquisition plan containing an overall strategy for managing the preaward acquisition and postaward phases An effective acquisition plan is critical to project success The plan sets out what the agency will do to complete a procurement and how it will do it The plan also specifies the type of contract that will be awarded how the agency will select a contractor cost and schedule goals milestones significant risk areas and contract management controls Auditors should assess the extent to which the agency s acquisition planning is realistic and comprehensive One part of this assessment should be the review of the Agency Procurement Request APR to ascertain whether it is complete and accurately reflects the objectives and scope of the project To verify that the agency has defined an effectiveAudit Objective strategy and plan for selecting a contractor and managing contract performance Acquisition plan and related documents as Documentation appropriate such as a plan of action and milestones

Solicitation Document A solicitation document provides information necessary for vendors to propose equipment software and services to meet the agency s requirements In most cases information resources will be purchased by issuing an RFP which forms the basis for the resulting contract Less commonly an agency may acquire information resources using an invitation for bids An RFP may be preceded by a request for information or request for quotation An RFP should be clear and comprehensive and include the elements described in GSA s guidance on standard solicitation documents 1 The areas of most interest to auditors include section C Description Specifications Work Statement section E Inspection and Acceptance and section M Evaluation Factors for Award Section C describes the tasks to be performed by the contractor and the products to be delivered Section E sets out government and contractor responsibilities in ensuring that contract deliverables are acceptable to the agency Section M explains how the agency intends to select a winning contractor by describing the importance of all factors to be considered in evaluating proposals In developing the RFP an agency may hold presolicitation or preproposal conferences in order to seek industry views on the planned acquisition and to encourage companies to offer proposals Once the RFP is developed it may be released in draft form in order to obtain industry questions and reactions Auditors should determine what steps the agency has taken to get feedback on its requirements how the agency has handled comments or questions on a proposed RFP and whether the agency has acted to ensure that contractor proposals are competitive 1See for example U S General Services Administration Information Resources Management Service Overview Guide Acquisition of Information Resources Jan 1990 A proper RFP is a critical element of a successful acquisition because it becomes part of the binding contract once a proposal is made and accepted If the RFP does not accurately and clearly describe the agency s requirements or if the evaluation factors do not accurately reflect the agency s priorities then the resulting acquisition may not meet user needs If the RFP is unjustifiably restrictive favoring one contractor over others the agency may be unable to benefit from full and open competition Auditors should become familiar with the standard format for an RFP The audit team should include persons sufficiently knowledgeable about the information technology being purchased to judge how well the agency has defined its requirements in the RFP Team members should include or have access to people who can identify areas where the RFP does not define the agency s needs well enough to protect the government s interests These persons should also know enough about performance or capability validation techniques to determine whether or not the agency s requirements are reasonable and effective Audit Objectives To determine whether or not the solicitation document is complete clear and consistent verify that requirements continue to reflect user needs and determine if the proposed evaluation process will result in an effective and economical acquisition Documentation Required Record of presolicitation or preproposal conference Solicitation document RFP or invitation for bid Draft RFPs and

definition of all deliverables and the conditions of their acceptability b A clear definition of government and contractor responsibilities c The relative importance of evaluation factors d A proposal format requiring that cost and technicalelements be separated e Reasonable provisions that protect the agency such as liquidated damages provisions or give incentives to the contractor such as bonuses for good performance Identify option clauses that create uncertainty in work load projections 2 Examine the evaluation criteria to ensure a They are consistent with the requirements analysis specifications and proposal preparation instructions b They provide all the factors and significantsubfactors to be considered in evaluating offers and the relative importance of different technical or cost factors in accordance with FAR 15 605 3 Evaluate the performance evaluation package theagency will use Determine whether the agency reimburses contractors for participating in benchmarking or other testing and whether the cost of such performance evaluation efforts constitutes a barrier to competition a If there is a benchmark has the benchmark been independently examined by some outside organization Review the benchmark plan to confirm that demonstration criteria are clearly stated Determine how the agency selected a representative mix of programs for the benchmark Determine if the complexity of programs in the benchmark is representative of the projected work load Determine how the agency validated the benchmark as representative of the agency s work load b If there is simulation or modeling determine how the agency selected parameters for the model Review any concerns or complaints raised by vendors c If a compute off demonstration of prototypes is to be used confirm that the agency has established plans for prototype and follow on contracts 4 Interview users and managers if necessary todetermine whether they concur with the solicitation Determine whether users or managers identify new or changed requirements not included in the RFP Find out if there are any factors considered important for selecting an offer that are not included in the Page 47 GAO

Technology A Model to Help Managers Decrease Acquisition Risks GAO IMTEC 8 1 6 August 1990 Phase III Chapter 10 Test and Acceptance Testing provides the basis for making decisions on whether to accept contract deliverables For testing to be effective it must be addressed relatively early in the acquisition so it can be properly included in planning Test plans provide testing procedures and the evaluation criteria to assess results of the testing An agency should establish its initial test plans in the presolicitation phase These plans should show how the agency will verify that the acquired equipment software or services meet user needs and satisfy security requirements After a contract is awarded the agency will need to carry out test and acceptance procedures The auditor should ensure that test planning is conducted early enough so that test requirements are included in the contract In assessing the postaward phase the auditor should ensure that the agency has not accepted equipment or software that does not meet its requirements The contract should specify conditions for acceptable performance For example the contract may require that a computer operate successfully for 30 consecutive days out of a 90 day test period Agency personnel should ensure that the contractor fully meets the conditions for acceptable performance Internal auditors may be required to verify that the equipment or software pass the specified tests Assessing the test and acceptance phase may require a high level of technical skill on the part of auditors such as when an agency has contracted for software development services and must test the quality of delivered software The auditor should be able to understand the system requirements development methodologies and test tools being used Page 60 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks To confirm that the agency has Audit Objectives 1 Fully defined its requirements for testing thetechnology to be purchased 2 Effectively

there been shortfalls Explain any variances and their effects Appendix II Management Metrics Purpose This appendix describes tools and techniques for measuring the status of acquisitions involving significant software development It describes techniques known as software metrics for quantitatively measuring how closely a project conforms to development plans and assessing whether an acquisition is at risk of delay or cost increases These techniques require considerable information about the system being developed and can only be used after system design The metrics described here will generally be used after contract award in order to assess how well the agency is managing the system development process Software metrics which use mathematical models to measure elements of the development process are intended to help organizations better understand and manage the relationships between resource decisions development schedules and the cost of software projects By using software metric tools an auditor can independently evaluate software development projects by analyzing project budgets requirements schedules and resources and then confirm or question cost schedule and resource estimates Different metrics may be useful for an audit depending on the objectives and status of an acquisition Using cost models to estimate the cost and length of time necessary to develop a new software system for example is appropriate only after requirements have been defined a system design has been developed and the size of the new system has been estimated The models described here require estimates of either the lines of code or number of function points that the new system will include Cost models project the time and cost to develop a system on the basis of estimates of the system s size and other pertinent factors They may be used before a solicitation for software development is Page 68 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks issued in order to assess the reasonableness of the agency s schedule if a system design has been prepared or after a contract has been awarded and software development has begun The other metrics described in this appendix require that system development work be underway A comparison of the actual number of functions successfully tested to the number planned in the acquisition schedule for example requires that system testing be underway Cost Models Cost models are tools that estimate the effort needed to develop software based on assumed relationships between the size of a system and the effort needed to design code and test the software These models can help the auditor assess whether the acquisition s estimated cost and schedule are reasonable Each model uses cost drivers which are parameters such as the level of experience of the programmers the reliability requirements of the programs and the complexity of the project along with the estimated project size to derive overall cost and schedule estimates for the acquisition When a system involving software is being developed one or more cost models may be useful A model will be more reliable if it takes into account the agency s historical experience in developing systems Cost models are available both commercially and from a few agencies within the Department of Defense Most of the tools were developed initially for use with Defense department projects but can also be used with non Defense systems Many are based on industry recognized models such as the Constructive Cost Model COCOMO PRICE Putnam and Jensen The commercial tools range in cost from about 500 to well over 20 000 Government developed or government modified tools are available free of Page 69 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks charge with a nominal charge for upgraded copies of the software Because many different packages are available and because more than one can be used auditors should determine what models if any are used in their agencies Typically cost models are derived using data gathered from years of experience with a wide range of software projects Therefore accuracy of predictions may improve as further experience is accumulated in an agency Auditors should use cost models to look for discrepancies with the cost and schedule estimates established for an acquisition By varying the estimated values for cost drivers the auditor may also be able to perform a sensitivity analysis illustrating where project estimates are most susceptible to change However cost models have significant limitations in accuracy unless their underlying assumptions of system size and cost drivers are carefully chosen and reflect the agency s previous experience in system development It is a matter of auditor judgment to decide how discrepant project estimates and estimates provided by cost models should be to raise concerns about risks of cost and schedule overruns In making this judgment the auditor should take into account the uncertainty of estimates and assumptions made in using a cost model Auditors should use a cost model to provide general estimates and not precise figures Therefore in applying software metrics to audit work care must be taken to follow generally accepted government auditing standards when drawing conclusions based on the results of software metrics Specifically all findings should be qualified by the recognition that these tools are limited by the accuracy of the Page 70 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks estimated system size and other project data provided for the model the historical data from which the model was developed and the fact that all estimates are projections of an inherently uncertain future Procedures for minimizing the effect of these limitations require for example proper technical advice qualifying language in audit reports and a review of data and assumptions by agency officials Auditors should also ensure that the model used is consistent with the software development methodology of the project under consideration A system developed through rapid prototyping for example should be evaluated with a model that takes prototyping into account The following indicators are intended to help auditors Other Indicators assess how effectively an agency is managing a system development contract These indicators measure differences between what an agency planned for its contractor to accomplish by certain points in the systems development life cycle and the actual results In most cases this comparison is most easily done graphically Using more than one indicator can give a broader picture of a project s status Auditors should use indicators appropriate to the project under review and for which data are available Problem Reports This indicator involves tracking the number of open and closed problems reported by a contractor as a system is developed A problem could be any anomaly discovered during design coding testing or implementation Problems are distinguished from failures of code which represent defects discovered during operation Contracts should specify how problems are to be identified and reported By reviewing these reports and noting how quickly Page 71 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks problems are resolved auditors can obtain an understanding of how well the contractor is performing The project manager or Contracting Officer s Technical Representative may be the best source for problem reports Because an agency may choose to prioritize problems in order of their impact the reports should distinguish between priority levels of problems Figure II 1 shows one way to present this kind of analysis It shows the number of new problems reported and the number of problems closed in order to show a trend over time and to show any backlog that may be developing The auditor may also choose to report total problems reported and resolved or break them out by level of priority Figure II 2 shows the length of time that problems have remained open in order to demonstrate how quickly software problems are resolved once found In this example three levels of priority are distinguished for reported problems Figure II 1 Problem Reports in Software Project Figure II 2 Problems by Priority Levels and Number of Months Unresolved Software Volatility Software volatility is also measured graphically Figure II 3 shows changes in the total number of approved system requirements Cumulative changes are also tracked including additions deletions and modifications to requirements Steady increases in the number of requirements and changes to requirements may indicate that the project is at risk for delays and cost overruns Figure II 3 Software Requirements Changes Development Progress This indicator involves the comparison of actual and expected progress in the design coding and integrating of system units Units can be measured in terms of computer software units or computer software configuration items If the project team does not complete its design or programming and testing activities as planned this indicator can show schedule delays before major milestones are reached The progress indicator can show all elements of design coding testing and integrating or it may treat them as separate indicators Figure II 4 shows how Page 75 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks planned and actual progress in the design and coding of software units can be displayed Figure II 4 Development Progress Software Size This indicator records changes in the expected magnitude of the software development effort The size of the system measured in source lines of code as established by the system design may change as the system is coded Changes in size can be expressed Page 76 GAO IMTEC 8 1 4 Assessing Acquisition Risks as total lines of code or can be broken out into new modified and reused lines of code Changes in the estimated system size may indicate that the project was overestimated or underestimated in size and complexity These changes may also indicate that requirements are changing and may be related to the software volatility issue described earlier Increasing estimates of software size should alert the auditor that the project s schedule and expected cost may be underestimated Changes in the expected system size may necessitate reestimates of the development cost using the cost models described earlier in this appendix Figure II 5 shows how the estimates of software size can be tracked over time Figure II 5 Software Size Estimates Personnel Stability Tracking the total number of people assigned to a system development effort compared to planned staffing levels provides another indicator of potential problems The auditor can examine projected versus actual levels of total personnel or of key experienced personnel Understaffing may result in schedule slippage Adding personnel late in a project can actually cause further slippage Other metrics may be chosen as needed Auditors could for example compare expected to actual usages of hardware resources in order to identify emerging computer capacity problems Another approach would involve tracking changes to the estimated completion date for a system The metrics described here offer suggestions to be tailored for use as appropriate to particular projects

appropriated funds of supplies or services including construction by and for the use of the federal government through purchase or lease whether the supplies or services are already in existence or must be created developed demonstrated and evaluated Acquisition begins at the point when agency needs are established and includes the description of requirements to satisfy agency needs solicitation and selection of sources award of contracts contract financing contract performance contract administration and those technical and management functions directly related to the process of fulfilling agency needs by contract Acquisition Planning The process by which the efforts of all personnel responsible for an acquisition are coordinated and integrated through a comprehensive plan for
