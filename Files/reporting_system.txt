 The LSC Matters Reporting System August 8 2002 Introduction Starting on July 1 2001 all LSC grantees began collecting information on non case activities using the Matters Reporting System LSC had long noted that grantee programs provide referrals and community legal education that they engage in outreach and that they work cooperatively with other groups to address the needs of the low income community We recognized that this work often entails a great deal of effort and produces significant results With the Matters Reporting System in place an important tool has been created for use by legal services leaders at the national state and local levels in describing the full scale and scope of legal services being delivered in communities across the nation Although the 2001 data reported in March of this year should be regarded as preliminary it covered only half a year and reflected the usual kinds of startup problems one would expect of a new data system it already has produced a wealth of information that allows the Corporation to provide a more complete picture of legal services practice than has ever before been possible on a nationwide basis For example we can already say that The total number of people being served annually by LSC grantees is several times the number of cases being reported on the Case Service Report CSR A conservative estimate of just the people receiving services that can be easily counted such as referrals and legal education presentations shows that more than two million people were provided with these services in the last six months of 2001 alone Many more were provided with other services using delivery vehicles whose reach is more difficult to quantify such as web sites weekly radio and TV shows and legal information columns in newspapers More than 75 percent of grantees are providing various forms of pro se assistance These include workshops courthouse help desks forms pleadings self help packets and other resources for self representation in simple legal matters In addition to providing an important service to people who cannot afford lawyers LSC grantees are playing a significant role in helping courts to deal with the flood of self represented litigants appearing in courtrooms across the nation Increasingly LSC grantees are important gatekeepers or hubs in referral networks of agencies and service providers serving low income people These are addressing a wide range of needs of the poor including access to jobs education shelter and personal safety Many LSC grantees operate intake systems that systematically diagnose each applicant s problems and make referrals through a network of legal and non legal service providers in the community who can provide the most appropriate types and levels of service With the implementation of the Matters Reporting System the Corporation has created an asset offering significant dividends for stakeholders at all levels of the civil justice system Along with the CSR system which quantifies case services the Matters Reporting System provides an expanded capacity to produce numerical and narrative data describing the full range of services provided by the core network of legal services programs serving communities across the nation With further refinements underway to improve reliability this system will enable program leaders at all levels to provide Congress client groups state legislatures bar leaders courts funders and other stakeholders with a more accurate picture of how many people are being served by LSC funded programs It will help to identify innovative best practice models that point the way toward more efficient and effective methods of addressing the legal needs of low income people It will inform LSC grantees about the range of methods being used by their fellow program managers to deliver more and better services and to assist people with the precise level and type of service appropriate to their legal situation It will enable leaders to do a better job of marketing legal services by telling the story of what LSC grantees are contributing to their communities through the partnerships they have created and the wide range of solutions they have put in place In the next section of this report we describe in more detail the picture that emerges from the 2001 Matters Service Reports In addition we outline some changes that the LSC Results Group a working group of senior LSC professionals plus Ken Smith an outside consultant that designed tested and is currently evaluating and refining a system for reporting matters services is considering for improving the reliability of the data obtained for 2002 and 2003 Overview of Matters Services Provided by LSC Grantees A More than two million people received significant Matters services from LSC grantees in the last half of 2001 This figure is conservative It only includes the counts that the LSC Results Group deemed reliable based on a review of the data and follow up interviews with a sample of grantees See Exhibit 1 for a summary of reliable versus soft numbers The actual number of people provided various non case services by LSC funded programs is almost certainly several times higher Refinements in the guidelines provided to grantees planned for distribution in October 2002 will provide more reliable figures to be generated covering 2002 and 2003 services B Matters services were of six types 1 Community legal education 195 LSC grantees 99 5 percent reported providing community legal education services to low income people in their communities According to matters reports by grantees in the second half of 2001 more than 1 450 000 people received these services Among the services delivered were the following Presentations at gatherings of low income people for example residents of a local senior center Legal education brochures distributed at community centers helping agencies and other community sites Legal education videos distributed through libraries courthouse kiosks public access TV and community sites Legal education materials downloaded over the Internet by people visiting web sites maintained by LSC grantees Community legal education is a crucial service provided by LSC grantees It informs low income people about their legal rights and responsibilities connected with various situations they might encounter as consumers tenants parents spouses employees and citizens It equips people to handle simple matters themselves reducing the strain on already overburdened courts and legal assistance programs It is preventative helping people to avoid mistakes that can lead to more serious legal problems and the need for representation in the future 2 Pro se assistance Legal services programs provide a broad range of generalized information and assistance to people wishing to handle simple legal matters themselves without extensive assistance from an attorney 150 LSC grantees reported that in 2001 they provided pro se assistance services They indicated that in the second half of 2001 more than 183 000 people were served The numbers of grantees providing different types of services were as follows Number of Grantees Self help workshops or clinics 89 Help desk at court 56 Self help materials posted on web sites 44 Other e g self help materials posted on kiosks 70 3 Referrals People come to legal aid offices with a wide range of problems some of them falling within the scope of the program s priorities and others that do not Referring people to other organizations that can help them is a crucial service that most legal aid programs provide Any referral which is not a case as defined by the CSR system can be counted as a matter Examples of matters referrals would be criminal matters or civil problems excluded under a grantee s priorities for example divorces not involving domestic violence or children In the second half of 2001 grantees reported providing matters referrals to 533 490 people The table below indicates the kinds of help to which these people were referred 4 Outreach LSC grantees seek to increase visibility in the client community in several situations for example when launching new services for example a toll free phone hotline trying to reach special needs populations the elderly homeless people families reaching the end of their eligibility period for welfare people in non English speaking communities or expanding services into hard to serve communities for example to small towns far from legal aid offices 89 percent of LSC grantees reported that they conducted outreach efforts in 2001 The method used most often by 61 percent of grantees was referral agreements with other agencies These are agreements made with other service providers such as domestic violence shelters to refer eligible clients to our grantees This is a very effective way of letting the public know we are there Other outreach methods used were informational notices printed in local media 53 percent TV spots or public service announcements 32 percent radio spots or announcements 39 percent newsletters of other organizations 44 percent how to reach us information on web sites 59 percent and other methods 49 percent Increasingly grantees are using targeted outreach methods rather than shotgun approaches like general media advertising These are designed to reach people specifically having critical legal needs addressed by special legal aid projects such as domestic violence clinics eviction prevention programs and disability advocacy units An example of targeted outreach is the posting of an advertisement for order of protection clinics in domestic violence shelters and family counseling agencies 5 Indirect services Number of Grantees 169 Some legal aid programs tap the significant resources of other community organizations in an effort to expand their reach They are doing this by providing legal training and support to non lawyer helping personnel such as social workers ministers teachers and shelter staff who apply this new knowledge to help their clients find appropriate legal information and advice when they have a legal problem One hundred sixty nine grantees reported they used such indirect service delivery models in 2001 This has a multiplier effect one lawyer trains 20 social workers each of whom helps 50 clients resulting in 1 000 people and families getting legal information materials or referrals they might otherwise not have had Applying this principle legal aid programs are beginning to form collaborations with other agencies to provide holistic solutions for complex problems such as domestic violence that raise other issues such as the need for income support health care and child care services Legal aid lawyers and paralegals increasingly are partnering with social workers medical people job counselors and other specialists to provide the right mix of legal and non legal services people need to get back on their feet 6 Other services In addition to the above there are a number of newer kinds of services that grantees reported as matters in 2001 These include the following Number of Grantees Mediation alternative dispute resolution 38 Other 58 In the last six months of 2001 LSC programs reported providing such other Matters services to over 49 000 people C Significance Matters services have major impacts on our communities courts and low income population Community legal education prevents small problems from getting worse and reduces the strain on our legal system Pro se assistance empowers people to help themselves and makes our court system work better Referrals help people find the help they need It is clear from the Matters Service Reports that LSC grantees have dramatically expanded the range of strategies available for addressing the legal needs of low income people The data collection system provides LSC with the capacity to track the expansion of these methods and to better describe their scale and impacts as this expansion continues The Matters data includes some people who were not eligible clients It is impractical to restrict grantees to counting only matters handled on behalf of client eligible people However we believe that the number is a small proportion of the total LSC grantees go to considerable lengths to focus services on the client eligible population In the first instance this is done by presenting the services as being for the poor including the targeting of outreach efforts on groups and areas in which poor people congregate and live The subject matter of written materials and of events for example legal education workshops is on issues of particular concern to our clients The sponsorship and location of events and location of grantee offices contributes to this targeting And where ineligible persons participate anyway the great majority of them are near poor often those who are eligible under non LSC funding programs such as IOLTA and Administration on Aging Even with web based services which are notoriously difficult to target exclusively to a particular segment there is some evidence that the majority of users are client eligible people For example web visitor survey data from Pinetree Legal Services in Maine indicates that two thirds of its site visitors are low income people or persons seeking information on behalf of low income people Implementation of the System A Status Report Planning for the matters service reports process was several months in the making In designing the instrument consultant Ken Smith and the LSC Results Group examined existing data collection models that state IOLTA funders and individual programs had used The group then drafted an instrument and pilot tested it with a volunteer group of 22 programs in January 2001 Their experience led to the version that was implemented in all LSC grantee programs in July 2001 What s working what issues need to be addressed The general concept of matters is working well The data system seems to have been well accepted by field programs The system includes a narrative component as well as statistical reporting providing the Corporation with a strong capacity for describing the character as well as the volume of services and delivery models in use The 2001 reports have enabled the LSC Results Group to identify adjustments for improving reliability of the numerical data being provided by grantees These include Clarification of definitions For example web hits were counted in the 2001 version of the system but this proved to be a vague concept that produced huge numbers but little useable information Definitions will be clarified for measures to be used in 2003 for quantifying the reach of web based legal education and pro se assistance models Additional questions Considering the difficulty of changing data collection systems in mid stream few changes are being considered that would require grantees to revise their forms or procedures However in a few areas small changes will be proposed that are relatively easy to implement For example in 2002 grantees will be asked to report the number of newspaper articles published rather than the number of people reached by newspaper articles which is nearly impossible to quantify in a useful way Improved guidelines For example more guidance will be provided to grantees on quantifying the numbers of brochures and materials packets they have distributed Clearer distinctions will be drawn between newsletter articles which are targeted to well defined audiences and newspaper articles which are broadcast to the general population Additional guidelines will be provided for estimating numbers that cannot be directly counted These changes are expected to lead to greater reliability in the matters data for 2002 and 2003 Some of the figures which grantees estimated in 2001 will be measured in 2002 as data collection systems become better established and guidelines get wider distribution to program staff Figures which the Results Group deemed too soft to be used in 2001 will eventually be moved to the reliable column Conclusion The data from the Matters Reporting System can be used for a variety of important purposes These include Producing materials that provide Congress bar leaders and other stakeholders with a more accurate picture of how many people are being served by LSC funded programs Describing the benefits that services such as community legal education pro se assistance and referrals to community agencies provide to the communities served by LSC grantees Identifying programs that have developed innovative best practice models pointing the way toward more efficient and effective methods of addressing the legal needs of low income people Informing grantees about the range of methods being used by their fellow program managers to deliver more and better services and to reach more people with the precise level and type of service appropriate to their legal situation Doing a better job of marketing legal services by telling the story of what LSC grantees are contributing to their communities through the partnerships they have created and the wide range of solutions they have put in place The Matters Reporting System represents an important asset now in place in LSC funded programs It will provide a stream of information about legal services practice serving the civil justice community well into the future
