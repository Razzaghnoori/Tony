                            There are at least  million acute cases of malaria each year globally resulting in        more than a million deaths Ninety percent of deaths due to malaria occur in Africa south        of the Sahara and most occur in young children Of the four types of human malaria        Plasmodium vivax          P malariae          P ovale  and         P falciparum         P falciparum malaria is most common in Africa and it accounts        for most of the extremely high mortality south of the Sahara        Malaria parasites are developing unacceptable levels of drug resistance and many        insecticides are no longer useful against mosquitoes transmitting the disease Vaccine        research has produced few hopeful candidates and although millions of dollars are poured        into research an effective vaccine is years away        One recurring theme in malaria vaccine research has been the high frequency of the gene        for sickle cell hemoglobin HbS in malaria endemic regions which is believed to be due to        a heterozygote HbAS advantage against fatal malaria The mechanism behind the high degree        of resistance conferred by HbAS in severe and complicated malaria is still unknown but        recent observations have suggested the mechanism might involve an immune component        In this months         PLoS Medicine  Thomas Williams and colleagues reason that the best way        to test whether malaria protection by HbAS has a significant immune component is to see        whether protection varies with age They studied the agespecific malaria pattern in         children and adults living in Kilifi District on the coast of Kenya They argued that if        the malaria protection provided by HbAS were innate it should be independent of malaria        exposure and remain constant with age However if immune mechanisms were involved        protection should increase with age until children become functionally immune when        additional immunological advantage should be lost        They found that overall HbAS was nearly  protective against mild clinical malaria        Protection varied with age increasing from  to  during the first ten years of life        and thereafter returning to  in children more than ten years old        The authors admit that this observation could be due to any factor that affects malaria        risk and varies with age but state that accelerated immune acquisition seems the most        likely explanation They suggest several mechanisms for how HbAS could accelerate immune        acquisition for example immunity could be mediated by accelerated acquisition of        antibodies to altered host antigens expressed on the parasiteinfected red cell        surface        In discussing their findings the authors point out that their study focused on mild        malaria For accelerated malariaspecific immunity to be relevant to HbAS selection it        would have to operate within a period of maximum risk for severe and fatal malaria They        note that in a recent study conducted by another group in western Kenya protection        against severe malaria by HbAS was only seen in children  months old but that in that        study no analysis was presented that addressed the effect of age within that range        The authors conclude that the relevance of their current observations on mild clinical        malaria to protection against severe and fatal malaria are unknown and that further work        must be done to better understand the role of HbAS in protection against malaria
