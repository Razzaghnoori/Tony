 Tape That Impeachment driven press lockstep is back with all the majors leading with the Senate s decision to admit into evidence not Monica live but Monica Memorex According to the coverage yesterday s Senate votes fixed the impeachment endgame and put the proceedings on course for a wrap up next week The end will guess the papers be an acquittal on both the perjury and obstruction counts with no finding of facts in lieu of a conviction but after the trial very possibly a resolution of censure The vote not to call Lewinsky in person note the papers was the first one in the proceedings that didn t follow party lines 25 Republicans voted on the winning side against the Republican House managers USA Today sees impeachment fatigue in the day s debate and the New York Times says there was little ardor or urgency in the speeches comparing the whole thing to a cooling souffl But the Times captures a flash of emotion here and there noting that one House manager said If one senator has failed to personally sit through this deposition and every deposition that senator is not equipped to render a verdict on the impeachment trial of the President of the United States And the Los Angeles Times reports that when the House managers asked for up to eight hours to question Lewinsky in the Senate chamber a clearly disgusted Sen Barbara Boxer reacted with an audible gasp The decision to allow the Lewinsky deposition tape into evidence for next week s phase of the trial was reached over the objections of the White House Both the Washington Post and NYT note that presidential counsel Gregory Craig argued in the Senate that the tape would add to the agony to the embarrassment and to the humiliation of the Clinton family The Post points out that the Senate vote on video admissibility contains a rider that excludes any statements made by the witnesses after the end of the direct response to the last question meaning that a statement by Jordan at the conclusion of his appearance and an apology offered to Lewinsky by a White House lawyer at the end of hers will not be disseminated The NYT lead editorial says the real action now is the behind the scenes negotiations among senators to arrive at a censure resolution Democratic senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Dianne Feinstein are shopping a draft that condemns President Clinton s actions as shameless reckless and indefensible The White House would go for that says the paper but the Republicans will rightly insist on language reflecting that Clinton knowingly lied under oath tampered with evidence and witnesses and attempted to interfere in the progress of a civil rights suit The LAT front features a piece summarizing the witness depositions At one point when Monica Lewinsky is asked if she thinks Bill Clinton is an intelligent man she replies I think he s an intelligent president At this remark the room full of attorneys congressmen and senators erupted into laughter And in his depo Vernon Jordan haughtily offered his version of the separation of powers doctrine I do not view the president as giving me instructions The Wall Street Journal reports that researchers have just

The Journal points out that the debacle is somewhat ironic in that the plane is supposed to be low end One glaring defect in the story it doesn t breathe a word about what problems are causing the
