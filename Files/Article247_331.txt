 Indis Hall of Fame We Have a Winner The editorial page of the Wall Street Journal today enters Chatterbox s Indis i e Intellectual Dishonesty Hall of Fame for its persistent refusal to make note in its coverage of Juanita Broaddrick s rape allegations that a key corroborating witness has a serious potential grudge against Bill Clinton Her father s murderer had his sentence commuted by one Gov Bill Clinton You will note that my piece reported four witnesses the Journal editorial page s Dorothy Rabinowitz writes Chatterbox today Er whoops that s right Previously Chatterbox had suggested that the existence of the additional witnesses had gone unreported until last week s NBC broadcast Chatterbox acknowledges and regrets this error These four witnesses told NBC they heard Broaddrick talk about the alleged rape around the time it allegedly occurred in 1978 Four witnesses is better than one and the number does diminish somewhat the significance of any potential grudge that may be held by one of them Or actually two of them Chatterbox will get to that in a bit Still the Journal editorial page should have mentioned the potential grudge if not in its initial story then in one of the two follow ups that have appeared since just as the Washington Post the New York Times and NBC News did in their more responsible coverage This might be a good moment to review Chatterbox s scoring procedure The Journal s editorial page scored one point for the original omission in its Feb 19 piece four points for the continued omission in two follow ups and six more points for every day of publication since the original offense That s eleven Ten gets you into the Indis Hall of Fame Twenty points gets you a faxed likeness of Joseph Stalin Incidentally in overlooking Rabinowitz s mention of the four witnesses Chatterbox also overlooked Rabinowitz s inaccurate description of them They i e NBC had four witnesses giving corroborating testimony citizens with nothing to gain italics mine and possibly much to lose by going public Rabinowitz wrote on Feb 19 Nothing to gain What about vengeance One of these witnesses was Norma Kelsey the woman whose father s murderer had his sentence commuted by Gov Clinton Kelsey is the only witness who allegedly saw Broaddrick on the day of the alleged rape and witnessed the bruised lip torn panty hose etc Another was Norma Kelsey s sister Based on what we know then only two of these citizens can really be said to have nothing to gain Anagram update William Tunstall Pedoe who maintains the Anagram Genius site and whose own name sounds like an anagram for something else informs Chatterbox that the author of the anagram praised in this space last week see Beyond God and Dog is one Martin Eiger Apparently Eiger published his discovery in the November 1998 edition of the National Puzzlers League s journal The Enigma As a tribute to Mr Eiger s achievement and to the distinguished reportage today ranked by Dorothy Rabinowitz and several other New York University judges as the 100 best works of 20 th century journalism Chatterbox offers the following anagrams for Harvest of Shame CBS s justly celebrated 1960 documentary on migrant workers anagrams courtesy of Anagram Genius Hash Fearsome TV Haves Hate Forms Oh Save the Farms Timothy Noah
