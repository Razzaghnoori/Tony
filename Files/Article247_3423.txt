 Provoking the Hosts ELLEN I ll be brief on this first one as I ve got a doctor s appt at 7 a m but I promise two more dispatches today you lucky old dog So you re just assuming a recession is around the corner So do I but I ve been saying that for several years In fact if the U S economy was in the turlet as Archie Bunker would say two years ago Clinton never would ve made it through his Lewinsky and I use her name as just a catchall for all his scandals which are too numerous to repeat travails The public which by and large cares more about its pocket than politics would ve said send the skunk to the showers And as a result Gore would be the front runner in the 2000 elections Explain to me re your second post yesterday how techno is interesting in a larger political sense I fell off the pop music train in the early 90s my nephew who s 11 knows all the new stuff just like I did when I was his age I gave him a copy of the Pogues Rum Sodomy the Lash when I was in Bermuda as an artifact of the 80s and one of my top five from that era and he thanked me but I bet he hasn t played it yet Let s be provocative What do you think of Slate There have been rumors that Microsoft is going to close it down just as their Sidewalk is crumbling I don t mean to be a drunk at the host s cocktail party but I have mixed feelings I think Michael Kinsley is an incredibly overrated editor and really belongs at the New York Times where his mediocre talents would fit right in But as a Web site Slate has its moments even though on a crummy computer like my year old laptop which means it s already obsolete it s very slow The links are valuable especially the transcripts of TV shows the Diary can be interesting and Jacob Weisberg who writes like he s 60 is fun to make fun of But Slate is far better than the amateurish Salon which I hear doesn t everybody is in trouble Slate is professional and is more like a print magazine obviously like the New Republic I was one of the few paid subscribers and would subscribe again just for the services One of my sons just woke up so I ve got to run I haven t shaved in a week so now I have the growth that Nixon did by 11 a m each day My boys want me to grow a beard I tell them it s not possible but I ll give it a try More later Best RUSS
