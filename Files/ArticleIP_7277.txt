 Drawing upon her rich experience of life Prudence Prudie to her friends responds to questions about manners personal relations politics and other subjects Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Queries should not exceed 200 words in length Please indicate how you wish your letter to be signed preferably including your location Dear Prudie My girlfriend is intelligent attractive and affectionate Maybe too affectionate When we re eating in public she likes to play footsie under the table That would be OK I enjoy playing footsie but she likes to tease me by digging her heel into my bare toes I usually wear sandals often when I m ordering She then watches me squirm to appear nonchalant in front of our server My question is this How do I gently ask her to play nice without hurting her feelings Ouch That Hurts Dear Ouch Without hurting her feelings It sounds to Prudie like your dominatrix friend is passive aggressive with only a tiny quotient of the passive Prudie does not like to be bossy but she strongly suggests you do the following since she divines you are not going to change your shoes Next time Miss Intelligent Attractive and Affectionate decides to stab you with her heel scream bloody murder and don t hold back You will attract momentary attention from the other diners but it will be worth it This maneuver is called sending her neurosis back to her If the darling girl asks why you have never hollered before simply tell her you were not interested in playing her games but now you are Prudie poetically Dearest Prudence How may a proper person handle the delicate matter of bad breath when happenstance forces one into consulting with someone on the boss staff I don t mean to be indelicate but retching was very close at hand when that person talked Prudie this vile odor was beyond belief Sincerely Dorothy S Shreveport La Dear Dor Prudie too has lived through this a few times What she has done is try to seem casual and arrange her hand so it covers her nose One wants to be helpful and alert the person but it is a very difficult thing to do If it is more than a passing acquaintance you might want to risk the person s embarrassment in order to be helpful with a remark something like I hope you don t take offense but I feel sure you would want to know that somehow your breath has turned sour or your lunch is lingering or whatever you are comfortable saying Granted it is easier to get away quickly and say nothing Prudie breathlessly Dear Prudie Recently you published a letter asking if you must use skills not in your job description just because you have them This is in fact a legal question In Virginia for an employee of a private company absent contractual provisions to the contrary the answer would be a resounding yes Not only can employers ask they can require it and if you refuse more than once to do something your employer has asked just because nobody put it in your job description you might even be denied unemployment benefits when they fire you In my experience employers tend to be relatively uninterested in people whining about what someone else should be doing In the case of the fellow who wrote I would give priority to my own work but help out to the extent that I could without neglecting my tasks It is generally safe to check what the boss wants This is not legal advice do not rely upon it If you have a problem seek the advice of an attorney usual disclaimers etc etc AEG Dear AE Thank you for your expertise about employment law at least in Virginia The wild card you may have overlooked is that our computer expert correspondent was not being asked by his boss to help everybody Instead co workers themselves were falling on his neck seeking help In addition to job description issues our writer was trying to determine where good guyness intersected with doormathood And you raise a pertinent point for Prudie She is not practicing either law or psychological counseling She is merely advising Slate readers who want an outside unbiased opinion from one of Mr Kinsley s minions Prudie nonprofessionally Dear Prudence I am a big fan of your column and generally speaking a supporter of the always leave em wanting more school of thought regarding product such as yours However while I am consistently impressed by the high quality of your responses I must admit I am somewhat underwhelmed by the quantity of your output Four letters once a week Or thereabouts That s it It s not as if you were being printed on a paper medium of limited dimension where space issues would be an important consideration In the realm of cybermedia you have unlimited space in which to work yet you limit yourself I ask that you consider expanding the scope of your pleasant palaver to the enrichment of us all After all Ann Landers and sister Abby give it to us daily with no diminution of quality or reader interest You are no less than they Sign me Wanting More in Rosamond Calif Dear Want You are kind to want to see All Prudie All the Time but Slate is a banquet table of offerings We would not want to overdose on the problems of Slate readers would we As for your reference to Ann Landers and her sister Prudie has particular regard for Ms Landers and delights in the observation of many that she resembles her though Prudie of course is somewhat younger Prudie appreciatively
