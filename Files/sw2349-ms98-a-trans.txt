 okay all right um i i understand that it s being proposed as a requirement for uh young people to be uh huh to go into public service i think yes all all young Americans they did not specify you know exactly what young means yeah yeah i think that it probably would be a a good program i think probably two years is too long i think maybe a year would be the the longest that yep yeah probably you re probably right yeah two years is might be a little too long yeah and you there will be a lot of rebellion in that and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place i don t think that they re gonna be serving anybody that s right that that would be the problem yeah so i think it would be a good thing though to encourage other people who aren t even aware that they can do such a thing sure would um hum um hum to get out there and do so yeah or maybe offer them you know some sort of an incentive to do it yeah uh you know college credit you know something you know i m not sure what but i right right college credit is a good idea because i m not sure they need to be you know paid you know a super do salary of any kind that that kind of takes away from public service right that s right yeah they probably couldn t do anything monetary but i think giving giving some kind of college credit but just you know to receive a letter in the mail that says you know you need to report somewhere by next Monday you know i m not sure that would be a terrifically good idea uh huh no i don t think so either because a lot of people um depending on how the public service programs are set up and i m not that that familiar with them to know i m not either really but you know if a lot of people flat can t afford to you know that and most kids these days have gotten themselves into um financial situations where they have to be working all the time that s right that s right uh huh that s right absolutely then you ll you ll so it s it s a really tough question young families whatever they just they just couldn t you know take off to do that that s right yeah and if you put them in public service right out of high school then that s that postpones their college for a year and that would upset a lot of people too because they just wanna get on only that s right um hum um hum sure would there would have to be a lot of you know thought given to something like that i would think yeah i you know i think it it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program but i i i think it can t be something that s mandatory it has to be something that s voluntary you know which is a pretty much the way it is now they might um hum yep yep that s right i m not even really sure this point in time you know what what programs are out there yeah and that s the other thing is that you know instead of making it mandatory they maybe maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and um hum um hum do programs and tell them that we need your help and you know uh uh volunteer for such and such a time and you you have a choice of where you wanna go and and and that way handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it um hum um hum yeah yeah like maybe if if there was something you know they could do in their own own you know their own town or city yeah in their own community right yeah and not to have to pull up roots and you know and go somewhere half way around the world or something yeah that s true most of them probably wouldn t do something like that although there are a lot of kids who would do it just to get away from their parents that s right yeah that s that s true too that s true too but but they would have to be supportive in some way and i m not sure those those programs are available to do that yeah yeah me either and you you wonder you know what kind of quality job would they do you know right just sit around for their year or would they really you know make a contribution of some kind right exactly that s yep it s tough it s tough yeah it is tough it s and and i don t know who s even proposing it or or how they plan on implementing it if they do yeah yeah i m i m not sure either but i think there would have to be a lot more you know information uh you know disseminated before you say let s do this you know yeah yeah i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them you know it d be it it wouldn t take up much much it would take up more time than anything but it wouldn t take up a lot of money they wouldn t have to spend money advertising and things like that yeah um hum yeah yep that s right you go to school and you have a kind of a captive audience you get them all in the auditorium and you you know give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something and um hum yeah um hum and i think that they could get some results from that because there are a lot of people who are volunteer and community minded but they don t know where to go to to to do anything yeah um hum that s right yeah that s a real waste too it really is yeah it is it really is i don t really see the emphasis on things like Peace Corps like we you know we saw back i guess in the Carter administration that was that was a big thing with him right yeah yeah and i guess even back to Kennedy as a matter of fact i guess Kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing or was it you know really interested in things like that uh huh but i just don t hear much about it anymore like i say i don t even know what programs are are even ongoing now you know i don t either that s what anyway it s a tough question really is you know yeah it is a tough question okay well thanks for your time enjoyed talking to you okay take care bye bye sure same here take you too bye bye
