 Big Bang Theology Did God cause the big bang That is what half a dozen new books about science and religion whose authors range from a Reagan administration official to an Israeli physicist to an elementary particle theorist turned Anglican priest are saying The fact that the universe abruptly exploded into existence out of apparent nothingness some 15 billion years ago they submit means it must have had a supernatural creator A couple of months ago the same claim was enthusiastically aired at a Washington conference sponsored by the Ethics and Public Policy Center under the rubric Beyond the Death of God with eminent thinkers such as Fred Barnes Mona Charen and Elliott Abrams in attendance And the idea received a sympathetic hearing on William F Buckley s show Firing Line a few weeks ago The idea that only God could have caused the big bang is scarcely new In fact the big bang is probably the only idea in the history of science that was ever resisted because of its pro God import For much of the modern era scientists followed Nicolaus Copernicus Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton in believing the cosmos to be eternal and unchanging But in 1917 when Albert Einstein applied his theory of relativity to space time as a whole his equations implied that the universe could not be static it must be either expanding or contracting This struck Einstein as grotesque so he added to his theory a fiddle factor called the cosmological constant that eliminated the implication and held the universe still It was an ordained priest who took relativity to its logical conclusion In 1927 Georges Lema tre of the University of Louvain in Belgium worked out an expanding model of the universe Reasoning backward he proposed that at some definite point in the past it must have originated from a primeval atom of infinitely concentrated energy Two years later Lema tre s model was confirmed by the American astronomer Edwin Hubble who had observed that the galaxies everywhere around us were receding Both theory and empirical evidence pointed to the same verdict The universe had an abrupt beginning in time Churchmen rejoiced Proof of the biblical account of creation had dropped into their laps Pope Pius XII opening a conference at the Vatican in 1951 declared that this scientific theory of cosmic origins bore witness to that primordial Fiat lux uttered at the moment when along with matter there burst forth from nothing a sea of light and radiation Hence creation took place in time therefore there is a creator therefore God exists Marxists meanwhile gnashed their teeth Quite aside from its religious aura the new theory contradicted their belief in the infinity and eternity of matter one of the axioms of Lenin s dialectical materialism and was accordingly dismissed as idealistic The Marxist physicist David Bohm rebuked the developers of the theory as scientists who effectively turn traitor to science and discard scientific facts to reach conclusions that are convenient to the Catholic Church Atheists of a non Marxist stripe were also recalcitrant Some younger scientists were so upset by these theological trends that they resolved simply to block their cosmological source commented the German astronomer Otto Heckmann a prominent investigator of cosmic expansion The dean of the profession Sir Arthur Eddington wrote The notion of a beginning is repugnant to me I simply do not believe that the present order of things started off with a bang The expanding Universe is preposterous incredible it leaves me cold Even some believing scientists were troubled The cosmologist Sir Fred Hoyle simply felt that an explosion was an undignified way for the world to begin rather like a party girl jumping out of a cake In a BBC interview in the 1950s Hoyle sardonically referred to the hypothesized origin as the big bang The term stuck Einstein overcame his metaphysical scruples about the big bang not long before his death in 1955 referring to his earlier attempt to dodge it by an ad hoc theoretical device as the greatest blunder of my career As for Hoyle and the rest of the skeptics they were finally won over in 1965 when two scientists at Bell Labs in New Jersey accidentally detected a pervasive microwave hiss that turned out to be the echo of the big bang at first they thought it was caused by pigeon droppings on their antenna If you turn on your television and tune it between stations about 10 percent of that black and white speckled static you see is caused by photons left over from the cosmogonic event What greater proof of the reality of the big bang you can watch it on television Since the 60s scientists have been busy working out and feuding over the details of the big bang cosmology But God is not in the details his existence is deducible from the mere fact that there is a world at all So goes the cosmological argument one of the three traditional arguments toward a Supreme Being Click to read the ontological argument and the teleological argument The reasoning starts off like this 1 Everything that begins to exist has a cause of its existence 2 The universe began to exist 3 Therefore the universe has a cause of its existence Click to learn more about the surprising Islamic origins of this argument and what Ludwig Wittgenstein had to say about it There are many options for attacking the logic of this cosmological argument and contemporary opponents of theism have tried them all If everything needs a cause for its existence then so does God More frequently heard in the form But Mummy who made God This objection fails because it gets Premise 1 wrong The premise does not say that everything needs a cause but that everything that begins to exist does God never began to exist he is eternal So he does not need a cause for his existence Maybe the universe had a natural cause But the big bang could not have been caused by prior physical processes That is because it began with pointlike singularity which according to relativity theory is not a thing but a boundary or an edge in time Since no causal lines can be extended through it the cause of the big bang must transcend the physical world Well then perhaps it had no cause at all It is hard to think of a principle more amply confirmed by our experience than that things do not just pop into existence uncaused No one can really pull a rabbit out of a hat Ex nihilo nihil fit Yet something of the sort does seem to happen in the quantum world where owing to Heisenberg s uncertainty principle tiny virtual particles spontaneously appear and disappear all the time An entire universe could do the same claim some cosmologists Calling themselves nothing theorists they have produced models showing how the cosmos could have burst into being all by itself out of a patch of false vacuum or a 3 D geometry of zero volume or in the case of Alexander Vilenkin of Tufts University literally nothing at all this took Vilenkin four pages of math So the universe is summoned out of the void by the laws of physics But this can t be right The laws of physics are just a set of equations a mathematical pattern They cannot cause the world to exist As Stephen Hawking has written A scientific theory exists only in our minds and does not have any other reality whatever that might mean Just because the universe is temporally finite does not mean it had a beginning Speaking of Hawking this is his famous no boundary proposal So long as the universe had a beginning we could suppose it had a creator Hawking wrote in A Brief History of Time But if the universe is completely self contained having no boundary or edge it would have neither beginning or end it would simply be What place then for a creator In Hawking s quantum cosmology the pointlike singularity of the big bang is replaced by a smooth hemisphere in which space and time are commingled Time zero becomes an arbitrary point not a true beginning it is no more a boundary than the North Pole is Hawking s proposal is extremely popular with laymen who are hostile to the cosmological argument judging from the mail I get Apparently they enjoy being baffled by imaginary time a theoretical fiction Hawking uses to redescribe the big bang so that there is no beginning In real time there still is a beginning Sometimes Hawking says that imaginary time is earlier than real time which is a logical contradiction sometimes he suggests it might be more real than real time which is an absurdity OK so the universe had a beginning and hence a First Cause which is moreover transcendent How does it follow that this cause is God or even God like Now there is an acute question Philosopher Thomas Nagel has suggested that something humanly inconceivable lies behind the big bang What if anything can really be inferred about the First Cause Well suppose that it were something mechanical An ideal machine produces its effect either always or never it does not just suddenly start to operate at some moment unless someone gives it a kick If a mechanical cause produced the universe at time T there is no reason it should not have done so at time T minus 1 The argument can be repeated to T minus infinity A mechanical cause would have either produced the universe from eternity or not at all But the universe was created at one moment out of an infinity of other indistinguishable moments This implies that the moment was freely chosen and hence that the creator had a will and to that extent a personal nature And power Yet the big bang cosmology has one unwelcome consequence for theists It seems to suggest that the Creator was a bungler A singularity is inherently lawless Anything at all can come out of one It is exceedingly unlikely that a big bang singularity should give rise to a universe whose conditions are precisely suitable for life let alone the best of all possible worlds As the American philosopher Quentin Smith has pointed out If God created the universe with the aim of making it animate it is illogical that he would have created as its first state something whose natural evolution would lead with high probability only to inanimate states The only way God could have ensured the appearance of creatures in his own image was by repeatedly intervening and making adjustments to steer the evolution of the world away from lifeless disaster But a competent Creator does not create things he immediately or subsequently needs to set aright observes Smith Remember we are talking about the universe s physical infrastructure not sinners with free will So did God cause the big bang Overcome by metaphysical lassitude I finally reach over to my bookshelf for The Devil s Bible Turning to Genesis I read In the beginning there was nothing And God said Let there be light And there was still nothing but now you could see it
