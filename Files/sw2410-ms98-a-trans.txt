 okay my views it asked for my views so my views on that are yes i do still consider them a threat uh huh really and yes i do and the reason i do is because um i ve with uh Gorbachev was raised and his mentor was i because it was Nikita Khrushchev i believe i know it was one of the old old school Russian and uh he he is a definite he is a Marxist Leninist communist through and through uh huh uh huh and Marxist Leninist communism is a threat to the United States because um the whole nature of it is to control the world the the whole goal of the Marxist Leninist theology is world domination uh huh and i do not believe that it has not they ve never stated that their goal is not to you know take over the world and they ve never repented of all the massacres all the just the you know the hundreds of thousands of uh massacres they ve killed more Jews oh yeah and all this and so no i don t trust them a bit i think it s a big scam think so yes i do i yes i would all but say i know it s a scam you can t trust him he was the head of the KGB for years was he yes he was for many many years he was trained in the old school of Lenin theology and he he s never changed any of his any of the he he deals in that kind of theology he s you know he might say one thing but what he does is Marxist and Leninist in nature and so uh huh and so that s why the Russians are so angry with him right now is because they ve they know it s a scam and so you know i that s what i feel i don t know what do you feel do you agree with me or disagree uh huh yeah um you know it s it s hard to say uh if if things change uh change there so rapidly but uh Gorbachev Gorbachev Gorbachev is i don t know i think i think you you re right he s a chameleon he s just a he s he he s just he seems to have flip flopped on you know uh uh you know when they first came into power when uh President Reagan was in he was this real nice guy and he was uh huh trying to uh win everybody in the West over about what oh what a great reformer he was and all this other stuff but then you know now he s uh know now he s uh you know crushing the uh demonstrations and and and trying to close close it off again so i i i can t figure i can t figure him out i don t know if he s being pressured from right uh above or around or uh from other places in in well if he got out of line too much from the old school they d just knock him off i mean they re not going they re not going to permit anyone in that Russian Parliament to get in power that s going to change anything too much so yeah that their people are starving i mean they cannot right they ve got to know that something s got to give because they re in their society you re not at you know it s supposed to be all for one and one for all but that ain t how it works baby i mean that s you know they re not going to do something unless they ve got incentives and they don t have any incentives to work uh huh no because they ve taken them from the people because the Marxist Leninist theology is to i mean it really is its own religion it it could be classified in theological terms as a religion because it is uh huh but they deny God self is everything self you know everything is um for me for me for me and therefore or for the for the people for the people which means everybody else except you right but that s not what they really do they say that but that s not the reality of it even the Bolshevik revolution the whole thing was uh yeah an attempt to uh gain authority without you know having to be risen up in authority the best way to get Godly authority is to you know work and and work your way to the you know work your way up not being promoted by man because promotion comes from God uh huh yeah but when you anytime you see a nation go in and just overtake it and it s take it take authority take control it s a i believe it s a spiritual yeah thing that happens and it s like a spirit of witchcraft it s like a a bad spirit goes over that nation because you have these people that want they re power hungry uh huh and they want all this power and they want to control all these people and it s not for the people it s for themselves and the way you know that is because they didn t work their way up from the bottom up they went in and they took power and they took authority and they uh huh took authority and they cut and they stab and and our nation does that a lot too i know it s not necessarily i don t think this is the greatest system either but i just feel like there s just a lot of oppression over the Soviet Union because of that the authority is there to exalt self that s the whole Leninist theology they deny God they deny any creator they ve yeah forbade religion for years and years and God s the one that opened the doors for their religion for for Christianity to go in Russia it s not it s not Gorbachev he will not receive the credit for that because one man uh huh saying that could not have done anything God had to open those doors and i believe that the the pressure just got so great from the people yeah uh huh because that they you know they God just honored their prayers and did a miracle because i don t know we our pastor went to Russia and we work with a lot of churches in Minsk and in Belev Russia and some other places and so i don t know i have a real heart for Russia that s why i think it s funny we got this call because i have a good friend my one of my best friends is going into into the underground church cause it uh huh basically it s still underground it oh yeah and so they re going in a mission trip into Latvia in about six months and so they re preparing for the trip you know and and it was i sat behind her Sunday and they had their Russia team folder so i thought oh that s cool so anyway so this is kind of one of my little pet babies but anyway i don t know i just yeah i think they want a one world order that s what i think i think Gorbachev would like to see a one world order a one world economic community and a one world government with him in charge of it and Bush is going around talking about it too yeah and it s like all these pawns on this chess big all these players on this big chess game you know and it s a world championship and who is ultimately going to get the power who s going to get put in checkmate and who s going to be ruled out of the game yeah and who s going to have the power over what they want to establish in this one world you know community they re always talking about it all the time oh yeah you hear a lot about it yeah but it it s all that it s it s all that uh the new age philosophy and um uh huh are you a Christian you must be to know new age yes oh yes oh yes i know all about the new age philosophy yeah and uh it s yeah right but they are in such disarray over there they re not in any position to exalt exert themselves over anybody right now like they were uh huh uh huh i mean with Eastern Europe falling apart and their whole economic system falling apart they can that that we need to take real advantage of that uh huh uh huh yeah to to pull their satellites away from them but yeah i think that they still are a threat but yet maybe a different ki nd of a threat than a military threat but i do believe that they re a military threat i think yeah just look what we did to Iraq well it was with Russian were they fought us with Russian weapons and they ve they found out the hard way how bad badly put together the Russian weapons are right uh huh that s true yeah that s true they did didn t they i know it s it s interesting i still wouldn t want to take them on though i still wouldn t want to take them i still think we need to be very careful but i believe that their economic or an economic threat more than anything at this point because they want control over the i know they want control over the European economic community and that you know that s why i see them diversifying their their power and their control that they have oh yeah oh yeah uh huh and like for you know instead of just being oh big tough Russia but i still believe they ve uh they ve probably got weapons we can i mean they they never would sell to anybody else yeah oh of course you know so i guess i feel like yeah they probably i wouldn t want to mess with them but i don t trust them i m not all like oh yeah they re just like us i i have a heart for the people of Russia no no no no not not not for the leaders definitely not for the leaders no i wouldn t be surprised if Gorbachev wasn t a satanist wasn t a satanist i m not kidding well they re they re they re a secret they re a secret society they re a secretive society right even yeah you know and they re not going to let you see what they don t want you to see exactly even you know in our own country i mean Bush was in the scull and bones the Trilateral Commission and all these groups with ulterior motives and so it s like what on earth is you know are these people ever here and involved in um in the high ranking things i mean when you look at their history and what they ve done to their own people what they ve done it s like yeah yeah man can we trust them have they repented for what they did have they made a world apology no they haven t we we repented this was wrong we re going to start seeking God and we re going to start seeing God to do for our nation what needs to be done and even Bush will call a national day of prayer is Bush saved i don t know God knows he says he is and i m going to trust that with him but i mean it s just no i don t trust them yeah no you d be crazy if you trust them but anyway call it what is it McCarthyism no i m not like that i just got enough common sense that nope to you come repent make a world apology for all the wrongs that you ve done and yeah we ve done wrongs but we ve not done near the atrocities they ve done and we need to maybe do that also you know uh huh you know i m saying i m not saying like oh America we re so we re perfect over here i m not saying that either but that s not what the question asked so boy i could preach uh huh
