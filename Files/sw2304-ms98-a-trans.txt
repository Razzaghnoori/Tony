wonderful beef parts of beef cooked and barbecued and it s marvelous uh i have yeah yeah and then i have to find a place around here that has that well they have one in uh they have an Argentinean place down in Georgetown okay i ll keep that in mind yeah you serve that yourself or the for a family so um uh excuse me you ever serve that yourself when you have company oh no well see what happens

thirteen nineteen twelve nineteen thirteen at at one point one third of the population of Argentina was Italian like pure Italians yeah well i ll tell you it s interesting because when we cook here i m of Italian descent my husband is Chinese okay so we and we both love European Continental cooking French cooking so we cook uh our meals are well we don t do we don t usually mix i mean that s well sometimes well if we re entertaining we ll do a Chinese recipe okay right right and um there are really easy recipe that is you know with Chinese you always have several dishes yeah and nowadays with microwaves you can steam many of the things in a microwave i don t know if you have one yeah yeah and if you like Chinese food you can take filet of fish and put a little bit of soy sauce and a little bit of sesame oil on top of it okay okay and chop some scallions and a little ginger okay and just cover it with some uh waxed paper and steam it just until the fish is done and it s a wonderful is it um flavorful piece of fish yeah because i was uh you know it s like when when you go buy fish you know like well like i buy like the fish that you can do in the microwave you know the breaded fish and you know i ve seen you know the filet um hum um hum yeah buy a fresh filet of fish a nice one at the fish market uh the fish counter what kind of fish um uh any white fish sole is good um um flounder sole or flounder is real good okay so we put soy sauce and sesame and even grouper little bit of soy sauce and sesame sesame seed oil okay and not too much soy sauce uh some chopped up scallions um you know slivers of scallions okay and slivers of ginger and then just cover it and put it in the microwave for just just two say two minutes check it after two minutes to see if the fish flakes and if the fish flakes it s done don t overcook it though okay because i got i got um one of those little uh microwaves the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water yeah well till you just check it you know during and another quick dish if you like um if do you know what hoi sin sauce is it s that sweet Chinese sauce yeah no i don t well if you go in a Chinese store ask for hoi sin H O I S I N wait wait wait H wait ah H O I H O I S I N or S E N either way they ll spell it hoi sin sauce it s a very sweet dark sort of a purplish plum sauce purplish brown S I N okay and if you take uh little pieces of pork and you fry them like little cubes of pork okay and you fry them with garlic and a little bit of couple dashes of hot pepper okay and then mix some hoi sin sauce with sherry just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce okay that you can serve over rice how how much uh how much uh how much pork do you buy for two people um well for two people um American uh if it s American style i d buy a half a pound if you know we if you re just serving that but if you re serving another dish with it say the rice dish right um well with guys pretty healthy appetite i d probably go a third of a pound and then you know you could yeah i could i could probably go half a pound and you can always you can always heat it up again and save you know so but there s there s just since i m from Argentina i just love meat and we just yeah you can also do the same thing using um if you have ground beef just stir fry the ground beef drain off the oil use the same hoi sin sauce and um some of the frozen mixed vegetables okay okay just stir that in and you ve got a very colorful side another dish and how much does it cost um the hoi sin sauce oh a dollar twenty nine a can a can would serve would serve you for you know for quite a few um meals yeah oh okay yeah okay i thought it
