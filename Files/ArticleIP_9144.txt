 The Back of Virtues During the past year public opinion about Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr s investigation of President Clinton has polarized into two schools The right holds that Starr has valiantly defended justice and the rule of law against a scoundrel president The left dismisses Starr as a duplicitous right wing assassin bent on destroying a president who serves the people It took Starr months to discredit the first school It took him a single day to disprove the second It s impossible to dismiss Starr s testimony before the House Judiciary Committee as the performance of a villain Through hours of hectoring cheap shots and generally ill mannered behavior from the committee s Democrats Starr kept his composure and courtesy He absorbed the questions seriously answered them in a straightforward manner and offered clear explanations for nearly every aspect of his conduct that was brought into question He seemed honest kind thoughtful and fair a perfect independent counsel And yet Starr s investigation has been a moral disaster the equivalent of a high speed chase in which an armada of police cruisers crumples dozens of cars and injures scores of pedestrians in pursuit of a rowdy teen ager Gazing back at the wreckage the interesting question is not the crude choice posed on political chat shows Ken Starr Hero or Villain but the subtler mystery more often explored in novels How did such a good person do such bad things How does virtue become vice Starr s essential virtues are his dedication to the truth his respect for the law and his solid moral convictions When Clinton speaks he looks like a confidence man trying to figure out which line to feed you When Starr speaks he looks like a man with nothing to hide If I were Clinton s lawyer I d never let him take a polygraph test If I were Starr s lawyer I d pay for one For nearly a year Starr has searched doggedly for the truth about the Monica Lewinsky affair while Clinton and his henchmen have obstructed him What we ve learned from this search is that Clinton had a shameful affair with an intern and covered it up but also that the truth wasn t worth the search In pursuit of the truth Starr s agents wired Linda Tripp to record her young friend They confronted Lewinsky told her she could go to jail and suggested she would be unwise to call her lawyer or her mother Starr tried to make a bookstore cough up records of her purchases He sought to abridge the attorney client privilege by commanding Vince Foster s lawyer to divulge what Foster had told the lawyer before committing suicide He compelled Secret Service agents to testify about the president s trysts Starr s hunt for the truth trampled privacy loyalty and security At last week s hearing he conceded that his agents had investigated whether an unhelpful witness might be obliged legally to give up her adopted child My investigators work very hard and diligently to find relevant evidence Starr offered Starr saw the black and white of truth and falsehood but not the spectrum in between He accused Clinton of perjury a felony in part for playing silly word games in his grand jury testimony Never mind that Clinton had confessed to the essential points that he had engaged in an inappropriate relationship with Lewinsky and had tried to hide it from Paula Jones lawyers Convinced there could be only one truth Starr overlooked others He failed to see how what looked to him like a conspiracy to silence a witness in a sexual harassment case could look to the participants like a slapdash scheme to hush up an affair And his report presented sexual truths that serve no decent purpose Starr s confidence that he was obeying the law insulated him from examining his behavior in moral terms Pressuring Lewinsky to secretly tape record Clinton Vernon Jordan and Betty Currie was distasteful but legal so Starr s agents did it This is all traditional prosecutorial activity Starr asserted at the hearing Forcing Secret Service agents to testify about the president s sex life was indecent and reckless but constitutional so Starr did it And leaking to or as Starr put it briefing reporters about the case on condition of anonymity was sneaky and unfair but Starr decided it was OK because it was legally defensible When Clinton s lawyer David Kendall challenged the propriety of these briefings Starr dismissively replied You re asking about press policy as opposed to constitutional issues By all accounts Starr is a man of firm convictions But firm convictions also inhibit doubt self criticism and learning The moral confidence that kept Starr admirably untroubled in the face of partisan insults during his testimony left him equally untroubled by his own genuine errors Should he have quit the Whitewater investigation after temporarily accepting a job at a university funded by a notorious Clinton hater Gosh no So pure was Starr s heart that he hadn t realized it would look bad Later when he sought approval to investigate the Lewinsky affair should he have disclosed that his law firm had been contacted to represent Jones and that he had spoken to Jones attorneys several times about constitutional aspects of their case It just did not occur to me Starr candidly told the committee Should he have disclosed months ago that he had found no evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton in the FBI files matter Golly said Starr he hadn t thought it was necessary to say so Where Clinton invokes false subjectivity It depends on what the meaning of the word is is Starr invokes false objectivity His favorite cloak is professionalism Confronted with questions about the loaded language of his report Starr told the committee it was a professional product Unable to distinguish his ego from his credo he accused Clinton of obstructing justice by asserting executive privilege against Starr s investigation It s our professional judgment that the president engaged in abuse of his authority by so doing Starr testified Given that Starr and his professionals were right anyone who saw things differently was wrong When Lewinsky s lawyer suggested that Starr s agents had detained his client improperly Starr issued an equally one sided press release portraying the encounter as a joint shopping and dining excursion I felt duty bound to provide public information that I thought was appropriate Starr testified Likewise his team often briefed reporters on background because we have the duty to engage in a proper public information function particularly to combat misinformation When Kendall asked why Starr s team conducted these briefings on background rather than on the record Starr explained We do not want to in any way be part of the story It wasn t necessary to disclose that the information had come from Starr s office since his office was above reproach Starr s critics think these excesses and failures make him a bad man But this inference oversimplifies Starr just as he oversimplified the scandal If conservatives are wrong to preach that the lesson of the year was the unraveling of a morally bankrupt president liberals are equally wrong to preach that the lesson was the unraveling of a morally bankrupt prosecutor Starr s failures stemmed not from evil but from errant good That lesson won t suit either side s assumptions But then that s the point of lessons There is another side to this paradox Just as Starr s virtues turned vicious Clinton s vices sometimes turn virtuous Lacking Starr s faith in absolute truth Clinton sees every side of every issue That s how he absorbed and finessed Israeli and Palestinian demands in the Middle East peace process Lacking Starr s confidence in the law Clinton sees where the law is too blunt an instrument to honor and promote good values That s why his views on abortion and homosexuality emphasize religious belief and personal responsibility rather than legislative prohibition Lacking Starr s moral certitude Clinton recognizes his own worst instincts and is capable of transcending them That s why he resisted the temptation to bomb Iraq Nov 14 when the political case for it was open and shut but the moral case was dubious To heed the better angels of your nature you must know the devils first
