 Same As the Old Rock Dear Chris It s a strange rock history indeed whose pivotal chapter concerns David Bowie but here you have it In Bowie s failure to sell big in the States James Miller isolates what I suspect is the real tragedy in his own critical life Bowie s failure was he writes an early indication that global youth culture created by the Beatles and ratified at the Monterey Pop Festival was already beginning to fall apart What Miller really seems to lament more than the hype silliness or commercialization of rock is the death of monoculture Earlier in the book he describes the global impact of Sgt Pepper when you could hear it wafting out of cars and cafes from Los Angeles to London from Paris to Madrid with the wistfulness of an old Catholic rhapsodizing the Latin mass Then again who can blame him Covering a record that the London Times cultural critic called a decisive moment in the history of Western civilization must have been a heady enterprise indeed especially if you bought the hype Rock criticism must have seemed fresher more important and probably easier then Yes new sounds can really ruin critical paradigms Show me someone like Marilyn Manson and I ll say OK Miller s right Rock is a finished cultural form a more or less fixed repertoire of sounds and styles and patterns of behavior But show me someone like the Wu Tang Clan whom Miller groups with Manson as musically crude gleefully obscene and just plain silly as well as the triumph of the psychopathic adolescent and I think Miller s simply not listening Classifying Wu Tang s strange chilly beats and glass aesthetic along with trance house and trip hop as simply new forms of rock requires either some impressive semantic gymnastics or deafness I have to mistrust someone who while bemoaning the bland repetitiveness of current rock concedes that occasionally new groups do catch his ear like En Vogue Queen Latifah and the Cardigans The Cardigans Still the stars have aligned to give Miller a nice context for his book tour We are after all in the age of Puffy Combs Limp Bizkit and that life affirming spectacle that was Woodstock 99 Flowers in the Port a San Given the last Miller s snapshots of the riots that accompanied Moondog s 1952 Coronation Ball and the early screenings of Blackboard Jungle seem judiciously chosen I m also glad a rock fan feels obliged to recognize the real life chaos and violence in rock unapolegetically even a bit joyfully closing with the image of 15 year old John Lennon at a Liverpool movie theater disappointed that there wasn t a riot What I like about the early chapters is Miller s idea of rock s serendipitousness the idea that jokes studio tricks and technical accidents created a new pop form That and the way youthful twitchiness and uncertainty from an uncomfortably pandering Ruth Brown to an amateurish Frankie Lymon to a jittery Elvis Presley formed a new musical vocabulary These kinds of unorthodox responses to rock s creation myth were fresh enough to make me expect more from the later chapters than a gloss on punk as simply rock s quintessence of stunning ugliness Man Miller s writing sure is uneven isn t it When he s in teen spirit mode he ll lapse into bodice ripper isms like These records touched me in ways that I d never been touched before And when he s trying some Greil Marcus y fabulism he ll resort to a scene setting device like As the sun rose in the East Hard to believe the same guy wrote those gorgeous meditations on Marvin Gaye and Strawberry Fields But I liked the sweep I enjoyed the flashback Nicholas Roeg approach Miller took to this overtold narrative and actually I bought a lot of his seemingly perverse omissions including Woodstock I certainly don t need to hear this fetishized event described again and I respect his choice of Altamont as the more relevant chapter in rock s dark lineage The chapters that bored me most were the retreads like the Springsteen chapter which basically condensed Fred Goodman s Mansion on the Hill and the Grateful Dead genesis which seemed ancillary and well about Deadheads While Steely Dan and Frank Zappa strike me as tributaries pretty distant from the mainstream Miller was trying to trace I think you re correctly suspicious of disco s absence and not just as a high point of decadence Miller spends an entire chapter lovingly detailing the design and production of the Fender electric guitar showing how the technology enabled an amateur musical expression that would change mass culture Disco prefigured the most cataclysmic reordering of rock sound and attitude in 20 years hip hop a form in which the technical gimmickry that Miller seems to both enjoy and distrust became central to music making And that s leaving aside the race issues until the next letter Yours truly Chris Norris
