Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Pursuant to 5 U S C 605 b the Secretary has certified that the interim rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities Such certification was published in the Federal Register 61 Fed Reg 35017 As a consequence HUD was not required to prepare either an initial or a final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections 603 and 604 of the Act and sections 607 and 609 are not applicable According to a HUD representative HUD s section 605 b statement and certification were not separately provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration Rather publication in the Federal Register was treated as providing notice to the SBA The SBA has not objected to this procedure iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 According to the agency the rule will not result in expenditures of 100 million in any year by either State Local or Tribal governments in the aggregate or by the private sector In addition the rule neither affects small governments nor contains a significant intergovernmental mandate Consequently the rule does not impose unfunded mandates under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant information or requirements under Acts

regulations is contained in the Balanced Budget Downpayment Act Pub L 104 99 January 26 1996 Executive Order No 12866 HUD reports that the interim rule and the accompanying economic analysis were reviewed and approved by OMB as required by E O 12866 HUD received the approval from OMB on June 10 1996 and no changes were made Executive Order No 12612 HUD states that the interim rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the States or on the relationship between the federal government and the States or on the distribution of power or responsibilities among various levels of government because the interim rule primarily involves relationships between HUD and private entities Executive Order No 12606 HUD reports that the interim rule will have only an indirect impact on family formation maintenance and general well being and that such impact will be beneficial because it will assist mortgagors in maintaining ownership of their properties In the preamble HUD states
