 Background Reduction in hypothalamic melanocortin tone caused by reduction in proopiomelanocortin POMC mRNA and elevation in agouti related peptide AGRP mRNA is thought to play a key role in mediating nutritional effects on neuroendocrine function 1 2 Thus fasting 3 4 insulin deficiency 5 and leptin deficiency 4 are all associated with reduced hypothalamic melanocortin tone However factors that regulate hypothalamic melanocortin tone are not fully elucidated Since both fasting and insulin deficiency are associated with reduced plasma leptin 5 and leptin replacement reverses effects of fasting 6 and also effects of insulin deficiency on food intake and body weight 7 it has been suggested that the reduction in leptin accounts for the reduced hypothalamic melanocortin tone in these conditions However fasting can influence hypothalamic gene expression in insulin deficient mice independent of changes in plasma leptin or insulin 5 as well as in leptin resistant db db mice 3 These data suggest that other factors in addition to leptin may mediate effects of fasting Since fasting insulin deficiency and leptin insufficiency also lead to an elevation in plasma glucocorticoids 8 and adrenalectomy of leptin deficient ob ob mice largely normalizes hypothalamic gene expression in these mice 9 it is plausible that elevated glucocorticoids may mediate some effects of nutritional state on hypothalamic gene expression This hypothesis is particularly compelling since recent data suggest that aberrant glucocorticoid activity may play a key role in the development of the metabolic syndrome 10 Glucocorticoids have previously been reported to increase body weight set point as determined by hoarding behavior in rats 11 while adrenalectomy has been reported to lower body weight set point in rats 12 In addition central infusion of glucocorticoids leads to increases in body weight and food intake with a concomitant induction of hypothalamic NPY 13 Nevertheless it remains unclear if an elevation in glucocorticoid concentration contributes to the effect of fasting on hypothalamic gene expression Adrenalectomy has been reported to block elevations in NPY mRNA in response to fasting 14 On the other hand it has been reported that elevation of plasma corticosterone levels is not required for the induction of NPY mRNA by fasting 15 In addition the extent to which hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA depends on elevated glucocorticoid levels in fasting and insulin deficiency has not been determined to date Therefore in the present study we assessed if an elevation of plasma corticosterone is necessary and sufficient to mediate effects of fasting and insulin deficiency on hypothalamic melanocortin tone as indicated by expression of hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA Results and Discussion Study 1 Effects of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic responses to fasting Fasting reduced body weight and adipose weight in both the sham operated and adrenalectomized groups as expected Table 1 Blood glucose was also decreased by fasting in both the sham operated group and adrenalectomized group Table 1 Serum corticosterone concentration increased with fasting as expected in the sham operated mice Fig 1A adrenalectomy blocked this fasting induced elevation of corticosterone Fig 1A Therefore the adrenalectomized fasted mice exhibited similar levels of corticosterone as both the adrenalectomized ad lib fed mice and the sham operated ad lib fed mice Fig 1A As we noted previously a basal level of corticosterone was detectable in the adrenalectomized mice after surgery 9 In contrast to corticosterone other humoral factors were not significantly affected by adrenalectomy Serum insulin and serum leptin both exhibited the same decreases in the adrenalectomized fasted and sham operated fasted animals compared to the adrenalectomized ad lib fed and sham operated ad lib fed mice Fig 1Band 1C therefore the levels of these humoral factors were the same in the sham operated fasted mice and the adrenalectomized fasted mice Fasting increased hypothalamic AGRP mRNA as expected in the sham operated fasted group and adrenalectomy completely blocked the induction of AGRP by fasting Fig 2A Adrenalectomy also produced a trend to decrease AGRP mRNA in the ad lib fed mice but this effect was not significant Fig 2A Fasting decreased hypothalamic POMC mRNA as expected in the sham operated fasted group but fasting had no effect on POMC mRNA in the adrenalectomized animals Fig 2B As with AGRP NPY mRNA was also elevated after fasting and this effect of fasting on NPY mRNA was also completely blocked by adrenalectomy Fig 2C Adrenalectomy therefore completely blocked the effects of fasting on hypothalamic AGRP POMC and NPY mRNAs Study 2 Effects of adrenalectomy on hypothalamic responses to insulin deficiency and fasting Streptozotocin injection induced diabetes in sham operated mice Table 2 Interestingly adrenalectomy attenuated the rise in blood glucose in streptozotocin injected mice Table 2 Fasting reduced blood glucose in the ADX STZ Fast group below even that of control mice Table 2 Streptozotocin injection led to reduced body weight and adiposity in sham operated animals as previously described 5 17 Table 2 whereas adrenalectomy attenuated the loss of both body weight and adiposity associated with insulin deficiency Table 2 Streptozotocin injection also led to significant hyperphagia typical of diabetic mice 17 Table 2 and adrenalectomy also ameliorated this response to insulin deficiency Table 2 Serum corticosterone was elevated in the Sham STZ group and was decreased in both ADX STZ and ADX STZ Fast groups Fig 3A Adrenalectomy did not result in complete elimination of corticosterone but instead resulted in low but detectable levels of serum corticosterone as previously noted 9 and described above Serum insulin was reduced to the same extent in Sham STZ ADX STZ and in ADX STZ Fast groups compared to control mice as would be expected with streptozotocin injection Fig 3B Serum leptin was also reduced to the same levels in all experimental groups compared to control mice Fig 3C Hypothalamic AGRP mRNA was significantly elevated in sham operated diabetic vs sham operated euglycemic mice as expected 5 17 Fig 4A However adrenalectomy completely blocked the elevation of AGRP mRNA in diabetic mice whether or not they were fasted Fig 4A Hypothalamic POMC mRNA was reduced in diabetic mice as expected 5 17 Fig 4B Adrenalectomy blocked this reduction in POMC mRNA in diabetic mice whether or not they were fasted Fig 4B As with AGRP mRNA NPY mRNA was elevated in diabetic mice and adrenalectomy blocked this induction of NPY mRNA in diabetic mice whether or not they were fasted Fig 4C In summary hypothalamic AGRP POMC and NPY mRNA all exhibited the expected changes in association with streptozotocin induced diabetes 5 17 Fig 4A 4B 4C and adrenalectomy largely or completely blocked all these responses to insulin deficiency whether or not the mice were fasted Fig 4A 4B 4C Study 3 Effects of corticosterone implants on hypothalamic gene expression Implantation of corticosterone implants for 48 hours significantly increased serum corticosterone compared to placebo implanted mice as expected Fig 5A Interestingly the corticosterone implants also significantly increased serum insulin and leptin Fig 5Band 5C In contrast the corticosterone implants did not significantly influence body weight or food intake compared to placebo implanted mice body weight of 24 5 0 6 g for the placebo group compared to 24 4 0 6 g for the corticosterone implant group food intake of 4 3 0 1 g day for the placebo group compared to 4 1 0 5 g day for the corticosterone implant group although epididymal adipose tissue depot was slightly smaller in the corticosterone implant group 0 19 0 01 g for the placebo group compared to 0 15 0 01 g for the corticosterone implant group p 0 05 Corticosterone implants also had no influence on blood glucose 134 8 10 9 mg dl for the placebo group compared to 128 8 4 3 mg dl for the corticosterone implant group Implantation of corticosterone implants for 48 hours significantly elevated hypothalamic AGRP expression compared to the placebo group Fig 6A Hypothalamic POMC mRNA was also significantly elevated in the corticosterone implant group Fig 6B Hypothalamic NPY mRNA exhibited a trend toward an increase although the effect was not significant p 0 14 Fig 6C Therefore hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNAs were both induced by the glucocorticoid implant whereas the NPY mRNA was not significantly influenced Conclusions In the present study adrenalectomy and corticosterone implants were used to address the role of elevated corticosterone in mediating the effects of fasting and insulin deficiency on hypothalamic gene expression resulting in several novel observations First we have demonstrated that adrenalectomy can block the elevation of AGRP mRNA and the reduction in POMC mRNA with fasting consistent with previous findings by Ponsalle et al concerning NPY 14 and suggesting that increases in corticosterone mediate fasting induced changes in melanocortin tone Second we have also shown that hypothalamic responses to insulin deficiency require elevation in corticosterone Third we have demonstrated using corticosterone implants that elevated corticosterone is sufficient to enhance hypothalamic AGRP expression but not to reduce hypothalamic POMC mRNA Together these results suggest that an elevation of corticosterone is necessary for reduction in melanocortin tone during fasting and with diabetes and is sufficient to induce hypothalamic AGRP mRNA but not to reduce POMC expression Although a reduction in plasma leptin plays an important role in mediating neuroendocrine responses to fasting 6 and diabetes 17 we have previously demonstrated that fasting can regulate hypothalamic melanocortin tone independently of both leptin and insulin 5 The present studies suggest that corticosterone may play a role in mediating these leptin independent effects Fasting was associated with elevated corticosterone Fig 1A and reduced insulin and leptin Fig 1Band 1C as well as melanocortin tone Fig 2Aand 2B as expected However preventing the elevation of corticosterone completely blocked the effect of fasting on hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA Fig 2Aand 2B without preventing effects of fasting on plasma leptin or insulin Adrenalectomy also blocked the effects of fasting on hypothalamic NPY mRNA Fig 2C confirming the findings of Ponsalle et al 14 These data suggest that leptin s effect to reverse effects of fasting on melanocortin tone may require and be mediated by a reduction in glucocorticoids Glucocorticoids were also elevated as expected in insulin deficient diabetes Fig 3A and serum insulin leptin and melanocortin tone were also reduced in this condition Fig 3Band 3C 4Aand 4B As with fasting the reduction in plasma leptin could largely be a reflection of the reduction in adipose weight as well as plasma insulin In turn as with fasting the reduction of plasma leptin could be the cause of the elevation of hypothalamic AGRP and NPY mRNA as well as the reduction of hypothalamic POMC mRNA On the other hand blocking the rise in corticosterone by adrenalectomy prevented the reduction in hypothalamic POMC mRNA and the induction of AGRP mRNA without reversing either the reduced leptin or the reduced adiposity characteristic of insulin deficient diabetic mice Fig 4Aand 4B These data suggest that reversal of effects of insulin deficiency by leptin 7 may require and be mediated by a reduction in glucocorticoids We had previously shown that fasting could regulate hypothalamic gene expression in insulin deficient mice even though in these mice fasting did not influence plasma leptin or insulin 5 Since adrenalectomy blocked the fasting induced reduction in melanocortin tone in diabetic mice as it had in euglycemic mice in the first study these results suggest that effects of fasting on melanocortin tone in diabetic mice may be mediated at least in part by a rise in plasma corticosterone itself possibly secondary to the reduction in plasma leptin Implanting corticosterone implants for 48 hours led to an elevation in both hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA Fig 6B Since adrenalectomy blocked the elevation of AGRP mRNA by fasting and insulin deficiency elevation of corticosterone would be expected to increase hypothalamic AGRP mRNA as was indeed observed However the corticosterone implants produced the unexpected effect of elevating hypothalamic POMC mRNA a rare if not unique circumstance in which hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA are regulated in the same direction The basis of this unexpected phenomenon is not yet clear However since leptin and insulin both stimulate hypothalamic POMC 18 the elevation of insulin and leptin in the corticosterone implanted mice Fig 5Band 5C the former possibly mediated by glucocorticoid induced insulin resistance and the latter possibly mediated by the resulting hyperinsulinemia might mediate the observed effect of corticosterone implants on hypothalamic POMC in these implanted mice On the other hand leptin inhibits hypothalamic AGRP mRNA 4 yet AGRP mRNA was nevertheless elevated in the face of elevated insulin and leptin These data suggest that in fasting and insulin deficient diabetes as in leptin deficient ob ob mice 9 19 glucocorticoids dominate leptin and insulin levels in determining AGRP expression whereas insulin and leptin dominate glucocorticoids in determining hypothalamic POMC expression These data are also consistent with the observation that in streptozotocin induced diabetic rats replacement of insulin is not sufficient to normalize elevated serum corticosterone or the elevated hypothalamic AGRP mRNA while it does partially normalize plasma leptin and hypothalamic POMC mRNA 17 After the present paper was submitted for review we became aware of a recent study by Savontaus et al examining the role of glucocorticoids in the regulation of hypothalamic gene expression in rats 20 using a roughly similar experimental design as in the present study In several respects the conclusions from this study are similar to the present study for example corticoisterone implants increased hypothalamic AGRP and POMC mRNA and adrenalectomy blocked the effect of fasting on hypothalamic POMC mRNA However in one key respect the results reported by Savontaus et al differed from those in the present paper adrenalectomy failed to block the effects of fasting on hypothalamic AGRP and NPY even though corticosterone implants were observed to induce AGRP mRNA Since we observed that adrenalectomy also blocks the effects of diabetes on hypothalamic gene expression in the present study we suspect the difference between the present study and that of Savontaus et al is probably due to different regulatory requirements in mice and rats For example it is clear that the regulation of AGRP differs in rats and mice since in mice hypothalamic AGRP mRNA is elevated by a deficiency in leptin receptor function 4 but in rats this is not true 21 However hypothalamic POMC is regulated similarly in rats and mice and this is probably the more important element regulating metabolic phenotype Taken together these data suggest that elevated glucocorticoids are sufficient to drive the increase in hypothalamic AGRP mRNA during fasting and diabetes but not the reduction in POMC mRNA Interestingly at least with respect to food intake and body weight over this 48 hour period the elevation of POMC appears to compensate for the elevation in AGRP to produce no net functional effect on body weight homeostasis in the presence of significantly elevated plasma corticosterone After more chronic exposure this delicate balance could plausibly become disrupted leading to glucocorticoid mediated development of the metabolic syndrome 10 Thus interactions between insulin leptin and glucocorticoids and the neuropeptide responses they generate within the melanocortin system allow complex metabolic responses to nutritional status but may also allow the development of metabolic pathologies Methods Animals The appropriate Institutional Animal Review Board had approved all studies To study the effect of adrenalectomy on fasting induced changes in hypothalamic gene expression Study 1 two month old male C57Bl 6J mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME Mice were individually housed with free access to food and water under 12 12 h light dark cycle lights on at 07 00 h Of the 31 mice 19 mice were adrenalectomized and the rest underwent a sham operation Adrenalectomy was performed as described previously by bilateral flank incision under anesthesia 2 5 2 2 2 tribromoethanol 0 015 0 017 ml g body weight i p 9 Sham adrenalectomy entailed the same procedure as adrenalectomy except that the adrenal glands were grasped but not removed After the surgery all mice were given one injection of dexamethasone 45 mg kg b w i p to facilitate recovery from surgery The drinking water was replaced with normal saline 0 9 NaCl to compensate for the loss of mineralocorticoids Body weight was monitored for one week following the operation at which time it was verified that the animals had recovered initial body weight as expected All mice were placed in fresh cages with new bedding and food was removed from half of the adrenalectomized mice and half of the sham operated mice for 48 hours This resulted in four groups sham ad lib fed n 6 sham 48 hour fast n 6 adrenalectomized ad lib fed n 10 and adrenalectomized 48 hour fast n 9 To study the effects of adrenalectomy insulin deficiency and fasting Study 2 33 male C57Bl 6J mice were obtained at 2 months of age from The Jackson Laboratory Bar Harbor ME and were individually housed with free access to feed and water under 12 12 h light dark cycle as described above Mice were treated with daily injections of dexamethasone 45 mg kg body weight i p for three weeks during which time they were either adrenalectomized or sham operated as described above Half the sham operated and all the adrenalectomized mice were injected with streptozotocin 10 days after the surgery 160 mg kg body weight freshly purchased from Sigma St Louis MO and dissolved in 25 mM Citric Acid Buffer pH 4 5 while the rest received buffer alone by tail vein injection 10 days after surgery Dexamethasone treatment continued until four days after the streptozotocin injection Mice were then monitored for two weeks without the dexamethasone injection at which point half the adrenalectomized STZ treated group were fasted while the rest of the mice were ad lib fed This resulted in four separate groups sham operated buffer injected ad lib

Harbor ME As with the first and second studies mice were individually housed with free access to food and water under 12 12 h light dark cycle lights on at 07 00 h Mice were divided into two group one received corticosterone implants of 30 mg Innovative Research of America Sarasota FL n 8 while the other mice received placebo implants Innovative Research of America Sarasota FL n 8 Body weight and food intake were monitored for 48 hours after which time all the mice were sacrificed For all studies mice were sacrificed following a balanced design towards the end of the light period between 17 00 and 18 30 h Mice were decapitated decapitation after a brief approximately 45 second exposure to carbon dioxide we have verified in pilot studies that the brief exposure to carbon dioxide does not significantly affect the plasma corticosterone levels under these conditions Table 3 Adrenalectomy was verified in each individual by visual inspection to assure that no visible traces of the adrenal glands were observed Brains for Northern blot analysis were quickly removed and the hypothalamus was dissected out frozen on dry ice and stored at 70 C until use Epididymal white adipose tissue was
