                            In  Richard Horton editor of the         Lancet chastised much of current surgical research and in particular        questioned the usefulness of the case series as a predominant form of communication among        surgeons  He asked a poignant question Does surgical research have a future Nearly        a decade later it is important for surgeons and nonsurgeons alike to revisit Hortons        challenge                    Why Surgeons Favor Case Series        Randomized controlled trials RCTs have become the pillar of clinical research Such        trials attempt to obtain an unbiased randomization of patients with respect to known and        unknown baseline conditions and to assess the effects of an intervention However only a        minority of surgical studies involve a valid randomization scheme The case series remains        a favored method of clinical investigation in surgery        Case series are easy to perform require less resources in terms of personnel and funds        can be performed at a single center and for many surgeons represent a means to        illustrate their surgical method and skills In many instances case series also serve as        valuable intellectual background for future clinical or scientific work For example        consider Dennis Burkitts report on jaw tumors in African children Alfred Blalocks        initial efforts in cardiac surgery or more recently Starzl and colleagues observations        in a small collection of patients of donor leukocyte chimerism whereby recipients acquire        tolerance to foreign donor cells In all three cases the authors work led to powerful        shifts in our understanding of the biology and treatment of disease  All were case        reports or case seriesbut under the current paradigm adopted by most journals and        evidencebased databases they would not be valued                     Barriers to Surgical RCTs        There are many reasons why RCTs in surgical patients may be more difficult to perform        than those in nonsurgical patients One of the most importantthough least understoodis        that the complexities of human disease in surgical patients makes them a more difficult        group to study Surgical patients are often heterogeneous in many more ways than        nonsurgical patients So it would be inherently easier for example to study a new        medication for generally healthy young adults with essential hypertension than a surgical        technique for older patients with hepatic failure needing transplantation        In addition while there may be value in studying patients from multiple centers there        may be important differences in the skill levels of different surgeons either between        centers or across the country For example the skill levels of surgeons in trials of        carotid endarterectomy may be greater than those across the surgical community as a whole        This makes the applicability of some surgical RCTs to the wider community less certain than        trials of medical therapies        So when it comes to surgical research for both researchers and funding agencies it is        easier to grapple with a difficult but ultimately soluble basic science question than to        face the uncertainty of clinical research Investigators understand these implicit issues        and trim their sails accordingly                    Improving the Rigor of Research        Nonetheless too much surgical work is conducted in the less rigorous format of the case        series What can and should be done to improve the rigor of surgical investigation It        would seem that improvements are required from within and beyond the surgical world        First as Horner observed and several eminent surgeons have since agreed reforms must        begin within the field itself  Both during surgical training and in the early        years of faculty development surgeons must obtain a thorough grounding in the principles        of basic research and proper clinical investigation        Second surgeons must establish firm and friendly relations with biostatisticians so        that the latter may play a strong role in helping to develop adequately powered studies        that can answer critical questions raised by new therapies and techniques This is an        especially acute need in an accelerating age of targeted therapies and disease        biomarkers        Third surgeons must reengage in the clinical research enterprise and resume leadership        roles in local and national clinical trials that involve surgical patients In the United        States for example an important step in this regard has been the establishment of the        American College of Surgeons Oncology Group which invites surgeons from all sectors        including private practice to become active participants in welldesigned        multiinstitutional trials  Similar efforts are needed on a global level        Finally similar to the pressures faced by their colleagues elsewhere in academia        surgeon clinicianinvestigators must be nurtured protected and valued by their colleagues        and medical administrators The financial health of academic medical centers relies heavily        on the generation of clinical revenue which in many centers falls disproportionately on        the shoulders of surgeons New paradigms for revenue generation and funding of clinical        research are needed                    Funding for Surgical Research        Beyond the walls of the academic medical center there also needs to be greater        recognition of the value of scientifically sound surgical research and clinical        investigation However the National Institutes of Health NIH the major source of        biomedical funding in the United States continues to convey a less welcoming attitude        toward surgical research than toward other types of clinical or basic science        At the NIH the principal instrument for performing peer review and making grant funding        decisions is the study section composed of about  members with expertise in a given        field There are few study sections devoted to surgically oriented clinical research and        only two study sections from among more than  in which surgeons make up even a        reasonable minority of the committee members  In comparison to those in other clinical        departments surgical grant proposals are less likely to be funded and awards when        funded are smaller                               Funding agencies need to recognize the importance of the surgical endeavor to modern            medicine                          Surgical research is also impeded by processes affecting other types of research as        well The number of researchers under  years of age receiving a first RO grant the main        NIH mechanism for external funding in any field is below  The average age of initial        funding for US physicians is about  years and shows a trend toward advancing age that        has progressed significantly in the past two decades Thus the NIH appears to reward        experience and proven results very heavily which may stifle innovation and likely serves        as an innate barrier for younger physicianinvestigators contemplating research careers                To help correct for this worrisome trend the NIH created the K award systemcareer        development grants designed to help starting researchers gain the experience needed to        compete for RO grants However nearly  of the clinicians who receive KO awards never        apply for RO funding  which suggests that the overall supportboth explicit and        implicitfor clinical research at the institutional and funding levels is inadequate        Finally outside the US surgeons face similar if not greater problems This bodes        poorly for countries where the cost of evaluating new therapies and technologies may be an        unaffordable luxury These challenges to the surgical research enterprise are therefore        global issues and should merit the attention of surgeons medical institutions and funding        agencies in all countries                    The Future        What can be done On the national and international level funding agencies need to        recognize the importance of the surgical endeavor to modern medicine Recently in the US        the NIH unveiled a roadmap httpnihroadmapnihgov designed to provide new pathways        to discovery Clear careful scientific surgical investigation must be part of this        roadmap although it is not specifically mentioned Outreach efforts to include surgeons in        a variety of study sections should be made to ensure that important insights into the        pathophysiology and treatment of disease with which surgeons are concerned on a daily        basis are not overlooked Additional efforts are needed to improve funding for clinical        research both for individuals at early stages of their careers and for multidisciplinary        clinical research and clinical trials Locally and individually surgeons must join        efforts to improve the clinical research enterprise by including training in clinical        investigation at an early stage in medical school and during surgical residency training        fostering the careers of young surgeoninvestigators through committed protected time        participating in local and national clinical research groups and recognizing that        development as a clinical researcher takes timemany years in fact        These efforts may help ensure that surgical research is a vital part of the future of        medicine and that it leads to the kind of highquality work that shapes and remodels the        face of medicine To foster these efforts surgeons must change and adapt to the currents        of modern medical research If this is successful the case series will become the        occasional rather than the common form of surgical communication And surgeons other        clinicians and most importantly basic scientists will be better able to take advantage        of the new avenues of biomedical science opening before us        But the case series will always represent one important tool for early studies or        uncommon conditions It remains true that while the method one uses influences the answer        one receives it can be just as important to ask the right questions which can be asked        even in a series of one patient  And surely that is the place one must begin
