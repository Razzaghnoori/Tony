 Bogus Nights The critic Terrence Rafferty has a sensible column in the current GQ on the vapidity of independent film In 1997 Rafferty writes independent movie after independent movie arrived in theaters on waves of critical admiration and moviegoers unaccustomed to the peculiar moral universe of indie ness must have emerged from these experiences deeply perplexed wondering perhaps how the reviewers who carped about studio films like Steven Spielberg s majestic flawed Amistad could embrace wholeheartedly stuff as dubious as Deconstructing Harry The Sweet Hereafter Boogie Nights and In the Company of Men Rafferty correctly identifies indie film s air of smugness Because its supposed anti commercial values are pre approved by a youngish left of center audience indie filmmakers are encouraged to be less rigorous with themselves to accept limitations that they d be better off trying to correct or transcend This is a familiar debate but Rafferty turns the usual cant around It s the hypercapitalist studio mentality that is usually deemed corrupt Independent films no matter how incompetent are thought to be well meaning Rafferty passes over obvious chances to criticize the indies in technical terms no review of Boogie Nights prepared me for what a patchy tedious film it was and instead finds something morally defective in them He has in mind Woody Allen Anthony Minghella The English Patient Neil LaBute In the Company of Men and Quentin Tarantino This rather disparate group is tied together by a desire to resist the strictures of studio filmmaking and to advertise that resistance to a discerning audience So instead of uplifting stories we get studiously downbeat ones instead of good vs evil we get calculated ambiguity instead of violence as plot device we get violence as happenstance and instead of a corporate worldview we get self expression and self regard Rafferty uses the word moral quite pointedly He thinks that these movies are destructive that they enjoy degradation I think he s mostly right Tarantino notably manipulates our capacity to be aroused by death No less offensive however is the automatic presumption of quality in work that defines itself merely by its choice of subject matter and mannerism Because a Martin Scorsese epigone named Paul Thomas Anderson announced a film on the subject of L A porn because he promised to show some dick he was celebrated as a poetic chronicler of subcultures Meanwhile better than average studio films I d name Titanic and The Devil s Advocate are picked apart by highbrow critics even by those who admitted enjoying them Tony Gilroy and Jonathan Lemkin s script for The Devil s Advocate was witty and literate Anderson s for Boogie Nights was not Most freethinking filmgoers will admit the existence of morally repugnant indie poseurs But what does that species have in common with the almost universally admired Coen brothers This writing directing producing team Joel Coen directs Ethan Coen produces both write has cannily outlasted the cyclical faddishness of indie dom Their movies Blood Simple Raising Arizona Miller s Crossing Barton Fink The Hudsucker Proxy Fargo and now The Big Lebowski have been eccentric in the best sense avoiding both mainstream studio practices and the indie mentality that mindlessly reacts against them And yet something is not working Every Coen opus after Blood Simple has in one way or another fallen flat I don t subscribe to the standard critique of the Coens that they are too cool and too clever by half that they care more for wordplay than for flesh and blood characters In fact they have a tremendous gift for character They can write a role and find an actor for it in a way that creates a small myth on the screen I m thinking in particular of Frances McDormand s unflappable pregnant cop in Fargo John Turturro s Barton Fink the mediocre leftist playwright who tries to go Hollywood and in the new film Jeff Bridges incarnation of Jeff Lebowski a k a the Dude an amiable stoner who is drawn into a Big Sleep inspired kidnap scheme What these characters have in common is an instantly plausible blend of idiosyncrasy and stereotype The Dude is burdened with all the clich s of his kind but he also shows pleasing eccentricities such as an eye for interior decor That rug really tied the room together he says after one of the bad guys urinates on it His bowling buddies and co conspirators John Goodman s character a gun toting Vietnam vet with an intellectual streak and Steve Buscemi s a nice guy who s always one step behind are also neatly drawn As long as they are simply chatting together at the bowling alley the film is charming and alive The trouble starts with the plot The great flaw in most of the Coens work is surprisingly an inability to sustain a plot over a two hour span I say surprising because their first movie Blood Simple came so close to perfection Its plot really was simple man hires hit man to kill philandering wife and appeared complicated only to the characters in the film The plot of Lebowski on the other hand is a mystery to all It has to do with the kidnapping of the young wife of a millionaire also named Lebowski and debts owed to a porn impresario I won t describe it in more detail because it crumbles to nothing long before the end Careless plotting first cropped up in the Coens murky gangster picture Miller s Crossing and it hurt Fargo the best of their recent films If a character buries a suitcase full of money we should find out what happens to it In Lebowski we lose track not only of plot devices but of whole characters who come and go without finding a reason to be Turturro is wasted as a bowler named Jesus a convicted pedophile in Spandex He is an amazing creation but he has no function The crux of the Coens plot problem is climax Over and over they have imposed an artificial resolution on a sequence of brilliant character studies In Barton Fink for example Fink s adventures in 30s Hollywood lead him through a splendid gallery of vintage Los Angeles creatures a madcap studio head a gin soaked Faulkneresque novelist a seemingly ordinary insurance salesman Goodman again who makes strange noises in the hotel room next door Then what The Coens put a dead woman in Fink s bed and set fire to the hotel In Fargo the kidnapping turned murder scheme never finds a satisfying second act and the Coens create an illusion of climax only by having one thug kill another in a giant geyser of blood In The Big Lebowski the climax is so farcically arbitrary one character drops dead of a heart attack that the Coens seem to be laughing at their own inability to wrap things up Anyone who s tried to write a screenplay knows the difficulty of writing a climax The process is always artificial The art is in hiding the artifice The Coens shrug off that task with annoying arrogance Do these enormously talented filmmakers show a moral failing in the sense that Rafferty developed in his piece I think they do Their sin is pride The Coens have reached a stage where they no longer question their ideas or flesh them out You can catch them in the act as it were by comparing a shooting script with the final product I have such a script for Barton Fink The shooting script is the script as it stands before filming begins the script that you can buy in book form is a continuity script which has been edited to match the film The degree to which the shooting script matches the film is astonishing Page after page has been shot word for word This needless to say is unusual even directors who write their own scripts very often make major changes during production The Coens had shot everything verbatim right down to unfinished sentences I don t know I mean and hesitations uh er If the script were airtight such faithfulness to self would be admirable But when the script is flawed The moral is that the Coens might actually be able to make further artistic advances if they shackled themselves to the evil studio system Someone needs to speak to them in time tested studio platitudes to say that the script goes nowhere in the third act or that there are too many marginal characters They might also profit from filming others scripts But the hype that greeted Blood Simple appears to have convinced them that they are sufficient unto themselves They ve reserved an independence they haven t earned
