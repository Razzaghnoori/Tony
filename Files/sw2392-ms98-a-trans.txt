 well we don t do much eating out oh well we wonder how these topics get chosen where was the last place you went out to eat uh Benny s well last place we went was uh uh oh we went to uh Popeye s uh Fried Chicken well actually it was a drive through yeah well uh ours usually consists of McDonald s i ve got two young kids and they love McDonald s well our our kids are a little older actually we got a a seventeen year old and a and a fourteen year old but but we still wind up i still i like fast food reasonably well yeah well uh i know it put on some weight for us so we stayed away them or tried to but i love to take the kids they say uh what do you look for to bring them uh to look at to uh come back to yeah i was talking to my husband while i was listening to they was trying to find a call and uh i said it s the toy uh uh the play yard out in the front yard you know that McDonald s has well how old are your kids four and two oh so they really like that sort of stuff then yeah they they d rather go out there and play in the yard than eat i can remember many times that when when it s interesting though that that you know particularly when you re traveling and you go some place you can stop at a McDonald s that s that s a big playground uh when the kids you know when the kids really need to get out and run around after been driving a while yeah well we ve took a we was living out in Memphis and we used to drive back and forth to Louisville that s where we usually from Louisville Kentucky and uh you know we d stop at the fast foods there uh usually i like to go just to get the kids out have them in a confined space where i can uh sit down and relax and be able to watch them too yeah that that that s really nice that they started doing that because it s the problem is you take them to some place nice and and you know the um even a place where they have to to sit down even if they really get kids they get they get bored in a hurry yeah and uh yeah you know we now that we re a little older we can go to i i still like um i like buffets yeah they got a couple all you can eat down here and uh we haven t went to them yet but i ve been threatening my husband that we ll go yeah well have you been in the area very long no we ve only well we ve been in Texas for two years little a little under two years oh so uh not really i don t know it too well you say you in Denison oh okay so we were i was in Sherman um yes hum last month of the i took a i sponsored a youth group up there and uh it was funny we went to a uh oh we must have had thirty of us and we went into a Pizza Hut and you wander into a Pizza Hut with that kind of crowd and they sort of hate to see you coming so they re they get the business but with a crowd of people it s uh it it it was kind of funny and we went in first and then it was so crowded and we went and i m trying to think it s right off anyway i don t know if it s Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn anyway we went to another one and and uh they the rates there are fairly reasonable but uh you know even those places are starting to have you know video games and things for kids to your kids play video games oh my son does he he s the four year old i ve got a Nintendo that he plays with oh well that gives him something to amuse him while there uh yeah yeah well he likes those crane games you know where you try to win a toy yeah he likes every time we pass one he wants me to win him a toy well do you have do you have any like Chucky Cheese or trying to well i remember Chucky Cheeses was down in Lewisville uh i haven t seen one here well they got one um in Richardson probably me i try and think there there there s a couple of those that they combined and it s a combination pizza parlor and all kinds of in a game room and toy room yeah and yeah and and they have the room full of balls and yeah Show Biz Pizza yeah yeah Show Biz that s the name of it that s what it is Show Biz yeah uh well do you like the pizza at Show Biz yeah it s alright uh i haven t seen one down here i think where there was one in in Memphis when we was there oh uh and it was great Steven the only thing that Steven didn t like that s my son was uh you know they had those dancing bears and stuff it scared him to death yeah yeah well you know they re so large they animated it yeah i think that s what it was but uh he he d rather go and ride on the rides you know they had airplanes that go up and down and stuff and yeah that s really uh yeah we were until the kids got older we d go there and you know it was um that right i ll date myself a little bit but it s remarkable the number of those things they need merged or something but it still it s still quite popular i have to i m not sure the pizza was okay i mean well we went one time uh one of my ex boyfriends had taken me this was years and years ago and uh i d taken my younger brother he s about twelve years younger than i am and uh um hum i remember eating their pizza and they had put anchovies and all this on it i mean they piled it up um hum and it was the nastiest tasting pizza i ve ever tasted me i rather go Master Mister Gatti s or there s a Godfather s down in uh Memphis and that was a good pizza i ve never tasted a better pizza well well well do you ever go out to any of the higher higher end type more expensive places uh no the last expensive place i went to it was a it was a Shoney s huh and we went there every Tuesday night and or Saturday night when we was playing uh when i was playing softball with uh hum a softball league down in Memphis we went and uh that s the most expensive place we went to um well we got a lot of barbecue places around around the Dallas area Spring Creek Barbecue that s right in Richardson and it uh i i like the barbecue there um and it it s fairly reasonable you can get um it i mean if if you know you go through the line and and pick up your food yeah well it s kind of hard to take two kids uh to a nice place number one they bug all the other people and uh or so we think they do and yeah it is they re probably just being normal though yeah but uh i don t know i every time i set up a baby sitter to uh go out and do something my husband uh nixes it and says we ll stay home this day and well when the you know it s funny when the when the when the kids get a lot older though you can you can you can do as you please our son graduates this year and we re kind of looking forward to yeah well i can t i ll you know i say i can t wait for my kids to grow up but i believe i m going to miss this age when they re gone yeah yeah they re uh but i i do want my freedom back i m sure my husband does too well the you know it s it s kind of like wanting to talk you know and um but and then they learned to say no and it s kind of funny but they uh the the and now they get older our son s a senior in high school will talk to us but he you know you know it s mostly um no it not really anything really important in his life no no no and it s sort of i guess it s a little disappointing but but i suppose it s it s just the way life is but yeah i i can t you know i can t relate to that just yet uh you know i mean my daughter she doesn t know the word yes it s no every time you turn around you know and my son i i can t de scribe him it s i don t know why or you know right uh can t relate to a seventeen year old yet well it it you know everybody all says you d be surprised how quickly it comes but it it uh we moved here in seventy six and daughter was six weeks old and and hard to believe in nearly fifteen years uh you sound like you got a Louisiana accent no i i i grew up in uh in Alabama Alabama okay alright alright i guess close to the Louisiana border well no actually and i was until i was eight i lived in in in south uh western Georgia and then we moved over into central part of Alabama oh okay but i ve been away from there for goodness i haven t lived in Alabama since nineteen sixty five that s been a long time ago i lived several places Europe and yeah in Asia yeah i spent military yeah my my husband was in the Navy but so i was in the Air Force what were you in Air Force uh i he tried to get in there they wouldn t take him yeah uh i was i went in in nineteen and sixty five when they were drafting people in fact my father was on the draft board so yeah well uh i i was born in sixty five so i can t say that uh husband was only five years old then too yeah well it things are different when uh everybody in in fact that it that was Vietnam era i was in fact i went to Vietnam myself yeah well uh it was it s it s a different world yeah well i know uh i don t just just out of curiosity how do you feel about these guys getting a welcome home that you all didn t get well see i never had a hard time coming home it didn t uh you know there all these people who spit on them and all these kinds of things i i came home and got married and i i never uh i and could now but i didn t and
