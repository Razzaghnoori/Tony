 Beyond Research No one can say what the welfare reform bill will bring but one unlikely outcome already shows signs of taking place Child care policy may finally receive practical rather than polemical attention For more than three decades social scientists have been studying the costs and benefits of child care and their work has yielded only one consistent result Their research is seized upon waved about politicized and in the end nothing much gets done But the polarized stalemate can t continue much longer for two reasons Child care has become an inescapable public issue and social scientists themselves have been expressing a new humility about child care research Politicians now have to stop hiding behind the experts and start improvising policy Does the welfare reform bill provide enough money to take care of the kids whose single parents are now forced to work The lines that get drawn on that central question are fairly predictable Liberal child advocates the Children s Defense Fund prominent among them regard the funding 20 billion available over six years as almost surely insufficient to offer the poor a true choice of quality day care What we know from child care research as a press release from Child Trends Inc puts the standard position is that the quality of child care matters for children s development and it matters the most for low income children Conservatives are content to assume that a majority of women who leave the rolls will rely on free or cheap unregulated child care by relatives and neighbors as the poor have generally done in the past Ron Haskins an influential Republican staff director on the House Ways and Means Committee has been outspoken in invoking social science to defend this position The latest research he argues has been unable to demonstrate with any certainty that the quality of day care has much of an impact on a child s future Why invest more money if it won t make a difference in the long run The interesting twist here is that as far as the science is concerned conservatives are right and liberals lag a wishful step behind when they cite sure proof that early day care decisively influences a child s development To make sense of the shakier expertise both sides now confront it helps to trace the history of child care research through three unsettling waves during the past quarter century The first wave crested in the 1970s when researchers faced the question What happens when mothers work The mood was apprehensive the phrasing negative what harm was being done to babies whose mothers leave them in the care of others Psychologists looked at maternal infant bonding as measured by the so called Strange Situation test in which they observed the partings and reunions of babies and mothers and graded the baby s behavior from secure to avoidant All in all the evidence seemed to suggest that infants who spent more than 20 hours a week in nonmaternal care risked being less attached to their mothers and risked displaying uncooperative behavior later in life When these findings left the lab they were promptly construed as political propaganda They were part of a backlash against the women s movement declared Sandra Scarr a professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and prominent day care expert now the CEO of KinderCare in the strident mood of the moment The advice for women has always been to get out of the work force This is just another way of saying the same thing The second wave of studies followed in the 1980s They were more textured and hopeful the question behind them less dour What kind of nonmaternal care can help infants and children Longitudinal studies sought to measure children s development their language skills school achievement cognitive gains social and emotional adjustment etc given different kinds and quality of care in their early years When the widely varying studies detected short term benefits from better quality care liberals and child advocates trumpeted them Meanwhile conservatives seized on findings that such benefits faded in later years Day care research since the early 1990s has been characterized by what the experts call a more ecological approach Studies have lately aimed to take into account children s family characteristics parental living arrangements and attitudes income experience with welfare etc But as Sandra Scarr confessed in a recent paper surveying the child care landscape the results have pulled the rug out from under two decades of work Taken together these studies seem to show that given basically safe child care settings the quality of care has next to no measurable independent effect on children s long term fates Poor day care doesn t seem permanently to harm kids whose lives are otherwise in OK shape Nor can good day care be solidly proven to give a dramatic or lasting boost to kids whose home lives are a mess Sometimes it can help but a child s family appears to be what really counts In retrospect it s clear that earlier studies made too much of small effects on development that were derived from very small samples The complex interaction between family and day care situations to say nothing of individual temperaments defies ready measurement But where does that leave us Liberals and child care advocates no longer armed with evidence to bolster their demands for big investments in child care quality have two choices They can either rely on outmoded studies to argue with conservative politicians who for the moment have the more authoritative pretext for scrimping on day care cost and quality Or they can follow the example set by Scarr Acknowledging the new research and doing some of it herself Scarr still champions quality but now on more immediate less quantitative grounds Her approach points the way for liberals to gain credibility by shedding the onus of being social engineers and take their turn at playing the populist anti expert card Liberals and child advocates can now explain as conservatives have before them that social policy isn t about enforcing officially approved choices They can say that regardless of what the experts tell us it s perfectly obvious that cheap care by relatives and neighbors shouldn t become the only feasible alternative for struggling mothers Parents can make the best decisions for their kids and if they are looking for quality day care it isn t likely to be because someone in a lab coat tells them it will mean an IQ 4 6 points higher at age 15 It will be because they hope it may mean a happier more secure week for their kid and a less anxious one for themselves What s more the chance to take an active choice in the matter as a parent may itself be a step toward the more successful better monitored arrangements that poor working parents and more middle class parents too say they need and want A similarly pragmatic spirit beckons on the conservative side Republican Gov Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York the conservative vanguard on the issue show no inclination to exploit research that says in effect Why care about day care quality Instead they re busy scrounging for funds to spread good care more widely Thompson recently came up with 25 million more for affordable quality child care as welfare mothers head to work 20 million to ensure that the working poor aren t edged out of the subsidized care they count on and 5 million to increase the supply and quality of overall care Of course this decision raises plenty of questions of its own Is 25 million more going to be enough in a state like Wisconsin How should that money be used on more informal arrangements or on more day care centers on stiffer regulations or on other financial incentives to improve quality On some of everything The political debate over those questions will be more practical and less ideological paradoxically enough if scientific claims about a long term payoff or the lack of one are left out of it
