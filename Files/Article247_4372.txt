 Like Father Like Son Dear Judith Nice e mail I m glad to see you re ending this exchange without busting a cap in my ass OK Carmela Soprano is Hillary Clinton I want to run this one by Chatterbox You ve got it exactly right it s evident from the first episodes of the new season that the writers have lost interest in Carmela which is a tragedy because as you put it so well have you ever thought of taking up a career in writing Tony s sister Havarti or whatever she s called is an epic drag Your observations about Carmela and your questions about Meadow and Anthony junior her two children bring us to one of the more interesting subtopics in mobology What do the families know and how do they live with what they know The answer especially to the second question is mostly unknowable to outsiders I have never spoken to a child of a mobster who said straight out yeah my father s a made man and I m not going to cover up for him anymore Even when the father s are dead the children still lie One of Paul Castellano s sons a completely legitimate guy as far as I could tell told me that there is no such thing as organized crime and that his father was set up by the government the same way Clinton was set up Mob families not Families but actual nuclear families are among the most dysfunctional on the planet they lie they wear masks on top of masks and they live off dirty money I remember sitting with Vicky Gotti one day last year asking her what she thought her father really did for a living Remember this is years after her father was convicted of being the boss of the Gambino family No one in America today believes that John Gotti was a simple plumbing supply salesman But all she could come up with was this There s more to my father than people know I asked her what she meant She said There s two sides to this story I asked her to explain further It s just more complicated than what you think She will never be able to say what she knows that her father was boss And yet here s the irony I don t think she s embarrassed by her father s career choice In fact after spending some time with her I came to believe that she sincerely loves him even worships him By the way I don t think Meadow Soprano bought her father s cover story at all She s the one who explained to Anthony junior what their father really did for a living I think you re right though If Meadow heard the unadorned truth she would be miserable You may also be right that Meadow is on the verge of becoming the next great female character But I m waiting for Anthony junior there I go again dissing the female characters to ask his father when he s going to be a made guy This is the acid test of mob character as I said before He who makes his own son instead of keeping him far away from the gangster life is considered the ultimate scumbag Carlo Gambino one of the greats would never induct his own sons Only after Carlo died did his sons get made Sammy the Bull tells a great story When John Gotti bursting with pride told Vincent Chin Gigante that he had just made John junior Gigante said that he was sorry to hear it Talk about a great story line for The Sopranos I d love to see how Tony Soprano reacts if and when his son asks to join the business Tony Soprano is an upwardly mobile gangster so one assumes he d recoil in horror but I m sure the writers of The Sopranos could do something interesting with this Despite my disappointment with the new season so far I have a great deal of faith Judith it s been great doing this piece of work as the button men would say with you I find you to be quite lovable for an intellectual herring Jeff
