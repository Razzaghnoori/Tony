 Background Pelvic floor disorders PFD are highly prevalent among elderly women Many surgical reports attempt to determine the best surgical treatment for PFD yet do not address the pathophysiology The etiology of PFD is probably multifactorial including a genetic predisposition to connective tissue abnormalities vaginal childbirth with damage to the innervation of the pelvic floor muscles estrogen deficiency and aging effects 1 The pelvic floor situated at the bottom of the abdominal cavity forms a supporting shelf for the abdominal and pelvic viscera It has three layers the endopelvic fascia the levator fasciae and muscles and the perineal membrane external anal sphincter The primary support for the pelvic organs comes from the pelvic floor muscles 1 2 This suggests that an alteration to the levator ani supportive function may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PFD 3 which affect 5 of younger and nearly 50 of elderly women 2 In women the levator muscles form a horizontal shelf with an anterior midline cleft the urogenital hiatus through which the urethra vagina and rectum pass Anatomically the levator muscle is subdivided into the iliococcygeal and the pubococcygeal muscles 4 5 Fig 1 The levator ani muscles play an important role in bladder neck fixation provided by the suspensory sling and hiatal ligament 6 The urethra is supported by the action of the levator ani muscles through their connection to the endopelvic fascia of the anterior vaginal wall 7 and the muscles of the levator ani contract during a cough to assist continence 8 The fast twitch type II fibers in the levator ani muscles play an important role in continence and their loss accompanies the development of urinary incontinence 9 Clinically women with recurrent urinary incontinence after Burch colposuspension have a more pronounced pelvic floor weakness than women with primary stress urinary incontinence 10 This suggests that the recurrent urinary incontinence is caused by a progression of pelvic floor dysfunction Severe alteration in the levator ani integrity is associated also with fecal incontinence 11 12 13 Histologic and histochemical analysis of pubococcygeal muscle obtained from asymptomatic women and from women with PFD has shown that both age and parity vaginal delivery appeared to be related to the morphological features of the samples In the symptomatic women there was a significant increase in the number of muscle fibers showing pathological damage The range of diameters of both type I and II fibers was significantly different between symptomatic and asymptomatic women A significant proportion 90 100 of muscle fibers in symptomatic women were type I fibers showed centrally located nuclei and exhibited significantly greater diameter than type I fibers in asymptomatic women 3 However the cellular and molecular aspects of regression of type II fibers are poorly understood Though apoptosis in adult muscles has been described and may result from changes within bcl2 bax system alteration in pathways that regulate differentiation of muscle cells changes in the myonuclei and the nature of pathways inducing senescence of skeletal muscles are still far from being clear 14 Among cell cycle related proteins an important role in the regulation of skeletal muscle differentiation belongs to p27 kip1 p27 protein 15 a cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor required for cell cycle arrest Additionally since the identification and cloning of the p27 gene in 1994 16 the p27 protein has been shown to be involved in various other aspects of cell physiology and pathology 17 Our previous study has shown that differentiation of cells in tissue culture is associated with an increase in p27 expression 18 Although a regular p27 expression protects normal cells from apoptosis overexpression of p27 induces apoptosis of cells through elevation of proapoptotic proteins such as Bax 19 20 These observations indicate that changes in p27 expression can determine the fate of muscle cells Aims of the present study were to investigate p27 expression in levator ani muscle of symptomatic women determine changes with age and compare the p27 expression with histochemical detection of fast and slow twitch muscle fibers in parallel sections Materials and Methods Patients Biopsy samples 5 5 5 mm were collected from 22 symptomatic patients with PFD stress urinary incontinence pelvic organ prolapse fecal incontinence and overlaps age range 38 74 without hormone replacement therapy Besides hormone replacement also excluded from the study were patients with a history of malignancy endometriosis and pelvic infections Tissue sampling from levator ani muscles and fascia illustrated in Fig 1 was based on the work of Bernstein 2 biopsy size and site with some modifications approved by the Institutional Review Board We used similar approaches to obtain the biopsy during reconstructive surgery symptomatic patients and abdominal hysterectomy asymptomatic controls The biopsy sample was always obtained from the right pubococcygeal muscle The biopsy was lateral 20 25 mm to the urethrovesical junction and was performed midway between the urethra and arcus tendinus white line It was lateral enough from the urethra to avoid any alteration of nerves to the urethra and bladder In reconstructive surgery on entering the space of Retzius the fat was pushed aside to expose the superior fascia of the levator ani After incision the fascia biopsy specimen 5 5 mm was collected Next the Allis clamp was used to expose a small part of the pubococcygeal muscle and collect a 5 5 5 mm muscle biopsy specimen For comparison biopsies were obtained from nine asymptomatic women age 31 49 who were having a hysterectomy for benign conditions such as abnormal uterine bleeding fibroids or pelvic pain and no hormone replacement therapy They did not have any demonstrable pelvic relaxation by examination or history of stress urinary incontinence We were unable during a two year period collect biopsies from asymptomatic women of age 50 or older The apparent reason for this is that except for urogynecological indications and cancer there is virtually no reason for abdominal gynecologic surgery in postmenopausal women To ensure the compatibility of biopsy samples the space of Retzius was opened in all patients During abdominal hysterectomy the urinary bladder was pushed down to reach the space of Retzius by incision right behind the pubic bone The fat was pushed aside with the assistance of a hand in the vagina and biopsy was performed as described After biopsy a single figure of eight stitch suture was placed in all patients which corrected any potential loss of support that might be caused by the biopsy This was bloodless and did not create any lasting difficulties None of the control patients developed urinary incontinence or evidence of loss of support or voiding difficulties In younger asymptomatic women we also collected biopsy samples of ectocervix and endometrium from hysterectomy specimens These samples were utilized to determine p27 expression in other tissues for comparison with expression in the skeletal muscle Fig 9 In addition we utilized our collection of frozen human corpora lutea CL from which some observations have been reported previously 21 22 23 in order to determine a relationship of p27 expression with some other cell cycle related proteins under specific circumstances Fig 10 All parts of the study were approved by the Institutional Review Board at our University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine All women underwent the informed consent process and signed informed consent forms before participation

and second up to 2 h we used Kodak XAR film Eastman Kodak Rochester NY Image analysis Evaluation was performed on a Leitz DM RB Leica Inc Wetzlar Germany microscope equipped with differential interference contrast and a DEI 470 CCD Video Camera System Optronics Engineering Goleta CA with detail enhancement The video images were captured by CG 7 color frame grabber Scion Corporation Frederick MD supported by Scion Image public software developed at the National Institutes of Health Wayne Rasband NIH Bethesda MD and ported to Windows 98 The pictures were copied into the Microsoft PowerPoint 97 SR 2 Microsoft Corporation Redmont WA software labeled and saved in Portable Network Graphics format The immunohistochemical staining was quantified as an area in square micrometers maximum area for whole screen was 307 200 sq micrometers at 100 magnification occupied by the densities of peroxidase staining above the sample background as described previously 25 26 Briefly the illumination of empty field image background was first adjusted to 40 in 0 to 255 scale Measurement of an area of peroxidase staining was performed using the density slice method The upper limit of the density slice was set at the 255 maximum density value and the lower limit at 150 sufficiently high above the hematoxylin staining of the nuclei which does not exceed a density value 120 Under these conditions the measured area represented a crude value in square micrometers e g 50 000 To obtain net values each crude value was subtracted with the value of tissue background obtained from the same sample stained with a control staining e g 500 m 2 net value 49 500 m 2 Six measurements were performed on each biopsy sample These six values represented a dataset for a single biopsy patient stained for a particular marker Data in Fig 7represent means of 54 measurements from asymptomatic patients A n 9 and 132 measurements from symptomatic patients S n 22 To evaluate the density of p27 staining in western blots we used a different approach Scanned blot was transferred into the Scion Image enlarged 4 two times 2 and each lane was processed as follows Small square area 20 20 pixels was used to obtain six background measurements above the p27 band Subsequently six measurements of staining within the p27 band crude values were obtained Each crude value was subtracted with corresponding background value giving the six net values of p27 density The net values were used for statistical calculations Statistical analysis Statistical analysis of data was performed using the Statistical Package of the Microsoft Excel 97 SR 2 Microsoft Corporation Redmont WA professional version Descriptive Statistics and GraphPad InStat GraphPad Software Inc San Diego CA www graphpad com software The Mann Whitney Test was used to compare two columns Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance followed by the posthoc Student Newman Keuls Multiple Comparison test was used for a comparison of multiple columns Values of P 0 05 were considered significantly different Power calculations were performed using GraphPad StatMate version 1 01i GraphPad Software A threshold P value alpha of 0 05 two tailed was selected Results and Discussion Western blot analysis Fig 2Ashows that the antibody to p27 clone G173 524 produces a single band at 27 kDa in all investigated tissues and no nonspecific staining is apparent with secondary antibody alone This indicates that all immunohistochemical observations should be ascribed to the specific expression of p27 protein In western blot the most prominent p27 expression was in the late trophoblast culture 120 h as expected from our previous study 18 When compared to trophoblast culture the p27 expression in levator ani muscles was lower but higher then weak expression in whole placenta and rectus fascia Fig 2Bshows quantitative evaluation materials and methods of the blot in panel A The statistical evaluation showed no significant difference between two cases included symptomatic and asymptomatic female in density of p27 expression in levator ani muscles Immunohistochemistry Expression of p27 in levator ani muscle fibers of control asymptomatic women was restricted to the plasma membrane and adjacent nuclei Fig 3A and inset Some muscle fibers close to the levator fascia often showed weak cytoplasmic staining but no change in the cell size Fig 3B Pre and perimenopausal symptomatic patients showed hypertrophy of muscle fibers and this was associated with variable cytoplasmic p27 expression ranging from none to moderate Fig 3C Biopsy samples obtained from symptomatic women in advanced postmenopause showed diminution of size in some fibers accompanied by strong cytoplasmic p27 expression Fig 3D and inset This was accompanied by appearance of cytoplasmic vacuoles in regressing muscle fibers Fig 3E and inset and by an increase in the stromal component s Fig 3Eand 3F Control procedure showed no non specific staining inset Fig 3F These data indicate that hypertrophy of muscle fibers may be accompanied by moderate p27 cytoplasmic expression Further increase in cytoplasmic staining p27 overexpression accompanies shrinking and fragmentation of muscle fibers This was characteristic for symptomatic women in advanced postmenopause suggesting that hormonal changes accompanying postmenopause such as diminution of ovarian sex steroid production might contribute to the degenerative changes in the levator ani muscle From the ovarian sex steroids the role of diminishing estrogen levels is questionable since the levator ani muscle fibers do not express estrogen receptor alpha 2 26 It is not known if estrogen receptor beta is expressed but levator ani muscle fibers show nuclear expression of progesterone and androgen receptors 26 Altered ovarian function in the premenopause can be observed as early as age 43 years and includes hyperestrogenism and hypergonadotropism accompanied by decreased progesterone secretion 27 During the transition from pre to postmenopause both estrogen and androgen levels also decline 28 These hormonal alterations may well be responsible for the increased gynecological morbidity that characterizes this period of life including structural and molecular changes in levator ani muscle and increasing incidence of pelvic floor disorders Diminution of fast twitch fibers We also studied histochemical staining type II and type I fibers along with protein p27 expression Fig 4 A B C is a biopsy from an asymptomatic women age 38 exhibiting a proportional number of fast f Fig 4A and slow twitch fibers s Fig 4B and strong surface and nuclear but no cytoplasmic p27 expression Fig 4C Fig 5is from a symptomatic female age 50 Some muscle fibers exhibited both type I and type II staining representing the transitory t1 and t2 types This was accompanied by p27 cytoplasmic expression in t2 fibers In addition some fibers showed type I staining accompanied by p27 cytoplasmic expression t3 fibers This contrasted with a quiescent genuine fast f and slow twitch s fibers which showed either type I or type II staining and no p27 cytoplasmic expression The transitory fibers often exhibited hypertrophy Occurrence of both type II and type I staining in the same striated muscle fiber has not been described When using the term transitory fibers we are aware that a static picture can not explain the dynamic process However the transitory fibers show both type II and type I staining cytoplasmic p27 expression suggestive of ongoing differentiation 17 18 and marked hypertrophy The occurrence of transitory fibers was also associated with a decline in the number of fibers exhibiting the type II staining only which suggests a type II into type I transition Also a lack of muscle cell shrinking and fragmentation during this process indicates that type II fibers do not degenerate but are transformed into the type I fibers Shrinking and fragmentation of muscle fibers Fig 6Ashows a lack of type II fibers in postmenopausal patient age 63 Type I staining was characteristic for all fibers present including those exhibiting a diminution in size Fig 6B Staining for p27 revealed appearance of weak a1 to moderate cytoplasmic expression a2 in some otherwise normal fibers Very strong p27 expression was characteristic for the fibers exhibiting cytoplasmic vacuolization a3 see also inset Fig 3E and fragmentation a4 arrow i e morphologic features characteristic for the cells undergoing apoptotic cell death 29 Quantitative evaluation of p27 expression Fig 7Ashows cumulative data on p27 expression in levator ani muscle from asymptomatic and symptomatic patients The mean p27 expression in symptomatic patients age range 38 73 years was much higher P 0 0001 when compared to controls age range 31 49 years The power for number of cases was 80 for number of measurements 99 However there was also a highly significant difference in mean age between the groups Fig 7B P 0 0001 power 99 At present we are not able to determine if in asymptomatic postmenopausal women the p27 expression in levator ani muscles also increases with age since non urogynecological surgery except cancer excluded is exceptional in such cases p27 cytoplasmic expression and muscle abnormality An important question is whether the increase in cytoplasmic p27 expression correlates with the age of the patients and the severity of the muscle abnormality Fig 8shows a lack of cytoplasmic p27 staining of levator ani muscle in another control female age 42 panel A exhibiting normal size of muscle fibers n and high proportion of type II fibers panel B Panels C and D show a situation in the youngest patient from symptomatic group age 38 pelvic organ prolapse The muscle fibers show marked hypertrophy h and cytoplasmic p27 expression panel C associated with a lack of type II staining panel D On the other hand panels E and F show a situation in the oldest female in asymptomatic group The size of fibers is normal but moderate p27 cytoplasmic staining is evident panel E This is however accompanied by a lack of fast twitch fibers panel F Hence even in the presence of moderate cytoplasmic p27 expression in muscle fibers of normal size Fig 8E which accompanies depletion of fast twitch fibers panel F the woman may remain continent without an actual evidence of pelvic floor disorder On the other hand cytoplasmic p27 expression accompanying hypertrophy of muscle cells panel C was accompanied by PFD These observations indicate that an increase in cytoplasmic p27 staining may accompany normal female aging age 49 along with the diminution of fast twitch fibers in otherwise normal muscles and without manifestation of PFD Conversely levator ani from younger symptomatic patient age 38 exhibited hypertrophy of muscle cells accompanied by increased cytoplasmic p27 expression and manifestation of PFD Altogether the cytoplasmic p27 expression is indicative of fast to slow twitch transition of levator ani myotubes but not necessarily indicative of manifestation of PFD assuming normal muscle morphology Table 1summarizes our observations and suggests possible pathways for the transition of type II to type I fibers and progression of degeneration of levator ani muscle cells Note that a lack of type I staining is characteristic for fast twitch fibers only row 1 and a lack of p27 cytoplasmic expression is characteristic for the resting fast and slow twitch fibers and fibers in early transition rows 1 2 and 5 Only fibers in row 3 show type II type I and p27 cytoplasmic staining and a lack of type II staining is apparent from row 4 on During transition the fast twitch fibers may increase in size and gradually change into the slow twitch fibers exhibiting regular size Fibers in advanced transition rows 3 and 4 and those undergoing degeneration rows 6 and 7 are associated with cytoplasmic p27 expression Although rows 4 and 6 are similar the latter is associated with the regression of many accompanying myotubes see Fig 3 D F and Fig 6 How unique is the unusual p27 expression for the skeletal muscle p27 is a cyclin dependent kinase cdk inhibitor and is normally expected to be localized to the cell nucleus In normal cells p27 is sequestered and its activity gradually decreases as cells reach S phase p27 preferentially binds cyclin D cdk4 but lower levels of cdk4 in TGF treated cells allow p27 to be available for binding to the cyclin E cdk2 and cyclin A cdk2 p27 is structurally related to the p21 having a similar sequence in the N terminal region Inhibition of cell cycle by p27 and p21 is complemented by retinoblastoma protein pRb and other cell cycle inhibitors tumor suppressor proteins 30 31 32 In reality besides their role in the regulation of the cell cycle the cdk inhibitors in association with D type cyclins cyclin E and cdk2 play a direct role in the stimulation of epithelial cell differentiation 33 p27 is also transiently expressed in developing myotomes and enhances myogenesis 34 The localization of p27 to plasma membrane and the cytoplasm in normal and abnormal striated muscle in vivo raises a question how unique these unusual expressions are for the skeletal muscle cells The observations summarized in Table 1 indicate that cytoplasmic expression of p27 is related to two dynamic processes i advanced transition of fast to slow twitch fibers rows 3 and 4 Table 1 and ii gradual degeneration of muscle cells rows 6 and 7 On the other hand regardless of the status quiescent fast and slow twitch fibers myotubes in transition or degenerating the muscle cells exhibit plasma membrane p27 staining Excellent models for the studies of cell differentiation in vivo are stratified squamous epithelia 35 particularly those that are easily to collect such as the samples of epithelium of ectocervix from hysterectomy specimens In addition the epithelium of ectocervix is hormonally dependent and shows certain changes along with the fluctuations of levels of ovarian steroids during the menstrual cycle Another even more hormonally dependent tissue is endometrium Fig 9shows p27 expression in the ectocervix and corresponding endometrium from the same uteri In ectocervix during the early follicular phase when increasing levels of estrogens stimulate proliferation of stem cells and subsequent shift of cells between the layers toward surface some mature epithelial cells upper intermediate layers showed cytoplasmic p27 staining white arrowhead Fig 9A p27 expression was also apparent in the surface degenerating cells black arrowhead but not between these two layers dotted arrowhead This resembles the transition of type II into type I fibers and degeneration of myotubes In the mid follicular phase p27 staining was restricted to the nuclei white arrow panel B but during the luteal phase when the influence of estrogens is accompanied by progesterone the nuclear p27 diminished black arrow panel C and mature and aged epithelial cells showed surface p27 expression similar to that in all types of muscle fibers In endometrium the early follicular phase was associated with strong stromal p27 expression s panel D accompanied by variable nuclear expression in epithelium of narrow glands arrows In the mid follicular phase stromal and nuclear p27 staining increased further panel E but luteal phase endometrium showed diminution of both panel F Altogether these observations indicate that in addition to the striated muscle cells the cytoplasmic and plasma membrane p27 expression can be observed under certain circumstances in other cell types Yet the cytoplasmic p27 expression in abnormal skeletal muscles also appears to be temporary i e during the transition type II to type I and terminal regression of myotubes Moreover a combined action of estrogens and progesterone characteristic for the luteal phase appears to cause a diminution of nuclear p27 expression in the epithelium of ectocervix and endometrium Fig 9 Cand 9F Curiously the remnants of p27 staining were confined to the nuclear envelope arrows Fig 9 Cand 9F see also Fig 10A suggesting a degradation of p27 in the nuclear core and or a defect of p27 synthesis transport These tissues however do posses nuclear receptors for both steroids 36 37 We did not detect similar fluctuation of nuclear p27 expression in muscle fibers yet myotubes do not exhibit estrogen receptor expression 2 26 However estrogen progesterone and androgen receptors are expressed in the principal cells fibroblasts of levator ani fascia 26 which represents another important component of the pelvic floor involved in its suspensory function and might be a target of the complex effect of hormonal fluctuations during the cycle and influenced by the hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women Some recent studies indicate that long term continuous estrogen replacement is not beneficial yet may worsen or induce the manifestation of PFD 38 39 possibly through the suppression of sex steroid receptor expression in the pelvic floor Since progesterone and androgen receptors are also expressed in the levator ani muscle and long term estrogen replacement therapy appears to suppress their expression 26 both the levator ani fascia and muscle might be affected by continuous estrogen replacement Correlation of cytoplasmic p27 with other cell cycle proteins Cytoplasmic p27 expression in the skeletal muscle and epithelium of ectocervix raises the question if it is associated with some other cell cycle proteins which otherwise show characteristic nuclear localization We investigated ovarian CL another interesting structure for the studies of cell differentiation and degeneration in vivo 21 22 23 and found that cytoplasmic p27 expression is constantly present in the CL of pregnancy Fig 10 panel A shows that the mature CL of the menstrual cycle has p27 expression limited to the luteal vessels luteal cells show only traces of nuclear p27 arrow and no cytoplasmic staining However in the CL of pregnancy nuclei of luteal cells show abundant p27 expression arrow panel B accompanied by moderate cytoplasmic staining Nuclear p27 is also evident in stromal cells s arrowhead When compared to p27 the cyclin D1 is expressed in some nuclei of luteal cells only arrow panel C and absent from the stromal cells in the CL of pregnancy However the cytoplasmic expression of cyclin D1 is similar to that of p27 Staining for cyclin E panel D shows expression in occasional nuclei The insert shows a lack of Ki67 dividing cells Expression of p21 panel E is similar to that of cyclin E The pRb panel F shows nuclear expression similar to that of p27 including stromal cells but no cytoplasmic staining of luteal cells These observations indicate that cytoplasmic expression of p27 correlates with that of cyclin D1 One may speculate that the cdk4 is involved since p27 has a preferential affinity to the cyclin D cdk4 complex If the cytoplasmic p27 expression in abnormal muscle cells is accompanied by staining for cyclin D1 remains however to be established Conclusions This is a first report on the p27 protein expression in normal and abnormal human striated muscle cells in vivo Normal muscle fibers show strong nuclear and plasma membrane expression Cytoplasmic p27 staining accompanies perimenopausal transition of type II to type I fibers In the absence of other muscle abnormalities the diminution of type II fibers alone is not necessarily accompanied by PFD Pelvic floor disorders in perimenopausal patients are associated with the hypertrophy of muscle cells and moderate cytoplasmic p27 expression while PFD during advanced postmenopause are associated with shrinking and fragmentation of muscle cells and cytoplasmic p27 overexpression The cytoplasmic and plasma membrane p27 expression is not unique to the muscle
