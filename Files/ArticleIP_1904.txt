 Confessions of a Cybershaman The dramatic growth of the Internet has people extrapolating wildly Every day we see something new and amazing Surely given what we have seen so far the future is bright Don t believe me Need more details Just ask your resident visionary Predicting the future of technology has gone from a minor sideline of the scientists and engineers actively building that future to a discipline of its own No technology company worth its salt lacks a full time visionary on staff And every marketer and spinmeister must be a junior visionary The higher placed your visionary the more visionary your company will seem so by all means promote one to vice president Even so make sure the CEO does the vision thing as well Visionary has even become a profession As Hunter S Thompson once wrote When the going gets weird the weird turn pro Their business cards don t have visionary on them but these people are not hard to spot They may be fellows at some impressive sounding institute you ve never heard of before Or they might write a magazine column and have recently published a best selling book If you need more vision than that you can subscribe to their newsletters attend their elite annual conferences of industry big shots or invite them to speak or consult for astronomical fees Being a visionary is a new profession but it is really just a variant on fortunetelling which may be the world s oldest And its marketing appeal is similar people will pay for reassurance about the unknown The fortunetellers of old had many techniques Yet the crystal balls and tea leaves are just apparatus All fortunetelling in fact rests on three pillars First you must tell people more or less what you think they want to hear Second you must spice your predictions with drama Nobody wants a prediction that the future will be more or less like the present even if that is statistically speaking an excellent prediction Predictions must involve either acquiring or losing love wealth or life itself ideally a combination of all three Third your predictions must somehow avoid measurement of their accuracy Many tricks have been invented to serve this end Predictions can be vague for example or couched in complicated gibberish Either way there is a loophole And customers generally don t mind Seeking advice about the future is more about relieving insecurity or anxiety than about achieving statistical accuracy But being a fortuneteller is harder these days Chicken entrails aren t enough you need to channel the spirit of an 11 000 year old warrior Or you become a technological visionary for the Internet The techniques of being an Internet visionary are just like those of lower tech fortunetellers through the ages A technological visionary must tell people what they want to hear because your company s stock won t rise if you spout an unpopular vision to analysts Big shots won t speak at your conference if you piss them off Internet visionaries also use standard soap opera themes A popular one life and death not of people but of companies or even better entire industries Tell em that old media are going to die There seems to be an infinite appetite for this despite precious little evidence If you hurry you can tell them that push will conquer all but that one s got a week left at best Talk like an action hero so you seem tough and important And be bold It is better to predict dramatic things that don t happen than boring things that do Most of all being a technological visionary is not about predicting what will actually happen This astounded me when I first realized it and even now I am not really comfortable with the thought Technology and engineering are all about testing hypotheses against reality aren t they Yet there is no evidence that the public or the press holds any technological visionaries accountable In fact many latter day Internet fortunetellers don t even bother with vagueness or complicated loopholes They just baldly spout predictions certain that nobody will care if these predictions are true Aconfession I have been accused of being a visionary myself And in all candor I fit the profile What can I say in my defense I say this The problem does not rest with us visionaries Sure there are a few bad apples in every crate and a few legitimate deep thinkers who sometimes get carried away But most visionaries are smart and honorable people who are sincerely interested in the future The problem is the need that drives people to visionaries in the first place Technology is driving our lives at a torrid pace That generates many concerns Will my company come through this richer or poorer Will my job be safe What does it all mean The technology that shapes the modern world is as incomprehensible to most people as the forces of nature were to a society of hunter gatherers So we turn to technological visionaries as we once turned to shamans This call to play fortuneteller is not easily refused A reporter from a major publication cornered me recently and said Nathan I only have a couple of minutes Quick what is your vision Twenty fifteen I riposted but only with my glasses on Ho ho But he didn t want a joke Nor did he want a carefully constructed set of arguments projecting current trends or a well reasoned strategy He wanted a sound bite something pithy to take out of context What does it matter that you have the whole truth if you can t understand it In this context it is understandable that nobody really cares about a visionary s track record If next week s vision is exactly the opposite of this week s don t hesitate to tell that one too Among modern occupations only cult leaders and TV weathermen rival the technological visionary s ability to retain credibility despite all evidence to the contrary There is an antidote to visionary disease We as a society have to learn more about the technology that is shaping our lives and become more comfortable with it Few people these days believe that evil spirits cause illness that the rain god causes rain or that electric light bulbs are mystical We do not fear the forces of nature as much as our species once did because we understand those forces better Even if most people don t actually understand say where hurricanes come from there is widespread comfort with the notion that some experts do At the same time there is widespread appreciation that even weather experts have their limits which empowers people to treat experts as mortals rather than as gods One day the technology that today creates a market for visionaries will be as mundane as light bulbs People who have grown up with that technology will be as comfortable with it as we are with light bulbs today They will not be as dependent on cybershamans There is a name for the people who will accomplish this daunting task and put corporate visionaries like me out of business We call them children But they ll have their own fears about the future and so my last prediction the future of the fortunetelling industry is secure
