 Introduction IL 10 is a potent monocyte macrophage regulatory cytokine that inhibits expression of proinflammatory mediators 1 2 Monocytes macrophages B cells murine Th2 cells and some CD8 cells produce IL 10 3 4 Macrophages rapidly produce proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF IL 1 and IL 12 after activation with lipopolysaccharide or IFN while production of IL 10 is delayed Once IL 10 is produced it functions in an autoregulatory fashion to suppress proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression and protein production 5 6 7 In addition IL 10 suppresses the expression of MHC class II molecules and costimulatory molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and B7 leading to reduction in T cell macrophage interactions 8 9 10 The selective suppression of Th1 cell activity is believed to be due to IL 10 inhibition of IL 12 a differentiation factor for Th1 cells 11 12 The release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates by macrophages is also suppressed by IL 10 13 14 In addition IL 10 stimulates the production of cytokine inhibitors such as IL 1 receptor antagonist 15 In patients with rheumatoid arthritis IL 10 is produced by synovial membrane cells and is found at high levels in the synovial fluid 16 17 It has been shown that suppression of IL 10 production by synovial cells is associated with increased levels of IL 1 and TNF suggesting that IL 10 plays a suppressive role in rheumatoid arthritis joints 16 It was also observed that IL 10 directly stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and reversed the cartilage degradation induced by activated mononuclear cells 18 These immunosuppressive activities indicate that IL 10 is a potential therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases In animal models of arthritis systemic treatment with IL 10 and adenovirus mediated transfer of viral IL 10 moderately suppresses the development of arthritis but is significantly more effective when combined with IL 4 19 20 21 22 23 24 The evidence for the importance of IL 10 is further supported by the fact that in vivo anti IL 10 treatment accelerates disease in collagen induced arthritis CIA 22 Most studies focused on investigating the role of IL 10 in models of arthritis have involved administration of neutralizing antibodies large amounts of IL 10 or gene therapy in experimental animals While these studies are helpful in broadly defining the function of IL 10 it is difficult to determine the cytokine dose and timing by these means To address the effects of complete elimination of IL 10 in vivo on the development of CIA and to understand the mechanism responsible for IL 10 regulation we examined the development of arthritis in homozygous IL 10 IL 10 deficient mice Materials and methods Animals antigens and immunization procedure The IL 10 mice were generated as previously described 25 The original genetic background of these animals was a mixture of the strains 129 Ola and C57BL 6 These IL 10 mice were backcrossed to DBA 1 for six generations and further backcrossed for an additional two generations to DBA 1 Jackson Laboratories Bar Harbor MA USA in our laboratory All mice were typed for the IL 10 mutation by PCR using primer sets that detect either the DBA 1 wildtype WT or the mutated IL 10 gene In addition splenocytes from IL 10 mice activated in vitro did not produce IL 10 The IL 10 mice were maintained in sterilized bedding and food with acidified water Chicken type II collagen was used for generation of arthritis as described elsewhere 26 Male and female WT heterozygous IL 10 and IL 10 mice were immunized once with 100 g chicken type II collagen emulsified in complete Freund s adjuvant CFA Difco Detroit MI USA by intradermal injection at the base of the tail Assessment of arthritis Animals were examined for the onset of joint swelling every other day A standard scoring system based upon redness and swelling of each paw ranging from 0 to 4 for each paw thus resulting in a possible maximum severity score of 16 was used for the assessment of disease severity Histologic studies were performed to determine the extent of joint damage At the end of the experiment hind paws were dissected fixed and decalcified before being embedded in paraffin and were sectioned at 6 m as previously described 27 Sagittal sections were stained with H E Assessment of cytokine production by spleen cells in vitro Spleens were obtained at various time points after immunization with collagen Single cell suspensions were prepared as previously described 28 Splenocytes 2 0 10 6cells ml were incubated in 24 well Falcon plates Fisher Scientific Pittsburgh PA USA in RPMI 1640 media containing 7 fetal bovine serum Life Technologies Grand Island NY USA 100 U ml penicillin 100 g ml streptomycin 2 mM L glutamine 50 mM 2 ME 1 mM sodium pyruvate 0 01 mM nonessential amino acids and 10 mM HEPES Cells were stimulated in the presence or absence of collagen 100 g ml IFN was measured from day 5 supernatant using the OptEIA mouse cytokine detection system BD PharMingen San Diego CA USA Measurement of immunoglobulin isotypes An ELISA was used to measure isotype specific antibodies in serial dilutions 1 500 1 2500 of sera ELISA plates were coated with 1 g chicken type II collagen Collagen specific IgG isotypes were detected with peroxidase labeled rabbit anti mouse IgG 1 or IgG 2a Zymed Laboratories San Francisco CA USA Titrated concentrations of IgG 1 and IgG 2a myeloma proteins were used to generate a standard curve and the IgGs were detected with the same labeled rabbit anti mouse IgG 1 or IgG 2a antiserum Flow cytometry Flow cytometry was performed on freshly isolated spleen cells Immunofluorescence staining of cell surface markers was performed using FITC labeled antibodies against CD3 B220 CD11b and CD11c BD PharMingen FITC labeled rat IgG isotypes were used as controls FcRs were blocked using anti FcR antibody 24G2 Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACS Caliburflow cytometer utilizing CELLQuest software Becton Dickinson San Jose CA USA Statistical analysis Analysis of the arthritis score and disease incidence at different time points were carried out using the nonparametric Mann Whitney U test Student s t test was used for statistical analysis of all other data Analyses were performed using SPSS software SPSS Chicago IL USA Results Augmented CIA in DBA 1 mice lacking IL 10 To determine whether IL 10 functions as an endogenous inhibitor of inflammatory arthritis we examined the development of disease using the CIA model Male and female WT IL 10 and IL 10 littermates were immunized with collagen in CFA intradermally Data from the male and female mice were pooled because there was no significant difference between the two groups All mice succumb to arthritis but the time of onset was somewhat delayed in the WT and IL 10 mice compared with that in the IL 10 mice Fig 1a Interestingly the number of arthritic WT and IL 10 animals began to recede after day 35 whereas all IL 10 mice were still arthritic at the time of termination of the experiments although with reduced severity Arthritis severity in IL 10 mice was significantly exacerbated in comparison with that of WT or IL 10 mice Fig 1b Inflamed joints showed typical histopathological abnormalities described previously synovial proliferation leukocyte infiltration cartilage and bone erosions 29 30 which correlated well with the severity of the clinical symptoms Taken together the results described demonstrate that IL 10 is important for controlling disease severity Anticollagen antibody is reduced in IL 10 deficient mice Induction of CIA is dependent on B cells and high doses of antibodies are pathogenic when transferred to na ve recipients 31 IL 10 can affect both the viability and the production of immunoglobulin by B cells 32 33 To determine whether the augmentation in CIA correlated with an alteration in anticollagen antibodies we collected sera from animals at the time of sacrifice Interestingly IL 10 mice produced significantly less anticollagen antibody than either WT or IL 10 mice Fig 2 Both the IgG 1 and the IgG 2a isotypes of anticollagen antibodies were substantially reduced These results suggest that a decrease in anticollagen antibody may be the result of a requirement for IL 10 in B cell antibody production IFN levels are reduced in IL 10 deficient mice IFN production is observed early in collagen immunized mice and progressively increases with the time of clinical manifestation of arthritis Although the level of IFN correlates with disease IFN appears to play a dual role in disease activity Anti IFN treatment early in the course of disease suppresses arthritis whereas neutralization of IFN late in disease exacerbates arthritis In addition IFN receptor deficient mice exhibit exacerbated disease 34 35 We were therefore interested in determining whether the levels of IFN correlated with arthritis in collagen immunized WT IL 10 and IL 10 mice Splenocytes were isolated from immunized mice and cultured in the presence and absence of collagen Fig 3 IFN levels were significantly suppressed in the IL 10 mice in comparison with either WT or IL 10 animals These results confirm that reduced levels of IFN were associated with exacerbated arthritis in collagen immunized animals These data also suggest that IL 10 positively regulates IFN either directly or indirectly CD11b expansion correlates with reduced IL 10 Matthys et al recently showed that the enhanced severity of CIA in IFN receptor deficient mice immunized with type II collagen in CFA is due to an expansion of the CD11b cells 36 Since IL 10 mice produce reduced levels of IFN we were interested in determining whether there was a specific expansion of CD11b cells Although the spleen cell number increased in IL 10 mice 1 42 10 8 0 17 in comparison with WT mice 0 84 10 8 0 23 there was a specific expansion of the CD11b cell population The spleen from WT mice contained 10 7 CD11b cells whereas the spleen of IL 10 mice contained 22 5 CD11b cells Table 1 When the percentage of cells was corrected for cell number there was a 3 7 fold increase in CD11b cells in the spleen of IL 10 mice The net number of T cells B cells and dendritic cells was not significantly different These data are consistent with the inhibitory effects of IFN on expansion of CD11b cells The data suggest that IL 10 is important for controlling IFN and or other cytokines involved in the process of CD11b cell expansion In an attempt to understand the mechanism responsible for the expansion of CD11b macrophages in IL 10 mice we examined cytokines associated with inflammation and Th1 cell phenotype We were unable to detect any difference in the IL 12 or TNF levels in IL 10 mice in comparison with WT mice However IL 1 was significantly increased in IL 10 animals Fig 4 These results suggest the possibility that IL 1 may play a role in CD11b cell expansion Discussion IL 10 appears to play an important role in the regulation of several autoimmune disease models Treatment with recombinant IL 10 in CIA in proteoglycan induced arthritis and in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis reduced disease severity and neutralizing IL 10 with antibodies exacerbated disease 19 20 22 23 The present data are consistent with previous results and show that a complete absence of IL 10 exacerbates inflammation in CIA 37 38 39 The anti inflammatory properties of IL 10 suggest that endogenous IL 10 may function as a regulator of proinflammatory mediators in vivo 39 It is interesting however that disease severity inversely correlates with the levels of IFN in IL 10 mice suggesting that IL 10 may control disease activity via regulating IFN responses Although CIA is considered a Th1 type disease mediated by IFN the role of IFN in the pathogenesis of CIA is not clearly understood IFN appears to have two separate functions disease promoting as well as disease limiting 40 Neutralization of IFN with antibodies early in the course of disease exerts a suppressive effect whereas anti IFN treatment late in disease enhances arthritis 41 Also disease severity in CIA is enhanced in IFN receptor deficient mice and loss of the IFN receptor turns mice normally resistant to CIA into an arthritis susceptible strain 34 35 IFN thus provides a dominant protective effect in CIA The reduction in IFN in IL 10 deficient mice is consistent with the disease limiting properties of IFN These results suggest that IL 10 plays an unexpected role in regulating IFN production in CIA Recent work by Matthys et al demonstrates that the protective effect of IFN is dependent on the presence of the mycobacterial component of the adjuvant 36 Only when mice are immunized with collagen in CFA is there an increase in disease severity in IFN receptor deficient mice Ablation of IFN in these mice is associated with extramedullary hemopoiesis and expansion of CD11b cells Consistent with this observation a similar increase in CD11b cells was observed in the IL 10 mice These data suggest that IL 10 controls the IFN concentration in vivo and that the reduced level of IFN in IL 10 mice contributes to expansion of CD11b cells and increase in disease severity The increase in IL 1 we observed in IL 10 mice may account for the increase in CD11b cells as IL 1 is known for its hematopoietic properties 42 In addition to the cellular immune response anticollagen antibodies are required for the development of arthritis In the studies presented despite the increase in disease severity in the IL 10 mice anticollagen antibodies are reduced This reduction in antibody levels may be a direct effect on B cells due to a loss of IL 10 or may be an indirect effect due to downregulation by IFN The Th1 cytokine IFN is important in vitro and in vivo for enhancement of IgG 2a secretion 43 It is expected that loss of IFN should result in a reduced collagen specific IgG 2a response but it is unexpected that the IgG 1 response would also be reduced These results indicate that IL 10 has a direct effect on maintaining antibody production in CIA In addition loss of the anti inflammatory effect of IL 10 appears to overdrive the requirements for high levels of anticollagen antibodies in CIA Conclusion In summary these results suggest that IL 10 is an important regulator of inflammation in vivo In CIA a deficiency in IL 10 leads to an increase in disease severity The corresponding reduction in IFN levels and the expansion of CD11b cells suggests a potential mechanism for IL 10 regulation of CIA Abbreviations CFA complete Freund s adjuvant CIA collagen induced arthritis ELISA
