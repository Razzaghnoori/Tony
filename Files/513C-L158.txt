 May 12 1994 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Dr Name An another academic year comes to an end I am pleased to report that your IU School of Dentistry is continuing its leadership role in advancing dental education Our faculty students and staff are reviewing all aspects of the school curriculum competencies financial management just to name a few to make sure that we remain at the forefront of dental education Indeed our entire second floor is being renovated this summer so that our physical facility can accommodate the changing needs of our school Private donations to the IU School of Dentistry play an essential role enabling us to continue as one of the top dental schools in the country There are several critical areas which cannot be funded by the citizens of the State of Indiana and without these programs our school cannot completely fulfill its mission Student scholarships special faculty research and advancements in technology need to be funded with contributions from alumni and friends of the school Your contributions to the school in the past have been very important to us and I sincerely hope that you will make a financial investment in the IU School of Dentistry this year I have enclosed a brochure which explains more about our needs These are challenging times for dental schools across the country and I firmly believe our ability to remain in a leadership position will be enhanced with your support Please consider this request carefully it is very important to us the future of dental care in Indiana and your private practice Sincerely H William Gilmore DDS Dean
