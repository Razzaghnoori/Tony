 OK Are you ready Ready All right This is the story of Robin Hood Robin Hood is uh or was way back when the home of my mother as she grew up in Alma Michigan Um it was a community that was put together by Englishmen um they were all farms and each one had a name like Robin Hood or something to do with England Uh there was some land that would have been so many acres per house and Robin Hood um had fond memories for my mother But the story I want to tell happens more um as I was a little girl so it was many years later I was born in 1936 Uh we were at my grandfather s farm which was a different farm at that time but it s still in the same Alma Michigan uh area And my aunts were all visiting my uncles and the cousins were there also And one of the aunts or my mother said Let s go see Robin Hood Well Robin Hood had been they moved many years ago from there uh so we all piled into the car and went to see Robin Hood As we drove up to Robin Hood you could tell it was left to the elements There was grass waving in the breeze and it was rather sad no paint on the house but you could see it had been a beautiful home at one time We went up the back porch uh the well was open anyone could ve fallen into the well it was in the back porch or the side porch Went in and uh it always mother had always talked about the staircase and how beautiful it was and indeed it probably had been As we walked up the stairs the window was broken and the shade was flapping in the breeze and the wallpaper was wet from the rain and the elements had been coming in for years as we walked through the home and I have fond memories of that day I was probably in the fifth or sixth grade I would imagine Um we went outdoors then went into the barn and there was a dead calf in the barn Now whether that calf had just wandered in or whatever I don t know Uh we ourselves lived in Grand Rapids Michigan so we went home uh from Grandpa s farm that night Uh and my mother sat down probably that first week and she wrote a poem and uh the poem tells a lot My mother s name was uh Catherine Berry McGovern The poem is titled The Place of my Childhood Dreams Nearer and nearer my footsteps led me Back to the place of my childhood dreams Cautiously I opened the door I remembered no key had been turned in the lock Slowly I entered each battered room And saw the cracked plaster the discolored walls Lastly I ascended the old open stairway Once the pride of my joyful young life At the landing I gazed out the window And there was the woods in the distance The woods where we had gathered wildflowers in the spring And then I remembered our mother s voice calling from somewhere Children be sure to put them in water tis cruel to pluck them and then let them wither and die Slowly as I had entered I walked from the home of my childhood dreams As if from some sacred tomb I d walked down and out and into the bright sunny spring air The birds I could hear them singing How I had loved any one of those songs Our favorite rosebush was gone I saw And wondered if others had loved it as I From the distance the town hall clock was striking the school bell was ringing I could hear from the small town away Then suddenly the thought came The sights and the sounds of the world could go on forever But the place of my childhood dreams could never again feel the same inside It s beautiful My mother um had a wonderful life really Uh Robin Hood they moved into Robin Hood as a brand new farm It burned within the first month that they were there It was then rebuilt and they moved in And I believe after a time they really couldn t afford to live there any more So they moved to another farm and lo and behold that house also caught on fire Um as I grew up we lived in the city until I was in the sixth grade And Mother and Dad then purchased an old farmhouse and remodeled this farmhouse it took al took almost a year to remodel It wa it was a wonderful uh farm it had wonderful gardens as you might tell my mother was a gardener Um when they were still remodeling the house it was Christmastime and we still lived in the city the phone rang uh whether it did or it didn t my father said it did And we went uh he said that we had to go out to the farm because uh someone had left the light on in the barn So we piled into the car Christmas Eve and it was snowing so beautiful Typical as I remember dream Christmas Eve And we went out and we drove up the driveway and Daddy went down to the bottom the barn and as we opened the door a horse whinnied And it was our first horse that we had it was uh a Christmas present And I still can picture that with the uh the light the outdoor light of the barn and the snow coming down it was really beautiful But uh we lived there we moved in the spring of 48 and uh February around February 10 of 1959 I got a call and the house was on fire It was winter and of course there wasn t any water and uh they just had water in the tank truck and the house was gutted out as a result of that My father was in the hospital at the time and he died a month later So my mother then left our home and uh didn t have a home to go to and built a home in the city then uh was happy there although she was lonely I m sure And uh created another garden but was never the same thing There was a piano that was always in each one of those homes My sister still has that piano and uh still has the best tune of any piano I ve ever heard Sorry for my crackly voice It s been difficult but I loved her Um when my mother passed away she passed away in 1992 and uh after her funeral we went out to the farm By then it someone else had built a house on the same spot what had been a dirt road was then a four lane highway We pulled into the driveway and someone was living in the house of course and the barn was still there I mean the house that they had built on this property Where there had been a formal garden to the left of the driveway was then a woods as time had taken its toll And um the people were very happy to see us And it was a very healing experience we walked the property somewhat We walked down to the creek and the watercress was still growing in the creek as it had as I grew up Uh it was interesting that the man was sensitive as we are and he said that they would go to certain corners of the fields on the property that was sixty seven acres and you could still feel Mr McGovern s presence And uh I liked that because my father was a very sensitive man although he came across as he was being very gruff he was not OK
