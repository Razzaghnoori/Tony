 A helping hand for helping hands INLAND VALLEY March 9 2002 Mancy Mintie s Uncommon Good organization pays the school debts of attorneys and health care workers dedicated to serving those less fortunate By Joanna Corman joanna corman latimes com Linda Samels Ceballos entered Loyola Law School in Los Angeles knowing she wanted to represent the poor She graduated in 1995 owing 58 000 in loans She was about to run out of means to pay back those loans when she took a job at the Inner City Law Center in Los Angeles a firm that fights slum landlords It was there that she met Nancy Mintie Mintie a Claremont resident made it possible for Ceballos to represent poor clients against wealthy landlords a calling about as low paying as lawyer jobs get and pay off her loans at the same time It kind of stepped in at the right time said Ceballos who has loan payments averaging 800 a month and whose starting salary was 30 000 Because of the program I ve been able to stay here There was no way I could make that payment I barely make it now with my regular bills Mintie who turns 48 this month started Uncommon Good in December 1999 The nonprofit operation pays the debts of attorneys and health care professionals who work with the poor It grew out of her work at the Inner City Law Center which she founded in 1980 and often depended on the skills of young lawyers with a social conscience In 1998 she stepped down from her role as director Over the next year she realized she needed incentives to keep lawyers around after they got a few years of experience Not only were there fewer attorneys entering the field of poverty law some were being driven out of the profession The reason With attorneys one year out of graduate school facing an average debt of just less than 90 000 and starting salaries at legal aid organizations averaging 31 000 they couldn t afford the job It really had become an economic impossibility to take these jobs and survive on them Mintie said That finding became the wake up call for me and hopefully it will be the wake up call for others in a community that cares about access to justice for the poor Her career started more than 20 years ago in a garage behind a Catholic Worker soup kitchen on skid row in Los Angeles She lived on a 3 a week stipend that she spent on pantyhose and bus fare Her law practice grew to an organization that brought in millions of dollars of damages through its cases against L A slumlords allowing poor families to set up college funds and buy homes In all those years she never lost a case When she stepped down she had time to notice what was happening to the field of poverty law I realized with a shock that the work had really disintegrated and we had lost a whole generation of public interest lawyers she said It had gone from being an economic sacrifice as it was in my day to an economic impossibility The whole system has essentially collapsed Mintie also started to ask questions about the medical field Almost every person who walks into a free medical clinic she said faces some legal problem such as an eviction or the loss of Social Security benefits And many of her clients had medical problems from living in slum housing such as cockroaches lodged in ear canals and rat bite fever a nonfatal malady that particularly affects children Mintie noticed that health care professionals were graduating with staggering debts and also couldn t afford to work with the poor Her work was noticed by Oprah Winfrey who invited her on the TV show March 26 2001 Mintie received a 100 000 Use Your Life Award from Oprah s Angel Network a nonprofit organization that awards money to those who help others Mintie said that all of the money has gone to her recipients none was spent on overhead She will be out of funds by spring She is trying to get religious organizations to sponsor recipients It is a secular organization but one that grew out of Mintie s religious convictions I was raised Catholic I think the tradition for compassion for the poor encouraged that gift in me she said My faith said Yes this is right She said she hopes that religious organizations see the link between their beliefs and her work For so long there has been such misunderstanding between the religious community and the work lawyers do for the poor The work that we do is the purest form of expression of the core values of all of the major faith traditions Uncommon Good has a few religious sponsors including her church Our Lady of the Assumption in Claremont where Mintie plays piano daily at the 6 30 a m Mass Fourteen people now receive money from Uncommon Good Debt payments can be as low as 300 a month and as high as 2 000 Some recipients grew up poor and want to give back while others feel the need despite having a middle class upbringing But a commonality among some of them was a decision all faced should they leave their jobs for higher paying ones Their low salaries and high debt payments were making it impossible to live Recipients include Lisa Levsen 33 a doctor who graduated from USC Medical School with 144 000 in debt and monthly loan payments of 1 200 She works as the head physician at the Los Angeles Mission a free clinic on skid row And William Martinez 28 who cut his medical school studies short because he couldn t afford the 39 000 in loans after two years of graduate school and four years of college Martinez works two jobs as a physician s assistant and supports his elderly parents and 8 year old son Uncommon Good has a 22 member board of doctors lawyers and representatives of Christian groups and is recruiting mentors One goal is to get the state Legislature to pass a law to provide loan forgiveness to medical professionals and lawyers who work with the poor Mintie said she hopes her organization can be a national model for other professions She is trying to bring legal aid services to the Inland Valley the closest legal aid office is in El Monte and represents 700 000 poor people throughout the San Fernando San Gabriel and Inland valleys Unless the legal aid is in the community you can t say you are serving the poor Mintie said Neal Dudovitz is the executive director of Neighborhood Legal Services of Los Angeles County the legal aid office in El Monte He sees attorneys new to poverty law leave all the time because they can t afford the salary with their law school debt She s really opened a lot of eyes in terms of having people understand how the educational debt is limiting and reducing the services that are available to low income communities Dudovitz said Nancy is light years ahead of the curve on this stuff Very little is being done practically to solve it Mintie her colleagues say could have made a lot of money in private practice She s very kind and pleasant said Julius Thompson 45 an attorney at Inner City Law Center and an Uncommon Good recipient But she s also a woman on a mission When she sets her sights on something she s a formidable force
