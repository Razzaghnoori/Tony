                        HOW TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY OF ORGANIZING THE GOVERNMENT            As presently configured the national security institutions of the US government                are still the institutions constructed to win the Cold War The United States                confronts a very different world today Instead of facing a few very dangerous                adversaries the United States confronts a number of less visible challenges that                surpass the boundaries of traditional nationstates and call for quick imaginative                and agile responses            The men and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the s                and s They restructured the government so that it could protect the country                That is now the job of the generation that experienced  Those attacks showed                emphatically that ways of doing business rooted in a different era are just not                good enough Americans should not settle for incremental ad hoc adjustments to a                system designed generations ago for a world that no longer exists            We recommend significant changes in the organization of the government We know that                the quality of the people is more important than the quality of the wiring diagrams                Some of the saddest aspects of the  story are the outstanding efforts of so many                individual officials straining often without success against the boundaries of the                possible Good people can overcome bad structures They should not have to            The United States has the resources and the people The government should combine                them more effectively achieving unity of effort We offer five major                recommendations to do that                            unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning against Islamist                    terrorists across the foreigndomestic divide with a National Counterterrorism                    Center                unifying the intelligence community with a new National Intelligence Director                unifying the many participants in the counterterrorism effort and their                    knowledge in a networkbased informationsharing system that transcends                    traditional governmental boundaries                unifying and strengthening congressional oversight to improve quality and                    accountability and                strengthening the FBI and homeland defenders                        UNITY OF EFFORT ACROSS THE FOREIGNDOMESTIC DIVIDE            Joint Action            Much of the public commentary about the  attacks has dealt with lost                opportunitiessome of which we reviewed in chapter  These are often                characterized as problems of watchlisting of information sharing or of                connecting the dots In chapter  we explained that these labels are too narrow                They describe the symptoms not the disease            In each of our examples no one was firmly in charge of managing the case and able to                draw relevant intelligence from anywhere in the government assign responsibilities                across the agencies foreign or domestic track progress and quickly bring                obstacles up to the level where they could be resolved Responsibility and                accountability were diffuse            The agencies cooperated some of the time But even such cooperation as there was is                not the same thing as joint action When agencies cooperate one defines the problem                and seeks help with it When they act jointly the problem and options for action                are defined differently from the start Individuals from different backgrounds come                together in analyzing a case and planning how to manage it            In our hearings we regularly asked witnesses Who is the quarterback The other                players are in their positions doing their jobs But who is calling the play that                assigns roles to help them execute as a team            Since  those issues have not been resolved In some ways joint work has gotten                better and in some ways worse The effort of fighting terrorism has flooded over                many of the usual agency boundaries because of its sheer quantity and energy                Attitudes have changed Officials are keenly conscious of trying to avoid the                mistakes of  They try to share information They circulateeven to the                Presidentpractically every reported threat however dubious            Partly because of all this effort the challenge of coordinating it has multiplied                Before  the CIA was plainly the lead agency confronting al Qaeda The FBI                played a very secondary role The engagement of the departments of Defense and State                was more episodic                            Today the CIA is still central But the FBI is much more active along with                    other parts of the Justice Department                The Defense Department effort is now enormous Three of its unified commands                    each headed by a fourstar general have counterterrorism as a primary mission                    Special Operations Command Central Command both headquartered in Florida and                    Northern Command headquartered in Colorado                A new Department of Homeland Security combines formidable resources in border                    and transportation security along with analysis of domestic vulnerability and                    other tasks                The State Department has the lead on many of the foreign policy tasks we                    described in chapter                 At the White House the National Security Council NSC now is joined by a                    parallel presidential advisory structure the Homeland Security Council                        So far we have mentioned two reasons for joint actionthe virtue of joint planning                and the advantage of having someone in charge to ensure a unified effort There is a                third the simple shortage of experts with sufficient skills The limited pool of                critical expertsfor example skilled counterterrorism analysts and linguistsis                being depleted Expanding these capabilities will require not just money but time            Primary responsibility for terrorism analysis has been assigned to the Terrorist                Threat Integration Center TTIC created in  based at the CIA headquarters but                staffed with representatives of many agencies reporting directly to the Director of                Central Intelligence Yet the CIA houses another intelligence fusion center the                Counterterrorist Center that played such a key role before  A third major                analytic unit is at Defense in the Defense Intelligence Agency A fourth                concentrating more on homeland vulnerabilities is at the Department of Homeland                Security The FBI is in the process of building the analytic capability it has long                lacked and it also has the Terrorist Screening Center                        The USgovernment cannot afford so much duplication of effort There are not enough                experienced experts to go around The duplication also places extra demands on                already hardpressed singlesource national technical intelligence collectors like                the National Security Agency            Combining Joint Intelligence and Joint Action            A smart government would integrate all sources of information to see the enemy as a                whole Integrated allsource analysis should also inform and shape strategies to                collect more intelligence Yet the Terrorist Threat Integration Center while it has                primary responsibility for terrorism analysis is formally proscribed from having                any oversight or operational authority and is not part of any operational entity                other than reporting to the director of central intelligence                        The government now tries to handle the problem of joint management informed by                analysis of intelligence from all sources in two ways                            First agencies with lead responsibility for certain problems have constructed                    their own interagency entities and task forces in order to get cooperation The                    Counterterrorist Center at CIA for example recruits liaison officers from                    throughout the intelligence community The militarys Central Command has its                    own interagency center recruiting liaison officers from all the agencies from                    which it might need help The FBI has Joint Terrorism Task Forces in                     locations to coordinate the activities of other agencies when action may be                    required                Second the problem of joint operational planning is often passed to the White                    House where the NSC staff tries to play this role The national security staff                    at the White House both NSC and new Homeland Security Council staff has                    already become  percent larger since  But our impression after talking                    to serving officials is that even this enlarged staff is consumed by meetings                    on daytoday issues sifting each days threat information and trying to                    coordinate everyday operations                        Even as it crowds into every square inch of available office space the NSC staff is                still not sized or funded to be an executive agency In chapter  we described some                of the problems that arose in the s when a White House staff constitutionally                insulated from the usual mechanisms of oversight became involved in direct                operations During the s Richard Clarke occasionally tried to exercise such                authority sometimes successfully but often causing friction            Yet a subtler and more serious danger is that as the NSC staff is consumed by these                daytoday tasks it has less capacity to find the time and detachment needed to                advise a president on larger policy issues That means less time to work on major                new initiatives help with legislative management to steer needed bills through                Congress and track the design and implementation of the strategic plans for                regions countries and issues that we discuss in chapter  Much of the job of                operational coordination remains with the agencies especially the CIA There DCI                Tenet and his chief aides ran interagency meetings nearly every day to coordinate                much of the governments daytoday work The DCI insisted he did not make policy                and only oversaw its implementation In the struggle against terrorism these                distinctions seem increasingly artificial Also as the DCI becomes a lead                coordinator of the governments operations it becomes harder to play all the                positions other roles including that of analyst in chief            The problem is nearly intractable because of the way the government is currently                structured Lines of operational authority run to the expanding executive                departments and they are guarded for understandable reasons the DCI commands the                CIAs personnel overseas the secretary of defense will not yield to others in                conveying commands to military forces the Justice Department will not give up the                responsibility of deciding whether to seek arrest warrants But the result is that                each agency or department needs its own intelligence apparatus to support the                performance of its duties It is hard to break down stovepipes when there are so                many stoves that are legally and politically entitled to have castiron pipes of                their own            Recalling the GoldwaterNichols legislation of  Secretary Rumsfeld reminded us                that to achieve better joint capability each of the armed services had to give up                some of their turf and authorities and prerogatives Today he said the executive                branch is stovepiped much like the four services were nearly  years ago He                wondered if it might be appropriate to ask agencies to give up some of their                existing turf and authority in exchange for a stronger faster more efficient                government wide joint effort Privately other key                officials have made the same point to us            We therefore propose a new institution a civilianled unified joint command for                counterterrorism It should combine strategic intelligence and joint operational                planning            In the Pentagons Joint Staff which serves the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of                Staff intelligence is handled by the J directorate operational planning by J                and overall policy by J Our concept combines the J and J functions                intelligence and operational planning in one agency keeping overall policy                coordination where it belongs in the National Security Council                            Recommendation We recommend the establishment of a National                    Counterterrorism Center NCTC built on the foundation of the existing                    Terrorist Threat Integration Center TTIC Breaking the older mold of national                    government organization this NCTC should be a center for joint operational                    planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies                    The head of the NCTC should have authority to evaluate the performance of the                    people assigned to the Center                                        Such a joint center should be developed in the same spirit that guided the                    militarys creation of unified joint commands or the shaping of earlier                    national agencies like the National Reconnaissance Office which was formed to                    organize the work of the CIA and several defense agencies in space                                    NCTCIntelligence The NCTC should lead strategic                    analysis pooling allsource intelligence foreign and domestic about                    transnational terrorist organizations with global reach It should develop net                    assessments comparing enemy capabilities and intentions against US defenses                    and countermeasures It should also provide warning It should do this work by                    drawing on the efforts of the CIA FBI Homeland Security and other departments                    and agencies It should task collection requirements both inside and outside the                    United States                The intelligence function J should build on the existing TTIC structure                    and remain distinct as a national intelligence center within the NCTC As the                    governments principal knowledge bank on Islamist terrorism with the main                    responsibility for strategic analysis and net assessment it should absorb a                    significant portion of the analytical talent now residing in the CIAs                    Counterterrorist Center and the DIAs Joint Intelligence Task ForceCombatting                    Terrorism JITFCT                                    NCTCOperations The NCTC should perform joint planning                    The plans would assign operational responsibilities to lead agencies such as                    State the CIA the FBI Defense and its combatant commands Homeland Security                    and other agencies The NCTC should not direct the actual execution of these                    operations leaving that job to the agencies The NCTC would then track                    implementation it would look across the foreigndomestic divide and across                    agency boundaries updating plans to follow through on cases                                The joint operational planning function J will be new to theTTIC                    structure The NCTC can draw on analogous work now being done in the CIA and                    every other involved department of the government as well as reaching out to                    knowledgeable officials in state and local agencies throughout the United                    States                The NCTC should not be a policymaking body Its operations and planning should                    follow the policy direction of the president and the National Security                    Council                                        Consider this hypothetical case The NSA discovers that a suspected terrorist is                    traveling to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur The NCTC should draw on joint                    intelligence resources including its own NSA counterterrorism experts to                    analyze the identities and possible destinations of these individuals Informed                    by this analysis the NCTC would then organize and plan the management of the                    case drawing on the talents and differing kinds of experience among the several                    agency representatives assigned to itassigning tasks to the CIA overseas to                    Homeland Security watching entry points into the United States and to the FBI                    If military assistance might be needed the Special Operations Command could be                    asked to develop an appropriate concept for such an operation The NCTC would be                    accountable for tracking the progress of the case ensuring that the plan                    evolved with it and integrating the information into a warning The NCTC would                    be responsible for being sure that intelligence gathered from the activities in                    the field became part of the governments institutional memory about Islamist                    terrorist personalities organizations and possible means of attack                In each case the involved agency would make its own senior managers aware of what                    it was being asked to do If those agency heads objected and the issue could                    not easily be resolved then the disagreement about roles and missions could be                    brought before the National Security Council and the president                        NCTCAuthorities             The head of the NCTC should be appointed by the president and should be equivalent                in rank to a deputy head of a cabinet department The head of the NCTC would report                to the national intelligence director an office whose creation we recommend below                placed in the Executive Office of the President The head of the NCTC would thus                also report indirectly to the president This officials nomination should be                confirmed by the Senate and he or she should testify to the Congress as is the case                now with other statutory presidential offices like the US trade representative                            To avoid the fate of other entities with great nominal authority and little                    real power the head of the NCTC must have the right to concur in the choices of                    personnel to lead the operating entities of the departments and agencies focused                    on counterterrorism specifically including the head of the Counterterrorist                    Center the head of the FBIs Counterterrorism Division the commanders of the                    Defense Departments Special Operations Command and Northern Command and the                    State Departments coordinator for counterterrorism                    The head of the NCTC should also work with the director of the Office of                    Management and Budget in developing the presidents counterterrorism budget                There are precedents for surrendering authority for joint planning while                    preserving an agencys operational control In the international context NATO                    commanders may get line authority over forces assigned by other nations In US                    unified commands commanders plan operations that may involve units belonging to                    one of the services In each case procedures are worked out formal and                    informal to define the limits of the joint commanders authority                        The most serious disadvantage of the NCTC is the reverse of its greatest virtue The                struggle against Islamist terrorism is so important that any clearcut                centralization of authority to manage and be accountable for it may concentrate too                much power in one place The proposed NCTC would be given the authority of planning                the activities of other agencies Law or executive order must define the scope of                such line authority            The NCTC would not eliminate interagency policy disputes These would still go to the                National Security Council To improve coordination at the White House we believe                the existing Homeland Security Council should soon be merged into a single National                Security Council The creation of the NCTC should help the NSC staff concentrate on                its core duties of assisting the president and supporting interdepartmental                policymaking            We recognize that this is a new and difficult idea precisely because the authorities                we recommend for the NCTC really would as Secretary Rumsfeld foresaw ask strong                agencies to give up some of their turf and authority in exchange for a stronger                faster more efficient government wide joint effort Countering transnational                Islamist terrorism will test whether the US government can fashion more flexible                models of management needed to deal with the twentyfirstcentury world            An argument against change is that the nation is at war and cannot afford to                reorganize in midstream But some of the main innovations of the s and s                including the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even the construction of the                Pentagon itself were undertaken in the midst of war Surely the country cannot wait                until the struggle against Islamist terrorism is over            Surprise when it happens to a government is likely to be a complicated diffuse                bureaucratic thing It includes neglect of responsibility but also responsibility                so poorly defined or so ambiguously delegated that action gets lost That comment was made more than  years ago about Pearl                Harbor We hope another commission writing in the future about another attack does                not again find this quotation to be so apt            UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY            In our first section we concentrated on counterterrorism discussing how to combine                the analysis of information from all sources of intelligence with the joint planning                of operations that draw on that analysis In this section we step back from looking                just at the counterterrorism problem We reflect on whether the government is                organized adequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities it                will need not just for countering terrorism but for the broader range of national                security challenges in the decades ahead            The Need for a Change            During the Cold War intelligence agencies did not depend on seamless integration to                track and count the thousands of military targetssuch as tanks and missilesfielded                by the Soviet Union and other adversary states Each agency concentrated on its                specialized mission acquiring its own information and then sharing it via formal                finished reports The Department of Defense had given birth to and dominated the                main agencies for technical collection of intelligence Resources were shifted at an                incremental pace coping with challenges that arose over years even decades            We summarized the resulting organization of the intelligence community in chapter                 It is outlined below            Members of the US Intelligence Community            Office of the Director of Central Intelligence which includes the Office of the                Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management the Community                Management Staff theTerrorism Threat Integration Center the National Intelligence                Council and other community offices            The Central Intelligence Agency CIA which performs human source collection                allsource analysis and advanced science and technology            National intelligence agencies                            National Security Agency NSA which performs signals collection and analysis                National GeospatialIntelligence Agency NGA which performs imagery                    collection and analysis                National Reconnaissance Office NRO which develops acquires and launches                    space systems for intelligence collection Other national reconnaissance                    programs                        Departmental intelligence agencies                            Defense Intelligence Agency DIA of the Department of Defense                Intelligence entities of the Army Navy Air Force and Marines                Bureau of Intelligence and Research INR of the Department of State                Office of Terrorism and Finance Intelligence of the Department of Treasury                Office of Intelligence and the Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence                    Divisions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice                Office of Intelligence of the Department of Energy                Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection                IAIP and Directorate of Coast Guard Intelligence of the Department of                    Homeland Security                        The need to restructure the intelligence community grows out of six problems that                have become apparent before and after                             Structural barriers to performing joint intelligence work National                    intelligence is still organized around the collection disciplines of the home                    agencies not the joint mission The importance of integrated allsource                    analysis cannot be overstated Without it it is not possible to connect the                    dots No one component holds all the relevant information                By contrast in organizing national defense the Goldwater Nichols                    legislation of  created joint commands for operations in the field the                    Unified Command Plan The servicesthe Army Navy Air Force and Marine                    Corpsorganize train and equip their people and units to perform their                    missions Then they assign personnel and units to the joint combatant commander                    like the commanding general of the Central Command CENTCOM The Goldwater                    Nichols Act required officers to serve tours outside their service in order to                    win promotion The culture of the Defense Department was transformed its                    collective mindset moved from servicespecific to joint and its operations                    became more integrated                                                    Lack of common standards and practices across the                        foreigndomestic divide The leadership of the intelligence community                    should be able to pool information gathered overseas with information gathered                    in the United States holding the workwherever it is doneto a common standard                    of quality in how it is collected processed eg translated reported                    shared and analyzed A common set of personnel standards for intelligence can                    create a group of professionals better able to operate in joint activities                    transcending their own servicespecific mindsets                                    Divided management of national intelligence capabilities                    While the CIA was once central to our national intelligence capabilities                    following the end of the Cold War it has been less able to influence the use of                    the nations imagery and signals intelligence capabilities in three national                    agencies housed within the Department of Defense the National Security Agency                    the National GeospatialIntelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance                    Office One of the lessons learned from the  Gulf War was the value of                    national intelligence systems satellites in particular in precision warfare                    Since that war the department has appropriately drawn these agencies into its                    transformation of the military Helping to orchestrate this transformation is                    the under secretary of defense for intelligence a position established by                    Congress after  An unintended consequence of these developments has been                    the far greater demand made by Defense on technical systems leaving the DCI                    less able to influence how these technical resources are allocated and used                                    Weak capacity to set priorities and move resources The                    agencies are mainly organized around what they collect or the way they collect                    it But the priorities for collection are national As the DCI makes hard                    choices about moving resources he or she must have the power to reach across                    agencies and reallocate effort                                    Too many jobs The DCI now has at least three jobs He is                    expected to run a particular agency the CIA He is expected to manage the loose                    confederation of agencies that is the intelligence community He is expected to                    be the analyst in chief for the government sifting evidence and directly                    briefing the President as his principal intelligence adviser No recent DCI has                    been able to do all three effectively Usually what loses out is management of                    the intelligence community a difficult task even in the best case because the                    DCIs current authorities are weak With so much to do the DCI often has not                    used even the authority he has                                    Too complex and secret Over the decades the agencies                    and the rules surrounding the intelligence community have accumulated to a depth                    that practically defies public comprehension There are now  agencies or parts                    of agencies in the intelligence community The community and the DCIs                    authorities have become arcane matters understood only by initiates after long                    study Even the most basic information about how much money is actually                    allocated to or within the intelligence community and most of its key components                    is shrouded from public view                        The current DCI is responsible for community performance but lacks the three                authorities critical for any agency head or chief executive officer  control                over purse strings  the ability to hire or fire senior managers and  the                ability to set standards for the information infrastructure and personnel                        The only budget power of the DCI over agencies other than the CIA lies in                coordinating the budget requests of the various intelligence agencies into a single                program for submission to Congress The overall funding request of the                 intelligence entities in this program is then presented to the president and                Congress in  separate volumes            When Congress passes an appropriations bill to allocate money to intelligence                agencies most of their funding is hidden in the Defense Department in order to keep                intelligence spending secret Therefore although the House and Senate Intelligence                committees are the authorizing committees for funding of the intelligence community                the final budget review is handled in the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations                committees Those committees have no subcommittees just for intelligence and only a                few members and staff review the requests            The appropriations for the CIA and the national intelligence agencies NSA NGA and                NROare then given to the secretary of defense The secretary transfers the CIAs                money to the DCI but disburses the national agencies money directly Money for the                FBIs national security components falls within the appropriations for Commerce                Justice and State and goes to the attorney general                        In addition the DCI lacks hireandfire authority over most of the intelligence                communitys senior managers For the national intelligence agencies housed in the                Defense Department the secretary of defense must seek the DCIs concurrence                regarding the nomination of these directors who are presidentially appointed But                the secretary may submit recommendations to the president without receiving this                concurrence The DCI cannot fire these officials The DCI has even less influence                over the head of the FBIs national security component who is appointed by the                attorney general in consultation with the DCI                        Combining Joint Work with Stronger Management            We have received recommendations on the topic of intelligence reform from many                sources Other commissions have been over this same ground Thoughtful bills have                been introduced most recently a bill by the chairman of the House Intelligence                Committee Porter Goss RFla and another by the ranking minority member Jane                Harman DCalif In the Senate Senators Bob Graham DFla and Dianne Feinstein                DCalif have introduced reform proposals as well Past efforts have foundered                because the president did not support them because the DCI the secretary of                defense or both opposed them and because some proposals lacked merit We have                tried to take stock of these experiences and borrow from strong elements in many of                the ideas that have already been developed by others                            Recommendation The current position of Director of Central                    Intelligence should be replaced by a National Intelligence Director with two                    main areas of responsibility  to oversee national intelligence centers on                    specific subjects of interest across the US government and  to manage the                    national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to                    it                        First the National Intelligence Director should oversee national intelligence                centers to provide allsource analysis and plan intelligence operations for the                whole government on major problems                            One such problem is counterterrorism In this case we believe that the center                    should be the intelligence entity formerly TTIC inside the National                    Counterterrorism Center we have proposed It would sit there alongside the                    operations management unit we described earlier with both making up the NCTC                    in the Executive Office of the President Other national intelligence                    centersfor instance on counterproliferation crime and narcotics and                    Chinawould be housed in whatever department or agency is best suited for them                The National Intelligence Director would retain the present DCIs role as the                    principal intelligence adviser to the president We hope the president will come                    to look directly to the directors of the national intelligence centers to                    provide allsource analysis in their areas of responsibility balancing the                    advice of these intelligence chiefs against the contrasting viewpoints that may                    be offered by department heads at State Defense Homeland Security Justice                    and other agencies                        Second the National Intelligence Director should manage the national intelligence                program and oversee the component agencies of the intelligence community See                diagram                                        The National Intelligence Director would submit a unified budget for national                    intelligence that reflects priorities chosen by the National Security Council                    an appropriate balance among the varieties of technical and human intelligence                    collection and analysis He or she would receive an appropriation for national                    intelligence and apportion the funds to the appropriate agencies in line with                    that budget and with authority to reprogram funds among the national                    intelligence agencies to meet any new priority as counterterrorism was in the                    s The National Intelligence Director should approve and submit nominations                    to the president of the individuals who would lead the CIA DIA FBI                    Intelligence Office NSA NGA NRO Information Analysis and Infrastructure                    Protection Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security and other                    national intelligence capabilities                                The National Intelligence Director would manage this national effort with the                    help of three deputies each of whom would also hold a key position in one of                    the component agencies                                foreign intelligence the head of the CIA                defense intelligence the under secretary of defense for intelligence                                homeland intelligence the FBIs executive assistant director for intelligence                    or the under secretary of homeland security for information analysis and                    infrastructure protection Other agencies in the intelligence community would                    coordinate their work within each of these three areas largely staying housed                    in the same departments or agencies that support them now                        Returning to the analogy of the Defense Departments organization these three                deputieslike the leaders of the Army Navy Air Force or Marineswould have the                job of acquiring the systems training the people and executing the operations                planned by the national intelligence centers            And just as the combatant commanders also report to the secretary of defense the                directors of the national intelligence centerseg for counterproliferation crime                and narcotics and the restalso would report to the National Intelligence Director                            The Defense Departments military intelligence programsthe joint military                    intelligence program JMIP and the tactical intelligence and related activities                    program TIARAwould remain part of that departments responsibility                The National Intelligence Director would set personnel policies to establish                    standards for education and training and facilitate assignments at the national                    intelligence centers and across agency lines The National Intelligence Director                    also would set information sharing and information technology policies to                    maximize data sharing as well as policies to protect the security of                    information                Too many agencies now have an opportunity to say no to change The National                    Intelligence Director should participate in an NSC executive committee that can                    resolve differences in priorities among the agencies and bring the major                    disputes to the president for decision                        The National Intelligence Director should be located in the Executive Office of the                President This official who would be confirmed by the Senate and would testify                before Congress would have a relatively small staff of several hundred people                taking the place of the existing community management offices housed at the CIA            In managing the whole community the National Intelligence Director is still                providing a service function With the partial exception of his or her                responsibilities for overseeing the NCTC the National Intelligence Director should                support the consumers of national intelligencethe president and policymaking                advisers such as the secretaries of state defense and homeland security and the                attorney general            We are wary of too easily equating government management problems with those of the                private sector But we have noticed that some very large private firms rely on a                powerful CEO who has significant control over how money is spent and can hire or                fire leaders of the major divisions assisted by a relatively modest staff while                leaving responsibility for execution in the operating divisions There are                disadvantages to separating the position of National Intelligence Director from the                job of heading the CIA For example the National Intelligence Director will not                head a major agency of his or her own and may have a weaker base of support But we                believe that these disadvantages are outweighed by several other considerations                            The National Intelligence Director must be able to directly oversee                    intelligence collection inside the United States Yet law and custom has                    counseled against giving such a plain domestic role to the head of the CIA                The CIA will be one among several claimants for funds in setting national                    priorities The National Intelligence Director should not be both one of the                    advocates and the judge of them all                Covert operations tend to be highly tactical requiring close attention The                    National Intelligence Director should rely on the relevant joint mission center                    to oversee these details helping to coordinate closely with the White House                    The CIA will be able to concentrate on building the capabilities to carry out                    such operations and on providing the personnel who will be directing and                    executing such operations in the field                Rebuilding the analytic and human intelligence collection capabilities of the                    CIA should be a fulltime effort and the director of the CIA should focus on                    extending its comparative advantages                                        Recommendation The CIA Director should emphasize a rebuilding the                    CIAs analytic capabilities b transforming the clandestine service by                    building its human intelligence capabilities c developing a stronger language                    program with high standards and sufficient financial incentives d renewing                    emphasis on recruiting diversity among operations officers so they can blend                    more easily in foreign cities e ensuring a seamless relationship between                    human source collection and signals collection at the operational level and f                    stressing a better balance between unilateral and liaison operations                        The CIA should retain responsibility for the direction and execution of clandestine                and covert operations as assigned by the relevant national intelligence center and                authorized by the National Intelligence Director and the president This would                include propaganda renditions and nonmilitary disruption We believe however                that one important area of responsibility should change                            Recommendation Lead responsibility for directing and executing                    paramilitary operations whether clandestine or covert should shift to the                    Defense Department There it should be consolidated with the capabilities for                    training direction and execution of such operations already being developed in                    the Special Operations Command                                        Before  the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to                    conduct paramilitary operations with US personnel It relied on proxies                    instead organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training                    The results were unsatisfactory                Whether the price is measured in either money or people the United States                    cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret                    military operations secretly operating standoff missiles and secretly training                    foreign military or paramilitary forces The United States should concentrate                    responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity                The post Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIAmilitary teams for                    covert and clandestine operations was a good one We believe this proposal to be                    consistent with it Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages                    in building capabilities for joint missions The operation itself would be                    planned in common                The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations The military has a                    reputation for being methodical and cumbersome We do not know if these                    stereotypes match current reality they may also be one more symptom of the                    civilmilitary misunderstandings we described in chapter  It is a problem to                    be resolved in policy guidance and agency management not in the creation of                    redundant overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work The                    CIAs experts should be integrated into the militarys training exercises and                    planning To quote a CIA official now serving in the fieldOne fight one                    team                                        Recommendation Finally to combat the secrecy and complexity we                    have described the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national                    intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret                    Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence defending                    the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned                    among the varieties of intelligence work                        The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified as they are                today Opponents of declassification argue that Americas enemies could learn about                intelligence capabilities by tracking the topline appropriations figure Yet the                topline figure by itself provides little insight into US intelligence sources and                methods The US government readily provides copious information about spending on                its military forces including military intelligence The intelligence community                should not be subject to that much disclosure But when even aggregate categorical                numbers remain hidden it is hard to judge priorities and foster accountability            UNITY OF EFFORT IN SHARING INFORMATION            Information Sharing            We have already stressed the importance of intelligence analysis that can draw on all                relevant sources of information The biggest impediment to allsource analysisto a                greater likelihood of connecting the dotsis the human or systemic resistance to                sharing information            The US government has access to a vast amount of information When databases not                usually thought of as intelligence such as customs or immigration information                are included the storehouse is immense But the US government has a weak system                for processing and using what it has In interviews around the government official                after official urged us to call attention to frustrations with the unglamorous back                office side of government operations In the  story for example we sometimes                see examples of information that could be accessedlike the undistributed NSA                information that would have helped identify Nawaf al Hazmi in January  But                someone had to ask for it In that case no one did Or as in the episodes we                describe in chapter  the information is distributed but in a compartmented                channel Or the information is available and someone does ask but it cannot be                shared            What all these stories have in common is a system that requires a demonstrated need                to know before sharing This approach assumes it is possible to know in advance                who will need to use the information Such a system implicitly assumes that the risk                of inadvertent disclosure outweighs the benefits of wider sharing Those Cold War                assumptions are no longer appropriate The culture of agencies feeling they own the                information they gathered at taxpayer expense must be replaced by a culture in which                the agencies instead feel they have a duty to the informationto repay the                taxpayers investment by making that information available            Each intelligence agency has its own security practices outgrowths of the Cold War                We certainly understand the reason for these practices Counterintelligence concerns                are still real even if the old Soviet enemy has been replaced by other spies            But the security concerns need to be weighed against the costs Current security                requirements nurture overclassification and excessive compartmentation of                information among agencies Each agencys incentive structure opposes sharing with                risks criminal civil and internal administrative sanctions but few rewards for                sharing information No one has to pay the longterm costs of overclassifying                information though these costseven in literal financial terms are substantial                There are no punishments for not sharing information Agencies uphold a                needtoknow culture of information protection rather than promoting a                needtoshare culture of integration                                        Recommendation Information procedures should provide incentives for                    sharing to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge                        Intelligence gathered about transnational terrorism should be processed turned into                reports and distributed according to the same quality standards whether it is                collected in Pakistan or in Texas            The logical objection is that sources and methods may vary greatly in different                locations We therefore propose that when a report is first created its data be                separated from the sources and methods by which they are obtained The report should                begin with the information in its most shareable but still meaningful form                Therefore the maximum number of recipients can access some form of that information                If knowledge of further details becomes important any user can query further with                access granted or denied according to the rules set for the networkand with queries                leaving an audit trail in order to determine who accessed the information But the                questions may not come at all unless experts at the edge of the network can                readily discover the clues that prompt to them                        We propose that information be shared horizontally across new networks that                transcend individual agencies                            The current system is structured on an old mainframe or hubandspoke                    concept In this older approach each agency has its own database Agency users                    send information to the database and then can retrieve it from the database                A decentralized network model the concept behind much of the information                    revolution shares data horizontally too Agencies would still have their own                    databases but those databases would be searchable across agency lines In this                    system secrets are protected through the design of the network and an                    information rights management approach that controls access to the data not                    access to the whole network An outstanding conceptual framework for this kind                    of trusted information network has been developed by a task force of leading                    professionals in national security information technology and law assembled by                    the Markle Foundation Its report has been widely discussed throughout the US                    government but has not yet been converted into action                                                        Recommendation The president should lead the governmentwide effort                    to bring the major national security institutions into the information                    revolution He should coordinate the resolution of the legal policy and                    technical issues across agencies to create a trusted information network                                        No one agency can do it alone Wellmeaning agency officials are under                    tremendous pressure to update their systems Alone they may only be able to                    modernize the stovepipes not replace them                Only presidential leadership can develop governmentwide concepts and                    standards Currently no one is doing this job Backed by the Office of                    Management and Budget a new National Intelligence Director empowered to set                    common standards for information use throughout the community and a secretary                    of homeland security who helps extend the system to public agencies and relevant                    privatesector databases a governmentwide initiative can succeed                White House leadership is also needed because the policy and legal issues are                    harder than the technical ones The necessary technology already exists What                    does not are the rules for acquiring accessing sharing and using the vast                    stores of public and private data that may be available When information                    sharing works it is a powerful tool Therefore the sharing and uses of                    information must be guided by a set of practical policy guidelines that                    simultaneously empower and constrain officials telling them clearly what is and                    is not permitted                        This is government acting in new ways to face new threats the most recent Markle                report explains And while such change is necessary it must be accomplished while                engendering the peoples trust that privacy and other civil liberties are being                protected that businesses are not being unduly burdened with requests for                extraneous or useless information that taxpayer money is being well spent and                that ultimately the network will be effective in protecting our security The                authors add Leadership is emerging from all levels of government and from many                places in the private sector What is needed now is a plan to accelerate these                efforts and public debate and consensus on the goals                        UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE CONGRESS            Strengthen Congressional Oversight of Intelligence and Homeland Security            Of all our recommendations strengthening congressional oversight may be among the                most difficult and important So long as oversight is governed by current                congressional rules and resolutions we believe the American people will not get the                security they want and need The United States needs a strong stable and capable                congressional committee structure to give Americas national intelligence agencies                oversight support and leadership Few things are more difficult to change in                Washington than congressional committee jurisdiction and prerogatives To a member                these assignments are almost as important as the map of his or her congressional                district The American people may have to insist that these changes occur or they                may well not happen Having interviewed numerous members of Congress from both                parties as well as congressional staff members we found that dissatisfaction with                congressional oversight remains widespread            The future challenges of Americas intelligence agencies are daunting They include                the need to develop leadingedge technologies that give our policymakers and                warfighters a decisive edge in any conflict where the interests of the United States                are vital Not only does good intelligence win wars but the best intelligence                enables us to prevent them from happening altogether Under the terms of existing                rules and resolutions the House and Senate intelligence committees lack the power                influence and sustained capability to meet this challenge While few members of                Congress have the broad knowledge of intelligence activities or the knowhow about                the technologies employed all members need to feel assured that good oversight is                happening When their unfamiliarity with the subject is combined with the need to                preserve security a mandate emerges for substantial change            Tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient Either Congress should                create a joint committee for intelligence using the Joint Atomic Energy Committee                as its model or it should create House and Senate committees with combined                authorizing and appropriations powers            Whichever of these two forms are chosen the goal should be a structure codified by                resolution with powers expressly granted and carefully limited allowing a                relatively small group of members of Congress given time and reason to master the                subject and the agencies to conduct oversight of the intelligence establishment and                be clearly accountable for their work The staff of this committee should be                nonpartisan and work for the entire committee and not for individual members            The other reforms we have suggestedfor a National Counterterrorism Center and a                National Intelligence Directorwill not work if congressional oversight does not                change too Unity of effort in executive management can be lost if it is fractured                by divided congressional oversight                            Recommendation Congressional oversight for intelligenceand                    counterterrorismis now dysfunctional Congress should address this problem We                    have considered various alternatives A joint committee on the old model of the                    Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one A single committee in each house of                    Congress combining authorizing and appropriating authorities is another                                        The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the                    activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the                    development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate                We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence                    be made public and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to                    the National Intelligence Director not to the secretary of defense                                We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee                    specifically dedicated to oversight freed from the consuming responsibility of                    working on the budget                The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant                    subpoena authority to the committee or committees The majority partys                    representation on this committee should never exceed the minoritys                    representation by more than one                Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a                    member who also serves on each of the following additional committees Armed                    Services Judiciary Foreign Affairs and the Defense Appropriations                    subcommittee In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought                    together in the new committees work                Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees without set                    terms thereby letting them accumulate expertise                The committees should be smallerperhaps seven or nine members in each                    houseso that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility and                    accountability for the quality of the committees work                        The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before  committees                and subcommittees of Congress One expert witness not a member of the                administration told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding                the departments successful development The one attempt to consolidate such                committee authority the House Select Committee on Homeland Security may be                eliminated The Senate does not have even this Congress needs to establish for the                Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that                exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department                to deal with threats to national security Through not more than one authorizing                committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house Congress should be able                to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has the resources to                provide reasonable security against major terrorist acts within the United States                and to hold the secretary accountable for the departments performance                            Recommendation Congress should create a single principal point of                    oversight and review for homeland security Congressional leaders are best able                    to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its                    duties But we believe that Congress does have the obligation to choose one in                    the House and one in the Senate and that this committee should be a permanent                    standing committee with a nonpartisan staff                        Improve the Transitions between Administrations            In chapter  we described the transition of  Beyond the policy issues we                described the new administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place                until the spring of  and the critical subcabinet officials were not confirmed                until the summerif then In other words the new administration like others before                itdid not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office                            Recommendation Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little                    or no notice we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national                    security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the                    process for national security appointments We think the process could be                    improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new                    officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible                                        Before the election candidates should submit the names of selected members of                    their prospective transition teams to the FBI so that if necessary those team                    members can obtain security clearances immediately after the election is over                A presidentelect should submit lists of possible candidates for national                    security positions to begin obtaining security clearances immediately after the                    election so that their background investigations can be complete before January                                    A single federal agency should be responsible for providing and maintaining                    security clearances ensuring uniform standardsincluding uniform security                    questionnaires and financial report requirements and maintaining a single                    database This agency can also be responsible for administering polygraph tests                    on behalf of organizations that require them                A presidentelect should submit the nominations of the entire new national                    security team through the level of under secretary of cabinet departments not                    later than January  The Senate in return should adopt special rules                    requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees                    within  days of their submission The Senate should not require confirmation                    of such executive appointees below Executive Level                 The outgoing administration should provide the presidentelect as soon as                    possible after election day with a classified compartmented list that                    catalogues specific operational threats to national security major military or                    covert operations and pending decisions on the possible use of force Such a                    document could provide both notice and a checklist inviting a presidentelect                    to inquire and learn more                        ORGANIZING AMERICAS DEFENSES IN THE UNITED STATES            The Future Role of the FBI            We have considered proposals for a new agency dedicated to intelligence collection in                the United States Some call this a proposal for an American MI  although the                analogy is weakthe actual British Security Service is a relatively small worldwide                agency that combines duties assigned in the US government to the Terrorist Threat                Integration Center the CIA the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security            The concern about the FBI is that it has long favored its criminal justice mission                over its national security mission Part of the reason for this is the demand around                the country for FBI help on criminal matters The FBI was criticized rightly for                the overzealous domestic intelligence investigations disclosed during the s The                pendulum swung away from those types of investigations during the s and s                though the FBI maintained an active counterintelligence function and was the lead                agency for the investigation of foreign terrorist groups operating inside the United                States            We do not recommend the creation of a new domestic intelligence agency It is not                needed if our other recommendations are adoptedto establish a strong national                intelligence center part of the NCTC that will oversee counterterrorism                intelligence work foreign and domestic and to create a National Intelligence                Director who can set and enforce standards for the collection processing and                reporting of information            Under the structures we recommend the FBIs role is focused but still vital The                FBI does need to be able to direct its thousands of agents and other employees to                collect intelligence in Americas cities and townsinterviewing informants                conducting surveillance and searches tracking individuals working collaboratively                with local authorities and doing so with meticulous attention to detail and                compliance with the law The FBIs job in the streets of the United States would                thus be a domestic equivalent operating under the US Constitution and quite                different laws and rules to the job of the CIAs operations officers abroad            Creating a new domestic intelligence agency has other drawbacks                            The FBI is accustomed to carrying out sensitive intelligence collection                    operations in compliance with the law If a new domestic intelligence agency                    were outside of the Department of Justice the process of legal oversightnever                    easycould become even more difficult Abuses of civil liberties could create a                    backlash that would impair the collection of needed intelligence                Creating a new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention of the                    officials most responsible for current counterterrorism efforts while the threat                    remains high Putting a new player into the mix of federal agencies with                    counterterrorism responsibilities would exacerbate existing informationsharing                    problems                A new domestic intelligence agency would need to acquire assets and personnel                    The FBI already has  employees  field offices  satellite offices                    and  legal attach offices a laboratory operations center and training                    facility an existing network of informants cooperating defendants and other                    sources and relationships with state and local law enforcement the CIA and                    foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies                Counterterrorism investigations in the United States very quickly become                    matters that involve violations of criminal law and possible law enforcement                    action Because the FBI can have agents working criminal matters and agents                    working intelligence investigations concerning the same international terrorism                    target the full range of investigative tools against a suspected terrorist can                    be considered within one agency The removal of the wall that existed before                     between intelligence and law enforcement has opened up new opportunities                    for cooperative action within the FBI                Counterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other criminal                    investigations such as money laundering or the smuggling of contraband In the                    field the close connection to criminal work has many benefits                        Our recommendation to leave counterterrorism intelligence collection in the United                States with the FBI still depends on an assessment that the FBIif it makes an                allout effort to institutionalize changecan do the job As we mentioned in chapter                 we have been impressed by the determination that agents display in tracking down                details patiently going the extra mile and working the extra month to put facts in                the place of speculation In our report we have shown how agents in Phoenix                Minneapolis and New York displayed initiative in pressing their investigations            FBI agents and analysts in the field need to have sustained support and dedicated                resources to become stronger intelligence officers They need to be rewarded for                acquiring informants and for gathering and disseminating information differently and                more broadly than usual in a traditional criminal invetigation FBI employees need                to report and analyze what they have learned in ways the Bureau has never done                before            Under Director Robert Mueller the Bureau has made significant progress in improving                its intelligence capabilities It now has an Office of Intelligence overseen by the                top tier of FBI management Field intelligence groups have been created in all field                offices to put FBI priorities and the emphasis on intelligence into practice                Advances have been made in improving the Bureaus information technology systems and                in increasing connectivity and information sharing with intelligence community                agencies            Director Mueller has also recognized that the FBIs reforms are far from complete He                has outlined a number of areas where added measures may be necessary Specifically                he has recognized that the FBI needs to recruit from a broader pool of candidates                that agents and analysts working on national security matters require specialized                training and that agents should specialize within programs after obtaining a                generalist foundation The FBI is developing career tracks for agents to specialize                in counterterrorismcounterintelligence cyber crimes criminal investigations or                intelligence It is establishing a program for certifying agents as intelligence                officers a certification that will be a prerequisite for promotion to the senior                ranks of the Bureau New training programs have been instituted for                intelligencerelated subjects            The Director of the FBI has proposed creating an Intelligence Directorate as a                further refinement of the FBI intelligence program This directorate would include                units for intelligence planning and policy and for the direction of analysts and                linguists            We want to ensure that the Bureaus shift to a preventive counterterrorism posture is                more fully institutionalized so that it survives beyond Director Muellers tenure                We have found that in the past the Bureau has announced its willingness to reform                and restructure itself to address transnational security threats but has fallen                shortfailing to effect the necessary institutional and cultural changes                organizationwide We want to ensure that this does not happen again Despite having                found acceptance of the Directors clear message that counterterrorism is now the                FBIs top priority two years after  we also found gaps between some of the                announced reforms and the reality in the field We are concerned that management in                the field offices still can allocate people and resources to local concerns that                diverge from the national security mission This system could revert to a focus on                lowerpriority criminal justice cases over national security requirements                            Recommendation A specialized and integrated national security                    workforce should be established at the FBI consisting of agents analysts                    linguists and surveillance specialists who are recruited trained rewarded                    and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture imbued with a                    deep expertise in intelligence and national security                                        The president by executive order or directive should direct the FBI to                    develop this intelligence cadre                Recognizing that crossfertilization between the criminal justice and national                    security disciplines is vital to the success of both missions all new agents                    should receive basic training in both areas Furthermore new agents should                    begin their careers with meaningful assignments in both areas                Agents and analysts should then specialize in one of these disciplines and                    have the option to work such matters for their entire career with the Bureau                    Certain advanced training courses and assignments to other intelligence agencies                    should be required to advance within the national security discipline                 In the interest of crossfertilization all senior FBI managers including                    those working on law enforcement matters should be certified intelligence                    officers                The FBI should fully implement a recruiting hiring and selection process for                    agents and analysts that enhances its ability to target and attract individuals                    with educational and professional backgrounds in intelligence international                    relations language technology and other relevant skills                The FBI should institute the integration of analysts agents linguists and                    surveillance personnel in the field so that a dedicated team approach is brought                    to bear on national security intelligence operations                Each field office should have an official at the field offices deputy level                    for national security matters This individual would have management oversight                    and ensure that the national priorities are carried out in the field                The FBI should align its budget structure according to its four main                    programsintelligence counterterrorism and counterintelligence criminal and                    criminal justice servicesto ensure better transparency on program costs                    management of resources and protection of the intelligence program                                The FBI should report regularly to Congress in its semiannual program reviews                    designed to identify whether each field office is appropriately addressing FBI                    and national program priorities                The FBI should report regularly to Congress in detail on the qualifications                    status and roles of analysts in the field and at headquarters Congress should                    ensure that analysts are afforded training and career opportunities on a par                    with those offered analysts in other intelligence community agencies                The Congress should make sure funding is available to accelerate the expansion                    of secure facilities in FBI field offices so as to increase their ability to use                    secure email systems and classified intelligence product exchanges The Congress                    should monitor whether the FBIs informationsharing principles are implemented                    in practice                        The FBI is just a small fraction of the national law enforcement community in the                United States a community comprised mainly of state and local agencies The network                designed for sharing information and the work of the FBI through local Joint                Terrorism Task Forces should build a reciprocal relationship in which state and                local agents understand what information they are looking for and in return                receive some of the information being developed about what is happening or may                happen in their communities In this relationship the Department of Homeland                Security also will play an important part            The Homeland Security Act of  gave the under secretary for information analysis                and infrastructure protection broad responsibilities In practice this directorate                has the job to map terrorist threats to the homeland against our assessed                vulnerabilities in order to drive our efforts to protect against terrorist                threats These capabilities are still embryonic The                directorate has not yet developed the capacity to perform one of its assigned jobs                which is to assimilate and analyze information from Homeland Securitys own                component agencies such as the Coast Guard Secret Service Transportation Security                Administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border                Protection The secretary of homeland security must ensure that these components                work with the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate so that                this office can perform its mission                        Homeland Defense            At several points in our inquiry we asked Who is responsible for defending us at                home Our national defense at home is the responsibility first of the Department                of Defense and second of the Department of Homeland Security They must have clear                delineations of responsibility and authority            We found that NORAD which had been given the responsibility for defending US                airspace had construed that mission to focus on threats coming from outside                Americas borders It did not adjust its focus even though the intelligence                community had gathered intelligence on the possibility that terrorists might turn to                hijacking and even use of planes as missiles We have been assured that NORAD has                now embraced the full mission Northern Command has been established to assume                responsibility for the defense of the domestic United States                            Recommendation The Department of Defense and its oversight                    committees should regularly assess the adequacy of Northern Commands strategies                    and planning to defend the United States against military threats to the                    homeland                        The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate all of the                domestic agencies responsible for securing Americas borders and national                infrastructure most of which is in private hands It should identify those elements                of our transportation energy communications financial and other institutions                that need to be protected develop plans to protect that infrastructure and                exercise the mechanisms to enhance preparedness This means going well beyond the                preexisting jobs of the agencies that have been brought together inside the                department                            Recommendation The Department of Homeland Security and its                    oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threats the country                    faces to determine a the adequacy of the governments plansand the progress                    against those plansto protect Americas critical infrastructure and b the                    readiness of the government to respond to the threats that the United States                    might face                        We look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended and                we will participate vigorously in that debate
