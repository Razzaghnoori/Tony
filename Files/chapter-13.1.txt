 HOW TO DO IT A DIFFERENT WAY OF ORGANIZING THE GOVERNMENT As presently configured the national security institutions of the U S government are still the institutions constructed to win the Cold War The United States confronts a very different world today Instead of facing a few very dangerous adversaries the United States confronts a number of less visible challenges that surpass the boundaries of traditional nation states and call for quick imaginative and agile responses The men and women of the World War II generation rose to the challenges of the 1940s and 1950s They restructured the government so that it could protect the country That is now the job of the generation that experienced 9 11 Those attacks showed emphatically that ways of doing business rooted in a different era are just not good enough Americans should not settle for incremental ad hoc adjustments to a system designed generations ago for a world that no longer exists We recommend significant changes in the organization of the government We know that the quality of the people is more important than the quality of the wiring diagrams Some of the saddest aspects of the 9 11 story are the outstanding efforts of so many individual officials straining often without success against the boundaries of the possible Good people can overcome bad structures They should not have to The United States has the resources and the people The government should combine them more effectively achieving unity of effort We offer five major recommendations to do that unifying strategic intelligence and operational planning against Islamist terrorists across the foreign domestic divide with a National Counterterrorism Center unifying the intelligence community with a new National Intelligence Director unifying the many participants in the counterterrorism effort and their knowledge in a network based information sharing system that transcends traditional governmental boundaries unifying and strengthening congressional oversight to improve quality and accountability and strengthening the FBI and homeland defenders UNITY OF EFFORT ACROSS THE FOREIGN DOMESTIC DIVIDE Joint Action Much of the public commentary about the 9 11 attacks has dealt with lost opportunities some of which we reviewed in chapter 11 These are often characterized as problems of watchlisting of information sharing or of connecting the dots In chapter 11 we explained that these labels are too narrow They describe the symptoms not the disease In each of our examples no one was firmly in charge of managing the case and able to draw relevant intelligence from anywhere in the government assign responsibilities across the agencies foreign or domestic track progress and quickly bring obstacles up to the level where they could be resolved Responsibility and accountability were diffuse The agencies cooperated some of the time But even such cooperation as there was is not the same thing as joint action When agencies cooperate one defines the problem and seeks help with it When they act jointly the problem and options for action are defined differently from the start Individuals from different backgrounds come together in analyzing a case and planning how to manage it In our hearings we regularly asked witnesses Who is the quarterback The other players are in their positions doing their jobs But who is calling the play that assigns roles to help them execute as a team Since 9 11 those issues have not been resolved In some ways joint work has gotten better and in some ways worse The effort of fighting terrorism has flooded over many of the usual agency boundaries because of its sheer quantity and energy Attitudes have changed Officials are keenly conscious of trying to avoid the mistakes of 9 11 They try to share information They circulate even to the President practically every reported threat however dubious Partly because of all this effort the challenge of coordinating it has multiplied Before 9 11 the CIA was plainly the lead agency confronting al Qaeda The FBI played a very secondary role The engagement of the departments of Defense and State was more episodic Today the CIA is still central But the FBI is much more active along with other parts of the Justice Department The Defense Department effort is now enormous Three of its unified commands each headed by a four star general have counterterrorism as a primary mission Special Operations Command Central Command both headquartered in Florida and Northern Command headquartered in Colorado A new Department of Homeland Security combines formidable resources in border and transportation security along with analysis of domestic vulnerability and other tasks The State Department has the lead on many of the foreign policy tasks we described in chapter 12 At the White House the National Security Council NSC now is joined by a parallel presidential advisory structure the Homeland Security Council So far we have mentioned two reasons for joint action the virtue of joint planning and the advantage of having someone in charge to ensure a unified effort There is a third the simple shortage of experts with sufficient skills The limited pool of critical experts for example skilled counterterrorism analysts and linguists is being depleted Expanding these capabilities will require not just money but time Primary responsibility for terrorism analysis has been assigned to the Terrorist Threat Integration Center TTIC created in 2003 based at the CIA headquarters but staffed with representatives of many agencies reporting directly to the Director of Central Intelligence Yet the CIA houses another intelligence fusion center the Counterterrorist Center that played such a key role before 9 11 A third major analytic unit is at Defense in the Defense Intelligence Agency A fourth concentrating more on homeland vulnerabilities is at the Department of Homeland Security The FBI is in the process of building the analytic capability it has long lacked and it also has the Terrorist Screening Center The U S government cannot afford so much duplication of effort There are not enough experienced experts to go around The duplication also places extra demands on already hard pressed single source national technical intelligence collectors like the National Security Agency Combining Joint Intelligence and Joint Action A smart government would integrate all sources of information to see the enemy as a whole Integrated all source analysis should also inform and shape strategies to collect more intelligence Yet the Terrorist Threat Integration Center while it has primary responsibility for terrorism analysis is formally proscribed from having any oversight or operational authority and is not part of any operational entity other than reporting to the director of central intelligence The government now tries to handle the problem of joint management informed by analysis of intelligence from all sources in two ways First agencies with lead responsibility for certain problems have constructed their own interagency entities and task forces in order to get cooperation The Counterterrorist Center at CIA for example recruits liaison officers from throughout the intelligence community The military s Central Command has its own interagency center recruiting liaison officers from all the agencies from which it might need help The FBI has Joint Terrorism Task Forces in 84 locations to coordinate the activities of other agencies when action may be required Second the problem of joint operational planning is often passed to the White House where the NSC staff tries to play this role The national security staff at the White House both NSC and new Homeland Security Council staff has already become 50 percent larger since 9 11 But our impression after talking to serving officials is that even this enlarged staff is consumed by meetings on day to day issues sifting each day s threat information and trying to coordinate everyday operations Even as it crowds into every square inch of available office space the NSC staff is still not sized or funded to be an executive agency In chapter 3 we described some of the problems that arose in the 1980s when a White House staff constitutionally insulated from the usual mechanisms of oversight became involved in direct operations During the 1990s Richard Clarke occasionally tried to exercise such authority sometimes successfully but often causing friction Yet a subtler and more serious danger is that as the NSC staff is consumed by these day to day tasks it has less capacity to find the time and detachment needed to advise a president on larger policy issues That means less time to work on major new initiatives help with legislative management to steer needed bills through Congress and track the design and implementation of the strategic plans for regions countries and issues that we discuss in chapter 12 Much of the job of operational coordination remains with the agencies especially the CIA There DCI Tenet and his chief aides ran interagency meetings nearly every day to coordinate much of the government s day to day work The DCI insisted he did not make policy and only oversaw its implementation In the struggle against terrorism these distinctions seem increasingly artificial Also as the DCI becomes a lead coordinator of the government s operations it becomes harder to play all the position s other roles including that of analyst in chief The problem is nearly intractable because of the way the government is currently structured Lines of operational authority run to the expanding executive departments and they are guarded for understandable reasons the DCI commands the CIA s personnel overseas the secretary of defense will not yield to others in conveying commands to military forces the Justice Department will not give up the responsibility of deciding whether to seek arrest warrants But the result is that each agency or department needs its own intelligence apparatus to support the performance of its duties It is hard to break down stovepipes when there are so many stoves that are legally and politically entitled to have cast iron pipes of their own Recalling the Goldwater Nichols legislation of 1986 Secretary Rumsfeld reminded us that to achieve better joint capability each of the armed services had to give up some of their turf and authorities and prerogatives Today he said the executive branch is stove piped much like the four services were nearly 20 years ago He wondered if it might be appropriate to ask agencies to give up some of their existing turf and authority in exchange for a stronger faster more efficient government wide joint effort Privately other key officials have made the same point to us We therefore propose a new institution a civilian led unified joint command for counterterrorism It should combine strategic intelligence and joint operational planning In the Pentagon s Joint Staff which serves the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff intelligence is handled by the J 2 directorate operational planning by J 3 and overall policy by J 5 Our concept combines the J 2 and J 3 functions intelligence and operational planning in one agency keeping overall policy coordination where it belongs in the National Security Council Recommendation We recommend the establishment of a National Counterterrorism Center NCTC built on the foundation of the existing Terrorist Threat Integration Center TTIC Breaking the older mold of national government organization this NCTC should be a center for joint operational planning and joint intelligence staffed by personnel from the various agencies The head of the NCTC should have authority to evaluate the performance of the people assigned to the Center Such a joint center should be developed in the same spirit that guided the military s creation of unified joint commands or the shaping of earlier national agencies like the National Reconnaissance Office which was formed to organize the work of the CIA and several defense agencies in space NCTC Intelligence The NCTC should lead strategic analysis pooling all source intelligence foreign and domestic about transnational terrorist organizations with global reach It should develop net assessments comparing enemy capabilities and intentions against U S defenses and countermeasures It should also provide warning It should do this work by drawing on the efforts of the CIA FBI Homeland Security and other departments and agencies It should task collection requirements both inside and outside the United States The intelligence function J 2 should build on the existing TTIC structure and remain distinct as a national intelligence center within the NCTC As the government s principal knowledge bank on Islamist terrorism with the main responsibility for strategic analysis and net assessment it should absorb a significant portion of the analytical talent now residing in the CIA s Counterterrorist Center and the DIA s Joint Intelligence Task Force Combatting Terrorism JITF CT NCTC Operations The NCTC should perform joint planning The plans would assign operational responsibilities to lead agencies such as State the CIA the FBI Defense and its combatant commands Homeland Security and other agencies The NCTC should not direct the actual execution of these operations leaving that job to the agencies The NCTC would then track implementation it would look across the foreign domestic divide and across agency boundaries updating plans to follow through on cases The joint operational planning function J 3 will be new to theTTIC structure The NCTC can draw on analogous work now being done in the CIA and every other involved department of the government as well as reaching out to knowledgeable officials in state and local agencies throughout the United States The NCTC should not be a policymaking body Its operations and planning should follow the policy direction of the president and the National Security Council Consider this hypothetical case The NSA discovers that a suspected terrorist is traveling to Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur The NCTC should draw on joint intelligence resources including its own NSA counterterrorism experts to analyze the identities and possible destinations of these individuals Informed by this analysis the NCTC would then organize and plan the management of the case drawing on the talents and differing kinds of experience among the several agency representatives assigned to it assigning tasks to the CIA overseas to Homeland Security watching entry points into the United States and to the FBI If military assistance might be needed the Special Operations Command could be asked to develop an appropriate concept for such an operation The NCTC would be accountable for tracking the progress of the case ensuring that the plan evolved with it and integrating the information into a warning The NCTC would be responsible for being sure that intelligence gathered from the activities in the field became part of the government s institutional memory about Islamist terrorist personalities organizations and possible means of attack In each case the involved agency would make its own senior managers aware of what it was being asked to do If those agency heads objected and the issue could not easily be resolved then the disagreement about roles and missions could be brought before the National Security Council and the president NCTC Authorities The head of the NCTC should be appointed by the president and should be equivalent in rank to a deputy head of a cabinet department The head of the NCTC would report to the national intelligence director an office whose creation we recommend below placed in the Executive Office of the President The head of the NCTC would thus also report indirectly to the president This official s nomination should be confirmed by the Senate and he or she should testify to the Congress as is the case now with other statutory presidential offices like the U S trade representative To avoid the fate of other entities with great nominal authority and little real power the head of the NCTC must have the right to concur in the choices of personnel to lead the operating entities of the departments and agencies focused on counterterrorism specifically including the head of the Counterterrorist Center the head of the FBI s Counterterrorism Division the commanders of the Defense Department s Special Operations Command and Northern Command and the State Department s coordinator for counterterrorism The head of the NCTC should also work with the director of the Office of Management and Budget in developing the president s counterterrorism budget There are precedents for surrendering authority for joint planning while preserving an agency s operational control In the international context NATO commanders may get line authority over forces assigned by other nations In U S unified commands commanders plan operations that may involve units belonging to one of the services In each case procedures are worked out formal and informal to define the limits of the joint commander s authority The most serious disadvantage of the NCTC is the reverse of its greatest virtue The struggle against Islamist terrorism is so important that any clear cut centralization of authority to manage and be accountable for it may concentrate too much power in one place The proposed NCTC would be given the authority of planning the activities of other agencies Law or executive order must define the scope of such line authority The NCTC would not eliminate interagency policy disputes These would still go to the National Security Council To improve coordination at the White House we believe the existing Homeland Security Council should soon be merged into a single National Security Council The creation of the NCTC should help the NSC staff concentrate on its core duties of assisting the president and supporting interdepartmental policymaking We recognize that this is a new and difficult idea precisely because the authorities we recommend for the NCTC really would as Secretary Rumsfeld foresaw ask strong agencies to give up some of their turf and authority in exchange for a stronger faster more efficient government wide joint effort Countering transnational Islamist terrorism will test whether the U S government can fashion more flexible models of management needed to deal with the twenty first century world An argument against change is that the nation is at war and cannot afford to reorganize in midstream But some of the main innovations of the 1940s and 1950s including the creation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and even the construction of the Pentagon itself were undertaken in the midst of war Surely the country cannot wait until the struggle against Islamist terrorism is over Surprise when it happens to a government is likely to be a complicated diffuse bureaucratic thing It includes neglect of responsibility but also responsibility so poorly defined or so ambiguously delegated that action gets lost That comment was made more than 40 years ago about Pearl Harbor We hope another commission writing in the future about another attack does not again find this quotation to be so apt UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY In our first section we concentrated on counterterrorism discussing how to combine the analysis of information from all sources of intelligence with the joint planning of operations that draw on that analysis In this section we step back from looking just at the counterterrorism problem We reflect on whether the government is organized adequately to direct resources and build the intelligence capabilities it will need not just for countering terrorism but for the broader range of national security challenges in the decades ahead The Need for a Change During the Cold War intelligence agencies did not depend on seamless integration to track and count the thousands of military targets such as tanks and missiles fielded by the Soviet Union and other adversary states Each agency concentrated on its specialized mission acquiring its own information and then sharing it via formal finished reports The Department of Defense had given birth to and dominated the main agencies for technical collection of intelligence Resources were shifted at an incremental pace coping with challenges that arose over years even decades We summarized the resulting organization of the intelligence community in chapter 3 It is outlined below Members of the U S Intelligence Community Office of the Director of Central Intelligence which includes the Office of the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence for Community Management the Community Management Staff theTerrorism Threat Integration Center the National Intelligence Council and other community offices The Central Intelligence Agency CIA which performs human source collection all source analysis and advanced science and technology National intelligence agencies National Security Agency NSA which performs signals collection and analysis National Geospatial Intelligence Agency NGA which performs imagery collection and analysis National Reconnaissance Office NRO which develops acquires and launches space systems for intelligence collection Other national reconnaissance programs Departmental intelligence agencies Defense Intelligence Agency DIA of the Department of Defense Intelligence entities of the Army Navy Air Force and Marines Bureau of Intelligence and Research INR of the Department of State Office of Terrorism and Finance Intelligence of the Department of Treasury Office of Intelligence and the Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence Divisions of the Federal Bureau of Investigation of the Department of Justice Office of Intelligence of the Department of Energy Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection IAIP and Directorate of Coast Guard Intelligence of the Department of Homeland Security The need to restructure the intelligence community grows out of six problems that have become apparent before and after 9 11 Structural barriers to performing joint intelligence work National intelligence is still organized around the collection disciplines of the home agencies not the joint mission The importance of integrated allsource analysis cannot be overstated Without it it is not possible to connect the dots No one component holds all the relevant information By contrast in organizing national defense the Goldwater Nichols legislation of 1986 created joint commands for operations in the field the Unified Command Plan The services the Army Navy Air Force and Marine Corps organize train and equip their people and units to perform their missions Then they assign personnel and units to the joint combatant commander like the commanding general of the Central Command CENTCOM The Goldwater Nichols Act required officers to serve tours outside their service in order to win promotion The culture of the Defense Department was transformed its collective mind set moved from service specific to joint and its operations became more integrated Lack of common standards and practices across the foreign domestic divide The leadership of the intelligence community should be able to pool information gathered overseas with information gathered in the United States holding the work wherever it is done to a common standard of quality in how it is collected processed e g translated reported shared and analyzed A common set of personnel standards for intelligence can create a group of professionals better able to operate in joint activities transcending their own service specific mind sets Divided management of national intelligence capabilities While the CIA was once central to our national intelligence capabilities following the end of the Cold War it has been less able to influence the use of the nation s imagery and signals intelligence capabilities in three national agencies housed within the Department of Defense the National Security Agency the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office One of the lessons learned from the 1991 Gulf War was the value of national intelligence systems satellites in particular in precision warfare Since that war the department has appropriately drawn these agencies into its transformation of the military Helping to orchestrate this transformation is the under secretary of defense for intelligence a position established by Congress after 9 11 An unintended consequence of these developments has been the far greater demand made by Defense on technical systems leaving the DCI less able to influence how these technical resources are allocated and used Weak capacity to set priorities and move resources The agencies are mainly organized around what they collect or the way they collect it But the priorities for collection are national As the DCI makes hard choices about moving resources he or she must have the power to reach across agencies and reallocate effort Too many jobs The DCI now has at least three jobs He is expected to run a particular agency the CIA He is expected to manage the loose confederation of agencies that is the intelligence community He is expected to be the analyst in chief for the government sifting evidence and directly briefing the President as his principal intelligence adviser No recent DCI has been able to do all three effectively Usually what loses out is management of the intelligence community a difficult task even in the best case because the DCI s current authorities are weak With so much to do the DCI often has not used even the authority he has Too complex and secret Over the decades the agencies and the rules surrounding the intelligence community have accumulated to a depth that practically defies public comprehension There are now 15 agencies or parts of agencies in the intelligence community The community and the DCI s authorities have become arcane matters understood only by initiates after long study Even the most basic information about how much money is actually allocated to or within the intelligence community and most of its key components is shrouded from public view The current DCI is responsible for community performance but lacks the three authorities critical for any agency head or chief executive officer 1 control over purse strings 2 the ability to hire or fire senior managers and 3 the ability to set standards for the information infrastructure and personnel The only budget power of the DCI over agencies other than the CIA lies in coordinating the budget requests of the various intelligence agencies into a single program for submission to Congress The overall funding request of the 15 intelligence entities in this program is then presented to the president and Congress in 15 separate volumes When Congress passes an appropriations bill to allocate money to intelligence agencies most of their funding is hidden in the Defense Department in order to keep intelligence spending secret Therefore although the House and Senate Intelligence committees are the authorizing committees for funding of the intelligence community the final budget review is handled in the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations committees Those committees have no subcommittees just for intelligence and only a few members and staff review the requests The appropriations for the CIA and the national intelligence agencies NSA NGA and NRO are then given to the secretary of defense The secretary transfers the CIA s money to the DCI but disburses the national agencies money directly Money for the FBI s national security components falls within the appropriations for Commerce Justice and State and goes to the attorney general In addition the DCI lacks hire and fire authority over most of the intelligence community s senior managers For the national intelligence agencies housed in the Defense Department the secretary of defense must seek the DCI s concurrence regarding the nomination of these directors who are presidentially appointed But the secretary may submit recommendations to the president without receiving this concurrence The DCI cannot fire these officials The DCI has even less influence over the head of the FBI s national security component who is appointed by the attorney general in consultation with the DCI Combining Joint Work with Stronger Management We have received recommendations on the topic of intelligence reform from many sources Other commissions have been over this same ground Thoughtful bills have been introduced most recently a bill by the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee Porter Goss R Fla and another by the ranking minority member Jane Harman D Calif In the Senate Senators Bob Graham D Fla and Dianne Feinstein D Calif have introduced reform proposals as well Past efforts have foundered because the president did not support them because the DCI the secretary of defense or both opposed them and because some proposals lacked merit We have tried to take stock of these experiences and borrow from strong elements in many of the ideas that have already been developed by others Recommendation The current position of Director of Central Intelligence should be replaced by a National Intelligence Director with two main areas of responsibility 1 to oversee national intelligence centers on specific subjects of interest across the U S government and 2 to manage the national intelligence program and oversee the agencies that contribute to it First the National Intelligence Director should oversee national intelligence centers to provide all source analysis and plan intelligence operations for the whole government on major problems One such problem is counterterrorism In this case we believe that the center should be the intelligence entity formerly TTIC inside the National Counterterrorism Center we have proposed It would sit there alongside the operations management unit we described earlier with both making up the NCTC in the Executive Office of the President Other national intelligence centers for instance on counterproliferation crime and narcotics and China would be housed in whatever department or agency is best suited for them The National Intelligence Director would retain the present DCI s role as the principal intelligence adviser to the president We hope the president will come to look directly to the directors of the national intelligence centers to provide all source analysis in their areas of responsibility balancing the advice of these intelligence chiefs against the contrasting viewpoints that may be offered by department heads at State Defense Homeland Security Justice and other agencies Second the National Intelligence Director should manage the national intelligence program and oversee the component agencies of the intelligence community See diagram The National Intelligence Director would submit a unified budget for national intelligence that reflects priorities chosen by the National Security Council an appropriate balance among the varieties of technical and human intelligence collection and analysis He or she would receive an appropriation for national intelligence and apportion the funds to the appropriate agencies in line with that budget and with authority to reprogram funds among the national intelligence agencies to meet any new priority as counterterrorism was in the 1990s The National Intelligence Director should approve and submit nominations to the president of the individuals who would lead the CIA DIA FBI Intelligence Office NSA NGA NRO Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security and other national intelligence capabilities The National Intelligence Director would manage this national effort with the help of three deputies each of whom would also hold a key position in one of the component agencies foreign intelligence the head of the CIA defense intelligence the under secretary of defense for intelligence homeland intelligence the FBI s executive assistant director for intelligence or the under secretary of homeland security for information analysis and infrastructure protection Other agencies in the intelligence community would coordinate their work within each of these three areas largely staying housed in the same departments or agencies that support them now Returning to the analogy of the Defense Department s organization these three deputies like the leaders of the Army Navy Air Force or Marines would have the job of acquiring the systems training the people and executing the operations planned by the national intelligence centers And just as the combatant commanders also report to the secretary of defense the directors of the national intelligence centers e g for counterproliferation crime and narcotics and the rest also would report to the National Intelligence Director The Defense Department s military intelligence programs the joint military intelligence program JMIP and the tactical intelligence and related activities program TIARA would remain part of that department s responsibility The National Intelligence Director would set personnel policies to establish standards for education and training and facilitate assignments at the national intelligence centers and across agency lines The National Intelligence Director also would set information sharing and information technology policies to maximize data sharing as well as policies to protect the security of information Too many agencies now have an opportunity to say no to change The National Intelligence Director should participate in an NSC executive committee that can resolve differences in priorities among the agencies and bring the major disputes to the president for decision The National Intelligence Director should be located in the Executive Office of the President This official who would be confirmed by the Senate and would testify before Congress would have a relatively small staff of several hundred people taking the place of the existing community management offices housed at the CIA In managing the whole community the National Intelligence Director is still providing a service function With the partial exception of his or her responsibilities for overseeing the NCTC the National Intelligence Director should support the consumers of national intelligence the president and policymaking advisers such as the secretaries of state defense and homeland security and the attorney general We are wary of too easily equating government management problems with those of the private sector But we have noticed that some very large private firms rely on a powerful CEO who has significant control over how money is spent and can hire or fire leaders of the major divisions assisted by a relatively modest staff while leaving responsibility for execution in the operating divisions There are disadvantages to separating the position of National Intelligence Director from the job of heading the CIA For example the National Intelligence Director will not head a major agency of his or her own and may have a weaker base of support But we believe that these disadvantages are outweighed by several other considerations The National Intelligence Director must be able to directly oversee intelligence collection inside the United States Yet law and custom has counseled against giving such a plain domestic role to the head of the CIA The CIA will be one among several claimants for funds in setting national priorities The National Intelligence Director should not be both one of the advocates and the judge of them all Covert operations tend to be highly tactical requiring close attention The National Intelligence Director should rely on the relevant joint mission center to oversee these details helping to coordinate closely with the White House The CIA will be able to concentrate on building the capabilities to carry out such operations and on providing the personnel who will be directing and executing such operations in the field Rebuilding the analytic and human intelligence collection capabilities of the CIA should be a full time effort and the director of the CIA should focus on extending its comparative advantages Recommendation The CIA Director should emphasize a rebuilding the CIA s analytic capabilities b transforming the clandestine service by building its human intelligence capabilities c developing a stronger language program with high standards and sufficient financial incentives d renewing emphasis on recruiting diversity among operations officers so they can blend more easily in foreign cities e ensuring a seamless relationship between human source collection and signals collection at the operational level and f stressing a better balance between unilateral and liaison operations The CIA should retain responsibility for the direction and execution of clandestine and covert operations as assigned by the relevant national intelligence center and authorized by the National Intelligence Director and the president This would include propaganda renditions and nonmilitary disruption We believe however that one important area of responsibility should change Recommendation Lead responsibility for directing and executing paramilitary operations whether clandestine or covert should shift to the Defense Department There it should be consolidated with the capabilities for training direction and execution of such operations already being developed in the Special Operations Command Before 9 11 the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U S personnel It relied on proxies instead organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training The results were unsatisfactory Whether the price is measured in either money or people the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations secretly operating standoff missiles and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity The post 9 11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one We believe this proposal to be consistent with it Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions The operation itself would be planned in common The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality they may also be one more symptom of the civil military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4 It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management not in the creation of redundant overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work The CIA s experts should be integrated into the military s training exercises and planning To quote a CIA official now serving in the field One fight one team Recommendation Finally to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified as they are today Opponents of declassification argue that America s enemies could learn about intelligence capabilities by tracking the top line appropriations figure Yet the top line figure by itself provides little insight into U S intelligence sources and methods The U S government readily provides copious information about spending on its military forces including military intelligence The intelligence community should not be subject to that much disclosure But when even aggregate categorical numbers remain hidden it is hard to judge priorities and foster accountability UNITY OF EFFORT IN SHARING INFORMATION Information Sharing We have already stressed the importance of intelligence analysis that can draw on all relevant sources of information The biggest impediment to all source analysis to a greater likelihood of connecting the dots is the human or systemic resistance to sharing information The U S government has access to a vast amount of information When databases not usually thought of as intelligence such as customs or immigration information are included the storehouse is immense But the U S government has a weak system for processing and using what it has In interviews around the government official after official urged us to call attention to frustrations with the unglamorous back office side of government operations In the 9 11 story for example we sometimes see examples of information that could be accessed like the undistributed NSA information that would have helped identify Nawaf al Hazmi in January 2000 But someone had to ask for it In that case no one did Or as in the episodes we describe in chapter 8 the information is distributed but in a compartmented channel Or the information is available and someone does ask but it cannot be shared What all these stories have in common is a system that requires a demonstrated need to know before sharing This approach assumes it is possible to know in advance who will need to use the information Such a system implicitly assumes that the risk of inadvertent disclosure outweighs the benefits of wider sharing Those Cold War assumptions are no longer appropriate The culture of agencies feeling they own the information they gathered at taxpayer expense must be replaced by a culture in which the agencies instead feel they have a duty to the information to repay the taxpayers investment by making that information available Each intelligence agency has its own security practices outgrowths of the Cold War We certainly understand the reason for these practices Counterintelligence concerns are still real even if the old Soviet enemy has been replaced by other spies But the security concerns need to be weighed against the costs Current security requirements nurture overclassification and excessive compartmentation of information among agencies Each agency s incentive structure opposes sharing with risks criminal civil and internal administrative sanctions but few rewards for sharing information No one has to pay the long term costs of overclassifying information though these costs even in literal financial terms are substantial There are no punishments for not sharing information Agencies uphold a need to know culture of information protection rather than promoting a need to share culture of integration Recommendation Information procedures should provide incentives for sharing to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge Intelligence gathered about transnational terrorism should be processed turned into reports and distributed according to the same quality standards whether it is collected in Pakistan or in Texas The logical objection is that sources and methods may vary greatly in different locations We therefore propose that when a report is first created its data be separated from the sources and methods by which they are obtained The report should begin with the information in its most shareable but still meaningful form Therefore the maximum number of recipients can access some form of that information If knowledge of further details becomes important any user can query further with access granted or denied according to the rules set for the network and with queries leaving an audit trail in order to determine who accessed the information But the questions may not come at all unless experts at the edge of the network can readily discover the clues that prompt to them We propose that information be shared horizontally across new networks that transcend individual agencies The current system is structured on an old mainframe or hub andspoke concept In this older approach each agency has its own database Agency users send information to the database and then can retrieve it from the database A decentralized network model the concept behind much of the information revolution shares data horizontally too Agencies would still have their own databases but those databases would be searchable across agency lines In this system secrets are protected through the design of the network and an information rights management approach that controls access to the data not access to the whole network An outstanding conceptual framework for this kind of trusted information network has been developed by a task force of leading professionals in national security information technology and law assembled by the Markle Foundation Its report has been widely discussed throughout the U S government but has not yet been converted into action Recommendation The president should lead the government wide effort to bring the major national security institutions into the information revolution He should coordinate the resolution of the legal policy and technical issues across agencies to create a trusted information network No one agency can do it alone Well meaning agency officials are under tremendous pressure to update their systems Alone they may only be able to modernize the stovepipes not replace them Only presidential leadership can develop government wide concepts and standards Currently no one is doing this job Backed by the Office of Management and Budget a new National Intelligence Director empowered to set common standards for information use throughout the community and a secretary of homeland security who helps extend the system to public agencies and relevant private sector databases a government wide initiative can succeed White House leadership is also needed because the policy and legal issues are harder than the technical ones The necessary technology already exists What does not are the rules for acquiring accessing sharing and using the vast stores of public and private data that may be available When information sharing works it is a powerful tool Therefore the sharing and uses of information must be guided by a set of practical policy guidelines that simultaneously empower and constrain officials telling them clearly what is and is not permitted This is government acting in new ways to face new threats the most recent Markle report explains And while such change is necessary it must be accomplished while engendering the people s trust that privacy and other civil liberties are being protected that businesses are not being unduly burdened with requests for extraneous or useless information that taxpayer money is being well spent and that ultimately the network will be effective in protecting our security The authors add Leadership is emerging from all levels of government and from many places in the private sector What is needed now is a plan to accelerate these efforts and public debate and consensus on the goals UNITY OF EFFORT IN THE CONGRESS Strengthen Congressional Oversight of Intelligence and Homeland Security Of all our recommendations strengthening congressional oversight may be among the most difficult and important So long as oversight is governed by current congressional rules and resolutions we believe the American people will not get the security they want and need The United States needs a strong stable and capable congressional committee structure to give America s national intelligence agencies oversight support and leadership Few things are more difficult to change in Washington than congressional committee jurisdiction and prerogatives To a member these assignments are almost as important as the map of his or her congressional district The American people may have to insist that these changes occur or they may well not happen Having interviewed numerous members of Congress from both parties as well as congressional staff members we found that dissatisfaction with congressional oversight remains widespread The future challenges of America s intelligence agencies are daunting They include the need to develop leading edge technologies that give our policymakers and warfighters a decisive edge in any conflict where the interests of the United States are vital Not only does good intelligence win wars but the best intelligence enables us to prevent them from happening altogether Under the terms of existing rules and resolutions the House and Senate intelligence committees lack the power influence and sustained capability to meet this challenge While few members of Congress have the broad knowledge of intelligence activities or the know how about the technologies employed all members need to feel assured that good oversight is happening When their unfamiliarity with the subject is combined with the need to preserve security a mandate emerges for substantial change Tinkering with the existing structure is not sufficient Either Congress should create a joint committee for intelligence using the Joint Atomic Energy Committee as its model or it should create House and Senate committees with combined authorizing and appropriations powers Whichever of these two forms are chosen the goal should be a structure codified by resolution with powers expressly granted and carefully limited allowing a relatively small group of members of Congress given time and reason to master the subject and the agencies to conduct oversight of the intelligence establishment and be clearly accountable for their work The staff of this committee should be nonpartisan and work for the entire committee and not for individual members The other reforms we have suggested for a National Counterterrorism Center and a National Intelligence Director will not work if congressional oversight does not change too Unity of effort in executive management can be lost if it is fractured by divided congressional oversight Recommendation Congressional oversight for intelligence and counterterrorism is now dysfunctional Congress should address this problem We have considered various alternatives A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one A single committee in each house of Congress combining authorizing and appropriating authorities is another The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director not to the secretary of defense We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees The majority party s representation on this committee should never exceed the minority s representation by more than one Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees Armed Services Judiciary Foreign Affairs and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee s work Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees without set terms thereby letting them accumulate expertise The committees should be smaller perhaps seven or nine members in each house so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility and accountability for the quality of the committee s work The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress One expert witness not a member of the administration told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department s successful development The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority the House Select Committee on Homeland Security may be eliminated The Senate does not have even this Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security Through not more than one authorizing committee and one appropriating subcommittee in each house Congress should be able to ask the secretary of homeland security whether he or she has the resources to provide reasonable security against major terrorist acts within the United States and to hold the secretary accountable for the department s performance Recommendation Congress should create a single principal point of oversight and review for homeland security Congressional leaders are best able to judge what committee should have jurisdiction over this department and its duties But we believe that Congress does have the obligation to choose one in the House and one in the Senate and that this committee should be a permanent standing committee with a nonpartisan staff Improve the Transitions between Administrations In chapter 6 we described the transition of 2000 2001 Beyond the policy issues we described the new administration did not have its deputy cabinet officers in place until the spring of 2001 and the critical subcabinet officials were not confirmed until the summer if then In other words the new administration like others before it did not have its team on the job until at least six months after it took office Recommendation Since a catastrophic attack could occur with little or no notice we should minimize as much as possible the disruption of national security policymaking during the change of administrations by accelerating the process for national security appointments We think the process could be improved significantly so transitions can work more effectively and allow new officials to assume their new responsibilities as quickly as possible Before the election candidates should submit the names of selected members of their prospective transition teams to the FBI so that if necessary those team members can obtain security clearances immediately after the election is over A president elect should submit lists of possible candidates for national security positions to begin obtaining security clearances immediately after the election so that their background investigations can be complete before January 20 A single federal agency should be responsible for providing and maintaining security clearances ensuring uniform standards including uniform security questionnaires and financial report requirements and maintaining a single database This agency can also be responsible for administering polygraph tests on behalf of organizations that require them A president elect should submit the nominations of the entire new national security team through the level of under secretary of cabinet departments not later than January 20 The Senate in return should adopt special rules requiring hearings and votes to confirm or reject national security nominees within 30 days of their submission The Senate should not require confirmation of such executive appointees below Executive Level 3 The outgoing administration should provide the president elect as soon as possible after election day with a classified compartmented list that catalogues specific operational threats to national security major military or covert operations and pending decisions on the possible use of force Such a document could provide both notice and a checklist inviting a president elect to inquire and learn more ORGANIZING AMERICA S DEFENSES IN THE UNITED STATES The Future Role of the FBI We have considered proposals for a new agency dedicated to intelligence collection in the United States Some call this a proposal for an American MI 5 although the analogy is weak the actual British Security Service is a relatively small worldwide agency that combines duties assigned in the U S government to the Terrorist Threat Integration Center the CIA the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security The concern about the FBI is that it has long favored its criminal justice mission over its national security mission Part of the reason for this is the demand around the country for FBI help on criminal matters The FBI was criticized rightly for the overzealous domestic intelligence investigations disclosed during the 1970s The pendulum swung away from those types of investigations during the 1980s and 1990s though the FBI maintained an active counterintelligence function and was the lead agency for the investigation of foreign terrorist groups operating inside the United States We do not recommend the creation of a new domestic intelligence agency It is not needed if our other recommendations are adopted to establish a strong national intelligence center part of the NCTC that will oversee counterterrorism intelligence work foreign and domestic and to create a National Intelligence Director who can set and enforce standards for the collection processing and reporting of information Under the structures we recommend the FBI s role is focused but still vital The FBI does need to be able to direct its thousands of agents and other employees to collect intelligence in America s cities and towns interviewing informants conducting surveillance and searches tracking individuals working collaboratively with local authorities and doing so with meticulous attention to detail and compliance with the law The FBI s job in the streets of the United States would thus be a domestic equivalent operating under the U S Constitution and quite different laws and rules to the job of the CIA s operations officers abroad Creating a new domestic intelligence agency has other drawbacks The FBI is accustomed to carrying out sensitive intelligence collection operations in compliance with the law If a new domestic intelligence agency were outside of the Department of Justice the process of legal oversight never easy could become even more difficult Abuses of civil liberties could create a backlash that would impair the collection of needed intelligence Creating a new domestic intelligence agency would divert attention of the officials most responsible for current counterterrorism efforts while the threat remains high Putting a new player into the mix of federal agencies with counterterrorism responsibilities would exacerbate existing information sharing problems A new domestic intelligence agency would need to acquire assets and personnel The FBI already has 28 000 employees 56 field offices 400 satellite offices and 47 legal attach offices a laboratory operations center and training facility an existing network of informants cooperating defendants and other sources and relationships with state and local law enforcement the CIA and foreign intelligence and law enforcement agencies Counterterrorism investigations in the United States very quickly become matters that involve violations of criminal law and possible law enforcement action Because the FBI can have agents working criminal matters and agents working intelligence investigations concerning the same international terrorism target the full range of investigative tools against a suspected terrorist can be considered within one agency The removal of the wall that existed before 9 11 between intelligence and law enforcement has opened up new opportunities for cooperative action within the FBI Counterterrorism investigations often overlap or are cued by other criminal investigations such as money laundering or the smuggling of contraband In the field the close connection to criminal work has many benefits Our recommendation to leave counterterrorism intelligence collection in the United States with the FBI still depends on an assessment that the FBI if it makes an all out effort to institutionalize change can do the job As we mentioned in chapter 3 we have been impressed by the determination that agents display in tracking down details patiently going the extra mile and working the extra month to put facts in the place of speculation In our report we have shown how agents in Phoenix Minneapolis and New York displayed initiative in pressing their investigations FBI agents and analysts in the field need to have sustained support and dedicated resources to become stronger intelligence officers They need to be rewarded for acquiring informants and for gathering and disseminating information differently and more broadly than usual in a traditional criminal invetigation FBI employees need to report and analyze what they have learned in ways the Bureau has never done before Under Director Robert Mueller the Bureau has made significant progress in improving its intelligence capabilities It now has an Office of Intelligence overseen by the top tier of FBI management Field intelligence groups have been created in all field offices to put FBI priorities and the emphasis on intelligence into practice Advances have been made in improving the Bureau s information technology systems and in increasing connectivity and information sharing with intelligence community agencies Director Mueller has also recognized that the FBI s reforms are far from complete He has outlined a number of areas where added measures may be necessary Specifically he has recognized that the FBI needs to recruit from a broader pool of candidates that agents and analysts working on national security matters require specialized training and that agents should specialize within programs after obtaining a generalist foundation The FBI is developing career tracks for agents to specialize in counterterrorism counterintelligence cyber crimes criminal investigations or intelligence It is establishing a program for certifying agents as intelligence officers a certification that will be a prerequisite for promotion to the senior ranks of the Bureau New training programs have been instituted for intelligence related subjects The Director of the FBI has proposed creating an Intelligence Directorate as a further refinement of the FBI intelligence program This directorate would include units for intelligence planning and policy and for the direction of analysts and linguists We want to ensure that the Bureau s shift to a preventive counterterrorism posture is more fully institutionalized so that it survives beyond Director Mueller s tenure We have found that in the past the Bureau has announced its willingness to reform and restructure itself to address transnational security threats but has fallen short failing to effect the necessary institutional and cultural changes organization wide We want to ensure that this does not happen again Despite having found acceptance of the Director s clear message that counterterrorism is now the FBI s top priority two years after 9 11 we also found gaps between some of the announced reforms and the reality in the field We are concerned that management in the field offices still can allocate people and resources to local concerns that diverge from the national security mission This system could revert to a focus on lower priority criminal justice cases over national security requirements Recommendation A specialized and integrated national security workforce should be established at the FBI consisting of agents analysts linguists and surveillance specialists who are recruited trained rewarded and retained to ensure the development of an institutional culture imbued with a deep expertise in intelligence and national security The president by executive order or directive should direct the FBI to develop this intelligence cadre Recognizing that cross fertilization between the criminal justice and national security disciplines is vital to the success of both missions all new agents should receive basic training in both areas Furthermore new agents should begin their careers with meaningful assignments in both areas Agents and analysts should then specialize in one of these disciplines and have the option to work such matters for their entire career with the Bureau Certain advanced training courses and assignments to other intelligence agencies should be required to advance within the national security discipline In the interest of cross fertilization all senior FBI managers including those working on law enforcement matters should be certified intelligence officers The FBI should fully implement a recruiting hiring and selection process for agents and analysts that enhances its ability to target and attract individuals with educational and professional backgrounds in intelligence international relations language technology and other relevant skills The FBI should institute the integration of analysts agents linguists and surveillance personnel in the field so that a dedicated team approach is brought to bear on national security intelligence operations Each field office should have an official at the field office s deputy level for national security matters This individual would have management oversight and ensure that the national priorities are carried out in the field The FBI should align its budget structure according to its four main programs intelligence counterterrorism and counterintelligence criminal and criminal justice services to ensure better transparency on program costs management of resources and protection of the intelligence program The FBI should report regularly to Congress in its semiannual program reviews designed to identify whether each field office is appropriately addressing FBI and national program priorities The FBI should report regularly to Congress in detail on the qualifications status and roles of analysts in the field and at headquarters Congress should ensure that analysts are afforded training and career opportunities on a par with those offered analysts in other intelligence community agencies The Congress should make sure funding is available to accelerate the expansion of secure facilities in FBI field offices so as to increase their ability to use secure email systems and classified intelligence product exchanges The Congress should monitor whether the FBI s information sharing principles are implemented in practice The FBI is just a small fraction of the national law enforcement community in the United States a community comprised mainly of state and local agencies The network designed for sharing information and the work of the FBI through local Joint Terrorism Task Forces should build a reciprocal relationship in which state and local agents understand what information they are looking for and in return receive some of the information being developed about what is happening or may happen in their communities In this relationship the Department of Homeland Security also will play an important part The Homeland Security Act of 2002 gave the under secretary for information analysis and infrastructure protection broad responsibilities In practice this directorate has the job to map terrorist threats to the homeland against our assessed vulnerabilities in order to drive our efforts to protect against terrorist threats These capabilities are still embryonic The directorate has not yet developed the capacity to perform one of its assigned jobs which is to assimilate and analyze information from Homeland Security s own component agencies such as the Coast Guard Secret Service Transportation Security Administration Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection The secretary of homeland security must ensure that these components work with the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate so that this office can perform its mission Homeland Defense At several points in our inquiry we asked Who is responsible for defending us at home Our national defense at home is the responsibility first of the Department of Defense and second of the Department of Homeland Security They must have clear delineations of responsibility and authority We found that NORAD which had been given the responsibility for defending U S airspace had construed that mission to focus on threats coming from outside America s borders It did not adjust its focus even though the intelligence community had gathered intelligence on the possibility that terrorists might turn to hijacking and even use of planes as missiles We have been assured that NORAD has now embraced the full mission Northern Command has been established to assume responsibility for the defense of the domestic United States Recommendation The Department of Defense and its oversight committees should regularly assess the adequacy of Northern Command s strategies and planning to defend the United States against military threats to the homeland The Department of Homeland Security was established to consolidate all of the domestic agencies responsible for securing America s borders and national infrastructure most of which is in private hands It should identify those elements of our transportation energy communications financial and other institutions that need to be protected develop plans to protect that infrastructure and exercise the mechanisms to enhance preparedness This means going well beyond the preexisting jobs of the agencies that have been brought together inside the department Recommendation The Department of Homeland Security and its oversight committees should regularly assess the types of threats the country faces to determine a the adequacy of the government s plans and the progress against those plans to protect America s critical infrastructure and b the readiness of the government to respond to the threats that the United States might face We look forward to a national debate on the merits of what we have recommended and we will participate vigorously in that debate
