 And So s Your Old Man Stories about Republican President designate George W Bush invariably note that he has spent most of his life doing exactly what his father former President George H W Bush once did This is not quite right W has spent most of his life doing exactly what his father did but doing it worse He is a chip off the old block chipped Poppy Bush starred at Andover W lazed his way through the prep school The father motored through Yale in two and a half years earning a Phi Beta Kappa key along the way The son squeaked through old Eli Poppy like his own father Sen Prescott Bush before him captained the Yale baseball team and joined the secret society Skull Bones W wasn t good enough to play ball for Yale And though he joined Skull Bones he whiled away his nights with a much less refined group the hard drinking frat brothers of DKE The elder Bush enlisted in the Navy in 1942 became the service s youngest fighter pilot flew 58 missions in the South Pacific was shot down over enemy waters and won the Distinguished Flying Cross The son also became a fighter pilot for the Texas Air National Guard He spent the Vietnam War flying missions over the Texas scrub W followed his father s path into the oil business Both abandoned New England for West Texas to strike it rich Both relied on rich friends for a head start but whereas the old man scored in his oilfields the son struggled George H W ran for Congress and won George W ran for Congress and lost Come middle age the father threw himself into public service U N ambassador China ambassador CIA director The son threw himself into baseball as an executive for the Texas Rangers Americans tend to forget the heroic life of President Bush This was one of his unfortunate talents He could make the extraordinary seem mundane There are competing theories about what the son s pale imitation of a r sum signifies The first popular among Gov Bush s fans is that he s a late bloomer It took him till his mid 40s to settle down but now that he has he is making up for his lost years and surpassing the father he has so long trailed After all he has won a statewide race in Texas twice Poppy lost both his statewide campaigns in Texas Junior has already vanquished former Texas Gov Ann Richards the woman who ridiculed his father in 1988 Now he will topple Al Gore half the team that battered Dad in 1992 The other less charitable theory surmises that just as W has tried to equal his father and fallen short so he ll find some way to choke in the presidential election It s far too early to take sides on this question or to draw grand psychological conclusions about how the father will shadow the son s presidential campaign But there is another way to look at W s knockoff r sum as a documentary of a generational change in American politics Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess author of America s Political Dynasties notes that American political dynasties come in all sizes and flavors In some a family from humble origins uses political success to make itself rich and snooty In some a dynasty is stolidly consistent across generations The Tafts of Ohio for instance have been steady Republican burghers for more than a century The Bushes started as a noblesse oblige dynasty Prescott Bush began his forgettable service as a senator only after a long career as a gentleman banker He viewed his political activity as an obligation and he instilled that sentiment in his son George Poppy was dutiful in pursuit of office compiling the requisite experience almost mechanically adding line after line to his r sum until America had no choice but to elect him president Politics was always a duty never a pleasure Remember the horror of hearing George Bush ingratiating himself with voters by calling them my main man and the like But what began as noblesse oblige has morphed into something different during this generation The Bushes are a microcosm of the transformation of Republican politics from Northeastern elitism to Western populism The son s failure to match his father reflects this small D democratization Bush the elder came of age when New England Republicans led the party and patrician manners were boons to a Republican But in an era when a politician s ability to communicate trumps anything else and the balance of Republican power has shifted west the preppy Anglican ethos that defined the old man is suspect George W Bush spent his 1978 congressional campaign excusing his father s membership in the Trilateral Commission In today s politics the son s checkered r sum signifies success By choosing DKE over Skull Bones drinking over studying baseball over the United Nations George W compiled a record that suits our populist age W has bartered the high status accomplishments of his father for something more precious regular guyness He is warm and impulsive where his father was distant and calculating Every story about the son applauds his democratic instincts his ease with all kinds of people his ebullience and physicality his informality His passionate Methodism contrasts with his ancestors chilly Episcopalianism The Gore dynasty oddly has followed the opposite path Al Gore Jr has outdone his senator father in the calculus of political achievement but the veep is stiff and awkward and dutiful in a way that his impulsive backslappy dad never was George W Bush jokes that his father s idea of a perfect son is Al Gore Jr This may be America s choice in 2000 the George W Bush who isn t George H W Bush or the Al Gore who is
