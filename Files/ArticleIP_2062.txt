 Living in a Second Best World Attention all shoppers A marvelous new marketplace is opening its doors Soon thanks to the next great wave of deregulation due to arrive in neighborhoods across the nation you will be able to haggle over your electricity rates What s that you say You are not thrilled at the prospect of a new bunch of utility companies calling you at dinner time to offer you their special one time only package of cut rate prices for customers who turn on their air conditioning only after 8 p m never run the clothes dryer except between 10 a m and noon and use only fluorescent bulbs Are you worried perhaps that when most of your neighbors are buying their kilowatts from elsewhere your local utility will no longer gladly send crews to restore your power in an ice storm Or that competing electricity producers won t invest in cleaner generators or that they will switch to the cheapest and dirtiest coal they can find Or that average prices won t really fall after they ve paid for all the new executives and middlemen and advertising copywriters and telemarketers they will need in order to compete If you re suffering such qualms you re probably the sort of person who doesn t appreciate the ample benefits telephone and airline deregulation have brought You re someone who still thinks it wouldn t be such an awful thing to have a single phone company reaching from coast to coast because it means you need only one phone card to call anywhere in the country who would willingly relinquish exciting new features such as dialing 11 extra digits in order to protect yourself against surprise charges by no name telephone companies a fun service my local carrier recently introduced You would just as soon avoid all those arguments about being slammed for charges by a phone company you didn t choose or being crammed for special services you didn t order You re also probably one of those people who needs to make flight reservations at the last moment who has better things to do than search the Internet for bargain rates and hates feeling the person next to you paid only half as much for a ticket You long for leg room and semi edible meals in coach class You remember when confirmed reservations meant the airline would a hold your seat and b feel obliged to find you a substitute on another carrier if necessary if for some reason your flight didn t take off In other words you re someone like me What s the matter with us Surely we know from both economic theory and concrete example that open competition is the best assurance of consumer satisfaction Companies shielded from market pressures by monopoly position or government intervention grow fat lazy and indifferent to their customers Why are we so dubious about the benefits that freely competing telephone companies and airlines shower upon us Well partly it s because the world keeps offering us more and more choices except the choice of lengthening the day We ve already got our hands full doing our jobs and caring for our families and shopping for the everyday things of life in malls and catalogs and now the Internet We are not wrong to suspect that many of the corporate efficiency gains the economists extol come at the usually uncounted expense of our own time and convenience When airlines overbook to minimize the chance they might fly with empty seats the value of the hours we waste doesn t get counted in their costs Unless it cuts our own employer s productivity which in hard to track ways it may well do it doesn t even get subtracted from the GDP Ditto the time we spend trying to figure out whom to call when our phone is out of order In other words these companies are improving their bottom lines by shifting costs from measurable cash to immeasurable hassle What s more there are theoretical as well as practical reasons why deregulation may not always produce net gains That s because for much of our day we live in the world of the second best Popular economists don t like to talk much about the world of the second best because it s such a messy place It inhabits those sectors of the economy where one or more requirements of purely competitive markets many suppliers a relatively homogeneous product easy access for new companies to the market enough information for consumers to make the best buys cannot be met to a substantial degree Sometimes the operative constraint is physical you can t build airports just any old place Or entry costs are so high that no one will pay them unless guaranteed a return at least initially as when cable TV was new Sometimes it arises from the nature of the enterprise you wouldn t want to have to have dozens of different telephone lines in your house just so you could connect with all the different phone companies your friends might select Sometimes it s because there are nonmarket goods involved the high value people place on personal safety national security a clean environment or social welfare Sometimes the products being sold such as sophisticated medical care really are too complex for anyone but a specialist to understand fully Of course no markets are really perfect in this imperfect world and you want to be careful not to let suppliers exaggerate the constraints to buttress an unwarranted case for de facto or legislated monopoly But second best situations abound and here s the upsetting thing that economic theory tells us about them In the world of the second best it is not guaranteed that a move toward eliminating the market imperfections will make the market more efficient In such a situation for example cutting regulations and increasing competition might make consumers better off or it might make them worse off There are no guarantees This of course is not a very satisfactory state of affairs for theoretical economists or for that matter policy makers or speech writers It means that instead of blandly assuming less regulation is better than more or more competition is better than less you have to study the specifics of each case very carefully And you have to keep experimenting with alterations and examining the results as external conditions change over time And this can be very tiresome for everyone involved So I can t tell you if deregulating utilities will necessarily lead to lower cost more efficient electricity service Or whether the recent move to consolidation among the regional companies created in the federal breakup of AT T will make telephone service better or worse But a priori neither can anyone else
