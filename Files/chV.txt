Vaqueros CowboysThe vaquero was the early Hispano cowboy and the antecedent of the Hollywood cowboy Horses and cattle were brought to New Spain by the Spaniards When Hernn Corts landed on the eastern shore of Mexico he had with him sixteen horses and at least three breeds of cattle Cattle breeding was a tradition hundreds of years old in Spain and Corts brought this tradition to Mexico and eventually to the Southwest The Spaniards introduced the system of el rancho with vaqueros being the workers who herded the cattle and conducting cattle drives Vaca means cow and a vaquero is one who works with cows The Spanish mission padres recognized this labor and conscripted mestizos mixedrace people Indians and Mexicans to take care of the cattle It was these individuals who developed the system equipment practices and traditions that have lasted these past few hundred years The Anglo cowboy learned everything about cattle from the vaqueroThe Mexican vaquero was a laborer a peon who was used by the missionaries to ride the horses and take care of the cattle So it was the culture of the vaquero that became the basis for the romantic cowboy of Hollywood The ensemble equipment and clothing of the vaquero evolved through the years as a combination of Spanish leather and regional indigenous fabrics He always wore a sombrero with a wide brim a leather chaqueta jacket tightfitting kneelength sotas breeches and botas leather leggings for protection The vaquero also wore iron spurs like those worn by the Conquistadores which are still worn to this day The various styles of saddles from the Moorish to the Spanish war saddle eventually changed when the vaqueros began making their own saddles more suitable for riding hard and for quick mounting and dismountingThe early vaqueros those of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were mestizos Indians Negroes and mulattos When Anglo Americans moved into Texas and bought enormous tracts of land they established huge ranches and hired Mexican vaqueros to work them They recruited and moved whole families from Mexico to work and live on their ranches The King and Kennedy ranches of east Texas are contemporary examples of this tradition and have many generations of Mexican vaqueros still living on their ranches A social historical study of the vaquero life on the King and Kennedy ranches from the early nineteenth century to the present has been written by Monday and ColleyThe vaquero from California also worked on very large ranches such as the Tejon ranch in the lower San Joaquin Valley This way of life has been memorialized in the work of Arnold Rojas who was a vaquero and has written about his life in California in the twentieth century Rojas makes a distinction between the cowboy the vaquero and the buckaroo The vaquero was originally Hispanic or Mexican or Indian and herded cattle in the Far West in the states of California Nevada Oregon Arizona Utah and Washington whereas the cowboys who herded cattle in the southern states were usually Negro or Anglo The vaquero or buckaroo is a westerner and the cowboy is a southerner The definition is a territorial one with the cowboy working east of the Rockies and the vaquero west of the Rockies It is this difference that Rojas writes about in his threevolume memoir of the California vaquero Anglos coined the word buckaroo meaning vaquero because they disliked the word cowboy and did not want to call themselves by that name Somehow when they pronounced vaquero it came out of their mouths as buckaroo The California Indians were trained by the Spanish missionaries to herd cattle and they were the primary vaqueros until the mids Mexicans from Sonora took over as vaqueros when they started migrating into California in the nineteenth century The style of horse riding instituted by the Spaniards was called la jinete a term that relates to the equipment used in riding It not only includes the bits spurs and the saddles but also the length of the stirrups how the reins are held and the amount of pressure of the knees on the horse Rojas was born in California as was his mother who as a child had a pleasant encounter with the bandit Tiburcio Vsquez He spent his whole life working as a vaquero and he states I speak as a vaqueroand I know whereof I speak Rojas  References Graham    Mather  Monday and Colley  Rojas

many stories recounting the legendary exploits of Vsquez especially those dealing with his romantic life as he was considered a true Don Juan On several occasions it was a lady that saved him from the legal authorities by helping to hide him Once at a party or fandango a woman hid him under her great hooped dress where he crouched silently until the constable gave up his search of the premises

the foot of the bed while the mother showed off her newborn to the sheriffLuis Valdez wrote and directed a play about Vsquez titled Bandido performed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles in  Valdez

as home base The game goes on until all of the colors have been chosen and all of the girls are caught In some versions the girls carry ribbons each of a different color Scholars who have analyzed the game point to the socialization of gender roles for little girls and the game serves as a lesson in the inevitable eventual separation from the safety of home This was one of the games collected by the Federal Writers Program in New Mexico during the s Although there were many games played by Hispano and Mexican children this one appears to be one with a long historical traditionJose Limn has written about a version found in Texas It is an ancient game that can be traced to medieval Spain to a place called Zafra In the version from Zafra two teams are involved one representing evil the other goodness One team is led by the devil el demonio and the other by an angel ngel de la guarda angel of the guard Each player is named a color and the two leaders the devil and the angel try to gain the most players In this version it is a battle between good and evil to see who can win the most soulsSee also Hilitos de Oro Naranja DulceReferences CardozoFreeman  Ebinger  Limn b Robe  Writers Program of New Mexico La Virgen de GuadalupeAlso commonly known as Nuestra Seora de Guadalupe she is the Virgin Mary who appeared to Juan Diego a Mexican Christian Indian on December   Historical documents verify the story of her apparitions She identified herself as the Virgin Mary the Mother of God and speaking in Nahuatl she asked Juan Diego to go to the Spanish bishop and ask that a temple be built there where she appeared the mount of Tepeyac To Juan Diego she was a beautiful woman who spoke his language so after much difficulty he sought to speak to the bishop but his story was not heard and he was asked to return another day The beautiful woman appeared to Juan Diego a second time and he was asked to seek the bishops audience again On the second try Juan Diego saw the bishop his story was heard and questioned but was not believed The bishop wanted a sign from the Great Lady so that he would know it was really she who was sending Juan Diego Diego intended to go back to Tepeyac and inform the beautiful woman but when he returned home he found that his uncle Juan Bernardino was extremely ill The next morning on December  as he walked to Tlatelolco to call a priest to come to his uncles side the beautiful woman came to him a third time asking what was wrong Diego told her of his sick uncle and of the request from the bishop She told him his uncle was now well and would not die and sent him to the top of a hill to cut fresh flowers that he was to take to the bishop as proof of her existence Diego followed her instructions and at the top of the hill he found beautiful roses of Castile still covered with dew He cut them and The Lady the Mother of God arranged them in his tilma cloak and sent him to the bishop with the proof requested When Diego unfolded his tilma in front of the bishop the roses fell to the floor and there on the tilma was an image of the Virgin Mary Now the Spanish bishop believed and as the beautiful woman requested a church was built right on the mount of Tepeyac The tilma with the image of the Virgin Mary still hangs in the temple called Guadalupe The name that the beautiful Lady gave herself was Tlecuauhtlacupeuh but to the Spaniards it sounded like Guadalupe which they instantly recognized as Our Lady of Guadalupe from Estremadura Spain But the Aztecs understood that in the Nahuatl language the name Tlecuauhtlacupeuh meant la que viene volando de la luz como el guila de fuego she who comes flying from the region of light like an eagle of fireTonantzin was an Aztec goddess literally called Our Holy Mother also known as Tonan Guadalupe appeared at what was once the temple of Tonantzin at the mount of Tepeyac Even today in Mexico La Virgen Mara is often called Tonantzin The acceptance of La Virgen de Guadalupe by the indigenous population of Mexico was the beginning of Mexican Christianity and the conversion of the Aztecs to Catholicism Guadalupe became the symbol of Indian Catholicism different from the European Catholicism of the Spaniards As the Aztecs adapted the Catholic religion to their indigenous beliefs they created a religion that met their own needs and own way of life She was declared the Patroness of the Mexican Nation in  and in  Pope Benedict XIV canonized Guadalupe as an official saint She was crowned Queen of Mexico in  showing how strong a symbol of Mexican nationalism she had become Today she continues as the countrys strongest symbol of Mexican identity The cathedral built in her honor can no longer be used because of structural damage but a new one was built in the early s Masses are held every hour of the day and the church is constantly filled to capacityFaith in La Virgen de Guadalupe is one of the strongest convictions in Mexican and Chicano culture Guadalupe has become a powerful cultural image Her appearance was crucial in restoring dignity and humanity to a conquered people Eric Wolf refers to Guadalupe as a master symbol a symbol which seems to enshrine the major hopes and aspirations of an entire society  She is the mother of the mestizo race La Raza The People and a political symbol for the oppressed and powerless She is affectionately referred to as La Morenita Virgencita Lupita Madrecita Madre de Dios and Nuestra Seora Virgil Elizondo a Chicano theologian states Guadalupe is the key to understanding the Christianity of the New World and the Christian consciousness of the Mexicans and the Mexican Americans of the United States Belief in her power as a mediator for the oppressed has prompted faithful followers to carry her image into battle for over  years Father Hidalgo during the Mexican War of Independence Emiliano Zapata during the Mexican Revolution and Csar Chvez during his battle for farmworkers rights against California agribusiness all carried the emblem of La Virgen de Guadalupe The image of Guadalupe provides support for those who believe in her divine power as the deliverer from oppressionEl Teatro Campesino has created a cultural piece titled La Virgen de Tepeyac The Virgin of Tepeyac For many years now it has been performed during the early part of December in the mission church of San Juan Bautista California It has become a Bay Area Christmas tradition to make the twohour journey to the small mission town to experience the miracle of Guadalupe although all Mexican American churches throughout the United States organize elaborate church ceremonies for December  the day of her appearance so there are literally hundreds of celebrations one can choose from to commemorate the dayContemporary Chicanas continuously look toward Guadalupe and reevaluate her influence in their mothers and grandmothers lives and in their own lives Although she is the preeminent representation of womanhood she has become an icon for womens subjugation and oppression In the s the artist Yolanda Lopez created a memorable image of working mothers by painting a garment worker at a sewing machine within the recognizable blue shield background that is easily acknowledged as the emblem of La Virgen de Guadalupe In New Mexico a young Chicana created a dance theater piece titled Apariciones de la Madre which incorporated modern ideas of women into the traditional images of the Aztec GuadalupeChicano muralists have painted images of Guadalupe in her traditional Aztec setting on barrio walls since the late s and often other cultural symbols such as a lowrider car are added to emphasize the Chicano experience La Virgen de Guadalupe is revered religiously candles are lit for her flowers are left at the church for her and yet she is very much a part of popular culture Her image is found on Tshirts key rings lowrider car hoods and tattooed across adult male chests Her face and form are frequently deciphered on tortillas shadows on walls and the trunks of trees When such an image is found thousands of people whether in Mexico or the United States flock to see and pray before the image The influence of Guadalupe is as powerful today as it was  years agoSee also El Teatro CampesinoReferences Alarcon  Brundage  Demarest and Taylor  Elizondo
