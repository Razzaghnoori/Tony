 Labor s Cheap Thrill Until John Sweeney took over the AFL CIO last year Republicans for years had barely mentioned the labor movement They didn t have to The rich got richer The median wage fell In the third quarter of 1996 after a brief reversal it went back to falling again No one has the nerve to ask for a raise For years labor or what was left of it did nothing at all Then last winter the AFL CIO voted to spend 35 million for voter education Not contributions to candidates i e hard money But just telling people about politicians voting records soft money And suddenly denunciation of labor bosses is on every Republican lip Now it s a pittance right 35 million Business vastly outspends labor on political contributions seven to one according to the New York Times the other day So why does the GOP worry Why is 35 million against business s hundreds of millions such a crisis Why is Republican control of Congress now at stake with such a laughable amount Because the GOP has big big trouble if there s even a whisper that Your real wage has fallen Inequality is spreading like a plague Medicare and student loans are now in play With only 35 million hey word could leak out Maybe business can outspend labor by nine to one or 90 to one but it can never spend enough to cancel the message out But isn t it unfair for union members to have to pay for this from compulsory dues when many vote Republican No it is not unfair First members can opt out or object Typically members every year get cards Remember you can opt out of paying dues for extra political work Conservatives have sued unions over this for years Unions must have major audits segregate money There is notice hearing rebate procedure The kind of due process liberals dream of for the poor but never get Compare this machinery with your rights as a company stockholder Can you opt out of the company s soft money political spending No Do you even know what they re doing No With millions of us in mutual funds who has any idea what political messages we re paying for But back to unions Do members in fact opt out with all their legal rights to do so No The highest opt out union right now is the Communications Workers of America which until recently was an open shop meaning that many members never paid dues at all Out of 600 000 CWA members there are currently about 2 000 objectors In other unions the opt out rate is much much lower So if union members do vote Republican why don t more of them opt out of soft money spending on ads that implicitly at least criticize Republican candidates Maybe members want to cast their own votes but they still like to hear what their union says Because of abortion or gun control or the Cold War I may decide I want to vote for the GOP But don t I want to hear my union s voice on issues where the union has some expertise That s why labor is making fewer endorsements Just provide the consumer advice On wages Social Security Medicare Let people make up their own minds The notion that millions of union members are being forced against their will to help finance this union campaign is simply a Republican fantasy When labor gets involved in politics this is not a detour from its real job of negotiating wages and hours Soft money for voter education That is labor s real job the very core purpose of a union Ever since the Supreme Court decision that required the opt out the court has drawn a wobbly line Negotiating wages OK Discussing politics Oh that s an extracurricular unrelated to the union s real work But as Felix Frankfurter wrote in dissent this distinction is silly After all what is Social Security but a job benefit Either the union gets the pension directly at the bargaining table or indirectly in Congress Or what about Clinton s poster child family leave Crawl off in a corner and give birth without pay Still it s something Either labor can get it directly from the boss or labor can get it from the boss via Congress What s the difference except in the latter case all of us benefit At least Frankfurter a New Dealer understood as we no longer can what a union is supposed to do In Europe the labor movement often began first as a labor party The parliament was the bargaining table But when labor defends Medicare isn t it still being a special interest No What s unique about labor is It s not a special interest or a single issue Special interest It s not like R J Reynolds looking for a tax break The AFL CIO is never or rarely looking for something that helps the AFL CIO purely as an institution Look at the last session an AFL CIO lawyer friend said to me recently What was labor fighting for Stop Medicare cuts Raise minimum wage These soft money fights mostly help not union chiefs or even members but the nonunion masses the private sector 90 percent who have no union at all Who benefits then You Me Aren t we nonunion types the freeloaders Why do the 10 percent in unions have to pay for our battles That is the real unfairness of soft money Of late business groups have begun running counter ads Sure But what can they counter with You don t need a minimum wage Let s cut back Social Security Isn t your standard of living getting too high No Business can t counter the ads It has to change the subject Thus Labor bosses But what about business bosses Union corruption That s been true sometimes but who pays the money to corrupt unions The frightening thing about labor soft money is that on the merits of the issues the GOP is defenseless What do you say to people who want the standard of living to rise For 20 years the median wage has dropped while the two parties have hauled in hundreds of millions from business groups Isn t labor with its soft money seeking to raise the standard of living for those of us with W 2s the closest thing we have now to a citizens party
