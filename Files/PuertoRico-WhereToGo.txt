 Where to Go Puerto Rico is an island of contrasts perhaps the only destination in the Caribbean where the city streets hold as much allure as the beaches One third of the island s population of just over three million live in San Juan which is undoubtedly the draw for many One of the leading commercial and industrial centers of the Caribbean it is characterized by high rise office blocks and sprawling suburbs It s the delights and historical treasures of the old town however that capture the eyes and imaginations of most visitors And beyond the limits of the capital are mountains rivers and lakes forests and plantations waiting to be explored Old San Juan Old San Juan is without doubt one of the most spectacular sights of the Caribbean Founded in 1521 it is partially surrounded by walls and fortifications that have protected it from modernization and indiscriminate development The carefully preserved historic houses and public buildings retain many of the most charming features of the original Spanish colonial architecture Cobblestone streets the stones were brought as ballast on the Spanish ships which went home filled with treasure and gold tiny squares and grand plazas surprise visitors at every turn as they wander the neat grid of streets planned four centuries ago Only eight blocks wide San Juan can easily be covered on foot though there are some steep ascents that may be challenging in the Caribbean heat Even if you only have one day you ll be able to enjoy its delights If possible however take at least a couple of days Enjoying a rest in a shady plaza or taking a long lunch at an outdoor caf are just as much a part of your trip as a tour around the museums San Juan is a living city and it s especially bustling after dark when crowds throng to the bars and restaurants or simply stroll the narrow streets and airy plazas Begin your exploration at Plaza de Col n Columbus Square If you take a taxi from the outlying resort areas this is a good place to alight before traffic in the narrow streets forces your vehicle to a halt The square was named after Columbus on the 400th anniversary of Puerto Rico s discovery in 1893 After admiring the unusually tall statue of the discoverer leave the square from the northeastern corner and walk along Boulevard del Valle this is a pretty street with a series of brightly painted buildings but the traffic can be busy At the top of the hill on the right you ll find the towering walls of Fuerte San Crist bal the largest fort in Puerto Rico It s also the youngest fort on the island built in the 18th century to plug a hole in the easterly defenses of the city From atop the brick walls which withstood fierce attacks by cannonballs and other projectiles you can enjoy panoramic views out to the east and over San Juan Bay to the modern city The fort s vast interior courtyard now echoes with the sound of running children rather the marching of soldier s boots but one dormitory of the old barracks has been re created with bunks lining the walls and uniforms hung neatly on pegs Take the long dark walk to the dungeons to find a faded drawing of a Spanish galleon sketched on the wall by a captain accused of treason After visiting the fort continue west along Boulevard del Valle which becomes Calle Norzagaray Here you ll be tempted by fine views of the sea you may even catch sight of a cruise ship sailing gracefully into port This route sits against the old city walls which were completed in 1785 and from here it is easy to see why the city was thought to be impregnable Thanks to the high thick walls and the watch towers with their distinctive rounded roofs the residents could be sure that no one would approach unseen After a walk of about half a mile you ll find the plain fa ade of the Museo de Arte e Historia San Juan Museum of Art and History on your left Once a major market place for the city built in 1855 the building now houses a major collection of Puerto Rican art Just past the museum a large open grassy area comes into view If you happen to be here on a weekend you ll find thousands of Puerto Rican families out flying kites This area is the best place to take advantage of the sea breezes and many kites soar hundreds of feet up in the air When collisions occur or lines get crossed jovial banter breaks out between the parties it s a very social activity The grassy area cut by one gravel path leads to the end of the promontory and the mighty Fuerte San Felipe del Morro usually simply referred to as El Morro meaning the headland On your right as you walk toward the entrance you ll pass the old city cemetery resting between the walls and the sea The ornate tombs are still carefully attended and hold the remains of some of Puerto Rico s most illustrious families The entrance to El Morro is reached across a wide dry moat a last defense against attack Walk through the huge curved doorway to the heart of the fort El Morro was one of the most formidable citadels in the world During the 16th and 17th centuries it was one of a ring of forts that held the key to Spanish power in the Caribbean The watchtowers of El Morro look out to sea and inland across San Juan Bay to the coastal plains beyond The multilevel defenses made it possible to fire weapons from sea level up to hundreds of feet above ground Despite some serious attempts by English and Dutch forces the fort was never forcibly taken Since 1845 the lighthouse here has provided protection for ships off the coast the present light dates from 1908 The old barracks and ammunition arsenal now house a museum which offers an audio visual presentation about the history of the fort in English and Spanish on alternate half hours After exploring the fort walk back across the grassy lawns At the small traffic circle at the end of the driveway you ll find refreshment stalls where you can get a cool drink or snack before moving on Young Puertorrique os have taken to skateboarding and rollerblading on nearby Plaza del Quartel Ballaj They gather every day at this square to compete with their peers and show off their skills to passersby To the left is Cuartel de Ballaj Ballaj Barracks once the major army barracks under Spanish rule and now a significant cultural attraction The second floor of the building houses the Museum of the Americas The museum s mission is to gather collections of artifacts of Amerindian culture including folk art basket ware from Colombia and ceremonial masks and costumes from around Central America The barracks themselves are also interesting large open rooms that used to house soldiers and their families face in toward a large court where drills were carried out The square now remains eerily quiet unless a school group is touring the museum Opposite the entrance to the Barracks is the long white building that houses the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture A new museum is planned for this space but in the meantime temporary art exhibitions display the best of Puerto Rican painting and sculpture Follow Calle Beneficencia the street leading off the right side of the barracks back towards town You ll soon come to a small square on your left with a huge totemic sculpture This is Plaza del Quinto Centenario Quincentenary Square The sculpture symbolizes the 500 years of Puerto Rico s existence On close inspection Amerindian and Spanish themes can be seen but some elements are a little obscure Walk on to reach another small square Plaza San Jos San Jos Square one of the gems of the city Situated close to El Morro it was once one of the most important squares in San Juan In the center is a statue of Juan Ponce de Le n in full regalia that was cast in 1797 from the iron of a British cannon confiscated after their unsuccessful attack on the city Edged by historic buildings the square has changed little since the 17th century except that many of the houses have been converted to restaurants and bars This is a good place to come after dark and watch the world go by On the north flank of the square is the Spanish Gothic Iglesia San Jos San Jos Church the second oldest church in the New World The plain white fa ade reflects the sunlight helping cool the interior The body of Ponce de Le n was interred here for over 300 years before being moved to the San Juan Cathedral in 1908 Attached to the church is a large building that was originally a Dominican Convent It was an army barracks until 1966 when it was taken under the auspices of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture You can enter the main square and see the three cloistered floors that flank it Art exhibitions are held here regularly On the east side of Plaza San Jos are two important buildings In the corner is the Pablo Casals Museum dedicated to the life of the cello virtuoso and composer who lived the last years of his life in Puerto Rico Casals was responsible for injecting life back into the classical genre here he sponsored a classical music festival which still takes place every June Next to the Casals Museum is the Casa de los Contrafuertes House of the Buttresses named after the sturdy stone supports that reach out at angles from the walls It is thought to be the oldest privately owned residence in Old San Juan dating from the early 18th century There are two museums on the upper floors the Pharmacy Museum a complete apothecary s shop with bottles and scales and above it the Museum of Latin American Print Leave Plaza San Jos via Calle Cristo Halfway down this street on your left you ll find the Catedral de San Juan San Juan Cathedral The church dates from 1540 though a comprehensive restoration was carried out in the early 19th century The interior features pretty trompe l oeil details that add depth to the plain columns and domes On the northern wall is the tomb of Ponce de Le n he shares this place of honor with San P o a Catholic martyr whose remains were brought from Rome in 1862 Facing the cathedral is Plazuela de las Monjas a tiny square filled with trees where courting couples and old folks take advantage of the shade You may also catch the sound of jingling bells signaling that the local ice cream seller is around On the north side of the square is the El Convento Hotel a great place to take a break The hotel has an interesting history because as the name suggests it started life as a convent in 1651 Unfortunately as the number of nuns declined the convent was forced to close and the building decaying year by year played host to the best and busiest brothel in the city It was also one of the cheapest hotels in town before being rescued and transformed in the early 1990s On the western flank of the square you ll find the Museo del Ni o Children s Museum No sterile display cases full of artifacts here This is an entertaining hands on activity center where kids can be kids and yet still have a learning experience There are four floors of interactive exhibits including a real dentist s chair where mom or dad can be examined by their offspring and a giant bubble machine on the upper floor Behind the museum are a number of other important attractions Take Calle las Monjas toward San Juan Bay After a short distance you ll arrive at the western wall and a small square Plazuela de la Rogativa with a bronze statue commemorating the torchlight religious procession or rogativa that saved the city in 1797 It s believed that the lights held by the bishop and the women of the city fooled the British forces in the bay into assuming that Spanish reinforcements had arrived The British fled empty handed Just a short walk north of the square is the Casa Blanca White House which for 250 years was the home of the descendants of Ponce de Le n Something of a mini fortress safe behind its own high wall the house itself is fascinating the interior is a museum to life in 16th and 17th century San Juan with many rooms full of period furniture Walk back toward the Plazuela de la Rogativa and peer over the city wall which rises over 100 ft 301 2 m at this point The plain fa ade is broken by the San Juan Gate which was once the only entrance to the city from the old port The gate was constructed in 1639 and the walls were completed in 1641 Every person who traveled across the Atlantic from Spain would enter through this narrow passage many would make their way directly to the Cathedral to give thanks for a safe arrival and all goods were transported through here The thick wooden doors are an impressive sight they were locked and guarded each night but now remain open to allow people to stroll along the seafront Make your way back to the cathedral along Calle San Juan and turn right once again at Calle Cristo You ll pass some interesting shops that might tempt you to browse for a while the designer outlet stores are particularly popular Turn right at Calle Fortaleza to reach one of the jewels of San Juan La Fortaleza Now the home of the Governor of Puerto Rico this fort is in fact a historic monument dating back to 1533 It was the first fortification built by the founders of San Juan and has been in constant use since that time Of course it has grown over the centuries you ll find extensions and renovations in the Baroque Gothic and Neo Classic styles Now a National Historic Site this fascinating home is full of period furniture You can tour the house and its extensive gardens but you must book in advance At the southern end of Calle Cristo at the edge of the city wall is tiny Capilla del Cristo This chapel was said to have been built in the memory of a young man who in 1753 raced his horse down Calle Cristo was unable to stop the animal in time and fell over the wall to his death Others say that in fact the chapel was built to commemorate the fact that the boy was saved by divine intervention at this very spot Whichever is true the chapel now stands as a barrier to any other such mishap To the left of the chapel is 18th century Casa del Libro House of Books a small museum devoted to rare books and the printing and binding arts Next door is the Centro Nacional de Artes y Artesan as Popular Arts and Crafts Center a showcase of modern art and crafts managed by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture Temporary exhibitions are mounted here and some items are occasionally made available for purchase To the right of the chapel is the entrance to Parque de las Palomas Pigeon Park clinging to the side of the city wall and a favorite with children The park can be a little oppressive it s always a flurry of people and pigeons but at least pause long enough to admire the panoramic views across San Juan harbor Back at Calle Fortaleza take a right and continue to the intersection of Calle San Jos Here you ll pass fascinating small shops selling art and crafts from around the world Wooden carvings from Asia sit side by side with Haitian native paintings Take a left and a block farther down you ll enter Plaza de Armas This was the first central square of Old San Juan and the City Hall or Alcald a still sits on its northern side The army used to drill here hence the name armas means weapons or arms but today it is simply a place for people to meet and have a coffee or sit and chat Workers enjoy picnic lunches here at midday old people while away the afternoon The Alcald a has an interesting interior with checkerboard marble floors and magnificent chandeliers It s usually open on weekdays you can check with the tourist information office on the ground floor as to whether it s OK to wander around Back on Calle Fortaleza walk east until you reach the Casa de Callej n House of the Alley on the corner of Callej n de Capilla A fine example of an 18th century house it is now the Museum of the Puerto Rican Family full of the furniture toys and other daily artifacts of a well to do San Juan family Taking a left out of the museum brings you back to Plaza Col n from where you can make your way south toward San Juan harbor Along the way you ll pass Teatro Tapia Tapia Theater named after Puerto Rican playwright Alejandro Tapia y Rivera The splendid fa ade was restored in 1976 the interior remodeled in 1987 The theater hosts regular performances of ballet dance and drama often showcasing works by modern Puerto Rican writers and choreographers You can t miss the harbor Just look for the huge cruise ships which dwarf the surrounding buildings The cruise port comprises several large jetties from whence hundreds of passengers disembark on a regular basis Walk west along the seafront in the direction of the town Next to the ultramodern cruise ship wharfs you ll will find the rather down at the heel commercial ferry jetty which caters to the small boats that ply across the harbor to the modern city Taking one of these little boats is one of the best ways to take in the size of the harbor and the old town You ll also get to see Puerto Ricans at work and and play snacking on empanadillas pastry turnovers filled with meat or cheese and enjoying salsa music Near the ferry dock across Calle Marina you ll see the rising edifice of the San Juan Post Office a magnificent building with Art Deco features In front of the post office is a tiny tourist information office La Casita where you can pick up maps and information Continue past the Post Office and the adjoining Plaza de Hostos which is full of souvenir stalls and faux designer watches galore To the left is the Arsenal de la Marina a fine building with strange Moorish details Built in 1800 it houses the Fine Arts and Folk Arts departments of the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture In front of you is the Paseo de la Princessa a smart promenade that has emerged from years of neglect to become the place in town to stroll in the evening or to sit and watch the world go by A number of new statues and fountains now grace the Paseo One named Raices Roots depicts members of each of the races that have contributed to the modern Puerto Rican mix surrounded by playful dolphins La Princessa home of the offices of the Puerto Rico Tourist Company sits along the Paseo Originally a prison this is why it is outside the city walls it is now a showcase of modern Puerto Rican art Metropolitan San Juan Toward the end of the 18th century the city fathers realized that San Juan was becoming overcrowded so they decided to break through a section of the vast wall and expand the city s borders Gangs of laborers were hired to carry out the job you can see photographs of them in Fuerte San Crist bal This action altered the perception that San Juan was a citadel city already an anachronism at the time and plans were drawn up to develop the area immediately east of the city an area that became known as Puerta de Tierra or gateway to the land Today San Juan stretches all the way around the bay A number of the modern suburbs though primarily residential have some interesting attractions for visitors Just outside the old town facing out toward the sea is the impressive El Capitolio home of the Puerto Rico Legislature Constructed in 1925 it has already been recognized as a historic monument Continuing beyond this sight you ll pass some rather careworn buildings before reaching Parque Mu oz Rivera one of the places where local families like to relax on the weekends There are areas of formal gardens a small fort and children s play area A seafront promenade to the north sees hundreds of families strolling on warm weekend evenings the beach though very narrow is the nearest one to the old city and it s always crowded in the afternoon and on weekends A series of bridges lead across a small strait to modern San Juan or to the right to Condado and the resort area Miramar a pleasant residential quarter with fine family homes benefits from its position alongside the Isla Grande commuter airport Santurce a business and residential area has few attractions except for a concentration of movie palaces and the Centro de Bellas Artes the largest performing arts center in the Caribbean Housing three theaters and five rehearsal halls this complex has spearheaded a resurgence in the popularity of traditional Puerto Rican music and dance It also has a regular program of performers from around the world Hato Rey s unexpected futuristic skyline marks it as the financial center of the Caribbean Those skyscrapers are banks and the street on which they stand has been nicknamed the Milla de Oro or Golden Mile R o Piedras is the home of the University of Puerto Rico Its considerable campus serves 42 000 students and the university museum in a modern one story structure nearby exhibits contemporary Puerto Rican paintings and sculptures along with archaeological evidence of the talents of the island s original Indian inhabitants More Indian relics plus old Spanish coins and tiles can be viewed in the Ponce de Le n Museum at Caparra 4 miles 61 2 km west of San Juan on Route 2 Alongside this small white museum are the ruins of the house Ponce de Le n built and from which he directed the colonization of the island In 1521 after a number of outbreaks of disease the capital was moved to San Juan and Caparra was abandoned What s left of Ponce de Le n s house looks like ancient Roman ruins earnestly preserved Cata o is an industrial area visible directly across the bay from the old city Most of its buildings though important to the economy of the island spoil the view but one is of rather more interest to visitors The Bacardi rum plant offers an interesting and well organized free guided tour Small motorized trains carry visitors to the distilling and bottling plants Free samples are dispensed and in the gift shop you can buy bottles to take back home For those more interested in history than in the production of rum there is a fascinating museum that relates the story of the Bacardi family who still own the business from their arrival in Cuba from Spain to their flight to Puerto Rico after the Cuban revolution in 1959 to their influence on the global drinks market San Juan s Resorts Puerto Rico s popularity as a holiday island has risen enormously since the early 1960s Most of the development and tourist infrastructure lies in a narrow strip along the coast east of San Juan Condado was the first it had already been on the map with the jet set and saw further expansion when a string of high rise hotels were built along the long stretches of sandy beach Its main street Ashford Avenue has something of the Art Deco feel of Miami s South Beach As you stroll past the shops selling expensive top drawer merchandise you re likely to pass a number of impeccably dressed older women carrying impeccably coiffed toy poodles As time has passed the young energy has moved east taking advantage of available land and now Isla Verde farther along the coast has been developed some say overdeveloped This is where all the real action is A number of large hotels with theaters casinos and restaurants attract high rollers Fast food restaurants bars and gift shops fill the streets The two main beaches of Isla Verde are impressive and they get very busy but the resort is very close to the airport and can get a little noisy The Northeast Heading east out of Isla Verde it takes only a couple of minutes to leave the city behind The coast road Route 187 leads past the end of the runway at Mu oz Mar n Airport on the left and Isla Verde s balneario public beach on the right Travel over the little bridge that spans the entrance to Laguna la Torrecilla and suddenly you are in the countryside The road runs along the coastline and through the Bosque Estatal de Pi ones an area of beautiful sandy beaches and coconut palms that until recently was a pristine environment where sleepy cattle sat under the trees It is now a popular weekend picnic spot for city families many of whom leave their litter behind when they depart This sort of carelessness spoils Pi ones and many other beauty spots on the eastern coastline within easy reach of San Juan an assemblage of broken bottles leftover food litter and worse is something you can t fail to notice Head through Lo za and on towards R o Grande Here Route 187 meets Route 3 one of the major arterial roads around Puerto Rico it s a very busy highway so be aware and drive carefully Take a left and proceed to Route 191 then turn right and head up toward El Yunque the Anvil the most famous mountain in Puerto Rico Normally capped with clouds it catches from the passing sea breezes and sometimes entirely lost in a blanket of gray storm clouds the 3 496 ft 1 088 m peak stands at the center of the Caribbean National Forest an area of virgin rain forest preserved since 1876 when the island was still a Spanish colony Originally a park of 12 300 acres 4 998 hectares it now covers 28 000 acres 11 330 hectares and is managed by the US Forestry Department The whole area is a place of staggering proportions there are over 200 species of native trees One specimen is said to be over 2 500 years old some trees are so wide it takes several people to reach around them others soar hundreds of feet into the air The forest gets over 180 inches 41 2 m of rain each year that s some 100 billion gallons 450 billion liters of water The animals that live here are also amazing This is one of the last habitats of the threatened Puerto Rican parrot The infamous coqu see page 47 is of course heard everywhere All in all the park in an impressive sight with slope after slope of vegetation laced with mountain streams and beautiful waterfalls and mountain peaks extend away into the distance Arriving via Route 191 you ll come right to the El Portal Tropical Forest Center at the entrance to the park This facility presents important information about the history of the park its plant and animal species and its role in the local ecology You can then travel on higher into the park toward the summit You can t drive the whole 8 miles 13 km between the visitors center and the end of the road but there are several car parks and rest areas on the way so there s ample access Two popular stops are La Coca Falls on the right after the 5 mile 8 km point and the Yokah Observation Tower at the 51 2 mile 9 km point Here you can photograph the surrounding slopes The most spectacular cascade in the park La Mina Falls is just a 30 minute walk from the roadside via Big Tree Trail Take a walk on any of the well marked trails the atmosphere is humid and the vegetation constantly damp your best friends will be your insect repellent and your stout shoes but the landscape is beautiful and fascinating El Yunque is included in many tours from San Juan these usually include a trip to Luquillo Beach which lies in the shadow of the peak to the north There is a popular balneario at Luquillo which has restrooms snack bars and a children s play area The beach is kept tidy and there is ample parking After Luquillo Route 3 curves around toward the east coast of the island and to the town of Fajardo which is a stepping stone to the offshore islands of Vieques and Culebra There is little to hold you in the town except for a finger of land reaching north out into the ocean Take Route 997 to explore this area On the way you ll pass a large marina with fleets of charter boats and the El Conquistador Resort and Country Club with its golf course marina and private offshore island At the very tip of the peninsula is Bahia la Cabezas and Las Cabezas de San Juan Nature Reserve one of the newest reserves on the island Acres of mangrove swamp cover the rocky outcrops sheltering sandy beaches and providing a haven for herons and pelicans You ll see hermit crabs scurrying across the ground hiding in their shells as you approach Faro de Fajardo Fajardo lighthouse stands amid all the greenery protecting ships from the shallows to the north and east Isla de Vieques and Culebra The islands of Vieques and Culebra off of Puerto Rico s east coast are a part of yet in many ways totally separate from the main island The small populations here live a slower more traditional life and the headlong rush to get there yesterday which you ll experience in some of the cities and towns of Puerto Rico doesn t seem to exist here at all Vieques pronounced be ay kase is the largest of the two though its name from the Amerindian means small island It s about 11 2 hours by ferry from the coast or a 30 minute flight from Isla Grande Airport in San Juan An island of wonderful sandy beaches and farmland it is also home to a large US military reserve Regular military flights may mar the tranquillity somewhat but they can t spoil the natural beauty Much of the land has been leased back to farmers and visitors can enjoy the wonderful beaches although you ll need some form of photo ID to gain access to them On the south coast you ll find Sun Bay and 3 miles 5 km of fine government run public beach which was used as the location for the film Lord of the Flies Nearby is Mosquito Bay an appropriate name since most of the island seems to have squadrons of the tiny winged beasts This is a phosphorescent bay and you can take a boat trip out into the water to agitate the microscopic organisms that give off the strange glow It s a fascinating experience The show is always better on a moonless night The capital of the island is Isabel Segunda named in honor of the 19th century Spanish Queen who was on the throne when work began on the fort in the 1840s Its shady plaza sees a constant stream of visitors but no one rushes There s little else to do but relax and this is the real appeal of Vieques Culebra much smaller at 21 sq miles 34 sq km is north of Vieques It is the largest rock in a collection of over twenty that attract sailors and divers from the main island Culebra was known as the Spanish Virgin Island until the American takeover it lies halfway between Puerto Rico and St Thomas in the US Virgin Islands Its only town is named Dewey after Admiral George Dewey a hero of the American Spanish War of 1898 The local people are more apt to call it Pueblo Culebra is full of natural beauty beaches Flamenco is the most celebrated clear waters full of marine life and land awash with flowers Most people come just to sit on the beach or walk in the fresh air Much of the island is now managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service to preserve the environment It makes an interesting day trip from Puerto Rico and a total contrast to hot days in the streets of Old San Juan The Southeast Traveling south from Fajardo you have the option of using Route 53 a new toll road or continuing on Route 3 Both roads lead past to the town of Humacao and on toward the south coast Just south of the Humacao is a left turn for Palmas del Mar a growing resort area on the southeast coastline A residential resort community built around wonderful stretches of beach the resort offers numerous activities including horseback riding fishing golf two courses and a casino East of the town of Yabucoa you ll find the start of the Ruta Panoramica If you don t have time to follow this entire trail at least drive along Route 3 south of Yabucoa to the area around the Cendro la Pandura peak The road climbs via a series of switchback turns and once at the top you ll have a clear view of the town lying in the flat plain below The lifestyle of the people who live high on the hillside is fascinating J baros country farmers carry machetes to the fields accompanied by their faithful hounds Chickens scoot under cars as you approach Around every turn you ll marvel at how the houses can be built on such precipitous slopes The road then leads along the southern coastal plain through several small towns to Playa de Ponce Ponce Puerto Rico s second city Ponce is as much steeped in history as Old San Juan Founded in 1692 it was named after a relative of Juan Ponce de Le n not the famous explorer himself Ponce is a thriving port city very modern in many ways but it lives up to its name of Pearl of the South At the very heart of the city is a jewel of an old town well preserved thanks to a massive and expensive restoration program begun in the 1980s Hundreds of careworn buildings were brought back to life and power cables were buried underground and out of sight Along with this physical transformation came a cultural change Ponce has become a focus for social events that celebrate Puerto Rican history and tradition several major festivals are held here throughout the year The focus of the city is Parque Degetau in Plaza Las Delicias Delight Square known by most locals as Plaza de Ponce Most of what you want to see is within a few minutes walk of this plaza and caf s and restaurants for refreshments are also near at hand You can spend a wonderful morning just soaking in the atmosphere The park with its shady trees cooling fountains and somber bronze statues including one of Luis Mu oz Mar n is where people come to take a break from the midday heat There s also a good ice cream shop on the east side of the square At the heart of the square is the Cathedral of our Lady of Guadalupe the city s main place of worship since the late 1600s Steady streams of visitors step inside to light a candle Behind the cathedral is perhaps the most famous building in the city the Parque de Bombas This small museum to the city s firefighters looks as though it were designed by a child and colored with crayons Ornate wooden domes sitting atop four turrets that are painted in the brightest red and black stripes and highlighted with brilliant yellow The structure was erected for a trade fair in 1882 and taken over by the bomba or firemen s organization The displays detail the bravery of individuals who fought fires in the once mostly wooden old town Casa Armstrong Poventud Armstrong Poventud House is the west side of the square Once the family home of a Scottish born banker and then later sold to the Poventud family it s now a cultural center that holds various exhibitions throughout the year The Alcald a city hall is also interesting Three American Presidents the two Roosevelts and Herbert Hoover delivered speeches from the balcony here Built in 1840 it served as the town jail until 1905 Radiating out from the main plaza are several roads each of which with its own treasures A number of the historic buildings have been converted to museums but many are still residential or commercial buildings in daily use Strolling along the streets you ll be able to admire the ornate Spanish colonial and neoclassical fa ades On Calle Isabel east of the square you ll find the Ponce History Museum The building was actually two family houses Casa Salazar and Casa Zapatar that were joined to make room for this fascinating collection of archive material The exhibits document the history of the town since its founding Photographs bring to life the changes in lifestyle over the centuries The comprehensive information plaques are in Spanish only but there are guided tours in English every hour Behind the museum on Calle Cristina is the La Perla Theater This was one of the first neoclassical structures to be built in the city in 1864 Destroyed by an earthquake in the 1910s it was rebuilt in 1940 and thoroughly restored as part of the major renovations of the late 1980s It is once again at the center of the cultural activity for which Ponce is famed Another noteworthy museum on Calle Isabel is in Casa Serrall s the Museum of Puerto Rican Music traces the complicated development of the island s distinctive musical legacy from Amerindian influences to the blending of Spanish colonial musical styles One of the homes that has only recently opened its doors to visitors is Casa Wiechers Villaronga on Calle Reina Designed in 1911 by Alfredo Wiechers for the Villaronga Mercado family it is full of elegant Art Deco features Ponce is a lively town and street vendors can be found on every corner The town market at Calle Atocha one block from the main square operates as it has done for generations Here you ll find fresh vegetables and fruit galore Ponce also has some surprises outside the historic quarter On El Vig a Hill above the town to the north are two interesting attractions One is a 100 ft 301 2 m high cross that overlooks the city Known locally as Cruz del Vig a it was built in 1984 this concrete cross replaced a wooden one from the last century There is an observation area at the point at which the arms spread from here you can get a panoramic view over Ponce and out toward the coast Set just below Cruz del Vig a one of the finest houses in Ponce Castillo Serrall s Serrall s Castle is not a castle but actually a spectacular family home built in the 1930s for the Serrall s family owners of the Don Q rum company With its red tiled roof and pastel pink exterior the structure is a lovely example of the Spanish Revival style It is full of beautiful furniture owned by various family members The gardens have been designed in formal French style with lots of carefully trimmed box hedges and expansive lawns from here you can look down on Ponce town Since 1986 the house has been owned by the Ponce Municipal Government which now operates it as a museum and meeting center South of the historic town center on Avenue of the Americas a modern two lane highway is the Museo de Arte de Ponce Ponce Art Museum This collection of European and Puerto Rican art probably the finest in the Caribbean would be very much at home in any European capital The museum is the brainchild of Luis Ferr industrialist and onetime governor of Puerto Rico who has put great effort into bringing works of art to the town More than 1 600 paintings and sculptures make up the collection which covers five centuries of western art The Flemish collection features work by Paul Bril 1554 1626 and David Teniers 1610 1690 The Spanish collection has a piece by El Greco 1541 1614 Nicholas Maes 1632 1693 is represented in the Dutch collection and British artists include Joshua Reynolds 1723 1792 Thomas Gainsborough 1727 1788 and George Romney 1734 1802 Pride of place is taken by the painting Flaming June by Frederick Lord Leighton 1830 1896 The gallery offers a guided tour in English every afternoon at 2pm The city of Ponce actually sits some 3 miles 5 km inland but the local residents take every opportunity to go to the coast The city beach is kept passably tidy by litter patrols One spot where you re bound to meet the locals is La Guancha a boardwalk area between the beach Ponce Marina and the commercial docks It s a great place for strolling and gazing out over the water There s a tower to climb if you want a bird s eye view Numerous kiosks sell cold beer and Puerto Rican snacks The area s always buzzing at weekends While at La Guancha you may see groups of people across the narrow bay staring down into the water More likely than not they re trying to catch sight of the giant tarpon that have taken to swimming around in the shallows Hundreds of these fish some are up to 7 ft 2 m long congregate here because they ve learned they ll be well supplied with tasty tidbits offered by the humans on shore North of Ponce are attractions of a different kind Take Route 503 out of town this road runs along the banks of the R o Portugu z and after about a mile and a half 2 km you ll arrive at the Tibes Indian Ceremonial Park one of the most important Amerindian archaeological sites in the Caribbean The ceremonial site and cemetery are across the river and you may not enter without a guide A small museum explains the known history of the Amerindian races it has a number of cabinets holding artifacts as well as a skeleton still in the traditional fetal burial position Once you re into the park the ceremonial grounds come into view Open spaces discovered since the 1960s are now believed to be used for ball games which had an important though as yet only poorly understood ceremonial purpose in Indian culture High in the hills behind Ponce is Hacienda Buena Vista To get there take Route 10 a major north south artery The road climbs steeply into dense vegetation and cooler air before you see signs for the hacienda the climate and environmental conditions here were ideal for the coffee that the plantation began to grow more than 150 years ago The plantation fell into neglect in the 20th century but since 1984 it has been returned to its original state by The Conservation Trust of Puerto Rico Agricultural machinery such as coffee bean huskers can be seen in the original buildings and the water mill and canals which harnessed the power of the Canas River are now in working order The facility shows how plantations used to operate and offer a fascinating insight into agricultural life in Puerto Rico all those years ago Advance reservations are required for the tours see page 64 The Southwest West of Ponce there are a number of bosques estatales state forests and acres of farmland with grazing cattle and commercial stables Rainfall is much lighter here than in the east and the forests are more temperate than tropical Bosque Estatal de Gu nica Gu nica State Forest on the south coast thirty minutes from Ponce is one of the largest tracts of tropical dry forest in the world The fascinating rocky landscape is home to thousands of cacti and other desert plants over 700 species all together Named a World Biosphere Reserve the area includes several sandy beaches To see the park at its best though take the inland route Route 334 rather than the coast road There is too much evidence of human activity on the beaches the litter and burned out cars spoil some of the beautiful views Further east along Route 116 you ll reach La Parguera a small town on the south coast surrounded by thousands of acres of mangroves A pretty town with a seaside atmosphere it is a popular vacation spot for city dwelling Puerto Ricans One of the most enticing activities in La Parguera is exploring the mangroves some of the tunnels are hundreds of yards deep and the small offshore islands where you can picnic swim and snorkel all day The waters offshore are full of sea life and wonderfully clear Rental boats are available Just east of La Parguera is Phosphorescent Bay known for its glowing water filled with micro organisms Over the years many residents have built houseboats on the margins of the mangrove and this has caused problems for the sensitive environment of the bay The situation is said to be improving now as new environmental controls are being put into place Heading west beyond La Parguera you ll need to use secondary roads but these are in surprisingly good condition and relatively quiet It s almost a pampas landscape here with grassy slopes and horses galore Boquer n a small village on the west coast has arguably the most beautiful balneario public beach on Puerto Rico a long arc of fine sand backed by sea grapes and palm trees The settlement is growing due to its popularity and a new marina is taking shape but it still retains the feel of its origins as a fishing village When the catches arrive small temporary stalls are set up around the tiny town square You can buy fresh clams and oysters which can be shucked for you to eat as you go There are a few small hotels here which soon fill up on weekends and holidays but if you arrive midweek or out of season you may find that you are the only visitors South of Boquer n you leave the world behind Make your way along Route 301 towards Cabo Rojo and the lighthouse at the southwest tip of the island to really enjoy natural Puerto Rico Fishing is the main way people make a living here between mangrove outcrops are many small shacks with boats tied up to rickety wooden jetties The salt flats that you see are still harvested commercially Eventually the tarmac stops and the road changes to a simple dirt track The surface is reasonable so don t worry about continuing on You ll travel over a narrow bridge and enter a section of the Bosque Estatal de Boquer n Leave you car below the lighthouse and walk up the hill to reach it a five minute walk for the reasonably fit Turn around as you climb the hill and a wonderful sandy bay will open out in front of you Pelicans play and feed and frigate birds wheel in the sky above The Faro de Cabo Rojo Cabo Rojo Lighthouse has been sadly neglected but the light still plays an important part in protecting shipping off the island It sits atop some of the highest cliffs on Puerto Rico a truly spectacular sight But beware of going too close to the edge as there are no fences here Inland from La Parguera and Boquer n is pretty San Germ n once also set on the coast but moved inland after the original site was sacked several times Built on an undulating hillside the town is the epitome of the Spanish colonial style Its two town squares have not yet been spoiled by neon fast food signs There s much of architectural interest around the pretty promenades and grand houses Over 200 named buildings are under protection but unfortunately as yet there is no tourist information office in the town and many of the buildings are neither identified nor open to the public Just enjoy the beautiful views and stroll along the streets to take in all the detail The major building of importance here is the Iglesia Porta Coeli Church of the Gate of Heaven a tiny terra cotta chapel and convent founded in 1606 It sits in the lower of two squares in the town The heart of one of the most important religious communities on the island in its early years it was later used as a schoolhouse and poorhouse before being handed over to the government in 1949 After renovations in 1960 it was opened to the public The new complex includes the Museo de Arte Religioso Museum of Religious Art which features a collection of Puerto Rican santos carved religious figures and icons North of Boquer n is the city of Mayag ez the major urban center of the west coast and the end of the Ruta Panoramica The old city was destroyed in an earthquake in 1918 as a result Mayag ez is less interesting in terms of architecture than other settlements It is however a popular base from which to explore the west coast there are frequent direct flights between Mayag ez and San Juan A number of large international hotels offer a good standard of accommodation and facilities such as golf and casinos The University of Puerto Rico s campus at Mayag ez has an internationally recognized Tropical Agriculture Research Center which among other activities cultivates several hundred tropical species The center is open to the public but since it has no refreshment facilities or play areas for children it s for dedicated gardeners only Fifty miles 80 km off the coast is Mona Island called the Galapagos of Puerto Rico This isolated place characterized by a coastline of high cliffs is home to turtles iguanas and endangered pelicans There is no human settlement today but there is evidence that Ta no Indians once lived here Columbus is also said to have landed as did Ponce de Le n Camping trips of the commune with nature variety can be arranged from Mayag ez The Northwest The northwest of Puerto Rico is the surfing capital of the Antilles with great waves rising offshore Inland is some of the most beautiful and undeveloped karst landscape anywhere The region produces most of the Puerto Rican coffee crop once the only coffee drunk in the Vatican Once north of Mayag ez head west on Route 115 to Rinc n This small town and low key resort is the surfing center for all the beaches along the coast North from town is Punta Higuaro one of the most popular beaches and the Faro de Rinc n Rinc n Lighthouse This warning tower which is surrounded by a neat park area with a caf and gift shop makes an ideal platform for whale watching Groups of the leviathans pass here on their migrations Telescopes allow you to scan the horizon for their watery exhalations Farther north along the coast just south of the small town of Aguada is a monument commemorating the landing of Crist bal Col n on the island in 1493 Though no one is really sure of the precise landing site Columbus is renowned for having been less than accurate in documenting his landing sites the small park with its column and na ve paintings depicting Spanish colonization serves its purpose well North of the town of Aguadilla traveling out toward the airport and Rafael Hernandez air force base are a series of fine bathing and surfing beaches The most famous is Crash Boat Beach named after a shipwreck that happened just offshore The beach is always busy but the most exciting stretch is the northern section where the fishing boats rest Most hours of the morning there are ships coming ashore with their meager but extremely fresh catch The boats are brightly colored and carefully tended to ensure that they are always in peak condition not one is splintered or sun bleached Traveling back along the northern coast there is little to draw the eye Inland however it s a different story South of the busy town of Arecibo are a number of attractions that would make a fine day trip from San Juan none is more than a 90 minute drive from the capital Route 129 from Arecibo leads to one of the most important and mysterious scientific instruments in the world Arecibo Observatory has the largest single dish radio telescope in the world 1 000 ft 305 m in diameter it has been silently scanning the universe making maps of distant solar systems and listening for messages from other planets since 1960 The Observatory is part of Cornell University s National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center it operates 24 hours a day The center likes to emphasize the serious scientific work it undertakes such as detecting extremely weak radio pulses from the very corners of the known universe which take 100 million years to reach the earth Some visitors are more impressed by the fact that the observatory was used for location shots in the James Bond film Goldeneye and more recently in Contact starring Jodie Foster A viewing platform allows you to look down on the massive dish and in the education center opened in 1997 visitors can undertake simple and safe experiments to learn more about physics and the solar system The Observatory sits in the heart of karst country a region of archetypal limestone erosion Wave upon wave of small smooth hillocks known as haystacks cover the land and the roads bend and weave around these forested mounds and through small villages nestled in the valleys The name karst is taken from a region of Yugoslavia that has these same geographical characteristics One striking feature of all karst landscapes is that the erosion of the limestone layers by rainwater creates cave systems where weaker rock is worn away from under stronger rock that remains intact Puerto Rico has one of the most dramatic cave systems yet discovered in an area known as Parque de las Cavernas del R o Camuy R o Camuy Cave Park a little way south of the Observatory just off Route 129 Tourist trains carry passengers between the caves and sinkholes deep vertical shafts created when cave roofs collapse that make up the park A long video Spanish only shows what to expect before you set out The giant Cueva Clara Clara Cave is reached by descending into a sinkhole once in its depths a narrow entrance leads to a cavern of cathedral like dimensions it is said the largest section of the cave could hold the El Morro fort The caves and sinkholes have taken millions of years to erode many of the stalagmites and stalactites have been hundreds of thousands of years in formation An underground river the R o Camuy is responsible for much of the work It still flows today enlarging its path through the rock The whole cave park is a truly awesome sight with holes 300 ft 91 m deep and 200 ft 61 m across and caves thousands of feet deep all surrounded by pristine forest Some say that the fountain of youth is here in the clean water filtering through the limestone from the surface You don t have to believe the legends but taste the water anyway it s very sweet and it can t hurt to wish just a little From the caves it s a short drive to Lares the island s center of coffee production The sweet brew made from Puerto Rican beans is considered one of the finest in the world though production is small Coffee plants usually interspersed with other crops such as bananas or plantains can be seen growing on the high hillsides it is a crop that enjoys good drainage and lots of humidity which the large banana leaves help to conserve From Lares take Route 111 to reach the most important Amerindian site on Puerto Rico the Parque Ceremonial Ind gena Caguana Caguana Indian Ceremonial Park The park is set in a wide valley surrounded by limestone peaks one of which is said to represent the supreme god of the Ta nos The several ceremonial ball courts discovered and excavated here suggest the site was one of the Indians major centers of worship The Ta nos were still living happily on the island when Columbus arrived in 1493 archaeological finds here date back to 1200 b c The ball courts edged with stones some with symbols carved on them are set in fine gardens planted with many native tree species A small museum displays pottery and other artifacts found at the site From Arecibo on the coast it s an hour along the fast Route 22 toll road to San Juan Many of the villages and towns along the way are small industrial outposts for the suburbs of Cata o Just before reaching the city however is a resort that is developing into an important provider of visitor accommodations Dorado has several large resort hotels all of which occupy private grounds near the pretty sandy beaches These are self contained hotels with facilities such as golf courses and night time entertainment There is however little tourist infrastructure in the immediate vicinity The town of Dorado with restaurants and shops is 21 2 miles 4 km from the nearest hotel along the strip The Dorado resort area began life as a large plantation owned by the Livingston family the first hotel built here the Hyatt Dorado Beach Hotel incorporated the old plantation house into its original design Excursion to St Thomas The shopping mecca of the Caribbean St Thomas is the most densely populated of the three US Virgin Islands the others are St John and St Croix Easily reached from San Juan just a 40 minute flight from Mu oz Mar n International Airport St Thomas has become a must visit island for many people It s a duty free haven where luxury goods can be 40 cheaper than at home This is particularly advantageous to US citizens who can claim an allowance of 1 200 per person regardless of age Many Puerto Ricans hop across for the day to take advantage of the bargains During the flight over from San Juan you ll be able to get a bird s eye view of most of the neighboring US and British Virgin Islands Charlotte Amalie The capital of St Thomas Charlotte Amalie pronounced amahlia sits on one of the finest natural harbors in the world Named by Danish settlers after the wife of King Christian V the settlement started out as a trading port a tradition that continues with great success today The downtown area resting between the surrounding hills and the harbor is a warren of old streets and red roofs best seen from above One lasting legacy of the Danish colonization is the street names Warehouses built along the harbor by 17th and 18th century Danish merchants still play host to hundreds of traders But now instead of stocking such staples as cotton flour or salt the stores are filled with the modern version of pirate booty gold gems watches and designer goods The main shopping streets lie close to the waterfront A series of narrow alleys are filled with craft clothing and jewelry shops along with caf s and restaurants that provide welcome relief once you ve become shopped out But Charlotte Amalie is not just a shopper s paradise There are historic gems to be discovered here as well Perhaps the most prominent is Fort Christian which sits to the east of downtown Work on the fort began in 1671 to protect the harbor The terra cotta walls pretty painted shutters and crenellated clock tower give the building a cozy rather than a fearsome look The interior has been transformed into a museum of life in the US Virgin Islands colonial furniture archive documents and old photographs of the islands people and towns Take a walk onto the walls of the fort for a wonderful view over the seafront and the colorful Vendors Plaza a craft market under bright parasols that has a permanent home in the fort s shadow Next to the fort is the pretty Legislature building with a classical fa ade painted bright lime green Finished in 1874 the building was originally used as a barracks for troops based at the fort Behind the fort and the Vendors Plaza is Emancipation Park perhaps the one place in town where you can sit in the shade of the trees and enjoy the cooling sea breeze after your sightseeing and shopping The park was named to commemorate the freeing of the slaves in 1848 Across Tolbod Gade is the Tourist Information Office where you can pick up maps and other information On the northern corner of Tolbod Gade is the main post office Make your way in that direction but don t be tempted to turn right and head for the stores just yet Take the steps to Kongens Gade which is the street behind the Lutheran Church The steps climb onto the steep hill that has many of the oldest and most important buildings of Danish Charlotte Amalie The family houses of the merchants and civil servants where built high on this rise named Government Hill to take advantage of the cooling breeze Kongens Gade itself has several buildings dating back to the late 18th and early 19th centuries Hotel 1829 named for the year in which it was built sits amid other fine homes Walk past Hotel 1829 and pause at the steps beside it which climb higher onto Government Hill These are the 99 Steps one of a series built by the Danes in the mid 1700s to allow pedestrian access to the town below The 99 Steps are the longest in town but whoever named the flight must have become tired toward the end and miscounted there are in fact 103 Before climbing the steps make a small detour farther along Kongens Gade past the Lutheran Parsonage 1725 to reach Government House an archetypal colonial mansion Now the office for the Governor of the USVIs this 1867 structure was originally used for meetings of the Danish Colonial Council it was totally renovated in 1974 Nearby is Seven Arches House Museum once the home of a Danish master craftsman The house has a welcoming arms staircase fashionable in the 18th century leading to the entrance Renovated and filled with period furniture walking through it is a step back in time Retrace your route to the 99 Steps and climb to the summit of Government Hill At the top just when you may feel in need of a rest you ll find Haagensen House another renovated period property Its original owner Hans Haagensen was a Danish banker Those who don t want to climb the steps can take a shuttle to Haagensen House from the Pampered Pirate gift shop on Norre Gade The remains of Blackbeard s Castle said to be the home of the famous pirate whose real name was Edward Teach can also be seen here Perhaps one of the most beautiful and unusual buildings in Charlotte Amalie is the St Thomas Synagogue on Crystal Gade This is the oldest synagogue building in continual use under the American flag The Jewish congregation has always been strong here from the very earliest days of Danish settlement in 1655 When the all consuming fire of 1831 broke out 64 families were worshipping in the small synagogue Only one scroll could be saved before the flames destroyed the building The present structure was built on the same spot and opened in 1833 The synagogue has sand on the floor symbolic of the Jewish flight from Egypt The cruise port is situated at the West Indian Company Dock a mile or so east of town The thirty minute walk around the harbor is pleasant if the traffic is not too busy Those who want to ride will find numerous taxis waiting to take them to and from Charlotte Amalie The dock is one of the largest and busiest in the Caribbean Old Danish warehouses along the dockside have been transformed in recent years creating Havensight Shopping Mall Over 80 tax free boutiques with caf s and restaurants sit only feet away from the huge ships You will also find the ticket office for Atlantis Submarine in the Havensight Mall This mini submarine which seats around thirty takes you some 60 ft 18 m under the sea to view coral reefs and the marine life that inhabits them A ferry takes you out to Buck Island some 3 miles 5 km offshore to rendezvous with the sub which then submerges to spend about an hour exploring the reef around the island Shoals of yellow tailed snapper surround the machine along with sharks rays and turtles It is great fun for young and old alike and a safe way to see the underwater world Beside the cruise port is Flag Hill rising 700 ft 214 m above sea level From here you can enjoy the panoramic views over Charlotte Amalie the surrounding hills and the harbor Paradise Point Tramway has been built to carry passengers to a platform which is ideal for photographers The seven minute journey to the top gives a clear view of Havensight and the cruise port and there are is a caf bar in case you want to stop for refreshment Around the Island Like most of the Virgin Islands St Thomas is full of hills The roads twist and turn around sharp bends and roll up and over undulations To see the main attractions of St Thomas it s best to head directly north up into the hills you ll be able to enjoy the beautiful views back towards Charlotte Amalie along the way Drake s Seat thought to mark the spot where Francis Drake sat and watched ships moving to and from San Juan offers breathtaking views of the northern coastline and Magens Bay the site of what is probably the best beach on St Thomas and one of the most famous in the Caribbean Estate St Peter Greathouse and Botanical Gardens takes up 11 acres 41 2 hectares along the ridge top near the summit of St Peter peak The estate was established in the 1800s and was owned in the 1930s by Virgin Islands Governor Lawrence Cramer Both the house and the gardens were totally destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 Today they are back to their beautiful best and the house has been restored to combine history with modern amenities The observation deck around the house is the perfect perch from which to admire the view If you re feeling more energetic follow the nature trail through the garden At nearby Mountain Top 1 547 ft 472 m above the bay and higher than Drake s Seat you ll find a sophisticated shopping mall and large bar area with almost non stop daiquiris they claim to have invented the banana daiquiri here Everyone comes with a camera so you may have to wait a while to get a shot of the view Magens Bay is a beautiful stretch of sand with a slight kink in the center which gives it the epithet heart shaped Because it is so sheltered it s a safe place for children to swim and for everyone to snorkel though it can get very busy In the rolling hillside behind the beach is Mahogany Run Golf Course so you could have a round in the morning and swim and snorkel in the afternoon On the eastern end of the island amid a number of large hotel complexes is Coki Point a pleasant beach At the end of the point is Coral World which offers a fascinating look at life under the water The attraction centers around a number of different controlled marine environments each with its own animals or fish Watch out for the sting ray shark and turtle pools where regular feeding times are posted you ll even get a chance to pet some of the exhibits Pride of place at Coral World must go to the genuine coral reef which has been implanted in the open water offshore An underground viewing area reached via a walkway allows you to observe the daily activity of the reef fish and some of the larger wild creatures who swim in for the free food provided by Coral World staff Coki Beach is popular spot for snorkelers simply because there is so much sea life here thanks to the regular feedings provided by Coral World around their reef Many of the cruise ships bus their passengers in here for snorkeling so it can get busy but you are almost always guaranteed a good show of marine life
