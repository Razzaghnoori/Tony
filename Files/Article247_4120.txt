 Mind Their Manners Margo Forbes could have used the toothpaste several decades ago Though I am confident a good plastic surgeon could help now Insert jokes about personality surgeons here Looks I m more interested in manners And it s here that you dear Prudie could provide some real insight into the campaign Which of the candidates has the best manners And does it matter We are after all obsessed with authenticity this year the real person At least that s what the pundits and the newsmagazines blare But it s the fake stuff that interests me more and here I am talking about such things as etiquette and decency I want a president who is true to other people more than he is true to himself I ll let you weigh in first on this one because of your expertise on the subject As far as Bush malapropisms go or as Jacob Weisberg calls them Bushisms I have a dandy from an interview that I had with the good governor of the second largest state which if it were a nation would be the 11 th largest economy in the world I asked him about the efforts of Southern Baptists to convert Jews and he responded I mean that s the Southern Baptists But I don t think that this is a government function And on that note where my questions to presidential contenders really do make me look like an obsessive on the subject of Yidden I leave it to you I ll try to file my next entry from the debate Catching rays for you Frank
