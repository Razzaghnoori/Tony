 well what s uh what s the best experience you can come up with uh as far as camping oh gee the first one that comes to my mind is uh camping outside the river at the uh at New Braunfels there oh man that sounds like a blast yeah we ve gone down there many a year is that right camping riding the river rapids yeah that that s where you just float down the river right yeah well they have some you know half way decent rapids there on tubes an i see it s not Deliverance but it s pretty good well that sounds pretty neat i guess i guess for me um um probably the last time i went camping was uh back in high school with Boy Scouts we always took an annual trip up to uh Colorado and went fly fishing oh really and uh we had we had a blast up there yeah i never tried that it it was nice going up there and see that scenery well i uh we ve done quite a bit of camping we uh used to uh throw everything in we had some old Volkswagen buses in our years early days when we had kids and they uh we d uh you know go uh drive up into the hill country around uh oh New Braunfels and i see San Marcus around in through there right Austin up around Austin area i see just camp out did they have some pretty good campsites up there yeah uh usually we d go uh like the state parks a lot of the state parks up in through there i see there s quite a few of them up there uh We started off pretty rough you know pretty much roughing it and we had like i say the Volkswagen bus we d pull up and just i had fixed up the thing where you could just open up the doors i d hooked on a little extension and made a tarp for the side and and and uh then we were set up in about five minutes ten minutes that was a regular party machine huh out by the side of the river yeah then we uh later on we started using a tent when we d go to uh you know tent camping i see that sounds pretty neat we enjoyed it uh we had three kids and uh they ve done a lot of camping with us and right they just seemed to like it yeah i remember uh going with my parents uh we weren t very good campers it seemed like we were never prepared and uh we i grew up right around Amarillo up in the very northern part of Texas um hum and uh we had a couple of lakes out there that we d go and and go fishing and then camp out and uh seemed like it always rain or something you know something had to go wrong and uh we were never prepared for it ha so uh it wasn t it wasn t until Boy Scouts that i really started enjoying uh going out and camping pretty uh pretty rough up around Amarillo isn t it it sure is uh in fact we went up there for Easter and and we we had uh a beautiful day we had a day where it snowed and then uh it rained the next day and you know you just never can tell what the weather s going to do that s my uh one of my wife s favorite stories to tell about Easter camping trips it the coldest Easter ever we left here uh we left here it was shorts weather in uh on Easter and right we went up and were going to spend on the Blanco River and we got there and a front come through and it was it was freezing oh Lord we didn t of course weren t prepared for it so right oh and there s nothing worse when you re out camping if you get wet you know it we sat there my brother in law cooked chicken bless and he was don t know how in heck he managed to do it but he did he stood out there and cooked that and we had something hot to eat that s hilarious we got up the next morning and she said i don t know about you but she said i m going into town and we re going to buy some long johns i m surprised you didn t just pack up and go home i tell so i was ready i was ready to go back to Houston that s right that s right oh Lord i guess everybody s got those experiences when uh when things just didn t didn t go right for them yeah that s uh sometimes turns into fun i think another similar one was when we d go uh up to Bastrop Strate State Park there in uh kind of got caught by the cold weather and we uh gathered what firewood we could and built us a campfire you know and sat around there right into the wee hours and uh ran out of firewood so we uh each took turns going out and gathering up big bundles of pine needles and throwing them on the fire and they didn t last very long but they burned hot oh Lord oh Lord i remember that that was a lot of fun that is funny but we uh most recently we still go camping every well not as much anymore we our kids are pretty near grown and uh really i uh we had uh we ve used a tent you know pop up trailer right we ve done some camping in that we still go down to the river at least try to get down there once a year i see Braunfels do they have uh actual camp sites there where you can go and yeah uh huh i see they re some they re some they re some what you d call primitive i mean there are no uh real facilities and then others that have uh facilities or yeah there s a few that have hot and cold uh you know electricity and and hot water and so forth there s a few of those and you have to make your reservations pretty well in advance oh you do have to make reservations there yeah because it s you know it is so nice and there limited space so uh huh right we usually if we re going we usually try and make them by March or so anyway oh i see huh i didn t realize that so it s uh yeah it s uh pretty nice since it s so popular it s best to to have the reservations huh well if you want to get a good camp site yeah you can go down and get a camp site pretty near any weekend they get prett y crowded on the uh you know the main July Fourth of July and right right Memorial Day and whatever yeah and Labor Day yeah that water can get pretty cold though if you go too early oh is that right yeah when s the best time to go down there for the water we try not to go before uh July because uh it takes uh it takes that long to get it heat up gets warmed up yeah it comes out of the Canyon Lake up there and it s uh comes out of that deep lake and it s pretty cold water you know i see huh because my wife and i had thought about going down there uh you know just for a weekend um hum because we have some friends from uh that went to school in San Marcus at South Texas yeah and uh they re always talking about how they rode the uh those inner tubes down the river and that sounded like a fun that d be a fun weekend well in addition to to the river what we call it s the Guadalupe River it s uh has campsites all along the river uh but then there s also Camp Warnicke where you can get cabins you know it s right on the River hum downtown New Braunfels i see and then they have the uh what they call the shoot which is uh it s a bypass around the dam where they have uh the comes right through the downtown part of New Braunfels huh that s a lot of fun yeah so you can actually rent cabins there yeah um hum at uh Camp Warnicke and that s in that s in New Braunfels property right in yeah right in uh almost right in downtown huh and uh that s a lot of fun then they have a uh there s a commercial water park they re called the Schlitterbahn which is a barrel of fun i see especially if you ve got kids yeah yeah they have tube ride tube shoots and just and so many rides you can t almost can t do them all in a day you know God that sounds like a blast yeah it s uh it s a uh all day event well that sounds like that might be a fun fun place to visit then yeah we ll have to give that a shot well i tell you what i guess uh i need to head out but i i appreciate the the conversation yeah well i m uh you have a good you have a good week
