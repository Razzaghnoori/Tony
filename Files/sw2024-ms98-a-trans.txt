 okay wonderful touch tone telephone there uh what kind of books do you enjoy reading uh having have uh i have a wide variety of of hobbies therefore my my reading pleasures are quite wide um i get a charge out of uh Texas highway uh which uh is very colorful and uh not being a native of Texas uh but being here eleven years have a tendency to uh find out the uh oh about the different areas of of the kind of the state by reading it right i ve read that one too i only had a subscription once but my mother always gave me hers and i i really enjoyed you know all the little things that you find out about Texas oh yeah it s it s uh absolutely it s great the way that it s broken out and you can uh set up little trips and day trips and things it s pretty pretty neat um oh i like photography um magazines i don t take a subscription or anything like that um things oh being an engineer in facilities i do read a lot of a lot of uh building magazines and and and plant engineering magazines and read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines and uh huh and uh kind of strange because i it s not unusual to uh see um an engineering manual or something laying around the house and then i ll sit up and read just to refresh uh you know to keep active on it but uh how about yourself uh huh well um i have an interest in art so i frequently purchase and read um books mainly on water color because that s my big interest at the moment um hum oh that s great and um oh i guess i like a variety of things um lots of fiction uh type books um right now i m occasionally reading on a book about uh the Mardi Gras in New Orleans and it s history that s fairly interesting um hum i bet that would be rather interesting uh that s uh self improvement that s that s always well that s that s kind of a hobby but it is self improvement uh from the standpoint of probably relaxing um yeah i i don t know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement how about you um well i hate to yes i do we um we have these classes we attend uh management classes then and they give you books and and the last book uh matter of fact i read was At America s Service by Carl Albridge it talks about um who the customer is and being customer oriented uh which falls in line with the TI culture here at Texas Instruments yeah um one of it s great slogans is if you re not serving the customer you better be serving someone who is uh huh uh so that s all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is and as you probably well know all of us are our own customer your my customer i m your customer sort of thing um right every now and then i m loaned the tape i can stick in the in the car cassette on the way home to make the drive more enjoyable talking about uh better outlooks on things and the philosophy of of Pat Haggerty and these kind of uh mind stimulating philosophy type yeah actually which all you know betters yourself yeah yeah well i guess maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don t think of in terms of self improvement um hum i mean they are but i don t label it as such like what for example well i don t know um i uh have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them but uh i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things but um they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself you know getting getting your yourself in gear to um hum uh sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really wanna do convincing you that you need to get on with it sure sure how about items like um The One Minute Manager which used to be a big okay so those are self improvements um yes sure our supervisor uh suddenly bought all of us a book called What Every Supervisor Should Know um by a main man named uh Doctor Bittel B I T T E L and it s a very layman s uh uh approach towards managing different types of people and the very last chapter and i haven t figured out why that one was last is how to manage engineers so it s it s very it s interesting here again it s it s casual reading and it s not eaten up with a lot of uh technical stuff and it s really uh excellent fast reading and uh but as you say it s it s sometimes it s difficult to to know if it s you know i think if somebody wants to say okay read these ten books because these are self improvements i would probably be turned off to them yeah yeah he casually just walked into it and uh put down a Stephen King book and uh picked up one of them it might be a little more interesting i don t know i i m not sure i could take too much of Stephen King that s a little little little heavy for me yeah they re uh quite uh they re hard to set down because it s so interesting and course they re always a little spookier than the movies but uh yeah it s always they re always challenging to get through one of them i have a hard time finishing books well i guess i also have been reading uh a lot of things on uh quality improvement and that type of thing because that s what i m involved in a lot at work um hum in quality especially nowadays uh that s almost everything that comes across the the the the the airways of the oh yeah you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other but i think sometimes the word is a little over used but exactly exactly right yeah we we have i think we we name drop it a little too much and and don t fully understand what what what it is we re saying i think it s it s focusing in on the issue and walking your talk and and all that kind of rolls in together there but uh yeah yeah yeah that s kind of part of it okay well any other comments uh not that i can think of um i think i m under my quota a little bit i need it if i if i make a phone call or two well we just started right ah this is true i ve enjoyed it well you too and uh have good bye have a good day bye bye good bye
