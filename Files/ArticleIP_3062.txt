 The Right To Be a Boor With the Paula Jones case and the sexual harassment debate wearing thin a new crisis looms on the employment horizon demanding our urgent attention According to a recent called Diversity in the Power Elite Have Women and Minorities Reached the Top highly placed corporate white men are fretting over the slow but steady rise of women blacks and Latinos to elite positions in the workplace Are they worried that these new arrivals will take away their jobs No According to the study what they fear is that women and minorities won t be good at playing golf OK accusing a man of golf anxiety isn t quite the same as alleging that he lowered his pants in front of a subordinate and requested service But far from making a trivial point the diversity study shows that the prosecutorial way we think about gender in the workplace may not always be helpful During the past few months Kenneth Starr s limitless pursuit of Clinton has caused sensible people to wonder if we ve let the battle against sexual harassment turn into a witch hunt I agree that courts aren t equipped to resolve many issues of gender on the job not because the results are unjust but because they re unsubtle How could the courts possibly deal with golf anxiety Surely a person has every right to converse with colleagues who play golf Surely he also has a right to assume that a new employee doesn t play golf Likewise he s entitled to appear shy or unfriendly around her and perhaps unintentionally hamper her ability to network inside the company and even then assume she lacks initiative and give her a mediocre job evaluation But such obtuse behavior even if legal causes suffering and it s worth talking about away from the blunt guilty or innocent logic of the law Arriving as it does on the tail end of the Paula Jones disaster Frances K Conley s memoir of sexism at Stanford may encounter a kind of sexual conflict fatigue and miss the attention it deserves It s a treasure trove of messy not always courtworthy gender job dilemmas that nevertheless need to be explored Conley the first tenured woman professor of neurosurgery in the country tells how she left Stanford University School of Medicine back in 1991 after 25 years of contented teaching and research Traditionally of course neurosurgery has been the elite macho pinnacle of medicine its Navy SEALs So at first glance when you consider how steely Conley had to be to rise in the field the event that provoked her to leave sounds pretty innocuous A colleague named Gerry Silverberg got promoted to be head of the program Conley who d worked with Gerry since they were in medical school thought he was a jerk Sounds so far like a depressing but routine power contest Where did sex come in Stirred by her anger Conley eventually began to face facts about Gerry that she had suppressed over two decades in order to concentrate on work She recalled how in years past during training he made a juvenile habit of propositioning her in front of other male students really propositioning her thrusting his pelvis in her face and saying how much she d like it In recent years he d interrupted her during complex brain surgery and shouted laughing How s it going hon All in all Gerry was a charmer Conley had to admit that while Gerry had no rivals as a pig he was hardly alone in his insensitivity When she was a med student all but a couple of generous male advisers had told her paternalistically to give up her neurosurgery dreams and stick with a nice female discipline like obstetrics One day she finally got the courage to knock on the door of the department chair and ask if she could join the program He answered the door with his pants string undone and a glance at the couch indicated he d been screwing his secretary As a young faculty member she attended weekly lunches because that s where the networking action was They were gross childish stag affairs In plain sight of everyone one colleague would caress her thigh daring her to make him stop and inviting all the men in the room to giggle Then the urologists at the table would speculate about who among their colleagues could get it up One may ask why Conley put up with this for so long It s a fair question Until the spring of 1991 she says she d basically identified with men Wrapped and totally immersed within the competitive cocoon of academic medicine living every day at a great distance from the real world I was all but oblivious to the fact that a woman s movement had started and selfishly had no idea how other women in my own world were faring Conley s writing voice even has something of a macho swagger and once in a while it hits a false note as if she were building her broad case against the medical profession in order to get back at Gerry the vulgar meanie At times too the cool expertise vs righteousness wit vs no sense of humor become almost too vivid as if she weren t a real life polemicist so much as an intriguing fictional character But here s where the case gets really fascinating Conley says she never intended to take legal action She just felt Gerry would make an intolerable leader and when he got promoted she impulsively resigned Then she naively sent a rambling op ed piece to the San Francisco Chronicle outlining in general terms naming no names the sexist atmosphere at Stanford The piece wasn t published right away Instead a reporter called wheedled an interview out of her and without informing her ran a front page story about her claims Nightline 20 20 NPR etc came along and ran stories portraying her as a crusader against sexual harassment a loaded phrase with a specific legal import which she had never used Now all this happened just a few months before Anita Hill announced to a TV audience that Clarence Thomas had left a pubic hair in her Coke In retrospect the media transformation of Conley s case looks like a rehearsal for its circuslike approach to Hill Thomas Conley had hoped to spark a general discussion of sexism in the medical academic profession Instead the media claim of sexual harassment reorganized the debate into a contest of personal adversaries Stanford as big and powerful institutions tend to do called for hearings Conley feeling that she should see through what she had unleashed returned to work in a Cold War atmosphere A two year agony of fact finding panels and legal actions ensued with losers both male and female Scapegoat men were singled out for behavior their profession had never before discouraged women who told of being pressured for sex found themselves alone laughed at or forced by the hostile environment to leave It took ages to resolve but in the end Gerry didn t get to be department chair though the two are somewhat horrifyingly still colleagues Conley after becoming a kind of national clearinghouse for complaints about sexism in medical schools traveled the college circuit to discuss flaws in both theory and practice of medical instruction But often she says the resulting reforms have been cosmetic a token low level bureaucrat assigned to hear problems with no forum to do anything about them Which isn t surprising Who would want to go through this kind of divisive battle every time an allegation came up That s one problem with our current approach to sexual harassment As we ve just seen in the Paula Jones case it s exhausting Everyone gets tired of the ransacking of private lives the cynical search for ulterior motives the weighing of imperfect evidence after a while people are likely to say Just let it go There s another problem too The focus on legalistic descriptions of punishable human behavior ignores unconscious behavior the habits many men are accustomed to that don t call for punishment but are still harmful what Conley says occurs within the reverberating circuitry of maleness The best parts of Conley s book are about deep institutional resistance to change the way that otherwise admirable male professors understandably draw on their training of 20 years ago which assumed the 70 kilogram male body as the human norm and left them totally ignorant of female health problems the way training in elite specialties like neurosurgery still promotes a specific kind of cowboy bravado which encourages women to bail out for gynecology On these issues Conley raises difficult important questions Unfortunately crude history will more likely reduce her to another role as a pioneer of the he said she said 90s If you missed the links in the text click to read more on the Yale University Press
