 Just Another Planned Community Dear Russ Since you mention reviews of the Celebration books I thought that Kurt Andersen s review in The New Yorker Sept 6 1999 was on the money It had a touch of skepticism regarding the subject after all this was The New Yorker but took Disney s town building attempt seriously except for the preposterous name of course although preposterous town names are hardly unknown in U S history New Hope for example or New Harmony which Andersen mentions or my favorite also in Florida Panacea Andersen raises an interesting point regarding the town of Celebration That is it is not really such a novelty Most of what the two books describe about their experience of living in Disney s town covenants problems with house construction issues of governance questions of exclusivity people s motivations for starting over and so on is found in any of the thousands of master planned communities that are built in this country every year The experience of moving into a brand new town is interesting but neither Celebration U S A nor The Celebration Chronicles pretentious title no sufficiently acknowledges that it is an ordinary one Every year like clockwork we build between 1 million and 2 million new houses the majority of which are in master planned communities some of which like Sun Cities are much larger Incidentally Frances Fitzgerald has written interestingly about the subject of contemporary new communities in Cities on a Hill A much more thoughtful book than either of the ones we are considering Of course one suspects that neither Celebration U S A nor The Celebration Chronicles would have been written had not the Disney Co been a part of the story In that sense there is a Ripley s Believe It or Not quality to these books One wishes for a Tracy Kidder to write about the same subject Kidder s gift is to draw people out and to keep himself in the background What mars both these books in my opinion is that one finds out altogether too much about the authors opinions which are frankly neither original nor all that interesting Frantz full disclosure here I correspond with him and Collins tend to be earnest and well meaning hence sometimes a tad pompous Ross an academic never lets us forget that he is from New York and not easily to be taken in I tend to agree with Andersen that Frantz Collins are the better reporters and have done their homework and produced a better book I m not sure I agree with your archeology in reverse analogy As an architect I have seen many buildings building complexes and planned communities completed but without inhabitants It is spooky I agree but hardly unusual Again with Celebration there is the tendency to inflate the ordinary into the extraordinary as if the presence of Disney raised the ante somehow Of course Disney s involvement did alter what happened the school the town center homebuyers expectations Maybe we can talk about that next time Regards Witold
