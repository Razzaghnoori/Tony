                            As the yearlong celebration of the         th anniversary of the discovery of the structure of DNA came to an end        the engaging autobiography of one of the participants further enlivened the drama of this        event Maurice Wilkins now  postpones the account of his involvement in the DNA affair        until the second half of the book Recounting his background and interesting life before        DNA  years in plain but telling sentences brings to life a character that is almost as        much out of the ordinary as those of the more flamboyant James Watson and Francis        Crick        Wilkins first six years in New Zealand a Garden of Eden were followed by a long        vividly described trip to England where the family eventually settled in Birmingham His        boyhood was marked by immersion in astronomy and telescopemaking but saddened by the        painful illness of his sister Success in school physics was the key for getting into        Cambridge where he reveled in the world of Ernest Rutherford Mark Oliphant and John        Bernal Given his leftist leanings it was inevitable that Wilkins would become involved in        the pacifist movement in Cambridge with its close connection to the Communist Party        Perhaps too much involvement led to a low degree grade in  and no hope of remaining at        Cambridge Instead he returned to Birmingham and joined the Luminescence Lab being        established by John Randall a man with whom he would be closely connected for many        decades The work there contributed to Randalls scheme for making radar practical in air        defensethe cavity magnetron that may have turned the course of World War II        Early in  Oliphant then at Birmingham left to work on the atomic bomb at Berkeley        and took Wilkins along Life in Berkeley was exciting but beneath the excitement of bomb        work and mixed feelings upon its success at Hiroshima Wilkins read Erwin Schrodingers         What Is Life Along with others who were to unravel the secrets of DNA        this planted the seed When after three transitional years Randall became head of Kings        College Londons physics department and director of a biophysics research unit sponsored by        the Medical Research Council MRC Wilkins was his deputy The attack on DNA structure        soon began        That Xray diffraction might play a major role in this search rested on two pillars        unique to England One was the British lead in using Xray diffraction to determine        molecular structuresa crown jewel built on the work of the Braggs father and son        Bernal and Dorothy Hodgkin The other was the preWorld War II work of William Astbury in        showing that DNA fibers displayed some crystallinity that if developed might be the basis        of helping to determine the structure Wilkins confides that in  he knew little of how        such Xray analysis might be done But in that year he was presented with an opportunity in        the form of samples of carefully prepared calf DNA given to him by a Swiss chemist Rudolf        Signer With this DNA much better fibers could be obtained and much sharper diffraction        diagrams emerged        The exploitation of this advance however became mired in a colossal error in Randalls        management of the group Without telling Wilkins he wrote to Rosalind Franklin who was on        her way to join the DNA effort that Wilkins was withdrawing from DNA work and that she        would take over Unaware of this Wilkins and Alec Stokes continued their work and reported        at a meeting in Cambridge in July  that DNA chains were probably in a helical        conformation with a diameter of   At the close of the meeting Franklin assailed        Wilkins saying that he should stop his DNA work as Randall had written would be the        case Understandably but regrettably the two groups continued working in isolation from        each other        Matters worsened In October Watson arrived at Cambridge and set up DNA structure        studies with Crick They quickly arrived at a threestranded helical structure But        Franklin and Wilkins soon demolished it Likewise a threestranded model at Kings College        had a very short life As if to trump these failures Bragg at Cambridge and Randall at        Kings agreed that DNA studies at Cambridge should stop and that the work should continue        only at Kings Mismanagement and noncooperation were taking their toll Franklin was moving        toward a twostranded structure but away from helices Indeed in mid she initiated a        discussion with an announcement about the death of the helix Mysteriously she put aside a        striking photo of the diffraction pattern of BDNA one of the two major structural forms        of DNA that emerged in early  as a perfect signature of the helical form But         continued downhill Even Wilkins stopped DNA work that November        Suddenly in the new year life returned to the DNA effort Linus Pauling had just        published a structure threestranded that did not long survive but the entrance of the        worlds leading structural chemist into the race reawakened everyone to the centrality of        DNA structure In January Raymond Gosling gave to Wilkins the very welloriented        diffraction photo of BDNA that he and Franklin had taken in July  Wilkins assumed        that it was given to him to do as he wished a few days later he showed it to Watson        Though hardly an expert in Xray diffraction Watson sensed that it was strong evidence for        helices and sketched it for Crick on his return to Cambridge Later that January Franklin        announced she would be moving from Kings College to Birkbeck College to join Bernals        group In giving her final seminar she switched from her earlier insistence that BDNA was        nonhelical but did not show the photo that gave the strongest evidence for helicity This        shift put Franklin in a position to move forward on the structure of DNA but without        others resorting to model building the goal would have remained elusive        Finally in midFebruary Max Perutz who was a member of the MRC committee overseeing        the Biophysics Unit at Kings College passed on to Crick his copy of a report from that        unit This report contained Franklins results that the phosphates were on the outside and        that the Aform of DNA had a special crystalline arrangement called the monoclinic C space        group From his work with proteins Crick saw immediately that the chains in the helical        structure must be antiparallel and that there were probably two chains entwined Watson        used other data in the report to deduce that there were indeed two chains not three or        four Erwin Chargaff had recently shown that in the base composition of all DNAs examined        adenines and thymines as well as guanines and cytosines are equal ie A  T and G  C        Now released from the ban on DNA studies Watson and Crick engaged in a frantic search        using model building They found a unique way to fit the bases in the structure by pairing        and by March  they had the doublehelix model constructed it obeyed the Chargaff ratios        it fit the Xray data for BDNA and it provided a rational way to encode and transmit        genetic information to subsequent generations        Wilkins was invited to view the model in Cambridge He found it stunning Watson asked        him to be a coauthor of the paper Wilkins true to his character declined as he had not        been involved in the final monumental stage Back in London Franklin had already moved to        Birkbeck She received the news of the discovery with equanimity But a later examination        of her notebooks showed that she had moved to favor helices and a twochain or possibly a        onechain model        With the rather complicated story of the greatest discovery in biology in the century        now reasonably complete what is one to make of it There are many answers I will mention        only three        The first is the key role played by model building In fiber diffraction there is not        enough information by orders of magnitude to locate every atom as would be possible in        diffraction by perfect crystals that give thousands of sharp reflections Instead the        fiber diagram can only provide cues and some specifics such as the repeat distance Model        building is a way of bringing into the picture previously determined bond distances and        bond angles of components such as the purine and pyrimidine bases and the sugars that are        unavailable from the fiber diagram That this was not seen at Kings College left the        researchers there well behind in a field that they had pioneered        A second lesson is the importance of bringing the full knowledge of single crystal        analysis to fiber diagram interpretation That Franklin and Wilkins missed noting that the        monoclinic C space group meant that the chains in the fiber had to be antiparallel robbed        them of an important clue to the structure        And third the management of the Biophysics Unit at Kings College was a recipe for        failure Riddled by secrecy diffuse lines of authority the absence of strategies and a        lack of open congeniality all so well described by Wilkins who refers to it as Randalls        Circus this unit is a model of how not to succeed in group research        DNA research continued at Kings College in a gradually improving environment important        details were worked out But there was no real renewal such as aiming at how DNA is        configured to accommodate proteins in the nucleus Wilkins enjoyed being included in the        subsequent awardsthe Lasker and the Nobel prizes With Crick he was annoyed by Watsons        rendering of events in         The Double Helix  The final chapter of his own autobiography addresses        the criticism that some have leveled against his cold relation with Franklin but also his        happiness in newfound family life Research gradually gave way to the pursuit of pacifist        goals in a number of organizations and to the popularization of science His has been a        useful life a part of which contributed to the great revolution in biology It is good to        have the insight that this book presents in a candid and personal way
