          hi Kay   hi   i uh was thinking about salaries and benefits and uh was wondering whats the most important thing to you besides a salary in a job   uhhuh well um i we just recently graduated from Rice University and uh we were going through a lot of job interviews and things and some of the things that were important to me my uh when my husband was looking for his job was um hours you know we he had been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all  so i was you know didnt want him to have a job that   yeah   would make him kind of be on call all the time and have to go in at any time and you know even on the weekends and and um and things so that was important to me and also insurance   uhhuh   for the family our family because wed like to be able to take care of our medical needs and not be thinking so much about whether or not you can afford it   sure yeah i dont ever want to have to worry about that thats real important to me um you know we have that that Aetna   uhhuh   um thats what we the insurance that we have right now when we were in Colorado they had um a different type of HMO there that i really liked a lot   umhum us too umhum   it was um not that kind of HMOs where you have to go to their theyre sort of like clinics you know uh but this was just an HMO where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular   umhum   hospitals and all that but it was with a certain list of of doctors that you know participated in the HMO   umhum   and um you know then you only had to pay the it for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor and uh three dollars for the prescriptions   well thats nice uhhuh thats good   and uh i especially liked the prescription especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time  that those prescriptions can be very expensive   umhum oh i know we just went through that ourselves we just you know were like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things   oh i know especially if you get what is it Seclor i think that that just about breaks the bank right there   umhum the yes yes its pretty bad well yeah and we um we were interested in having dental dental insurance too because um well having been in school we kind of put things off and only went in when we knew there was a problem somewhere and stuff and   umhum do you   we wanted to be able to go in and have our teeth cleaned and just checked all over and   do you have the basic plan or do you have the the other one   we have um you know were at Aetna with uh an  we have like the medical the dental insurance is separate is that what you mean and i dont think its the basic i think its the other one   right the one thats like you get additional theyll pay a little bit more i think for the different procedures we just have the basic right now and   umhum uhhuh   for most things it tends to cover it we dont have too many major um expenses at this point but we have been able to find doctors dentists that will accept  pretty much whatever the basic plan pays a couple of times weve had to pay oh i dont know three to five dollars but thats not that bad   uhhuh no thats great yeah we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too yes and lets see besides insurance other things that we looked at um well my husband does not like to commute very far and and we dont like him to be you know having to drive an hour to work or something   umhum no we dont like that either   so we kind of looked for where where the uh his office would be located and how far well hes uh you know hes at the one thats at um   is his office in Plano   seventy five at uh six thirty five and so well by living in Plano were just about fifteen minutes away and   uhhuh uhhuh oh thats not bad   especially especially when they finish all the construction out here and we didnt want him to let you know to like we had some job offers in the New York area and we thought well you know he would be really commuting   right oh yes youre not kidding   and not only is it you know trouble to have to drive but it takes time away from your home and your family when youre out driving   thats right   and um so that was something that was important to us and because like like i say i we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long that we were anxious to do everything we could to have you know       made us be more together and and what other can you think of another thing that you guys looked at and   well that those are some of the things that are very important to us too um   umhum   we wed like you know other benefits that are provided um the athletic facilities that that you can sometimes take advantage of um   umhum   i think thats thats pretty nice but i have to say that since weve come here we havent done it too much though we havent enrolled in too many of the classes or or any of that but thats a thats a nice benefit to have   umhum thats true thats really important um also what um opportunities there would be for advancement       i think we looked at besides just you know what salary you would be having having now but when when could uh your salary increase and   right   is there was there somewhere to go   yeah that thats one of the i think the hard things right now i mean theyre going through some some tough times  to say the least uh i know many of us are thankful that he still has a job   umhum yes that that we can make our mortgage payments and yeah thats really true   uh uh one of the drawbacks i think of working for a big company is often times you do have to follow pretty rigid um  guidelines um if if an employee is especially exemplary i think its often in a smaller company its a little bit easier for them to say hey you know this person did a wonderful job give him a big bonus kind of thing a lot of times   umhum   smaller companies have bonus plans where i think in a large company its hard to do that because therere just so many people to deal with and you have to have guidelines if you know for salary increases and things like that   umhum   just one of the things that that happens when someone when youre dealing with a large company   uhhuh   but   but well we also were interested in um you know being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for   umhum   for friendships that way so that you would feel happy going to work everyday and rather than thinking oh i really i cant stand these people i but uh so thats something that was important to him and   right   thinking he could um work under those   how long has he been in his present position   oh just since last last summer its only been not even a year yet so   uhhuh well i was going to say  it sounds like you you picked out a lot of good things you know for him to to have to uh to choose in a position that has a lot of thought put into it in a big company though you also get moved around a lot he may be having to drive over here to Lewisville some time or or we may be having to drive to Plano you never know   yes were oh yeah you never know were hoping that that wont be the case we       i think one of the most one of the most deciding factors of why we chose um this area is that um my husband was raised in Irving   uhhuh   and so he we have a lot of family here his side of the family and being when we were down in Houston we were isolated i mean its not that far but people would have we didnt have anyone in town that was our family and although we had really good friends and and we had church and school support and things um   right   we were anxious to move close to family members just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that   yeah were very   so that really made a big difference i think in why we chose TI and chose to move this way   were very far from our families and its really hard families little children and um they were the only grandchildren and so our our families are are are really far away in fact this is a little off the topic but yesterday my mother happened to be on a train going from Phoenix to back to Chicago and it stopped in Dallas for a half an hour so   umhum   i loaded the kids in the car and we went downtown and  met her train for half an hour and brought her a little snack and an Easter basket and  i think it it made her trip a little bit nicer       oh thats nice yeah and it is i think it is important to you know want to be close to your family and   yeah i mean its its hard i mean to to just for us to snatch a half hour like that is is a special occasion for us so um   umhum well thats definitely the way we feel   its nice its nice that you can have your family close like that   were really enjoying it i wonder what it would be like i mean i i wanted to be close to family but i also thought that it would be harder to be close to family  but its turned out really good and i think that you know were really satisfied with that choice and   yeah sometimes it can be   we you know kind of felt like um it was worth it to us   thats good   but anyway  well i my children just ran out the door so i need to go check on them but ive really enjoyed this conversation conversation and and uh nice to have met you and you have a good day okay byebye   okay well i have too okay you too byebye
