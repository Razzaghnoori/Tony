 oh uh so what s what s your favorite exercise well my i guess uh sports uh i m don t play as much sports as i used to because i m i m too old for it now but uh i still play golf i like to bowl although i hadn t bowled in quite a while but i guess my main exercise right now is probably golf oh that s pretty good exercise you do you drive a cart or do you carry your bag uh this last tournament i was in i walked nine holes and almost dropped so i shared a cart yeah it gets a long ways after a while yeah especially on a real hilly course yeah oh let s see i i play racquetball mostly yeah um i don t play very much anymore because i ve fractured my right ankle twice oh and uh fractured it on both sides and so it s kind of weak i m afraid to get out there and try it again um they have a real nice uh health club there at TI Lewisville racquetball courts and uh hand ball courts and it s a real nice facility i just haven t taken advantage of it yet though do do do they give the employees time off during the day to go no not really a lot of places do that now they ll they ll set aside you know like an hour a day that you can go exercise yeah yeah that s a pretty good idea because people who take advantage of it end up in better health and saves them on health care yeah yeah um yeah i like bowling too i haven t been for a while just don t have the time yeah but uh i guess bowling and racquetball s about it for me walking every once in a while but yeah not a great deal of that yeah i ve i wish they d split that bowling season up into uh three seasons um hum right now they have a real short season and a real long season um hum the summer league is just too long yeah well that s my uh i mean every time i ve tried to go you know it s always there s there s always a league bowling yeah yeah and it it s just so you either have to wait or yeah you re next to to league bowlers and after a while it just gets to be a pain yeah yeah there s there s hardly no open alleys anymore it s all yeah yeah especially here in Raleigh we ve got such little bitty bowling alleys all taken up yeah little bitty everything here but uh also TI has some good uh uh some good jogging tracks every once in a while while i m sitting there eating lunch i ll look look out and see people jogging i guess on their lunch hour yeah um a friend of mine works at uh IBM in Charlotte yeah and they ve got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land and it s a huge plant i mean this thing s just enormous and that s what they do at lunch time they go out and run around the building yeah i m not i was never into jogging i hated that when i was in high school playing football coach was always making us run yeah yeah i just sort of hated it from that point on well i i guess i would love to play basketball but but i don t i don t think i d have the wind for that i guess of all the sports that probably gives you more exercise than any any sport there is yeah it s that s a tough one to play i i used to play it when i was younger but yeah took it out of me then and i d hate to think what it would do to me now yeah but uh yeah i got to stick to more sedate sports yeah yeah i i as soon as i as soon as i can find me an ankle a good uh a good ankle brace i m going to start playing some racquetball again but i m not going out there with an unsupported ankle anymore yeah yeah i m tired of running around on crutches for two months at a time and i m not lucky enough to just go ahead and break it you know the things got to get fractured so that it never heals properly yeah yeah you might have to go to those old old old timey high top tennis shoes that they used to wear well i ve got a pair of those uh that s those are the ones that i wear when i go out there um yeah yeah trouble is i can t get them tight enough tight enough to really support your ankle to to really give me what i feel is support um so i m i i i think probably just an ace bandage would work yeah yeah but i want to get one of those um padded ankle yeah what you call its only bad thing about an ace bandage if you wrap it tight enough so that really supports your ankle it s going to cut off the blood yeah it s going to cut off the circulation yeah yeah i i think i tried that one time a couple years ago and it did the same did that same thing yeah you end up loosening it up and then of course you don t have any yeah yeah i think i ll probably just have to go with one of those splint braces or something yeah but um well i guess that s about it for exercise that s about it as far as exercise us old guys just don t do it very much do we no unless unless you c all pushing yourself away from the table more exercise well that s that s good exercise and i don t do enough of that either i sat down to a double dose of spaghetti tonight i yeah well i was cooking me a grilled cheese um i like grilled cheese too yeah cheese is bad for you i know well you know i i i wonder though it s i think it really depends on the person yeah i was reading an article in the paper the other morning these doctors are baffled about this eighty seven year old man who eats thirty boiled eggs a day yeah did you see that yeah yeah i heard about it and they re wondering where does that cholesterol go yeah i think it it s all in the metabolism of of the it i think it is too And i and i think things like eggs and cheese anything like that i think it just depends on who you are yeah because uh i know people who eat tons of that kind of stuff and they re just as healthy as can be yeah i mean i m i m sort of strange in a way i m i m about twenty pounds overweight and i smoke but my blood pressure is about my last reading was just the other day it was one hundred two over seventy nine well that s that s the same with me i do both and my blood pressure is i think it was the last time i took it it was a hundred and hundred and ten over seventy or something like that yeah good and low yeah and uh i mean you d think by looking at me my i d have a bad heart and everything terrific heart great blood pressure yeah yeah jeez i m not worried about it no if you didn t eat if you knocked off everything that they say is not good for you to eat uh you d be just about down to bread and water yeah exactly and and and even then you ve got to watch the bread and the water yeah it would have to be a diet bread yeah you never know what s in the water either well it s been nice talking with you well good talking to you you have yourself a good night okay you too talk thank you talk to you later bye bye
