 The 94 Minute Man A dearth of breaking news helped President Clinton win a clean sweep of the weekend shows His encyclopedic press conference Mark Shields NewsHour With Jim Lehrer was Issue 1 his midweek cancellation of the deadline for U S troop withdrawal from Bosnia was Issue 2 and his disarming chat at the White House with conservative critics of affirmative action ranked as Issue 3 The commentarians mostly thrilled at the style not the substance of Clinton s 94 minute press conference marathon Nearly every show replayed the president s decorum breaking response to the ABC reporter who tried to snare him with a sticky tape question about his race initiative By the fifth viewing you sorta saw the president s point None of the pundits did Ordinarily the press complains about the president avoiding them Clinton s wordy outing peeved Evan Thomas Inside Washington because all the talk proved that he doesn t have anything to say Charles Krauthammer Inside Washington found the silver lining If Clinton doesn t have anything to say the country must be in good shape Paul Gigot NewsHour begrudgingly credited the president with outlasting the press while Al Hunt Capital Gang slathered on the praise calling the 30 question romp a virtuoso performance Playing to character two conservative Capital Gang sters found Clinton mean Robert Novak and filled with self pity and afflicted with a thin skin Kate O Beirne Riffing off the press conference the pundits reprised last month s line that the president is a lame duck Lamer than most said Jack Germond Washington Week in Review because he isn t feared or liked by anybody in his party Instead of noting that anybody who can control the week s news with a press conference a foreign policy announcement and a tea with domestic dissidents is no lame duck the pundits indulged in psychobiography Clinton is frustrated because the end is now in sight for his presidency O Beirne and he has yet to establish his legacy George Will This Week Morton Kondracke The McLaughlin Group Because they will be chewing on the legacy thing for three more years the commentarians recently ordered a crate of dentures Reversing his campaign pledge to bring the troops home from Bosnia on June 30 earned Clinton near uniform praise from the pundits Mara Liasson Fox News Sunday George Stephanopoulos This Week and Steve Roberts Late Edition stroked the prez for saying I was wrong to promise the troops would come home in June 1998 Nobody in this town believed him when he set that deadline said Germond voicing the majority viewpoint that the promise was an obvious campaign lie But not everybody loves a mensch Pat Buchanan The McLaughlin Group barely disturbed the consensus by accusing Clinton of having deceived the American public and leading the nation into a quagmire Clinton s Bosnia plan will require congressional approval a cinch the pundits said because he has already drawn down U S troops in Bosnia from 27 000 to about 8 500 and no U S soldiers have been killed Deadlines are a bad idea said Brit Hume Fox News Sunday because locals would treat one as the first day of hunting season locking and loading in anticipation The only consensus criticism of Clinton is that he lacks an exit strategy from Bosnia Look for an etymological rundown of the phrase in a future William Safire language column All praised Clinton for expanding his national dialogue on race by meeting at the White House with several leading doubters of affirmative action Hume called it the legitimizing moment for conservatives who disagree with Clinton A step forward concurred Gigot that once again proved Clinton to be an aerobic listener Roberts The lone dissenting view came from Tony Blankley Late Edition who recounted how Newt Gingrich Bob Dole and Trent Lott all thought on first meeting that they could do business with the president They soon learned otherwise Jay Carney The McLaughlin Group counseled the president to mix policy initiatives with his racial jawboning if he wanted to accomplish anything Kondracke implored Clinton to prepare for the day when the courts will strike down set asides based on race He suggested preference programs based on economic status instead Oh Shut Up John McLaughlin urged the president to augment his racial dialogue with discussion of black racism jury nullification hate crimes perpetrated against white people by black people and violent imagery in rap songs At CNN the Stretching Technique Is Called Yip Yap How slow a news week was it Meet the Press host Tim Russert took his Christmas vacation five days early by letting Rep Jesse L Jackson Jr Laura Schlessinger the Rev Jerry Falwell and Mario Cuomo run amok in a long segment on the family and morality Russert regained consciousness at show s end when he introduced a historical segment on Robert Frost s Meet the Press visit Evans Novak took a holiday too with an inconsequential visit from guest Art Buchwald Bob and Elizabeth Dole chatted with Frank Sesno on Late Edition for no good reason And on Capital Gang the team ran out the clock with silly segments on what hypothetical gift each of the panelists would give to various politicians and what hypothetical gift they would give to each other The prescient Sam Donaldson wisely took the weekend off Note to Mark Shields If you say it on NewsHour don t repeat yourself on Capital Gang Punditus Interruptus Week 1 Robert Novak and Al Hunt were unusually civil to one another in the Dec 20 edition of Capital Gang foiling Pundit Central s plan to tabulate their numerous interruptions of one another in an attempt to calculate who is the bigger interjector Novak cut Hunt off only twice Hunt interrupted Novak once Blame the good manners on Christmas
