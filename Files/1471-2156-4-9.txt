 Background The ubiquitin proteasome pathway is essential for degradation of many regulatory proteins Proteins are targeted for proteasome mediated degradation by attachment of a polyubiquitin chain The addition of a polyubiquitin chain to a protein requires the sequential action of a ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2 and a ubiquitin protein ligase E3 1 E3 activities are thought to be essential because they are involved in substrate recognition SCF complexes are E3s composed of the Cullin family member Cul1 Cdc53 in S cerevisiae as well as Skp1 Roc1 also called Rbx1 or Hrt1 and one of the numerous F box proteins that act as a receptor for the substrate for review see 2 The founding member of the SCF family SCF Cdc4 was identified through genetic analysis of the G1 S transition in budding yeast and served as a model for the study of other SCF complexes Mutations in the E2 enzyme Cdc34 or in any of the SCF Cdc4components Cdc53 Cul1 Skp1 and Cdc4 arrest cells at the G1 S transition because of a failure to degrade the cyclin dependent kinase CDK inhibitor Sic1 3 4 In a wild type situation G1 cyclin CDK complexes phosphorylate Sic1 at the end of G1 This leads to Cdc34 dependent ubiquitination and degradation of Sic1 Phosphorylated Sic1 but not the unmodified protein is recruited to the SCF complex by binding to the WD domain of Cdc4 5 6 The F box motif of Cdc4 binds Skp1 so that the F box protein acts as a bridge between substrate and the SCF complex Cdc53 forms the core of the complex by binding Skp1 Roc1 and Cdc34 The Cdc53 Roc1 subcomplex stimulates the ubiquitination activity of Cdc34 7 8 Upon association with the complex Sic1 is extensively ubiquitinated and then degraded by the proteasome While mutations in the CDC53 gene of S cerevisiae eliminate SCF activity toward its many diverse targets the phenotype is nonetheless specific Presumably arrest at the G1 S transition is a result of the thresholds and kinetics of action of the various substrates which imparts special importance to the targeting of Sic1 for degradation Mutations in the C elegans ortholog Cul1 lead to increased cell number 9 showing that in this organism a different aspect of cell cycle regulation is controlled in a Cul1 dependent fashion It has been inferred that a deficit in Cul1 function results in defects in turn over of specific proteins and that the phenotype varies between systems because of differences in the spectrum of proteins affected and differences in the importance of the targeted proteins The transcription factor E2F is an important regulator of the G1 S phase transition in metazoans and a major target of the tumor suppressor Rb 10 11 The mechanisms controlling E2F activity have not been completely elucidated E2F is activated toward the end of G1 and it functions to promote S phase Nonetheless E2F is inactivated and or downregulated upon progression to S phase a regulatory feature that appears critical as E2F overexpression or ectopic activation induces apoptosis both in mammalian cells and in flies 12 13 14 15 Inactivation of the DNA binding activity of E2F 1 by the cyclin A Cdk complex has been shown to be critical for proper S phase progression 16 In mammalian cells E2F 1 is also subject to proteasome mediated degradation 17 18 19 and recent evidence indicates that E2F 1 degradation occurs in S phase 20 Control of E2F 1 stability has also been linked to its association with the F box protein Skp2 20 but this has not been tied to a specific phase of the cell cycle In addition Skp2 knock out cells do not accumulate E2F 21 and an E2F mutant unable to bind Skp2 is still ubiquitinated and unstable 21 Thus the basis of S phase destruction of E2F 1 remains unresolved Analysis of E2F levels in the Drosophila eye disc showed a disappearance of E2F staining in the S phase cells of the morphogenetic furrow suggesting conservation of the S phase destruction of this regulator 12 To explore potential roles for Cul1 in cell cycle control in D melanogaster we overexpressed mouse Cul1 mCul1 in the wing imaginal disc and found that this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading to a reduction in SCF function A screen for modifiers of the resulting small wing phenotype identified E2F as a putative target of SCF action Further analysis of genetic interactions implicated the SCF Slimbcomplex as a regulator of E2F function Results Mouse Cul1 overexpression in Drosophilaleads to reduced SCF function Since genes encoding highly conserved activites often function across species boundaries we attempted to evaluate mouse Cul1 mCul1 function in Drosophila To this end we used a GAL4 transgene to drive overexpression of mCul1 in the wing disc MS1096 is an X linked transgene that expresses GAL4 strongly on the dorsal surface and more weakly on the ventral surface of the wing primordium in third instar larval wing imaginal discs Because of dosage compensation GAL4 levels in males MS1096 Y are twice those in heterozygous females MS1096 In males MS1096 Y UAS mCul1 mCul1 overexpression led to a strong reduction in the size of the wing without any gross patterning defects fig 1A 1B Females MS1096 UAS mCul1 displayed a weaker phenotype that was sometimes indistinguishable from wild type see fig 2A In males further increasing expression by using two copies of the UAS mCul1 transgene reduces the wing to a rudimentary stump not shown The reduced wings also occasionally showed a multiple wing hair phenotype in which several trichomes instead of just one were produced by individual intervein cells particularly in the region near the anterior cross vein Introduction of a single mutant copy of the Cul1 k 01207allele 22 or a deficiency that uncovers Cul1 Df 2R NCX8 dominantly enhanced the wing reduction fig 1C In contrast decreasing the level of endogenous Cul3 guftagu another Cullin family member see http flybase bio indiana edu or expressing a GFP marker had no effect Coexpression of Drosophila Cul1 dCul1 suppressed the phenotype induced by expression of mCul1 fig 1D These data show that overexpression of mouse Cul1 has a dominant negative effect on Cul1 function or that dCul1 suppresses a neomorphic activity of mCul1 To test if overexpression of mCul1 is sensitive to the dosage of other SCF components we asked whether changing the copy number of both dRoc1 and dSkpA can modify the mCul1 induced phenotype dRoc1 and dSkpA are located at the tip of the X chromosome in region 1B Flybase http flybase bio indiana edu The small wing phenotype seen in flies overexpressing mCul1 was enhanced when flies also had a deficiency uncovering this region fig 2A 2B while coexpression of dSkpA rescued the wing phenotypes fig 2C 2D These results show that SCF function limits the mCul1 overexpression phenotype Cul1 and SCF function are required for proteasome dependent degradation of a number of proteins in other organisms We thus tested whether reduction in proteasome function would modify the phenotype caused by mCul1 overexpression The DTS5 and DTS7 alleles are mutations in the 6 and 2 subunits of the proteasome 23 24 Both mutations which have antimorphic activity acted dominantly to strongly enhance the small wing phenotype generated by mCul1 overexpression fig 2E supporting the idea that the phenotype is due to reduced degradation of an SCF substrate To directly assess Cul1 function we sought a target protein whose destruction might be limited by the activity of the Cul1 proteasome pathway While SCF triggers ubiquitination and proteasome action degrades many substrates to completion a few targets are instead cleaved and partially degraded This is true of the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus Ci it is cleaved and its C terminal portion is degraded 25 26 27 Cleavage and degradation require phosphorylation SCF Slmb and proteasomal activity While complete inactivation of SCF Slmbcauses cell death it was shown that a cell viable hypomorphic slimb allele resulted in accumulation of unprocessed Ci Based on this and findings that Ci accumulation is especially sensitive to pharmacological inhibition of the proteasome data not shown it appears that Ci levels are particularly sensitive to partial reduction in the activity of the SCF proteasome pathway of protein processing degradation Inhibition of Ci processing can be scored by the accumulation of a C terminal epitope 26 This assay showed that reduction in the function of Slimb or Roc1 two activities that contribute to SCF function is associated with an increase in Ci staining 26 27 Similarly reduction of Cul1 function by mutation in Cul1 data not shown and 28 or by overexpressing mCul1 fig 2Fand 2G led to Ci accumulation Together these results indicate that mCul1 overexpression leads to a Cul1 dominant negative action that reduces SCF function Based on the strength of the phenotype and its enhancement by removal of an endogenous copy of Cul1 we infer that the mCul1 expression only partially suppresses Cul1 function to create a hypomorphic phenotype We infer that the wing defect results from a reduction in the rate of degradation of one or more targets of SCF action Reduction in Cul1 function induces apoptosis The reduction in wing size in mCul1 overexpressing flies could result from changes in cell size or cell number Each cell of the wing blade produces a hair and hair density indicates cell density and hence cell size Wing hair density was unchanged by mCul1 expression even when there was a dramatic effect on wing size 62 6 3 0 cells 7950 m 2for MS1096 Y 60 8 2 3 cells 7950 m 2for MS1096 Y UAS mCul1 This result suggests that mCul1 overexpression causes a reduction in cell number either by a coordinate reduction in cell growth and proliferation or by increasing cell death To distinguish between these possibilities we dissected wing imaginal discs from late third instar larvae and stained them for mitotic or apoptotic cells Labelling with an anti phospho histone 3 antibody did not reveal any significant changes in the number of mitotic cells not shown However acridine orange staining showed a large increase in cell death throughout the wing pouch when mCul1 was overexpressed fig 3A 3B Coexpression of baculovirus anti apoptotic protein p35 rescued the reduction in wing size fig 3C 3D indicating that mCul1 overexpression induces elevated apoptosis mCul1 induced apoptosis was insensitive to the coexpression of dominant negative forms of p53 not shown p35 expression also suppressed the multiple wing hair phenotype indicating that this phenotype too requires apoptosis As dead cells do not contribute to adult structures this phenotype must be a secondary consequence of cell death We conclude that limiting SCF function induces apoptosis Note that this conclusion does not argue against a cell cycle role for SCF as defects in cell cycle progression can trigger apoptosis Dominant negative mCul1 genetically interacts with E2F Having determined that the mCul1 overexpression phenotype results from a dominant negative effect we were in a position to test for genetic interactions between mCul1 overexpression and mutations in potential cell cycle targets of Cul1 Because SCF complexes have been implicated in cell cycle control in other organisms we tested whether changing the dosage of cell cycle regulators dominantly modified the mCul1 overexpression phenotype Reductions in the levels of a variety of cell cycle genes cyclin E dacapo roughex DP RBF string cyclin A rca1 wee1 and cdc2 had no effect on wing size not shown In contrast reducing the level of E2F by 50 completely restored wild type wing size fig 4A 4B 4C an effect that correlated with a strong reduction in cell death in the disc fig 4E 4F The presence of a single hs E2F transgene gave a weak and incompletely penetrant enhancement in the absence of heat shock and this enhancement was stronger and completely penetrant when the transgenic strain was exposed to a heat shock treatment every 24 h during third instar and early pupal development fig 4D Since the presence of the hs E2F transgene and its induction by our heat shock protocol low level overexpression compared to Asano et al 1996 had no phenotype when in a wild type background we conclude that mCul1 expression sensitizes the cells to E2F overexpression The reciprocal suppression by E2F mutation and enhancement by E2F overexpression show that the apoptosis triggered by mCul1 is mediated by or requires E2F function Because a high level of ectopic expression of E2F is known to induce apoptosis 12 13 these results suggest that mCul1 overexpression might interfere with normal E2F downregulation Dominant negative Cul1 expression disrupts E2F inactivation in S phase Immunostaining for E2F in the furrow of the eye disc showed an abrupt drop in protein levels at the position where most cells exit G1 and initiate S phase 12 Using a double label approach we were able to test directly for overlap between E2F presence and S phase as marked by 5 bromodeoxyuridine BrdU incorporation in dividing cells of the wing disc despite the asynchrony of division No E2F staining was detected in BrdU labelled cells green of wild type wing discs whereas non S phase cells showed strong E2F red staining fig 5A 5B 5C no E2F staining was observed in over a thousand BrdU positive cells from 8 different discs Thus E2F is downregulated in advance of significant BrdU incorporation in wild type wing disc cells When mCul1 is overexpressed a small fraction of S phase cells 3 of 800 BrdU positive cells from 6 independent wing discs contains detectable amounts of E2F fig 5D 5E 5F arrowheads Since E2F is normally degraded prior to S phase the overlap in staining suggests that the partial suppression of Cul1 caused by mCul1 expression slowed E2F destruction to the point that it persisted briefly in S phase We suggest but have not demonstrated that the low percentage of cells showing the overlap in the staining is due to a remaining capacity of the residual SCF activity to promote slower but still effective elimination of E2F during S phase In any case our finding shows that when dCul1 function is reduced the normal pattern of E2F degradation in S phase is disrupted leading to inappropriate persistence of E2F While it could also be suggested that this effect might be secondary to other disruptions induced by dominant negative Cul1 the genetic suppression of phenotypes by reduction of E2F dose above suggests otherwise as do the analyses of the role of the F box protein Slimb below Slimb is required for E2F downregulation in S phase The experiments described above demonstrate that overexpression of mCul1 produces a phenotype that can be modified by second site mutations and therefore could be used for a more general genome wide modifier screen To determine whether other suppressors or enhancers might be isolated we tested if deficiencies on the third chromosome uncover other potential interacting genes One modifying deficiency Df 3R e R1 removes region 93B6 D3 4 and acts as an enhancer of the small wing phenotype One gene in this region slimb is an interesting candidate because this gene encodes an F box protein that is part of an SCF complex 26 29 Several independent alleles of slimb were tested and all enhanced the dominant negative mCul1 overexpression phenotype fig 6 compare A and B Four deficiencies uncovering other predicted F box containing genes CG4911 CG3428 CG2010 and CG9003 or mutations in the F box protein genes ppa and ago 30 31 had no effect on the phenotype not shown showing that the effect is specific Interestingly co reduction of E2F and slimb function reversed the slimb enhanced mCul1 overexpression phenotype fig 6Aand 6C and loss of a copy of slimb attenuated the suppression of the mCul1 phenotype resulting from loss of one copy of E2F compare fig 4Cand 6C This mutual co suppression suggests that slimb and E2F exert opposing activities on the same process and perhaps that Slimb acts on E2F or on a critical regulator of E2F activity We thus wished to test whether loss of Slimb had an effect on E2F protein in imaginal discs As slimb null mutants die as first instar larvae direct analysis of the mutant discs was not possible The severity of the slimb mutant phenotype suggested that the mutation reduced crucial SCF functions much more than did expression of mCul1 We used a slimb mutant stock carrying a slimb transgene under the control of the HSP 70 promoter to modify the time of onset of the slimb mutant phenotype In the absence of heat shock slimb homozygotes exhibited the early lethality of slimb mutants but a single 30 minute heat shock at 37 C during first instar was enough to allow some larvae to reach the wandering third instar stage 4 days later These larvae have small imaginal discs Labelling of these discs with the anti E2F antibody revealed that nearly all cells expressed E2F fig 7A Many of these cells also incorporated low levels of BrdU fig 7Band 7C usually in regions of the nucleus with lower E2F staining A few cells also had high levels of BrdU incorporation and these also expressed E2F although at lower levels asterisks on fig 7Aand 7B An hour and a half after a heat shock that restored Slimb expression BrdU labelled cells no longer contained detectable levels of E2F fig 7D 7E 7F No accumulation of E2F mRNA can be seen in slimb mutant discs fig 8 suggesting that any effect of Slimb on E2F occurs posttranscriptionnally These results indicate that elimination of E2F during DNA replication requires Slimb Slimb and E2F interact in vitro The above results raise the possibility that an SCF Slmbcomplex can target E2F for degradation If this is the case it is expected that Slimb would recruit E2F to the complex To test this hypothesis we asked whether Slimb and E2F physically interact To this end 35S labelled E2F was produced in vitro in a wheat germ lysate and incubated with the WD repeat region of Slimb fused to GST and bound to beads Analysis of bead associated proteins fig 9 showed association of radiolabeled E2F with the fusion containing the WD repeat region of Slimb lane 3 but not with GST lane 2 The interaction between Slimb and E2F depends on a phosphorylation event as it is prevented by the presence of active alkaline phosphatase lane 4 but not when the phosphatase is inhibited by sodium vanadate lane 5 Similar results were obtained with E2F2 the other Drosophila E2F family member not shown Discussion We have provided evidence indicating a role for an SCF Slmbcomplex in elimination of E2F during S phase in Drosophila We first demonstrated that mouse Cul1 overexpression has a dominant negative effect on SCF function in the wing imaginal disc resulting in apoptotic cell death leading to a small wing phenotype in adult flies Thus SCF activity normally suppresses cell death The cell death that occurred upon reduction of Cul1 function was suppressed when E2F function was reduced by mutation This genetic interaction might be due to action of E2F and Cul1 in parallel pathways one suppressing and one enhancing cell death or they might act in opposite directions in the same pathway Because SCF complexes are involved in controlling protein degradation we favoured the hypothesis that Cul1 promotes the destruction of E2F and that the inappropriate persistence of E2F leads to cell death Consistent with this idea E2F overproduction can induce apoptosis 12 13 Furthermore cell cycle specific destruction of E2F was suggested by the finding that E2F protein becomes undetectable in the synchronised S phase cells of the morphogenetic furrow of the eye imaginal disc 12 Our double labelling analysis extended this finding to the asynchronously cycling cells of the wing imaginal disc and demonstrated that E2F is rapidly degraded prior to significant DNA replication In contrast we found that E2F was detected in a fraction of S phase cells when SCF function was reduced by mCul1 This shows that normal E2F downregulation is delayed or slowed by reduction in SCF function Although the dominant negative action of mCul1 in Drosophila was unanticipated it offers a fortuitously convenient tool for the analysis of SCF function The Drosophila Cul1 mutant is less useful because maternal contributions of Cul1 are so large that homozygous mutant animals develop to pupariation Additionally unlike the spatially restricted expression of mCul1 the strong Cul1 mutant alleles result in lethality The stage and generality of the defects make analysis of the Cul1 mutant phenotype particularly difficult In contrast the induced expression of mCul1 in the wing disc does not compromise viability and it gives a distinctive graded phenotype well suited for the study of genetic modification While the basis for the dominant negative effect of mCul1 remains unknown it is important to recognize that inactivation of the endogenous Cul1 is incomplete so that a reduced level of Cul1 activity persists One likely explanation for the negative effect is that mCul1 overexpression leads to sequestration of some limiting SCF components into weakly active complexes This hypothesis is consistent with the fact that mCul1 retains some positive function in flies as revealed by its ability to prolong survival of dCul1 mutant flies J K H rich and P H O Farrell unpublished data The essentially complete suppression of the mCul1 phenotype by reduction of the genetic dose of E2F suggests a remarkable level of specificity in which among the many targets of Cul1 action the destruction of E2F appears to be particularly important Similarly limitations of Cul1 function in other organisms also uncovered the disproportionate importance of particular substrates For example Cul1 mutations in mice result in the accumulation of the SCF substrate cyclin E but not of p27 another well characterized SCF substrate 32 Among all of the substrates targeted for degradation by SCF in S cerevisiae it is the failure to degrade Sic1 that underlies the G1 arrest in cdc53 mutants 3 4 Thus different substrates of the SCF appear to have particularly high dependence on SCF activity in different biological contexts We suggest that our experimental context using mCul1 expression in the wing disc is particularly effective in exposing the involvement of SCF in E2F destruction Since SCF complexes function in conjunction with a variety of F box proteins that act as specificity factors mutations in individual F box proteins ought to affect particular subsets of SCF substrates In an extensive screen for loci that modify the reduction of function phenotype for Cul1 we identified the gene encoding the F box protein Slimb as a modifier and we failed to detect contributions of other F box encoding genes to the phenotype This implicates Slimb in the action of SCF on E2F Analysis of E2F levels revealed that cell cycle oscillations in E2F levels were absent when Slimb function was severely reduced Note that the severity of this E2F destruction phenotype in comparison to the mild defect in cell cycle programming of E2F destruction upon mCul1 expression is entirely consistent with the fact that the slimb mutant gives a stronger loss of function than the reduction of function imposed by mCul1 overexpression The absence of cell cycle oscillation in E2F presence in the slimb mutant suggests that SCF Slmbis responsible for targeting E2F for S phase destruction If this destruction is the consequence of direct action of SCF Slmbon E2F we would expect the F box protein to interact with E2F We confirmed this prediction by pull down experiments Furthermore we demonstrated that the interaction between Slimb and E2F is dependent on phosphorylation as expected for the interaction of F box proteins with their substrates We suggest that the S phase specificity of E2F destruction is regulated by a targeting phosphorylation event but we have not yet investigated this level of the regulation While SCF was previously implicated in the destruction of E2F 1 in mammals 20 this earlier study appears to focus on a distinct action of SCF The starting point for the analysis was an interaction between E2F 1 and Skp2 an F box protein that is not the mammalian homolog of Slimb Mutations of E2F 1 that disrupted this interaction increased E2F 1 stability in transfection experiments However there was no demonstration that this interaction was involved in or required for cell cycle oscillations in the level of E2F 1 Furthermore Skp2 knockout cells show no defect in E2F 1 degradation 21 and E2F 1 proteins unable to interact with Skp2 are still unstable 20 Our results implicate SCF Slmbrather than SCF Skp2in cell cycle specific destruction of E2F and argue that this regulation is critical for cell viability at least in flies As a unifying view we propose that Skp2 mediated control and Slimb mediated control of E2F activities occur at different times during the cell cycle and that SCF Slmbis responsible for the rapid destruction of E2F in S phase Since E2F is a positive regulator of the G1 S transition it is not clear why S phase destruction of E2F is required However we note that slimb mutant cells do not replicate DNA normally and the replication defect is correlated with an increase in E2F in individual cells This observation is consistent with previous reports indicating that E2F can limit DNA replication both in mammalian cells 16 and in flies 33 This enigmatic feature of E2F regulation suggests that its continued presence has a negative effect on DNA replication and indicates that we still have much to learn about its roles in cell cycle regulation SCF Slmbappears to influence other cell cycle events perhaps by actions on other substrates or perhaps as a result of events that are secondary to its influence on E2F destruction For example a slimb allele shows defects in centrosome duplication control 34 and slimb null cells undergo apoptosis 35 Both effects could be explained by a failure to inactivate E2F as E2F promotes centrosome duplication in mammalian cells 36 and E2F can induce apoptosis 12 13 A link between Slimb function and the RB E2F pathway of cell proliferation control is also suggested by the genetic interaction between the C elegans slimb ortholog lin 23 and the RBF ortholog lin 35 in which lin 35 function limits the severity of the loss of lin 23 37 Since RBF is an important modifier of E2F activity perhaps this interaction is a reflection of the action of both Lin 23 and Lin 35 on E2F However in our experimental situation we did not observe any modification of the mCul1 overexpression phenotype by mutations in either the RBF or DP gene two known partners of E2F This result suggests that these factors are not limiting factors in this situation or that E2F acts independently of RBF and DP The latter hypothesis is the most likely explanation for the lack of an RBF interaction for the following reason The E2F RBF complex has to be disrupted for E2F to drive cells into S phase and E2F degradation occurs after the G1 S phase transition which only happens after E2F has been released from its association with RBF According to this view we would predict that the mCul1 induced phenotype should be specifically sensitive to factors impinging on the elimination of E2F activity during S phase and factors involved in the unknown processes by which persistence of E2F has negative outcome Consequently this experimental system may provide an avenue for the genetic dissection of this mysterious facet of E2F function Conclusions To explore potential roles for Cul1 in cell cycle control in D melanogaster we overexpressed mouse Cul1 mCul1 in the wing imaginal disc We found that this overexpression has a dominant negative effect leading to a reduction in SCF function We used the resulting small wing phenotype in a modifier screen to identify mutations in cell cycle genes capable of dominantly modifying the mCul1 induced phenotype We found that E2F loss of function mutations were the strongest modifiers as they completely suppressed the phenotype The reduction in SCF function associated with mCul1 overexpression also correlated with a failure to downregulate E2F normally in S phase Additionally mutations in slimb that reduced the function of the F box protein Slimb enhanced the phenotype and led to persistence of E2F in S phase cells Finally this F box protein interacts with E2F in vitro These results indicate that an SCF Slmbcomplex is involved in regulating E2F activity during S phase Methods Identification of fly Cul1 and Skp1 orthologs We identified several lead ESTs in the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project database Sequencing of one of the corresponding cDNAs LD20253 obtained from Genome Systems Inc St Louis MO revealed that it encodes a protein with 61 identity to the mouse and human Cul1 proteins Expression of this cDNA in yeast is able to rescue the cdc53 1 mutation not shown indicating that the protein can perform at least some of the functions of the yeast Cul1 We used the same strategy to identify a Skp1 cDNA that also rescues skp1 mutations in yeast not shown Because the Drosophila genome contains several Skp1 like genes we call the fly Skp1 homologue dSkpA Stocks UAS mCul1 UAS dCul1 and UAS dSkpA were generated by subcloning the coding region of the corresponding cDNA in pUAST 38 The resulting vectors were then used to transform y 1w 67embryos The MS1096 stock is as described 39 The Cul1 allele k01207 22 will
