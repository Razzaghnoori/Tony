 October 1 1992 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name Since 1981 the Geography Department at IUPUI has graduated 67 geographers There have been so many changes to the IUPUI campus and your department that you and your fellow graduates might not recognize them A major development of national significance has provided much prestige to the IUPUI Geography Department The city of Indianapolis decided to develop a massive geographic information system GIS called Indianapolis Mapping and Geographic Infrastructure System IMAGIS in which the Geography Department and the University were invited to participate Four city agencies and four private corporations banded together with the university to develop an accurate multipurpose computer map of Marion County The university manages the consortium in exchange for the privilege of being able to carry out geographic teaching and research on the system The Laboratory of Applied Spatial Information Research LASIR was established as the university s interface with IMAGIs Faculty research and GIS courses are conducted in LASIR You might be interested in checking out the facilities Your department has been recognized by The National Geographic Society which has granted over 350 000 to be matched by state funds to develop geographic education in the state of Indiana The Geographic Education Network of Indiana Inc GENI manages the statewide project from the IUPUI Geography Department GENI organizes teacher workshops for K 12 teachers and assists them in developing geography teaching materials for classroom use GENI also promotes the expansion of geography in teacher training curriculums and in K 12 curriculums This year there are over 40 geography majors at IUPUI They must compete with hundreds of other students for limited financial aid For the first time however the department has received a 1000 gift to begin a scholarship fund to benefit geography students only 1000 is very generous but in order to preserve a scholarship it must be invested An endowment of 10 000 would allow the department to award needy geography majors small but very important scholarships every year You can help in several ways Most obviously you can make a personal gift to the IUPUI Geography Alumni Scholarship If 1000 seems like a lot please consider a gift in an amount you can afford Perhaps 100 is more to your liking or perhaps you would be interested in making several smaller gifts during the year Any contributions are tax deductible from both federal and Indiana state taxes Please send your contributions to the IU Foundation IUPUI Geography Department Scholarship Fund with the enclosed card in the self addressed envelope Please contact me if you have any questions Sincerely Rick Bein Chair P S Especially appealing for you and the department is the fact that a number of alumni work for companies that will match their gifts sometimes as much as three to one If you do and you make a gift of perhaps 50 your company s match could raise the value of your gift to 100 150 or 200 That makes a big difference in the amount available to establish a scholarship to benefit geography majors Enclosure
