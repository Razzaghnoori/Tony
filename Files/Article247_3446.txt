 The Reed Hendrix Syndrome and Other Rock Maladies Dear Chris You re right Surely I m in the advanced stages of Reed Hendrix Syndrome if I liked something it must have been the most esoteric thing on the album Your sharp demolition of Miller s Velvet Underground chapter and man oh man I would not like to be on the wrong end of your critical contempt convinces me that he suffers from a parallel syndrome Call it John Cale Brian Jones Glenn Matlock Disorder Except in the case of the Beatles where he s a convinced Lennonolater Miller seems compelled to place at center stage the lesser known members of any band He grants Mick Jagger only a marginal role in the early Stones Same with Johnny Rotten and the Sex Pistols Here Miller seems to be leaning too heavily on Jon Savage s Sex Pistols book of seven or eight years ago another rock history overstuffed with intellectual genealogy Savage attributes such Svengalian omnipotence to Malcolm McLaren and focuses so heavily on McLaren s intellectual antecedents from structuralism to the Situationist International that you could easily forget there was any band there at all Trying to deny Lou Reed any meaningful role in the Velvets as Miller does is a little tortured I m grateful to Miller for sticking up for Nico whom a lot of people dismiss as a rock stunt a kind of Eddie Gaedel but sexier of the downtown art world All Tomorrow s Parties haunts me as much as it did when I first heard it sometime during the Carter administration and I ll Be Your Mirror has some claim to be the Great Rock Love Song But if there s a lyrical voice to the Velvets it s Reed s particularly when he s in good humor Yes there are problems in these times But wooooo none of them are mine Miller is to be admired too for pointing out the role of texture in the Velvets best music Mo Tucker s drumming on Run Run Run is groundbreaking and Cale and Sterling Morrison on Heroin well what compares to them But it s Reed s song for goodness sake you could even call it his anthem and trying to give Cale all the credit for such things is like claiming A Day in the Life is a great piece of music by the London Symphony Orchestra One thing I wanted to raise with you before I sign off on this very pleasant week What did you think of Miller s reggae chapter which seems to make Jamaica stand for all of Foreign Rock In a book so preoccupied with intellectual ancestries Latin music seems to have gotten short shrift Not just La Bamba and Carlos Santana and Feliz Navidad but also such thoroughly Latin American songs as P S I Love You and Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow I have another more morals focused question about his treatment of reggae Miller describes Bob Marley s stance as uplifting unruliness and notes that when The Harder They Come set Jamaica s record for box office take it replaced The Sound of Music a musical that perfectly symbolizes the goody goody moralism that for better or worse reggae like rock and roll mocked ridiculed and beat into cultural retreat Did it Rock seems to have its own mile wide streak of goody goody moralism with some standouts like Janis Ian Jackson Browne and Bruce Hornsby who are nothing but After all we live as all smokers realize in an age of goody goody moralism So what is it in rock and roll that has allowed it to maintain its cultural pre eminence in such an age Someone ought to know After all If there s a rock n roll critics Heaven You know they got a hell of a Faculty Best Chris
