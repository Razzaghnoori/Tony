 Background Hypertension is a common medical problem in the United States occurring in as many as 43 million individuals 1 While end stage renal failure represents the second most common cause of end stage renal disease 2 perhaps only 1 in 2 500 hypertensive patients develops clinically important hypertensive nephrosclerosis This low frequency of end organ renal damage suggests a potential predisposition to this complication The inbred Dahl Rapp rat is a genetic model of salt sensitive hypertension 3 4 On a diet containing 8 0 NaCl young Dahl Rapp salt sensitive S rats rapidly and uniformly manifest low renin hypertension and die from hypertensive nephrosclerosis within weeks of institution of the high salt diet 5 The pathology is identical to human hypertensive renal disease and consists of arteriolosclerosis glomerulosclerosis and interstitial scarring with tubular cell dropout While other animal models of hypertension can be employed to study the pathogenesis of hypertension because of the rapid and reproducible development of renal failure S rats provide a unique means to investigate the pathogenesis of hypertensive nephrosclerosis In this respect this model is very useful in understanding hypertensive nephrosclerosis that occurs in human low renin hypertension especially in defined more homogeneous populations such as the black patients described by Grim and associates 6 Recent studies have shown that apoptosis was accentuated in kidneys of S rats during development of nephrosclerosis 7 These studies demonstrated increased numbers of TUNEL positive cells increased cytoplasmic nucleosome content and caspase 3 activation in kidneys of hypertensive S rats compared to normotensive Sprague Dawley control rats on the same high salt diet An increase in apoptosis rates in glomeruli and tubules was observed confirming a process that involved several different cell types in the kidney Apoptotic bodies were noted particularly in areas of glomerular sclerosis and in dilated tubules An increase in the number of PCNA stained cells was also demonstrated during the 21 day time frame but because renal function deteriorated renal failure correlated therefore positively with apoptosis and inversely with proliferation rates Thus the apoptotic process appeared to be a strong determinant of outcome in this model The Fas FasL system transmits apoptotic signals from the surrounding environment into the cell Fas contains a single transmembrane domain and belongs to the tumor necrosis factor TNF nerve growth factor family 8 FasL contains a single transmembrane domain and is also a member of the same TNF family 9 A soluble form of FasL has been described but appears to be less capable of inducing apoptosis when compared with the bound form 10 11 The binding of FasL with Fas initiates receptor oligomerization which recruits Fas associated death domain FADD 12 FADD binds procaspase 8 and permits activation of caspase 8 through self cleavage 13 Caspase 8 activates the effector caspases which commits the cell to the orderly process of apoptosis 14 15 In addition caspase 8 cleaves Bcl 2 interactive death agonist Bid 16 Truncated Bid localizes to the mitochondria and promotes cytochrome c release this process also serves as a major apoptotic signaling pathway for Fas 16 17 18 Depending upon the amount of caspase 8 that is activated the predominant pathway can be either Bid cleavage with subsequent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c or activation of the effector caspase pathway 18 Resident cells of the kidney express both Fas and FasL and Fas FasL signaling is functional in these cells 19 20 21 22 23 24 A recent review by Ortiz and associates 25 noted that the combined literature demonstrating participation of Fas FasL pathway in renal injury essentially fulfilled Koch s postulates In kidneys of S rats associated with apoptosis was a temporal increase in expression of Fas which was demonstrated using Western analysis of lysates of kidney cortex 7 The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the site of expression and potential functional significance of Fas and FasL in the kidneys of S rats during development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis Materials and Methods Animal preparation Studies were conducted using 40 male Dahl Rapp salt sensitive SS Jr termed S and 40 male Sprague Dawley SD rats initially 28 days of age obtained from Harlan Sprague Dawley Indianapolis IN The rats were housed under standard conditions and given a formulated diet AIN 76A Dyets Inc Bethlehem PA that contained either 0 3 or 8 0 NaCl These diets were prepared specifically to be identical in protein and electrolyte composition and differed only in NaCl and sucrose content Groups of S and SD rats on 0 3 and 8

Institute Cary NC A P value of 0 05 assigned statistical significance Results Kidneys of S and SD rats on both 0 3 and 8 0 NaCl diets were examined on days 7 and 21 The blood pressure responses to dietary salt intake of the Dahl Rapp S rat an experimental model of hypertensive nephrosclerosis and of the SD strain of rat have been published After seven days on the high salt diet S rats were hypertensive 146 2 mm Hg but had preserved renal morphology 5 By day 21 on the 8 0 NaCl diet the mean blood pressure increased to 169 7 mm Hg 7 27 28 Mean blood pressures of SD rats were not influenced by intake of salt over this time frame of study 118 4 mm Hg on the 8 0 NaCl diet compared to 115 4 mm Hg on the 0 3 NaCl diet In addition SD animals were healthy the intake of either diet was similar and they demonstrated no renal abnormalities 27 28 29 In the present study by day 21 the kidneys of S rats demonstrated significant vascular glomerular and tubulo interstitial injury TUNEL demonstrated apoptosis in glomerular and tubular compartments Fig 1 SD rats on both diets and S rats on 0 3 NaCl diet demonstrated by light microscopy no renal morphological alterations over the same period of study These findings were similar to previous publications from this laboratory 5 7 Using immunohistochemistry expression of Fas was increased specifically in kidneys of S rats on 8 0 NaCl diet by day 7 Fig 2 Staining was inhibited when the anti Fas antibody was pre incubated with recombinant soluble Fas Fig 2Eand 2J Quantification analysis comparing the four groups of rats in the study showed that expression of Fas in glomerular and tubular cells was greatest P 0 05 in kidneys of S rats exposed to the 8 0 NaCl diet for 7 and 21 days Fig 3 Comparing animals on the two diets for the same duration dietary salt did not alter Fas expression in kidneys of SD rats The increase in Fas expression in kidneys of S rats on the 8 0 NaCl diet was observed in cells in the glomeruli tubules and arteries Fig 4A B C Cytoplasmic staining was particularly apparent in these samples Over the same time period FasL expression was also examined Fig 5A B C D E F G H I J The anti FasL antibody labeled cells in both glomerular and tubular compartments but expression was more subtle than Fas particularly in the glomeruli Quantification of these observations showed an increase in expression of FasL in both glomerular and tubular compartments of kidneys of S rats on the 8 0 NaCl diet compared with the other three groups Fig 6 Again dietary salt did not alter glomerular and tubular expression of FasL in kidneys of SD rats Tubular epithelial cell expression of FasL appeared to be predominantly apical Fig 4Dand 4E although cytoplasmic staining was also observed particularly in cells of S rats on the 8 0 NaCl diet In addition some tubular epithelial cells of kidneys from S rats on 8 0 NaCl diet for 21 days appeared to express both Fas and FasL Fig 4F Gand 4H To determine whether the Fas FasL apoptotic pathway was active Western blotting of renal cortical lysates was performed using an antibody that recognized both procaspase 8 and the active form of caspase 8 In these experiments active caspase 8 was demonstrated in lysates from renal cortex of S rats on 8 0 NaCl diet for three weeks Fig 7 Active caspase 8 was not demonstrated in samples from rats on the diet for 7 days data not shown Tissue was also examined for cleavage of Bid which was identified specifically in lysates from renal cortex obtained from S rats on 8 0 NaCl diet for three weeks Fig 7 Discussion Recent evidence suggests that apoptosis is involved in several pathological processes in the lung 30 31 32 and kidney 33 34 35 36 37 Using the Dahl Rapp salt sensitive S rat which develops hypertensive nephrosclerosis that resembles the human disease process 5 this laboratory demonstrated an early and inappropriate apoptotic process that occurred in both glomerular and tubular compartments of the kidneys and correlated with the decline in glomerular filtration rate Apoptosis can be significant particularly three weeks into the course of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in this model Figure 1 A previous study used RNase protection assay and Western blotting to demonstrate an increase in Fas expression in kidney cortex of hypertensive S rats These findings were observed by day 21 of study 7 The present series of experiments demonstrated the diffuse sites of expression of Fas and FasL in the kidney and explored further the possibility that the Fas FasL pathway was active during the development of hypertensive renal disease in this rodent model of hypertension Expression of both Fas and FasL was observed in kidneys of both SD and S rats but specifically increased over time in hypertensive S rats Associated with the increased expression was cleavage of procaspase 8 to produce the active enzyme and cleavage of Bid indicating activation of the Fas FasL apoptotic pathway in the course of progressive renal failure These data along with the previous studies that confirmed morphological evidence of apoptosis and biochemical evidence of caspase 3 activation in these kidneys 7 showed a role for the Fas FasL pathway in promoting the loss of kidney function that develops in the setting of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in this model The mechanism of augmented Fas and FasL expression in kidneys of hypertensive S rats is uncertain In addition to apoptotic signaling the Fas FasL system may also be involved in proliferation Hueber et al showed that Fas might promote T cell proliferation by modulating release of calcium from intracellular stores 38 FasL is anti proliferative by regulating cell cycle progression 39 Previous studies demonstrated an increase in cell proliferation rates in kidneys of S rats on the high salt diet 7 so it is possible that Fas and FasL may play a role in control of proliferation Another potential explanation is tissue hypoxia which has been suggested to upregulate Fas in the kidney 36 37 MDCK cells in culture demonstrated increased expression of Fas FasL and FADD in response to partial ATP depletion 40 Fas and FasL expression in the kidney may serve as indicators of cellular stress Tissue hypoxia therefore remains a possible mechanism of increased expression of Fas and FasL although it seems less likely that the arteriolosclerosis that developed in S kidneys was severe enough to produce hypoxic conditions sufficient to up regulate Fas until the third week of study Increased expression of Fas and FasL appeared to increase the propensity to undergo apoptosis but was not the sole determinant of this process Despite the increase in expression of Fas and FasL at day 7 of study caspase 8 activation and Bid cleavage were not observed Fas FasL mediated apoptotic signaling is modulated by other intracellular factors Induction of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins IAP is one such mechanism 41 42 43 In vascular smooth muscle cells surface expression of Fas 44 and molecules involved in signaling the apoptotic process such as caspase 8 and caspase 3 appear to be regulated and provide another level of cellular control of apoptosis 45 However the potential anti apoptotic mechanisms present early in the course were ineffective by day 21 when caspase 8 activation was evident A previous study suggested that the apoptotic process occurred early in the development of hypertension in this model 26 so the data suggested that an apoptotic mechanism in addition to activation of the Fas FasL pathway is also involved in development of hypertensive nephrosclerosis in S rats In conclusion kidneys of S rats have been shown to be very sensitive to hypertensive injury which is mediated at least in part by the apoptotic mechanism controlled by Fas Augmented expression of both Fas and FasL by glomerular and tubular cells resulted in caspase 8 activation The pronounced increases in Fas and FasL expression and activation of this pathway by the third week of study also correlated with previous evidence that documented irreversibility of the renal injury if the hypertension was not corrected by this time 5 These data supported the view that the Fas FasL pathway promoted nephrosclerosis in this model Activation of the Fas FasL pathway may also serve as a mechanism of tubular epithelial cell loss and interstitial fibrosis which are also prominent renal features of hypertension The role of the Fas FasL pathway in human hypertensive nephrosclerosis remains to be determined Abbreviations SD Sprague
