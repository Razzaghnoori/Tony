        okay       have you been able to enjoy some family reunions in the past that youd like to discuss or   um yes i have a very large family i have seven brothers and sisters   wow thats a thats great   and being next to the youngest we all have almost all are married and all have children so its quite a feat to get everyone together but   umhum i imagine it would be with seven seven brothers and sisters   um  what we did one year  was for my fathers seventy fifth birthday   we oh how nice   we went out to dinner of course and we had cake and champagne and then we went back to his house and we reenacted some of the things we remembered him doing when he was when we were little   oh okay   you know like we always had to take off his shoes and socks so you know one of us did that and     uhhuh   and he used to tease us about he would he was gonna clean his shotgun when out on the front porch when we were gonna go out on dates or   uhhuh   he was gonna threaten to kill the um Easter Bunny or Santa Claus you know   oh dear oh dear   and so one of us dressed up and and got the old shotgun and you know course it was empty nobody uses it but brought that upstairs and   i hope so not   and so it was really funny he really enjoyed it and and all the rest of us did too because we spent a couple hours talking about it afterwards and adding more things wed forgotten so   uhhuh ill bet he really enjoyed that   was really yeah he did   well thats fantastic thats fantastic did   and how about you   well we uh were all scattered around the country i have a brother in Chicago one in Cleveland i have two in Germany and my sister were from a large family also my sisters pretty close to my parents and uh my wife and i luckily came from the same hometown   oh   and her her family is scattered all over also so what we try an to do when we have family reunions we schedule at the same time every year   uhhuh   and we all kind of migrate back to where Mom and Dad are from  which is in uh northern Utah and   uhhuh   so we kind of make sure that we schedule it the same time and we all head back about that same time and things that we do to make it memorable are that we go to a a resort either go water skiing horseback riding we make it a a week long affair and uh have a real nice vacation another reunion we do is uh at Christmas time this is something that a tradition that my grandparents started and we all get together around Christmas time the first Saturday the Saturday right before Christmas unless its either Christmas Eve or a day or two before and thats uh the week prior to that and uh the amazing thing is weve had the same Santa Claus and his wife have come for the last twenty six years   oh boy   and so you know growing up as a kid that was always Santa Claus and he was the same Santa Claus year after year after year and it really made a very very pleasant and memorable and we all exchanged gifts as as family and and we got to a point where were all growing growing up and we decided to have white elephant so  excuse me i think one of the the main thing is just being able to get together and coordinate everyones schedule   oh     that uh i find somewhat frustrating and and hectic but as long as weve uh announced it ahead of time and sent out flyers and and let everyone know when were going to get together and what well be doing its its always been very very fun and ive always enjoyed it and uh were very family oriented people and uh that uh makes it more special or more interesting especially when you have family from you know scattered all over the world when you can get together and discuss how their lives are and the different parts of the country too   uhhuh oh i think thats wonderful my family is all over the United States as well and we  are not as fortunate as to be able to get together even once a year   so   uhhuh   i  i moved here about eleven months ago and this is the closest ive been to most of my family for years i hadnt seen my sister in Austin for five years   wow   so  i know its really awful because we were mostly there are six girls and two boys in my family and so naturally we got then all got moved off somewhere   wow yes yes well were   i think its wonderful you get together once a year   its its not always easy but its uh its very memorable memorable boy i bet thats hard because i imagine that as a large family you were very close and and uh had a lot of fun as family   yes we really did we grew up on a farm and so you had to play with each other because there was no one else around so we played and fought and everything   so oh yes so you got to
