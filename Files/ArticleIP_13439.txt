 Clinton in the Senate Dock Commonly described in headlines as the trial of the century the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton received massive coverage around the world Friday with journalists clearly under strain to find anything new to say about the president s troubles The angles varied widely from paper to paper An editorial in the Jerusalem Post compared the impeachment in the United States with Israel s current political turmoil and said that I n both nations people are getting frustrated with political systems that have become obsessed with themselves and wish that what they see as unseemly distractions will be quickly over In Paris the conservative Le Figaro repeated the usual French view that Flytrap is a symptom of demented American puritanism Wake up Tocqueville they ve gone mad began a front page editorial signed by Franz Olivier Giesbert When one observes the depressing spectacle presented by American democracy today one imagines that the man who talked best about it cannot be feeling very well in his heaven There is decidedly something rotten in the kingdom of democracy The American obsession with truth and purity has turned morbid and demanding of psychoanalysis It is even endangering the whole political system In Tokyo the Japan Times said the impeachment drama had been sordid and embarrassing lending itself to the worst sort of moralistic posturing and inevitable charges of hypocrisy and opportunism It went on It has ended or done serious damage to several once promising political careers For all his accomplishments Mr Clinton s legacy has been permanently stained The British broadsheets strove for originality in their front page headlines The Daily Telegraph s was They came in two by two to call for Clinton s head over a picture of the House prosecutors arriving in the Senate The Independent s was Judge in Black is sworn in for trial of century focussing on Chief Justice William Rehnquist s funereal garb The Guardian s was weirder still A moment of history to connect Andrew 1868 with Strom 96 was what it said Only the Times of London was content with a normal headline The President goes on trial The paper s main editorial Friday was not about the impeachment process but about a new revelation that Britain s D Day commander and military hero Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery had referred 50 years ago to the African as a complete savage whose only hope would be a British colonial master plan to carve out giant West Central and East African federations and unlock their vast wealth for Britain s benefit Had Monty won Britain would have imposed an indefensible and unsustainable version of apartheid the paper said But it concluded that the sobering fact remains that Africans today are poorer than they were when Montgomery unveiled his plan Two continental European papers indulged their frequent penchant for interviews with American historians on current political questions On Friday the Corriere della Sera of Milan Italy interviewed Professor Arthur Schlesinger Jr who said that even if the impeachment of Clinton didn t succeed its effect in weakening the institution of the presidency will continue to be felt for generations In Le Monde of Paris the historian Fred Greenstein of Princeton University said nobody apart from hezbollah Republicans wanted the impeachment trial to continue beyond mid February or for witnesses to be called But Clinton had generated an almost paranoiac fury among right wing extremists who hate and despise him and for whom he personifies the permissive generation of the Vietnam war In Canada the new conservative national paper the National Post commented Friday that despite its show of serene confidence a trial will end in victory for Mr Clinton and disaster for his opponents the White House was in reality on the edge of panic This was because this impeachment trial requires the White House to argue two tough even incredible propositions first the president did not perjure himself and did not obstruct justice second that even if he did perjury and obstruction are not grounds for impeachment if they are committed in the context of sex The paper asked Can Mr Clinton trust the Democratic senators most of whom don t like him much to go on repeating these unconvincing lines week after week month after month In Australia the Sydney Morning Herald called it Clinton s Trial by Chaos and said in a commentary by its Washington correspondent that beyond the elaborate facade of formality the opening of the trial of William Jefferson Clinton was more reminiscent of a football scrum in a particularly vicious game The papers said It is like a parody of an end of the millennium crisis Can the world s greatest power really be reduced to this a serious legal argument in front of the Senate about such issues as whether Bill Clinton did indeed touch Monica Lewinsky s breasts and genitals The Sydney Morning Herald also carried an interview Friday with Richard Butler in which the Australian weapons inspector conceded that intelligence gathered in Iraq by his UNSCOM team might have been secretly passed to the United States The idea that somehow products of our work could be diverted to other purposes is theoretically tenable he said but I have no knowledge of that
