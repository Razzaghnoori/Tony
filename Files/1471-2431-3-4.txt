 Background Hospital based intervention programs maternity ward practices and the feeding preferences of health care providers doctors lactation counselors nurses may affect breastfeeding behavior 1 2 3 4 5 6 Interventions to increase exclusive and any breastfeeding may also result in lower morbidity rates 5 7 Observational results concerning the effect of information from health care personnel in a non trial setting are more ambiguous 8 9 In an early meta analysis by Bernard Bonnin and colleagues 10 nursing support without phone follow up did not have a statistically significant effect on breastfeeding duration The infant s father and other relatives may also play important roles in supporting and favoring breastfeeding 9 11 12 13 Several studies have looked at the content of infant feeding information from the perspective of medical professionals 14 15 but fewer studies have asked the mothers if and when they received breastfeeding information 16 A literature search failed to identify any study that correlates information about breastfeeding in a non trial setting with feeding patterns including the use of colostrum and prelacteal food In Bolivia the exclusive breastfeeding rate in infants under 4 months of age was found to be above 50 with 13 6 of infants still being exclusively breastfed at 6 9 months of age 17 In a second study only 30 of infants in Bolivia had begun receiving solid foods by 4 months of age 18 Although several studies have dealt with infant feeding and infant and maternal health 18 19 20 21 22 23 to the author s knowledge there are no data on the relationship between attitudes towards breastfeeding and information about breastfeeding and the actual breastfeeding pattern in this country The main objective of the present study was therefore to investigate the relationship between the attitudes of the mother and her family towards breastfeeding and the actual feeding pattern in a Bolivian population A second objective was to study the relationship between breastfeeding information specified according to source and timing and feeding pattern Methods Study area This study took place in La Paz Bolivia The interviews were conducted in consultant rooms waiting halls and maternity wards of four hospitals Del Nino 20 De Octubre San Gabriel and Obrero Study population Bolivian mothers with an infant 1 year of age were eligible for this cross sectional study The mothers lived in the La Paz urban area or in villages within a four hour bus ride from the city This study was part of a larger study on infant feeding n 518 infants Subjects interviewed about attitudes n max 502 or about breastfeeding information n max 420 did not differ with regard to educational level social class or ethnicity from the mothers in the larger study who were not asked about attitudes breastfeeding information The questions on breastfeeding information were added at a stage when a number of women already had entered the study hence the smaller number of mothers answering questions about breastfeeding information Ten women declined to participate mainly because of insufficient ability to speak Spanish The mothers were between 13 and 45 years of age mean 25 6 5 9 standard deviation SD years and 62 of the total number were teenagers Practically all the mothers were urban dwellers and the majority were Catholic Table 1 The mean age of the infants was 4 3 3 6 SD months median 4 months with many infants below the age of one month n 163 and fewer aged 10 months n 21 11 months n 10 or 12 months n 22 Interviews The author interviewed all the mothers and filled in the questionnaires in Spanish No interpreter was used The mothers were interviewed as they entered the hospital or in some cases while waiting for a visit with a doctor The mother s attitude to breastfeeding was evaluated by posing the question What is your opinion about breastfeeding The mother was then offered five alternatives presented in a random order very bad bad neutral good very good When asked to describe the attitudes of their family the interviewed mothers were offered four alternatives in random order negative indifferent positive or do not know Hence the attitudes of persons in the mother s social network were not determined directly but were reported by the mother based on her perceptions of their attitudes Information about breastfeeding was assessed by posing the question Have you received information about the advantages of breastfeeding from a doctor nurse other family member neighbor television radio or newspapers magazines books If the mother gave a positive answer regarding any of these sources she was then asked if and when she had first received breastfeeding information from each source and was given three alternatives before the birth of the child on the maternity ward or after leaving the maternity ward Definitions Exclusive breastfeeding was defined as not giving anything else besides breast milk at the time of the interview The maximum intake of non breast milk fluid in the past week that was allowed in this definition of exclusive breastfeeding was set at 3 cucharillas teaspoons or 1 cuchara larger spoon or 1 2 fluid ounce Except for this amount of fluid and for prelacteal food the absence of previous complementary foods or more supplementary fluids than the above weekly amount since birth was demanded for proof of exclusive breastfeeding In those cases where the weekly intake of food fluid could not be specified the end of exclusive breastfeeding was set at the date of introduction of the food fluid in question The provision of vitamins did not preclude exclusive breastfeeding Hence the definition of exclusive breastfeeding used in this study differs from that suggested by Labbok et al 24 In all analyses of exclusive breastfeeding in the current paper a since birth perspective has been used Any breastfeeding included exclusive predominant and partial breastfeeding 24 Colostrum was defined as the breast milk produced in the first five days after delivery Prelacteal food was defined as food given to the child before breastfeeding had been initiated Ethics The study was approved by the hospital directors of the four hospitals after they were informed about its content and objectives All participants gave their informed consent The interviews were conducted without the identities of the interviewed mothers being recorded or revealed Statistics The statistics program StatView 5 0 SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA was used for analysis of the data The significance level was set at p 0 05 with exceptions described below In all regression analyses the number of independent variables was lower than the number of individuals 10 as recommended by Altman 25 Independent variables were dichotomized in order to generate odds ratios and hazard ratios Mothers were divided according to median age 25 yr or 25 yr 251 vs 251 educational level 5 years of education vs 5 years 179 vs 321 and religious affiliation Catholics vs non Catholics 384 vs 115 Five years of education meant not having entered the intermedio stage of education Bolivian education is divided according to the stages basico 5 years intermedio 3 years medio 4 years and then university studies Social class was assessed by the interviewer on the basis of the mother s answers to the socioeconomic questions her language and appearance the work of her partner and her area of residence lower 150 middle 267 upper 40 The results of the social class assessment were based on an overall assessment and not on a weighting of the variables In the regression analyses mothers from the middle and upper classes were analyzed together in comparison with lower class mothers Mothers who failed to read a sentence out loud in Spanish from daily life were classified as illiterate 25 493 In this study Latin ethnicity indicates European ancestry n 191 while native ethnicity is predominant in the indigenous population n 264 A number of women were of mixed origin but were nevertheless classified as either Latin or Native Work was defined as gainful employment yielding an income on a regular basis Mothers were not asked to specify the duration of their work Determinants of maternal attitudes towards breastfeeding When studying determinants of maternal attitudes towards breastfeeding univariate analyses of attitude vs ten independent variables were first carried out Table 3 All independent variables with a p 0 20 were included in a multivariate model initial model see Table 3 Elimination of non significant variables was then undertaken using backward stepwise logistic regression until all remaining independent variables had a p 0 05 Final model see Table 3 In the initial model educational level but not literacy was kept in the model since the two variables were regarded as similar The backward stepwise mode was used to avoid exclusion of non significant variables that affected the model fitness 25 Factors associated with the timing of breastfeeding information For each source of information odds ratios or hazard ratios were calculated for two circumstances A any breastfeeding information vs no breastfeeding information and B breastfeeding information before birth vs breastfeeding information after birth or no breastfeeding information women informed for the first time on the maternity ward were excluded in B In the case of health care related information and doctor mediated information this paper also presents determinants for C breastfeeding information given before birth or on the maternity ward vs after the maternity ward or no information received Eight independent variables were correlated with each information source age of mother urban rural residence religious affiliation social class ethnicity educational level work living with the infant s father data in this section were obtained be means of univariate analyses In order to minimize the risk of mass significance a modified Bonferroni correction n number of comparisons was applied to this section of the results and only p values 0 00625 were regarded statistically significant 26 Therefore there are results with a 95 confidence interval for odds ratios 95 CI OR not including 1 00 that are not presented A p value of 0 00625 was also used to assess statistical significance in the analyses of knowledge about breastfeeding Feeding pattern Selection of independent variables The main purpose of the analyses in Tables 4and 7was to study the association between attitude breastfeeding information and feeding pattern and not to create predictive models for the feeding pattern as opposed to the analyses of determinants of maternal attitude see Table 3 Inclusion of non significant variables in a regression model affects the adjusted difference or AOR Adjusted Odds Ratio of other independent variables very little The purpose of the analyses of feeding patterns was to present the AOR for one variable attitude information about breastfeeding For that reason neither backward nor forward elimination of variables was carried out in these analyses the AORs originate from the initial complete model In all analyses of maternal attitude and feeding pattern the attitudes good n 272 and neutral n 1 were collapsed into one group and then compared with very good n 229 Results Background data The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 3 months Kaplan Meier Most mothers had given their infant colostrum while 1 in every 6

mothers 461 498 mentioned at least one advantage Most frequently mentioned were nutrition 318 498 63 9 defense against infectious diseases 309 498 62 0 and practical aspects 73 498 14 7 Economic

were able to mention at least one advantage of breastfeeding had been informed about breastfeeding to a greater extent than other mothers information from anyone from a medical doctor from neighbors from television from newspapers magazines books Most women did not report any disadvantages of breastfeeding 448 491 91 2 However fifteen mothers mentioned transmission of diseases 3 1 and eleven mothers 2 2 said breastfeeding made it difficult for the mother to work outside the home Breastfeeding information Sources of breastfeeding information Irrespective of the source of information 91 9 386 420 of the women had been informed about breastfeeding before the birth of their present child Table 5 Eleven mothers 2 6 had never received such information Out of 420 mothers 250 59 5 had received information about breastfeeding from either a doctor or a nurse before the birth of the infant Seventy mothers were first informed on the maternity ward 16 7 and seventy three mothers 17 4 had never been informed about breastfeeding Most mothers had been informed by a doctor before the birth of their child The most common sources of information about breastfeeding before birth were television 303 420 and the family 280 420 Table 5 Factors associated with the timing of breastfeeding information Mothers with more than five years of education of Latin ethnicity or with a middle upper class background were in general more often informed about breastfeeding Table 6 This was true irrespective of the timing of information Mothers living in urban areas and mothers living with the infant s father also reported having been informed about breastfeeding more often than other women Adjusting for multiple comparisons no independent variable correlated with breastfeeding information from a nurse a neighbor or the radio Mode of providing information The predominant mode of breastfeeding information provided by health care was verbal 313 418 74 9 while 110 of 418 mothers had been informed through pamphlets 26 3 Other channels of information included films videos 74 418 17 7 and posters 33 418 7 9 Breastfeeding information and feeding pattern Information about breastfeeding irrespective of source and time relationship to the birth was associated with avoidance of prelacteal foods Table 7 When adjusting for pre specified confounders use of prelacteal foods was less often reported by mothers who had received initial breastfeeding information before the infant s birth or on the maternity ward vs after birth or not having received any information at the time of the interview Breastfeeding information given before birth or on the maternity ward by either a doctor or a nurse was associated with an avoidance of prelacteal foods and a longer exclusive breastfeeding duration Crude analysis censored 156 417 Adjusted analysis censored 143 384 Table 7 Doctor mediated breastfeeding information given before birth or on the maternity ward was associated with giving colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal foods Table 7 Televised breastfeeding information correlated with avoidance of prelacteal foods Table 7 Discussion Strengths and weaknesses of the study All the interviews in this study were conducted by the author and this should have ensured a consistent technique and interpretation of the answers A number of interviews were interrupted and certain questions were not answered by all women The interruptions occurred at all four hospitals and were not limited to a certain socioeconomic group Nevertheless bias cannot be excluded and the results should be interpreted with caution In the mid 1990s 93 of infants in the urban areas of Bolivia received at least one vaccination 28 Although the hospital visits of most infants were for the purpose of regular check ups and vaccinations a number of infants were seen because of illness Hence in the present study bias in the sample cannot be excluded There is a risk that the reasons for the visits were associated with feeding patterns 29 Some mothers may also have been worried and the fact that such feelings may have affected the reliability of their answers cannot be excluded The attitudes of the infant s father and grandmother and the mother s sisters brothers were reported by the mother These answers may have differed from the true opinions of the infant s father grandmother etc 30 However it seems unlikely that such discrepancies have affected the results since maternal feeding behavior is influenced by what the mother perceives as the attitude of her partner or of her own mother Social class and ethnicity were assessed by the author No weighting was used The use of a formal index for social status such as the Hollingshead ISP Index of Social Position would have improved the study The intake of three teaspoons of fluid per week and the use of prelacteal food were allowed under the definition of exclusive breastfeeding in the present paper An average of less than half a teaspoon a day of fluid would not be expected to contribute to the actual nutrition of the child and was hence accepted in the definition of exclusive breastfeeding At the time of study the WHO accepted drops and syrups in their definition of exclusive breastfeeding page 3 http www who int child adolescent health New_Publications NUTRITION who_cdd_ser_91 14 PDF It was the author s impression that prelacteal foods were seldom given for nutritional reasons but rather as a matter of tradition This was a cross sectional and retrospective study not a clinical trial and for that reason the content of breastfeeding information was not checked In a recent study from the United States the majority of pediatricians were unfamiliar with the content of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative 15 and two thirds of the doctors did not make specific recommendations on the duration of breastfeeding 15 Any strategy aiming to decrease the use of prelacteal foods and to increase the use of colostrum and the duration of exclusive breastfeeding must take both the timing and the content of breastfeeding information into consideration The mothers were asked at what stage they had first been informed about breastfeeding This means that the extent to which mothers answering before birth had also received information on the maternity ward or after leaving the maternity ward is uncertain The fact that duration of exclusive breastfeeding use of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal food were linked to health care related information before birth or on the maternity ward but not to before birth may indicate that we should focus our efforts on informing mothers about breastfeeding on the maternity ward Future studies may choose to approach the issue of timing in a different manner The same potential confounders were used in all regression analyses of the relationship between attitudes towards and information about breastfeeding and feeding pattern This was done in order to inhibit the risk of data torturing This study was based on interview data Feeding data have not been confirmed through direct observation or other validation and there is an obvious risk of recall bias However the data on the rate of exclusive breastfeeding at various ages for example show a good correlation with those from the preceding Bolivian Demographic and Health Enquiry Data not shown 31 Main findings Almost all mothers thought breastfeeding was good or very good This is not surprising since two thirds of the mothers spontaneously mentioned the nutritional and immunological properties of breast milk when asked if they knew of any advantages of breastfeeding According to the mothers in more than 90 of cases the infant s father and grandmother were both positive toward breastfeeding Latin ethnicity and middle upper class mothers were three times more likely than other mothers to report that breastfeeding was very good This could either be due to better knowledge of breastfeeding advantages or to a different use of language In this study both Latin origin and middle upper class background were strongly linked to having been informed about breastfeeding by someone and both variables correlated with mentioning advantages of breast milk A third factor of seeming importance regarding access to information was level of education Educational level was also the only remaining independent variable in a stepwise regression analysis of determinants for knowledge of breastfeeding advantages In richer countries a high educational level may translate into longer breastfeeding duration The data did not support a link between attitude of the mother and duration of exclusive breastfeeding Maternal attitude has otherwise been shown to be an important predictor of the breastfeeding decision 32 33 One reason for the surprising results may be that Latin ethnicity although linked to a very positive attitude towards breastfeeding has also been linked to a shorter duration of exclusive breastfeeding unpublished data In many developing countries affluent groups have lower breastfeeding rates 34 A second reason could be the way attitude was defined in the present study Losch and colleagues 35 describe attitude as intention to breastfeed while Scott and colleagues 36 define it as feeding preference A third reason could be the measurement of maternal attitudes A multiattribute utility questionnaire such as the one used by Dungy et al might have yielded different results 37 No breastfeeding parameter correlated with the attitude of the infant s father or grandmother and this is in contrast to studies from other countries 9 12 36 38 Almost all partners and grandmothers in this study were reported to be positive toward breastfeeding and the lack of negative or neutral attitudes towards breastfeeding diminishes the chances to link attitude to feeding behavior Lay support for breastfeeding probably results in a longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding 6 It must however be emphasized that the cited meta analysis by Sikorski and colleagues 6 was based on randomized and quasi randomized trials in which even lay persons had undergone breastfeeding counseling lactation management courses Although partners and grandmothers in Bolivia may have an influence on feeding decisions because of their emotional importance to the mothers it is unlikely that they will exert much effect through the transmission of facts Hence the results of the present study do not support Losch and colleagues 35 in their recommendation that information be targeted not only at mothers but also at other individuals such as fathers Such measures may not influence infant feeding patterns in Bolivia Sixty three percent of the women in the present study reported that health care personnel had informed them about breastfeeding This figure offers a different perspective than studies reviewing the extent to which medical professionals claim to take up issues concerning breastfeeding with pregnant women 14 15 The unequal distribution of health care mediated information found among Bolivian women indicates a structural problem especially since only information mediated by health care personnel doctor or doctor nurse influenced the actual duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the use of prelacteal food and colostrum The correlation between professional information support and exclusive breastfeeding duration is in line with a recent Cochrane report in which the relative risk for stopping exclusive breastfeeding before the final study assessment was significantly lower among women receiving professional support 95 CI relative risk 0 69 0 89 6 The use of colostrum and avoidance of prelacteal foods are cornerstones in early infant nutrition and may be prerequisites for the establishment of future exclusive breastfeeding Resources must be made available to enable health care personnel to inform all Bolivian women about breastfeeding This is especially important in a poor area of the world where the prevalence of gastroenteritis is high 39 Numerous studies have shown a protective effect of breastfeeding in relation to infectious diarrhea 5 40 On the basis of this study it is reasonable to advocate that in Bolivia breastfeeding information should be supplied before birth or perhaps even more importantly on the maternity ward Intervention with antenatal breastfeeding support seems to have less effect on breastfeeding rates than trials offering only postnatal support 6 In that context the observation by Reiff and colleagues 8 that health care personnel may exert a stronger influence on mothers infant feeding practices with nonverbal teaching the hospital modeling of infant formula products than with verbal teaching is important Breastfeeding promotion programs on a maternity ward setting should include more than just verbal information e g rooming in breastfeeding assistance and talks during hospitalization The maternity ward may also provide mothers with a place to exchange ideas and experiences among themselves as well as to solve breastfeeding problems Conclusions In conclusion the results of this study indicate that breastfeeding information delivered by health care personnel in a non trial setting may influence the infant feeding pattern including the use of prelacteal foods and colostrum This study does not present any evidence indicating that the attitudes of the mother or the infant s father or grandmother influence actual feeding behavior However this is a cross sectional and retrospective study with a risk for recall bias and data need to be confirmed in a longitudinal study in which the timing and content of the information are taken into consideration List of abbreviations used Adj adjusted AOR adjusted odds ratio Bf breastfeeding CI confidence interval Excl exclusive OR odds ratio SD standard deviation Competing
