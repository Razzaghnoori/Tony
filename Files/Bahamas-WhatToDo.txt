 What to Do Shopping What to Buy Crafts Bahamians have always had to fend for themselves and this resourcefulness has led them to become proficient at a number of practical handicrafts many of which make beautiful souvenirs Straw goods are the most ubiquitous The Seminole Indians of Red Bay on Andros are said to produce the finest work on the Bahamas though each island has its own individual patterns and differences in style It is still possible to watch the women at work on the islands of Andros and at George Town on Exuma Straw work can be bought from small workshops in people s homes or from the better quality straw vendors in Nassau Prices can be high but even small bowls make beautiful and practical reminders of your trip The handmade pieces are likely to become rare within a couple of generations because so few young Bahamian women are now taking up the craft Be aware that much of the straw work particularly the mass market goods like hats and bags is not made in the Bahamas but in Taiwan and China If you want to be sure of getting genuine Bahamian straw work buy from places such as The Plait Lady who has a shop on Bay Street in Nassau you ll have to pay a little more but you ll be sure you re getting an authentic handmade work of art Paintings and art work with scenes of everyday life also make beautiful mementos The work of a number of artists including Alton Lowe and Eddie Minnis is becoming very collectable and prices can be high On the other end of the scale street art including things like driftwood paintings can be fun and much more affordable Wood carvings are made from a variety of native trees Some of the best are made from the lignum vitae the Bahamian national tree and from the wild tamarind The carvings come in a bewildering variety though animal and fish motifs seem to predominate Always check a piece thoroughly before you buy as they are vary in quality Don t buy wood if it looks green this usually means the wood has not been allowed to season and it may split as it dries Seashells and sponges can be found in every market and souvenir shop in the Bahamas They make beautiful natural souvenirs but some may come from protected species Do not buy coral or turtle products as this is illegal and only encourages further damage to these delicate and rare forms of sea life Clothing If you like you could take an empty bag and buy your holiday wardrobe when you arrive in the Bahamas Many of the shops on Bay Street at the International Bazaar and the Port Lucaya Market Place offer beachwear and T shirts galore Sarongs printed dresses and shirts in light fabrics are sold in almost every craft stall in the straw markets Light cotton Androsia clothing made on Andros is perfect for the Bahamian climate you ll

from the understated to the extremely flamboyant Duty free luxury goods Both New Providence and Grand Bahama have a good range of luxury duty free goods for sale The shops tend to be clustered together which makes it easy to compare prices and quality before you buy in Nassau you ll find them on Bay Street and in the International Bazaar and in the Port Lucaya Market on Grand Bahama Things to keep an eye out for include gold and silver jewelry and such gem stones as diamonds sapphires and emeralds set in gold from Christian Dior and other leading designers Abaco Gold is a range of jewelry designed and sold only in the Bahamas and unusual pieces such as rare gold and silver coins brought from treasure found on the seabed and mounted in gold to be worn as pendants or brooches If it s time for a new timepiece you can choose from a comprehensive range of watches by names such as Rolex Breitling and Tag Hauer Fragrances from around the world fine crystal and European leather goods are also on display in most of the shops Duty free shops will make claims that they save you 30 40 percent on prices you d pay back home but this is not universally true and it s always important to so some research on prices in your hometown before you go Some goods are only slightly cheaper than back home doing a little homework before hand will help you sniff out the real bargains
