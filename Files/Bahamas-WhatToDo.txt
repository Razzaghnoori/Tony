What to DoShoppingWhat to BuyCrafts Bahamians have always had to fend for themselves and this resourcefulness has led them to become proficient at a number of practical handicrafts many of which make beautiful souvenirs Straw goods are the most ubiquitous The Seminole Indians of Red Bay on Andros are said to produce the finest work on the Bahamas though each island has its own individual patterns and differences in style It is still possible to watch the women at work on the islands of Andros and at George Town on Exuma Straw work can be bought from small workshops in peoples homes or from the better quality straw vendors in Nassau Prices can be high but even small bowls make beautiful and practical reminders of your trip The handmade pieces are likely to become rare within a couple of generations because so few young Bahamian women are now taking up the craft Be aware that much of the straw work particularly the massmarket goods like hats and bags is not made in the Bahamas but in Taiwan and China If you want to be sure of getting genuine Bahamian straw work buy from places such as The Plait Lady who has a shop on Bay Street in Nassau youll have to pay a little more but youll

Minnis is becoming very collectable and prices can be high On the other end of the scale street art including things like driftwood paintings can be fun and much more affordableWood carvings are made from a variety of native trees Some of the best are made from the lignum vitae the Bahamian national tree and from the wild tamarind The carvings come in a bewildering variety though animal and fish motifs seem to predominate Always check a piece thoroughly before you buy as they are vary in quality Dont buy wood if it looks greenthis usually means the wood has not been allowed to season and it
