 Hillary Commie Martyr This week my column earns its name though strange bedfellow might be a better title for something by David Brock Brock in case you ve forgotten is that young gay conservative investigative sex journalist who specializes in the reverse beatification of liberal saints in the gay baiting American Spectator After making his name with a best seller arguing that Anita Hill had mixed up Clarence Thomas with someone else Brock became even more notorious by breaking in the pages of the Spectator the lurid tale that came to be known as Troopergate Though many of the revelations by Clinton s former bodyguards were clearly baloney Vince Foster groping Hillary Clinton in public Bill consuming whole baked potatoes in a single bite the fantasy was blended with elements of reality in an artful way One product of the mixture was the Paula Jones lawsuit which was filed not only against Clinton but also against one of Brock s own trooper witnesses who alleged that Paula did not flee the governor s hotel room as promptly as she recalls Given that background Brock s The Seduction of Hillary Rodham has been much awaited eagerly by the Dole camp less so by the Democrats The hype succeeded in getting my hopes up but not for long Slate has gotten its hands on a bootleg copy of the book marked confidential and embargoed for Oct 8 Slate is woefully disappointed There are only four allegations here that even vaguely resemble news 1 While running for Congress in 1974 Bill Clinton contemplated buying black votes in order to steal the election but ultimately did not 2 In the early 80s Hillary hired a private detective to find out about her husband s tomcatting 3 In 1992 the Clinton campaign hired another private detective to intimidate bimbos This detective obliquely threatened the life of Gennifer Flowers 4 On the morning of the inauguration in 1993 the Clintons had a frank exchange of views on the steps of Blair house trading such endearments as fucking bitch and stupid motherfucker These nuggets all have the same problems First they are remarkably thinly sourced to 1 a disgruntled former consultant who was disbarred for bribery 2 a detective who had his license revoked by the State of Arkansas 3 Gennifer Flowers ex roommate and 4 Park Police Second none of them implicates either the president or first lady in anything that is actually or even nearly illegal It was the consultant not the Clintons who wanted to buy votes Campaigns hire detectives all the time Profanity isn t a crime But worst of all these bombshells aren t particularly juicy and to find them you have to wade through 400 pages of stupefying rehash Possibly because he returned from Little Rock without the goods Brock takes a new authorial tack He casts himself as a fair minded quasi objective investigator appalled by the Hillary hating right To do this of course he must distance himself from himself and this he does with aplomb A Spectator piece of his about the travel office firings was even accompanied by a facetious caricature of Hillary as a witch he notes Fancy that The new evenhanded Brock says Hillary is neither an icon nor a demon Actually he veers drunkenly between these two poles now mocking Hillary for thick ankles dowdy outfits and r sum padding now excusing her involvement in Travelgate and Whitewater The troopers see Hillary as an undesirable foul mouthed harridan who had brought the mistreatment and neglect on herself Not so Brock assures us gallantly fending off the rogues It seems fairer to conclude that Hillary s flaring temper was an understandable reaction to the humiliation to which she was subjected on a regular basis Brock s disingenuousness is monumental and takes place at several levels At the first Brock under the guise of fairness slings enough mud to drown a Bangladeshi village His particular obsession is that Hillary Clinton is I kid you not a Red Carl Ogelsby whose writings influenced her at Wellesley was a Maoist or Marxist Saul Alinsky about whom she wrote her senior thesis now under lock and key was the mentor to the socialist agitator Staughton Lynd who had gone to Hanoi with Tom Hayden in 1965 to meet with North Vietnamese leaders At Yale Law School her revolutionary uniform consisted of white socks sandals and the loosefitting flowing pants favored by the Viet Cong She studied the First Amendment with Tommie the Commie Emerson and was seen around the influential circle of Robert Borosage later connected to the Institute for Policy Studies which promoted pro Soviet movements in the Third World at the height of the renewed Cold War She spent a summer working in Berkeley with lawyers Robert Truehaft and Charles Garry who were you guessed it Communists And on it goes The Legal Services Corp on whose board Hillary sat was a hotbed of Marxists and folk singers She later joined the New World Foundation on whose senior staff was Adrian W DeWind who during the 1970s was a member of the Committee for Public Justice founded by Lillian Hellman Mrs Clinton s mentor Marian Wright Edelman was at the height of the 1980s U S Soviet tensions a member of the board of SANE FREEZE a leading disarmament group and she has been affiliated with the Washington School a project of the Institute for Policy Studies After the election the first lady responded to a congratulatory note from the National Lawyers Guild which had been founded in the 1930s as an adjunct of the American Communist Party She thought about appointing as secretary of education Johnetta Cole a member of a committee connected to Cuba s intelligence forces and to the World Peace Council Even the detective hired by the Clinton campaign in 1992 to intimidate bimbos was a People s Detective Robert Truehaft actually was a Communist long before his association with Hillary Tommy the Commie was a McCarthyite nickname for a Yale professor who never was In either case so what Brock s anachronistic redbaiting resembles the fashionable game Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon in which it is shown that the actor can be associated with any other actor in the world in a series of short steps He then makes a laughingstock out of himself by accusing right wing critics of practicing smear tactics and guilt by association When it comes to such subjects as lesbianism drugs and witchcraft Brock s technique is slightly different He retails various suspicions then assures us that they are contemptuous I think he means contemptible but you get the idea The second level of falsity is that Brock defends Hillary only to elevate his own proprietary scandal As he indicates he thinks the media focused on Whitewater and Travelgate in 1994 as higher minded alternatives to Troopergate His agenda is to convince us that James McDougal doesn t matter but that Paula Jones does If he has to grant immunity to Hillary to prosecute her husband so be it Deep down he assures us Hillary is a good person Bill is not Unlike the virtuous Hillary the president s late mother slept around he tells us without any further elaboration She even ministered to call girls whatever that means William Blythe whom Clinton claims as his natural father was with a different woman every night Clinton to Brock is an empty vessel or at least a vessel with his wife at the tiller He has always been a parasite on her political acumen her intelligence and her income At the same time Brock undermines his fainthearted defense by arguing that Hillary is a closet revolutionary cadre a committed radical who takes as her creed Saul Alinsky s admonition that the struggle to help the poor is a struggle for power in which the ends always justify the means He even describes her journey to the White House as a Maoist long march This theory demands a certain creative use of evidence When Alinsky offered her a job after college Hillary turned him down saying in a letter that she disapproved of his methods and preferred to work inside the system But to Brock this only enhances the point Her chance to foist socialism on America finally came with health care reform Never mind that lefties hated her managed competition plan Never mind that she didn t even try to stop her husband from repealing the welfare entitlement She is a Trojan horse making tactical concessions in the name of the ultimate radical millennium Though Brock s primary theme is Hillary s clandestine pursuit of her own idea of justice he intersperses it with his own titular one about how a good person was seduced by an amoral husband and the seedy realities of Arkansas political life Unexplained is how one can be a dedicated revolutionary and a sellout to the status quo at the same time But then conservatives need to have it both ways about the Clintons Bob Dole still hasn t decided whether his opponent is a closet liberal or a chameleon You can make either case but you have to make up your mind
