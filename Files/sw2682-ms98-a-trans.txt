                 okay   um do you have a favorite credit card that you use   um i probably use my Discover card more than anything else   because any particular reason   uh no i really dont use too many credit cards im not fond of them i dont like using them   umhum umhum   but ive just gotten to the point where id rather carry that instead of cash   yeah i know what you mean   but but the thing is i always carry it with my checkbook so if i have i just pay for it with my check instead of     uhhuh   i think ive only ever used my credit card maybe three or four times   oh really wow   umhum   well i use um a credit card thats given out by US Air   umhum   well not given out i mean theres an annual fee um and the neat thing about the credit card is for every dollar that you charge you get one frequent flyer mile   umhum oh   and um  my husband and i tend to charge a lot and even things that we wouldnt normally charge now we charge because weve racked up seriously close in the past couple of years close to five or six thousand dollars just by charging   yeah wow   and um its really great because you can get some good discounts um on US Air you know using frequent flyer mileage and all that   umhum   um and the annual fee isnt bad i think its maybe thirty five dollars a year   umhum   um and here in Rochester maybe in in Pennsylvania also but you can charge your groceries   yeah uhhuh yeah   can you do that there which is great   with only only certain certain cards they accept though they dont accept all kinds of cards like they only accept the major cards   oh oh do do they accept Discover or no   um i dont know they do accept the Discover but i know they would accept like Visa Master Card   umhum yeah   umhum   well i love it and now um actually our our mortgage company is starting i think June first or something is going to start allowing people to charge their mortgage   oh my   and thats going to be great um and in the beginning we were having a problem because we would charge everything and then get this enormous bill   umhum   and just be totally wiped out because one thing i hate is paying interest   umhum   i refuse to pay interest if im going to do that im not going to use a credit card   exactly exactly   so what i do now is i i work it like a checkbook and every time i charge something i write it rout i write it out so im not fooling myself into thinking i have that money   uhhuh   you know i write it out and then its its as if i paid in cash   exactly yeah   so youre somebody that will pay off your bills right away   uh yes yes definitely that see that if if i dont have the money in my checking account i will not charge it even if i have the charge   umhum   i have to have that money before ill charge it   umhum yep i know what you mean   i refuse well im a college student and im a finance major   oh   so  and um i dont i oh my gosh i probably i have a Discover card   well that makes sense   i have an ATT card but i dont use it because i dont even know where it is i put it away like two years ago because i thought if i dont see it i wont use it which is really good because then     right   i you know a lot of my friends have like outrageous phone bills but i dont have it because i dont use mine   oh yeah   and um i know i have Montgomery Wards i have a um a J C Penneys i have a Kaufmans you know i have a Fashion Bug i have a whole bunch of them   umhum umhum   and i just used my J C Penney card and its a year old and that was the first time ive ever used it   really well   yeah i just i dont think to use them all the time and if i do use one i would rather use my Discover card one   umhum umhum   and theyre getting to the point now too at the end of the year   umhum   all the money that youve youve charged on theyll pay you i think its ten percent back   umhum a discount yeah yeah   so you know i even got a couple dollars back   seem umhum its definitely worth if you pay off your bills in full then credit cards are a real good idea   umhum yeah   because you dont have to carry a whole lot of cash and you get the interest you know if you charge at the beginning of the month then youre getting a months worth of interest   exactly   in your account   uhhuh   um but the second you let it go even one month um they had made an error on our statement where they never posted the payment yet i had the canceled check i had everything   uhhuh   and um i mean for that amount it was like a thirty dollar interest charge   oh my gosh   thats like another purchase for me it buying something   yeah me too  that would definitely be for me too umhum   yeah but um you know one thing one of the reasons because i have some of those cards that you mentioned and i think about it and a lot of reason i have those cards because J C Penney offered you know a free gift if you buy it   uh thats why i have it   yeah or five dollars off this purchase if you you know sign up and   uhhuh umhum   and uh as long as it because i dont J C Penney doesnt cost you anything i dont think   no huhuh no   right and so as long as it doesnt cost you anything then   that that yeah and being a college student i get um applications for them all the time i think once a week i have an application and the first thing i check for is if theres an annual fee if theres an annual fee i ditch it because i dont use them that often so it wouldnt even pay me to get it even if it was you know   oh yeah umhum yeah   and uh my Discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it   umhum umhum   and now she buys everything with her Discover Discover card and she works it the way you do with your card she writes it down like she would a check and then you know that way shes getting the interest on it too because at the end of the year they give her back her interest   umhum oh yeah umhum oh right   and i think she got back like fifty some dollars last year   uh wow that is great   so i mean she might spend three thousand but if you get thirty of it back you know thats still thirty dollars less   umhum yeah right and thats thirty dollars that you didnt pay any money to have it in the first place   exactly and she you know my moms like that too she pays it off as soon as the bill comes   umhum   umhum   one thing i still dont understand about credit cards is is how you can borrow money off a credit card i still havent quite figured that out   i havent tried it i dont trust it   i know i dont trust it either and um i know you can do it with a Visa card but it just seems like too simple and i know that theres some hidden   umhum theres so theres so much fine print that i dont understand that i wont even try it   yeah yeah yeah   yeah i just rely on my Mac card   on your what   my Mac card just take it out of the bank   oh just yeah the machine one thing that um that does scare me a little bit about my credit card is when i am giving it over the phone   uhhuh   or you know if i i i tend to buy a lot of things from TV like not not the shoppers thing but sometimes theyll be something good that theyre selling a record or something like that and um   umhum yeah   and after i do it i think God who did i give my number to   umhum   and um you know what are they going to do with it how can i trust them or whatever   umhum yeah   but um the credit card company i did have a charge on there once that i had no receipt for i had no recollection i didnt even know the the store   umhum   and they took it right off no questions i just said this isnt my charge if you can prove that it is then great if you cant then um you know just take it off   okay umhum yeah theyre usually i think theyre usually pretty good about that   umhum   uh i mean they they probably realized it was their mistake if if they really thought that it was not their mistake i think they would probably send you something proving that you actually did have it so   yeah oh yeah yeah they would pursue it definitely   yeah uhhuh i im im starting to use my credit card more like i said im a college student and the past two semesters i bought my books with it   yeah oh yeah   so and i run between two and three hundred dollars a semester with books   umhum um yeah   so thats approximately between five and six hundred dollars that i put on it and i just keep thinking oh good im going to get that back im going to get a little bit back  uhhuh   right right yeah thats true before you could at least deduct if you did pay any interest you could at least deduct that from your taxes   umhum   but now you cant do it and i know people that have racked up they they keep getting their limit extended because they keep exceeding it   i i cant see that   and then and all they can do is is pay the minimum balance or not that you know   and when they do that all theyre doing is paying the interest on it theyre not even paying the principal   exactly oh nope theyre not even touching it   i i uh when when i get to people like that i wish i think the company should just say uh were not giving you any more until you pay this off   i know   it dont i realize that the company wants you to use it you know and extend it all the time theyre making more money off you   right   but i think they should have the the consumer the most interest you know   yeah its true though because then all they end up doing is spending more of their time making collection calls   its like theyre addicted to using their credit card or something   oh yeah some people are they really are i mean if they have if they know they have more more on their limit   umhum   that i i might i think my brotherinlaw is like that actually but um he if he has a hundred dollars left until he reaches his limit hell spend it   oh my God   he cant because to him its like money to him its like a a loan almost in a sense and he cant bear to   i cant i cant do that   no i cant either   i have like i said i have to i have to know that i have that money before ill spend it   umhum   so i i i dont   yeah   i dont know  of course my mom lives very she was she had twelve kids and of course she she watched her money all the time and i that was one good thing i did get off of her   i know oh my God   uh i dont mind spending my money as long as its a necessity   umhum   and if its something i really really want but just to go out and start buying im not like that and thats something i got off of her and im   yeah
