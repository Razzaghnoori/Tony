 Background Aggregation of acetylcholine receptors AChRs at the post synaptic muscle membrane is the initial step in synaptogenesis at the neuromuscular junction and is essential for reliable and rapid synaptic communication Agrin is the only known in vivo stimulus for the initiation of receptor aggregation However several other researchers have reported that laminins including laminin 1 LN1 also induce receptor aggregation in cultured mouse muscle cells 1 2 3 At this time the LN1 stimulation pathway is not well understood but it has been argued from several lines of evidence to be at least partially distinct from the agrin pathway This is based on aggregation assays showing different time courses additive dose response relationships and differential co localization of the dystrophin complex and on biochemical observations indicating the lack of requirement for MuSK and the lack of tyrosine phosphorylation of receptors during LN1 but not agrin induced aggregation 1 2 4 The very minimal receptor aggregation seen in agrin deficient mice certainly argues that laminins are not sufficient to trigger receptor aggregation 5 More recently we have shown that agrin and LN1 induced aggregates can also be differentiated on the basis of the ultrastructural arrangement of receptors within aggregates 6 Laminins are major components of the extracellular matrix and exist in many isoforms with varying functions including cell adhesion neurite outgrowth and cellular signaling 7 8 9 10 Laminin binds agrin 11 and colocalizes with AChR aggregates 12 13 14 It also binds with Dystroglycan DG an important part of the dystrophin utrophin glycoprotein complex Reviewed in 15 16 The dystrophin complex is also found concentrated at the neuromuscular junction with AChRs and laminin and for this and other reasons is thought to be involved in both formation and maintenance of the NMJ 2 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 Taken together these observations have led to the hypothesis that LN1 serves as a secondary or supporting stimulus for agrin induced AChR aggregation 1 2 24 The present study is directed at a quantitative examination of the interaction between the signal transduction pathways for agrin and LN1 induction of AChR aggregates and colocalized DG aggregates Results Acetylcholine receptor aggregation In order to examine the possible interactions between agrin and LN1 combination experiments were conducted in which the total exposure time to individual stimuli was less than or equal to 24 hours Examples of the effects of agrin and LN1 alone or in combination using these protocols are shown in Figure 1 It is clear from visual inspection that either stimulus or the stimuli together increase the prominence of receptor aggregates Figure 1Avs 1B 1C 1D 1E 1F To quantify these differences the quantitative analyses described in Materials and Methods were carried out and the results are summarized in Figure 2 The present experimental system provides an important opportunity to estimate changes in the average AChR expression by sampling the fluorescence signal from the section of membrane representing the meridian of the spherical cell Average receptor expression was found to be significantly increased following exposure to agrin and less so although still significantly in response to LN1 Figure 2A Interestingly the combination experiments seem to indicate that these effects are additive suggesting that the two stimulation pathways do not share a common rate limiting step Moreover 24 hour exposure to LN1 did not bring about a significant increase in aggregate number while agrin did alone or in combination with LN1 Figure 2B Both agrin LN1 and combinations of the two significantly increased aggregate size Figure 2C In terms of aggregate density the concentration of receptors within aggregates the result was the mirror image of that for aggregate number agrin alone was indistinguishable from controls while laminin alone or in combination significantly increased density Figure 2D Figure 2Erepresents a novel analytical approach in which the distribution of aggregates on each cell is compared to that expected assuming random placing of the aggregates i e spatial independence neither cooperativity nor competition The mean Z values when significantly different from zero indicate the direction of deviation from a random distribution mean Z 0 indicates aggregates are closer together than would be expected at random cooperativity while values 0 indicate aggregates are further apart than expected competition The observed receptor aggregates were found to be significantly different from random only with agrin alone as the stimulus in which case they were found closer together indicating spatial cooperativity Dystroglycan aggregation Because of various lines of evidence connecting DG to receptor aggregation and to differences in agrin and LN1 pathways of induction we next examined the effects of the stimulus protocols on cells double labeled for AChRs fluorescein and DG rhodamine to examine the extent of correlation between the labels see below and the DG distributions Typical results are shown in Figure 3 in which DG distributions are seen to be quite punctate with examples of both kinds of non correlation 3AB CD demonstrating a lack of contamination of signals between the two filter sets There are also examples in which the labels do appear to be somewhat correlated 3 EF GH Quantitative analyses of the DG distributions are summarized in Figure 4 the observed AChR aggregates were consistent with the observations presented above but were not pooled with those data because they were not performed on matching sister cultures Agrin clearly increased the expression of DG as judged by label intensity Figure 4A while the effects of LN1 alone or in combination could not be assessed because it competed with the immunological probe used in labeling There are interesting similarities as well as differences in the effects of the two stimuli on the remaining measures of distribution First agrin showed no effect on the number of DG aggregates per cell while LN1 alone and in combination induced an increase Figure 4B This is the reverse of the finding for AChR aggregates Figure 2B DG aggregate size follows a similar pattern of increase by LN1 alone or in combination but not agrin Figure 4C but in this case it is the same as the finding with AChRs Figure 2C Again in agreement with AChR observations DG aggregate density is increased by LN1 but not agrin Figure 4D however in this case it appears that this increase is prevented by agrin while in the case of AChRs the combination follows the LN1 alone phenotype of increased aggregate density Finally the meanZ values Figure 4E clearly show that 1 DG aggregates are closer together than random cooperativity in all cases and apparently more so after stimulated with LN1 The last analysis performed was that of measuring the correlation between AChR and DG distributions in response to the stimulus protocols As discussed in Materials and Methods each of the three measures used here has some advantages over the others In the present experiments the trends are all quite similar however and are shown in Figure 5 All correlation measures show progressive and significant increases from control to agrin to LN1 to agrin LN1 The more physiologically meaningful metrics high frequency and above threshold correlation are quite low in controls indicating that aggregates of the two components are essentially independent in their distributions under these conditions This independence is lost with the application of either of the two stimuli and the effects of agrin and LN1 together are greater than either alone It should be noted however that even under these conditions the high frequency correlation for example indicates that about 19 0 44 2 of the variation in either distribution is predicted by the other Thus although the aggregate distributions are not statistically independent they are also not strictly colocalized Discussion Correlation of aggregates This is the first report in which entire slices of membrane have been compared in their entirety for correlation of AChR and DG distribution Accordingly the question arises as to how this approach can be compared with previous studies which demonstrate a visible colocalization of AChRs and DG in muscle cells stimulated by nerve terminals 19 or agrin 4 20 26 27 First we note that the present results do support a significant colocalization of the two molecules in agrin stimulated cells as compared to controls Figure 5 in general agreement with previous findings That the correlation coefficient never approaches unity is also consistent with the previous work in general it has been found that AChR aggregates contain DG but visible concentrations of DG can be found in the absence of AChRs Thus there appears to be a one way correlation whether the stimulus is agrin or laminin AChR aggregation is an excellent predictor of DG aggregation but the converse is not found see particularly 4 This lack of reciprocity will of course reduce the label correlation as measured in the present study Nevertheless it is apparent from visual observations e g Figure 3 that there is less perfect colocalization of DG within AChR aggregates in the present study than reported previously see for example 4 Figure 9 for a comparable study using Xenopus muscle cell cultures It seems likely that this is due to the more minimalist culture conditions used in the present study younger cells plated on clean glass coverslips lacking in extensive adhesion plaques and presumably endowed with a less stratified cytoskeleton This is supported by the finding that 48 hours of laminin stimulus is required for an increase in aggregate number while in the 24 hour protocol reported at present only aggregate size is increased It is to be expected that with greater stimulation time the colocalization would increase which presents the prospect of studying the relative dynamics of AChR and DG colocalization Distribution of aggregates The observation that receptor aggregates are distributed differently than would be expected at random deserves further comment As a first approximation there are three ways that receptor aggregates on a given cell could be distributed randomly closer together or further apart than random A random distribution would imply that aggregate dynamics initiation development and dispersal are independent of that for neighboring aggregates Aggregates distributed further apart than random would imply a local competition for the molecules required for aggregate formation or development or alternatively regionally increased levels of components which cause aggregate dispersal Conversely a distribution of aggregates closer together than random could result from a local reduction in the rate of dispersal or a regionally enhanced rate of initiation or development of new aggregates Of course these effects need not be mutually exclusive it could be that aggregate dynamics are cooperative in small regions of membrane while simultaneously competitive over larger scales We found that spontaneous receptor aggregates were distributed closer together than random Figure 2E although the deviation was small and only just significant statistically However agrin and LN1 appear to have very different effects on aggregate distribution Agrin dramatically increased the proximity of receptor aggregates while laminin stimulation resulted in random distributions of aggregates Interestingly this latter effect was dominant in the sense that agrin LN1 combinations also resulted in random distributions DG distributions were found to be closer together than random in all conditions examined Conclusions The present data largely corroborate and extend previously published accounts We did not find the substantially larger number of LN1 as opposed to agrin induced aggregates reported previously 1 perhaps because of the shortened application of laminin used in the presented experiments Also while laminin stimulation increased the colocalization of AChRs and DG in our experiments agrin also produced a similar increase Figure 5 These effects on colocalization appear to be additive as did the overall stimulation of AChR expression Figure 2A Both of these findings suggest distinct pathways for agrin and laminin induced receptor aggregation and this conclusion is strengthened by the observation laminin unlike agrin dramatically increased the density of receptors within aggregates Figure 2D as reported previously 1 The independence of pathways is also indicated by the profoundly different effects of the two stimuli on aggregate distribution This last observation indicating the absence of cooperativity or competition amongst LN1 induced aggregates invites the question of whether the results of laminin stimulation can be explained by simple mass action effects of increased receptor expression At present we can produce no evidence to rule out this possibility Increased expression of AChRs could decrease the dissolution of aggregates thereby increasing aggregate size density and over time number This would also explain the longer time required for LN1 induction of aggregates as well as the additivity seen here and in previous reports Whether or not the effects of LN1 on aggregation dynamics can all be attributed to an increase in receptor expression it seems clear from several lines of evidence that the mechanism is distinct from that of agrin induction and that the physiological effects of laminin are permissive rather than instructive for receptor

objective n a 1 3 and a 12 Bit Photometrics digital camera system model CH250 To avoid observer bias cells were first observed in bright field and randomly chosen from among the group of healthy spherical cells before observing them in fluorescence Analysis of fluorescence micrographs Custom written software in C and Mathematica was used to generate detailed quantitative membrane fluorescence information from each cell image 28 29 In the first phase the intensity of membrane fluorescence as a function of position is tabulated Figure 7B 7C Raw Data These measurements are then analyzed to provide statistics on the number size density and position of each aggregate on each cell Figure 7C The analysis is not perfect in particular small aggregates close together may be scored as single larger aggregates Nonetheless the analysis provides objective comparisons between the different conditions under examination New to this report the positional information was used to quantify the distribution of aggregates about the cell surface First the nearest neighbor distance is found for each aggregate on cells containing more than one aggregate Figure 7B For each cell the mean of these nearest neighbor distances is calculated Next the number and sizes of aggregates on a given cell are used to run repeated 1000 simulations assuming a random placement of the same sized aggregates For each simulation run the mean nearest neighbor distance is calculated so that together the runs provide an expected value and expected standard deviation for this parameter under the assumption of a random distribution These values corresponding to a given cell s aggregates are then used to form a z score from the observed mean nearest neighbor distance of the cell observed expected standard deviation Finally the expected value for all z scores from a given experimental condition is 0 given a random distribution negative if the aggregates are closer together than random and positive if the aggregates are further apart than random The significance of any deviation from randomness is tested by summing the z scores to form a 2statistic Also new to this report is testing of the correlation between label intensities in the double label experiments Correlation is a statistical measure of the relationship between two variables based on the covariance of those variables normalized by their standard deviations In these experiments the two variables are the label intensities of two fluorescent labels representing the two proteins of interest in the experiment Correlations are measured for raw data high frequency data and above threshold or aggregate data see Figure 7 The raw data provide a baseline measurement without any manipulation of the data but include low frequency gradual changes in fluorescence which are less interesting The high frequency correlation eliminates this contamination and avoids the somewhat arbitrary imposition of a threshold while the above threshold correlation is intuitively a better measure of what we mean by colocalization of aggregates but of necessity depends upon the threshold chosen Fortunately in the
