Kasparov was a total jerk I closely followed both last year s and this year s matches with great enthusiasm and have always had a lot of respect for Garry He is a true genius in chess the best there is So I did not expect him to say all those things that he said Garry claims that the second game was the one that led to his downfall and almost accused IBM of cheating Leaving aside the fact that IBM would not even consider doing this and risking its credibility and reputation it is a preposterous charge because whoever stepped in to help the machine would be a better player than Kasparov Alex Heard is right Perhaps we need another spokesman for the human race This one has just become another sports jerk Philippos Peleties Kasparov s Deep Blues I couldn t disagree more with Alex Heard s article Sore Loser This kind of personification of the computer does nobody any good Garry Kasparov does not owe Deep Blue an apology because Deep Blue is not a human and has no feelings It is a pile of microchips There is nobody to offend Garry acted like a human and it made me proud to be human too I am also proud of his fighting stance at the press conference He said exactly what I wanted to say This stupid machine will not definitively beat its masters And then there was a roar of approval from the audience Do the programmers of Deep Blue deserve an ovation Not to the same extent They are still the challengers in this saga of man vs machine And not one of the programmers could have beaten Kasparov in chess not even close Justin K Hertog New York City I Want My FDA I have one objection to FDA Smoke Rings by Jack Shafer The regulation of tobacco doesn t mean that adults are living in a childproof world Sure the FDA s efforts are done in the name of kids But the goal is to have fewer persons become addicted to nicotine at an age when information about the health hazards is likely to be ignored Many teen agers are not moved by the possibility of an early death in four decades But if smoking is addictive then it makes sense to try to keep tobacco out of the hands of kids who are too young to take the warnings seriously The FDA s regulations do not make it harder for adults to buy cigarettes The advertising regulations may make it harder for a new product to enter the market or to boost brand switching But adults can still buy cigarettes I am sure however that there are many in the anti tobacco movement who would be prepared to ban smoking because of the possibility of lung damage from secondhand smoke now that would be trying to create a childproof world Thomas J Mikula Bethesda Md He s No Bill of Rights Jack Shafer s FDA Smoke Rings and Jacob Weisberg s Clinton Turns Yellow complement each other on the same subject Big Brother Is Watching William Jefferson Clinton s abysmal record on liberty as Weisberg calls it is indeed a fatal twist of irony incredible and troubling Clinton is willing to toss away our First Fourth and possibly Second amendments with a simple flick of the pen He seems motivated by a deep seated longing to heal and protect but this is not a sufficient warrant for violating the privacy of an individual s rights and trampling on the Constitution I m weary of the perennial bad excuse for cameras censorship and regulations It s for your own protection and safety I understand Clinton s utopian aspirations but no society will ever find true peace and stability There will always be a small percentage who cannot govern their own lives and who abuse freedom but that shouldn t mean that we all have to pay the price by losing our constitutional rights Jackie Marcus American Meltdown James Traub s review of Nathan Glazer s We Are All Multiculturalists Now titled I Was Wrong really grabbed me I grew up in the 1950s at a time when the concept of the United States as a melting pot was widely preached in our schools and everyday life Later in the 1960s we were told that the melting pot did not take dark meat But now that there is clear cultural and biological assimilation I have been surprised to see that large constituencies actually try to categorize themselves by racial or ethnic labels Like Glazer I have questioned affirmative action and dreaded the creation of a legal caste quota system Like Glazer I now believe that events and processes are stronger than government policies and political mindsets I find myself on a similar journey of shifting concepts and renewed belief in the melting pot but like Glazer my journey is in process and the questions loom much larger than my answers Bill McMichael Oak Hill Va Ratings to Riches Hooray for David Plotz s Domestic Goddess Dethroned an assessment of Roseanne s self made downfall While I wouldn t go so far as to praise the early years of her show Plotz succinctly tracked the devolution of what started out as a very good idea How ironic that a program once watched by poor and wealthy viewers alike ultimately perished because its creator couldn t handle the move from being poor to being wealthy herself Erich Van Dussen New York City Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Please include your address and daytime
