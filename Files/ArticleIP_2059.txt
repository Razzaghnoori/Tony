 Know Maass When I first moved to Manhattan a neighbor approached me in the corridor of my apartment building Are you Peter Maass the writer Though I have heard this question many times over the years I still don t know the correct response Yes I am no I am not Both are accurate Unfortunately I offered my neighbor a reply that raised more questions than it answered Yes I am but there are two of us He looked at me oddly and adopted one of those don t mess with me expressions that New Yorkers are born with If an opportunity for amity had existed between us it seemed to have vanished He slipped into the elevator I slipped into my apartment and I imagine he rolled his eyes to the ceiling and thought Great another nut case in the building If only he knew the truth I am a writer a very good writer according to my mother I worked for the Washington Post for nearly a decade and I have written a book about my experiences covering the war in Bosnia It was published last year and got positive reviews It even won a couple of awards So when people ask whether I am Peter Maass the writer I should feel good I should feel triumphant I should feel like a master of the literary universe receiving the adulation he so rightly deserves and I should reply in a voice of elegant humility Yes I am But I don t I can t My problem is this Although I am Peter Maass the writer I am not Peter Maas the writer Peter Maas one s not two has a career s worth of books under his belt and he s famous Serpico famous Valachi Papers famous This has created a great deal of confusion I ve received letters intended for him phone calls intended for him compliments intended for him a publishing solicitation intended for him even a job offer intended for him which I turned down I have never met the guy Until recently I enjoyed the confusion There s something flattering about people thinking I was capable of writing a best seller about a New York cop when I was a teen ager in Los Angeles or that I could write one book after another in my 20s while at the same time reporting one newspaper story after another I had a great laugh when I was in North Korea a few years ago and someone congratulated me on my phenomenal output In North Korea Circumstances have changed I now have my own literary oeuvre This entitles me to certain privileges such as employing foreign words in my writings see previous sentence and living on the Upper West Side of Manhattan Also I should be able to revel in praise rather than worry about it But in my case praise from a stranger is like a glass of water served at a restaurant in Bombay You drink it warily if at all fearing it may be tainted Even if the water tastes pure and delicious you cannot enjoy it as much as you should There s nothing more pleasant than being congratulated for your literary skills but there s nothing less pleasant than realizing the congratulations are intended for a guy who writes about the mob I had hoped that my book would end the confusion that I would emerge as the one and only Peter Maass or Maas though I suspected this was unlikely At the least I hoped the confusion would turn to my favor Shortly before my book was published I wrote a piece about my identity crisis suggesting that if an admirer who thought I was Peter Maas asked for my signature I would scribble away and confide that my newest opus was far better than my previous ones If thousands of Maas fans bought my book by mistake I would not complain Yet I miscalculated No sooner did my book start getting some attention than Peter Maas released a book that turned into a best seller It s about Salvatore Sammy the Bull Gravano a mobster who turned state s evidence against John Gotti From what I hear about the book and I hear quite a bit it s not bad and that s unfortunate at least for me I went to the Washington D C public library recently to do a reading There was a sign at the entrance announcing the event and my name was spelled Peter Maas I thought little of it until a beefy audience member walked out shortly after I started talking about Bosnia I am pretty sure he wanted to hear about Sammy the Bull It s not that I can t drive people away from my readings but it usually takes more than 35 seconds Ignominy has many forms Once after I signed a pile of books at a bookstore a clerk told me not to leave because there were more copies in back He returned with a stack of books by Peter Maas I was tempted to sign them and nobody would have been the wiser but something held me back Integrity Honesty No try jealousy Signed books sell much better than unsigned ones I was in Los Angeles not long ago to attend a book festival A number of people lined up for my book signing and I was very pleased until some of them pulled out copies of his books It was a bit embarrassing especially as my father was sitting next to me at the time Could it get worse After a lull a middle aged couple approached me and the husband had my book My book I introduced him to my father and I explained how amusing it was that some people thought I was Peter Maas and wanted me to sign his books A distraught look emerged on the husband s face and his wife stared coldly at him I told you she sneered There was an awkward silence I quickly wrote a personal inscription in the book Best regards from the real Peter Maass and he smiled and thanked me I would like to think my inscription soothed the pain for him cheered him up and naturally this was my intention It was only later of course that I realized my inscription made it impossible for him to get a refund
