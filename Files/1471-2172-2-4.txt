 Background Mutations in Bruton s tyrosine kinase Btk are responsible for the human disease termed X linked agammaglobulinemia XLA reviewed in reference 1 The B cell antigen receptor BCR signaling defect is very severe such that XLA patients have a block in the pro B to pre B cell transition and consequently have no mature B cells The xid mouse in which Btk is mutated and the Btk knockout mouse display similar although somewhat less severe phenotypes 1 Btk is the prototypical member of the Tec family of non receptor protein tyrosine kinases PTKs that includes Bmx Itk Tec and Txk 2 3 In addition to a COOH terminal PTK domain Btk has an NH 2 terminal pleckstrin homology PH domain a proline rich Tec homology domain a Src homology 3 SH3 domain and a Src homology 2 SH2 domain Btk was originally identified in B cells but is now known to be expressed in most leukocytes with the exception of T cells and NK cells Btk is thought to be activated upon BCR cross linking by a two step mechanism involving phosphatidylinositol PI 3 kinase and the Src family PTK Lyn reviewed in references 4 5 6 PI 3 kinase induces Btk membrane targeting by generating phosphatidylinositol 3 4 5 trisphosphate PIP3 to which the PH domain of Btk binds Lyn transphosphorylates Btk within the activation loop of the kinase domain allowing subsequent autophosphorylation of the Btk SH3 domain and full Btk activation The SH2 domain containing inositol phosphatase SHIP downregulates Btk by dephosphorylating PIP3 4 5 6 Biochemical studies of Btk deficient B cells have shown Btk to be necessary for BCR induced phospholipase C 2 PLC 2 phosphorylation calcium mobilization extracellular signal regulated kinase ERK and c Jun NH 2 terminal kinase JNK mitogen activated protein kinase MAPK activation NF B activation and apoptosis 7 8 9 10 11 12 These signaling events are generally not entirely abrogated and kinetic analyses have revealed that the sustained phases are particularly impaired in the absence of Btk 8 9 13 In contrast these pathways are completely inhibited in the absence of the Syk ZAP 70 family tyrosine kinase Syk 14 These data have led to the hypothesis that Btk co operates with Syk in PLC 2 dependent BCR signaling and that Btk functions as a signal duration modulator reviewed in references 15 16 However it is not clear if Btk alone is sufficient to mimic aspects of BCR signaling nor is it known whether all downstream signals mediated by Btk are PLC 2 dependent Indeed additional functions for Btk have recently been proposed namely in PI 3 kinase activation 17 cytoskeletal reorganization 18 and DNA transcription 19 20 21 In this study we have generated a conditional form of Btk by fusing the full length Btk protein with the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor Btk ER We show that Btk ER activation alone is sufficient to activate multiple downstream signaling pathways in B cells including calcium mobilization ERK and JNK MAPK and apoptosis Moreover by analysing Btk ER function in PLC 2 deficient cells we show that PLC 2 is necessary for Btk ER to transmit these signals Results and Discussion Construction of Btk ER a conditional form of Btk In order to determine whether Btk activation alone is sufficient to mimic aspects of BCR signaling we have generated Btk ER a novel conditional form of Btk Btk ER was constructed such that the hormone binding domain of the estrogen receptor was fused to the COOH terminus of full length Btk Fig 1A This approach has been successful in producing conditional forms of the Tec family PTK Bmx 22 and also the PTKs v Src 23 Hck 24 and Abl 25 the serine threonine kinases Raf 26 and Akt 27 and the dual specificity protein kinase MEK1 23 The mechanism of action of ER fusion proteins is not clear although it appears that upon treatment of cells with estrogen or an estrogen analogue for example 4 hydroxytamoxifen 4 HT the biological activities of the proteins are induced This may involve ER domain dimerization and or selective stabilization of expression within the cell 26 The ER fusion protein method has been shown to accurately identify downstream substrates and effects of the above mentioned kinases Two forms of Btk ER were generated one using wild type WT Btk and the other using a kinase inactive K430E mutant of Btk as a negative control Fig 1A The Btk ER constructs were transfected into Btk deficient DT40 chicken B cells and stable clones were selected that expressed equivalent levels of Btk ER The DT40 cell system was used because it has proved useful in dissecting B cell signaling pathways through the use of gene knockouts derived by homologous recombination 15 Fig 1Bshows that WT Btk ER was kinase active in vitro as determined by autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of an exogenous substrate GST Ig in an immune complex kinase assay Kinase activity was not detectable for the K430E mutant of Btk ER Fig 1B comparable to control immunoprecipitations from Btk deficient cells data not shown In order to determine if Btk ER was active in vivo cells were treated with vehicle control 4 HT or anti and the phosphorylation status of cellular proteins and Btk ER were analysed by Western blotting Fig 1C Upon 4 HT treatment a discrete set of cellular proteins were inducibly phosphorylated in WT Btk ER expressing cells although their phosphorylation levels and the diversity of proteins phosphorylated were reduced in comparison with BCR cross linking As a control 4 HT treatment did not induce phosphorylation of cellular proteins in parental DT40 cells without Btk ER data not shown Btk ER itself was inducibly phosphorylated upon 4 HT treatment as measured by anti phosphotyrosine blotting and by a phosphospecific antiserum that recognises the Y223 site of Btk autophosphorylation Surprisingly the phosphospecific antiserum did not detect Btk ER Y223 phosphorylation in response to BCR cross linking suggesting that the observed phosphorylation in this case is largely due to the Y551 Lyn transphosphorylation site In cells expressing kinase inactive Btk ER phosphorylation of Btk ER was not detected and cellular substrates were not inducibly phosphorylated in response to 4 HT Fig 1C These data suggest that WT Btk ER but not the kinase inactive form can be activated in vivo by 4 HT The mechanism by which 4 HT activates Btk ER is not known but may be different to the mechanism of BCR induced activation since the two stimuli induce phosphorylation on different sites The identity of the cellular proteins phosphorylated downstream of Btk ER activation 50 79 kD range top panel Fig 1C are not known These proteins are unlikely to include Lyn or Syk the two PTKs that are primarily responsible for the BCR induced tyrosine phosphorylation pattern seen in DT40 whole cell lysates 14 since we were unable to detect phosphorylation of Lyn and Syk following specific immunoprecipitations data not shown Moreover the relatively weak phosphorylation of cellular proteins induced by Btk ER does not suggest that Lyn and or Syk are becoming activated Fig 1C This is consistent with the idea that Lyn and Syk are upstream of Btk activation 28 Btk ER is sufficient to activate the PLC 2 calcium pathway Btk deficient B cells are defective in BCR induced PLC 2 phosphorylation and calcium mobilization 8 11 In particular the sustained PLC 2 calcium responses are impaired A model has been proposed in which Btk controls calcium influx across the cell membrane by modulating PLC 2 activity and thus IP3 levels 6 29 Here we tested whether Btk ER activation was sufficient to activate the PLC 2 calcium pathway Btk deficient cells expressing either WT or kinase inactive Btk ER were treated with 4 HT or anti and PLC 2 phosphorylation was analysed by Western blotting Fig 2A Upon treatment with 4 HT a sustained PLC 2 phosphorylation was induced in cells expressing WT Btk ER that was not observed in cells expressing kinase inactive Btk ER Fig 2A As a further control 4 HT treatment of Btk deficient cells expressing Btk without the ER domain did not induce PLC 2 phosphorylation Fig 2B lanes 9 11 This demonstrates that the 4 HT response is specific to Btk ER Interestingly the slow kinetics of PLC 2 phosphorylation in response to Btk ER differed markedly from the fast transient kinetics in response to BCR cross linking compare Fig 2A lanes 6 9 with Fig 2B lanes 5 8 The slow Btk ER kinetics are consistent with data derived from Btk deficient cells in which sustained BCR induced PLC 2 phosphorylation calcium mobilization and MAPK activation are impaired but the initial responses are relatively normal and appear to be driven by Syk activity reviewed in reference 15 Additionally the sustained PLC 2 phosphorylation induced by Btk ER is in agreement with the idea that Btk does not activate negative regulatory pathways that turn off the signal rather it is Lyn that is thought to be largely responsible for this aspect of BCR signaling 15 To determine whether Btk ER is sufficient to induce a calcium flux cells were loaded with indo 1 and the concentration of intracellular free calcium monitored by FACS analysis Cells were treated with 4 HT and or anti as outlined in Fig 2C Strikingly upon treatment with 4 HT WT Btk ER induced a rapid calcium mobilization that was at a low level but sustained Fig 2C This pattern differed from that seen in response to BCR cross linking where an initial large transient increase in intracellular calcium was followed by lower but sustained levels Fig 2C These kinetics are similar to those seen for PLC 2 phosphorylation Figs 2A B again consistent with the idea that Btk regulates the sustained phase of calcium mobilization No additive or synergistic effect of both 4 HT and anti was observed Fig 2C This data indicates that Btk ER activation alone can induce intracellular calcium mobilization and is consistent with a previous study that showed cross linking of a constitutively membrane associated CD16 Btk chimera to induce a calcium flux 8 In order to evaluate whether Btk ER induced calcium mobilization was due to calcium release from internal stores or calcium influx across cell membrane calcium release activated channels CRAC cells were pre treated with EGTA to chelate extracellular calcium Fig 2D note change in scale within Fig 2Dand compared with Fig 2C In response to anti treatment of cells expressing WT Btk ER the sustained elevation of intracellular calcium was completely blocked in the presence of EGTA whereas the initial transient increase was only slightly impaired Similarly in response to 4 HT treatment the sustained increase in intracellular calcium levels was abrogated in the absence of extracellular calcium Fig 2D This suggests that Btk ER may induce calcium release from intracellular stores which subsequently results in calcium influx across CRAC Our data is consistent with that of Fluckiger et al 8 who proposed that Btk controls BCR induced calcium signaling by regulating PLC 2 activation IP3 levels and calcium store depletion Fig 2Cshows that kinase inactive Btk ER was unable to induce a calcium flux which in common with the PLC 2 data Fig 2A suggests that kinase activity is required for Btk ER function However in the context of signaling through the BCR we surprisingly found that kinase inactive Btk ER could reconstitute calcium mobilization in these Btk deficient cells Fig 2C This was not an artefact of the ER domain since non tagged kinase inactive Btk could also restore BCR induced calcium flux data not shown In addition we have found that kinase inactive Btk can reconstitute BCR induced ERK MAPK activation but not PLC 2 phosphorylation Tomlinson Bolen and Johnston unpublished data This suggests that Btk can function independently of catalytic activity perhaps as an adapter protein and that Btk induced PLC 2 phosphorylation is not essential for PLC 2 activation The mechanism may involve stabilization by Btk of the PLC 2 complex or signalosome 30 in an optimal conformation or subcellular location Upon BCR stimulation Btk is thought to be recruited to PLC 2 via the adapter protein BLNK as BLNK can associate with the SH2 domains of both PLC 2 31 32 and Btk 33 Membrane localization of this complex is required for PLC 2 activation 32 but the mechanism by which this is achieved is presently unknown reviewed in 34 It is conceivable that a Btk PH domain PIP3 interaction is important for membrane localization of the complex and that this function is independent of Btk kinase activity However it should be noted that reconstitution of calcium mobilization in Btk deficient DT40 cells by kinase inactive Btk was not observed in a previous study 11 The reason for this discrepancy is not clear but may be due to the different mutations that were used to generate kinase inactive Btk in the two studies In the present study we used a K430E mutation K430 is the invariant lysine known to be essential for enzymatic activity of protein kinases In the study of Takata and Kurosaki 11 Btk was rendered catalytically inactive by an R525Q mutation Since K430 is located on the smaller NH 2 terminal lobe of the kinase domain whereas R525 is part of the larger COOH terminal lobe it is possible that the two mutations differentially affect the capacity of kinase inactive Btk to function as an adapter in the activation of PLC 2 Btk ER is sufficient to activate ERK and JNK MAPK pathways BCR induced activation of the ERK and JNK MAPK pathways is impaired in Btk deficient DT40 cells but p38 MAPK activation is unaffected 9 The precise role of Btk in the activation of MAPK pathways is not clear but these findings suggest that Btk is required for ERK and JNK activation We therefore examined whether Btk ER is sufficient to induce ERK and JNK activity In Fig 3A Btk deficient cells that express either WT or kinase inactive Btk ER were treated with 4 HT or PMA as a positive control and ERK activity was assessed by immune complex kinase assay using MBP as an exogenous substrate In response to 4 HT WT Btk ER but not the kinase inactive protein induced ERK activity which increased over the time period examined Fig 3A The kinetics were somewhat different to those seen with anti stimulation where maximal ERK activity is detected within 5 min and is sustained for up to 120 min 9 However Btk ER was clearly able to induce sustained ERK activity and this coupled with the findings that in Btk deficient cells the sustained response is impaired 9 suggest that Btk activation may be responsible for the prolonged ERK activation normally detected following BCR cross linking Interestingly kinase inactive Btk ER was able to restore ERK activation in the context of anti stimulation Fig 3A lanes 6 and 12 This effect of kinase inactive Btk is consistent with the previous calcium data Fig 2C and supports the idea that Btk can perform a kinase independent adapter function In Fig 3B JNK activity was measured by Western blotting whole cell lysates with phosphospecific JNK antiserum This antiserum detects phosphorylation of JNK at sites T183 and Y185 which correlates with JNK activation Addition of 4 HT to cells expressing WT Btk ER induced JNK phosphorylation to a level that was similar to that seen with anti treatment Fig 3B lanes 2 4 or with both 4 HT and anti Fig 3B lane 5 However we did not detect JNK phosphorylation following 4 HT treatment of cells expressing kinase inactive Btk ER Fig 3B lanes 8 9 The weak JNK phosphorylation in cells expressing kinase inactive Btk ER in response to anti or both 4 HT and anti Fig 3B lanes 10 11 suggests a partial adapter function for Btk The control treatment with PMA and ionomycin induced JNK phosphorylation in both cell types Fig 3B lanes 6 and 12 From these data we conclude that Btk ER is sufficient to activate the JNK pathway in B cells Btk ER is sufficient to induce DT40 cell apoptosis A major biological response of B cells to BCR cross linking is apoptosis a function that is strongly induced in DT40 cells The mechanism of apoptosis induction is not clear but is dependent on the expression of Btk 12 13 We therefore tested whether the conditional form of Btk alone can induce apoptosis in DT40 cells In Fig 3C Btk deficient cells expressing either WT or kinase inactive Btk ER were treated with 4 HT and or anti for 24 hours Apoptosis was quantitatively measured by the TUNEL assay which detects double stranded DNA breaks that are a hallmark of apoptosis Remarkably WT Btk ER induced apoptosis to a similar extent to that seen with BCR cross linking Fig 3C despite the fact that PLC 2 phosphorylation calcium mobilization ERK and JNK were relatively weakly activated Figs 2 3A B However it is clear that the amplitude and duration of signaling responses can control differential activation of transcription factors For example in B cells NF B is activated by a large transient calcium flux whereas NFAT is activated by a low sustained calcium plateau 35 Thus in DT40 cells BCR induced apoptosis may be largely controlled by transcription factors that are themselves activated by low sustained signals which the BCR and Btk ER can activate equivalently A functional kinase domain was required for Btk ER induced apoptosis as kinase inactive Btk ER failed to induce apoptosis in response to either 4 HT or anti stimulation Fig 3C Interestingly a low level of apoptosis was observed in response to both 4 HT and anti in cells expressing kinase inactive Btk ER Fig 3C This again suggests an adapter function for kinase inactive Btk which here was facilitated by 4 HT The PMA and ionomycin control induced apoptosis in both cell types data not shown Btk ER induced calcium mobilization ERK and JNK activation and apoptosis are dependent on PLC 2 Biochemical analyses of Btk deficient cells have suggested that PLC 2 is a downstream substrate of Btk 8 11 However the importance of PLC 2 in Btk signaling has not been explored In particular it is not clear if the capacity of Btk to connect to downstream signaling pathways such as calcium mobilization MAPK activation and apoptosis is mediated through PLC 2 or whether it can occur via other pathways In particular recent reports have suggested that in addition to PLC 2 activation Btk may function in PI 3 kinase activation cytoskeletal reorganization and DNA transcription Btk was shown to be required for normal phosphorylation of a novel adapter protein named BCAP which couples BCR activated PTKs to PI 3 kinase activation 17 Btk may also regulate cytoskeletal reorganization by phosphorylating the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein WASP 18 which plays a role in actin polymerization Finally Btk has been reported to shuttle to the nucleus and may function in transcription by binding the transcription factors Bright and BAP 135 TFII I 19 20 21 36 Thus Btk may have multiple targets and it is not known which Btk induced signals are transmitted via PLC 2 To address these questions we have expressed Btk ER in parental and PLC 2 deficient DT40 cells Parental DT40 cells were considered a better control than the Btk deficient cells used previously Figs 1 3 as both PLC 2 deficient and parental cells express endogenous chicken Btk Thus parental and PLC 2 deficient cells were transfected with kinase active Btk ER and stable clones selected that expressed equivalent levels of Btk ER as measured by anti Btk Western blotting of whole cell lysates Fig 4A To test whether PLC 2 is required for Btk ER induced calcium mobilization parental and PLC 2 deficient cells expressing Btk ER were treated with 4 HT and or anti or ionomycin as a positive control Fig 4B Btk ER induced a sustained calcium signal in parental cells but not in PLC 2 deficient cells Fig 4B suggesting that Btk ER modulates calcium signaling by affecting PLC 2 activity Consistent with previous data no calcium mobilization was observed in PLC 2 deficient cells in response to anti 37 but as expected a calcium flux was detected in response to ionomycin that bypasses receptor proximal signaling events Fig 4B These data argue against the possibility that Btk ER directly controls a CRAC Instead our data are consistent with the model that Btk ER indirectly controls calcium signaling by regulating PLC 2 activity and thus IP3 levels and calcium store depletion 6 8 29 In Fig 5we have tested whether PLC 2 is required for Btk ER induced ERK and JNK activation and apoptosis Two different BCR signaling pathways can result in ERK activation in DT40 cells namely a PLC 2 independent Grb2 Sos pathway and a PLC 2 dependent pathway that requires protein kinase C 38 In Fig 5Awe found that Btk ER activated ERK MAPK in parental but not in PLC 2 deficient cells lanes 2 and 7 Thus Btk ER appears to induce ERK activation through its capacity to activate PLC 2 and not through a Grb2 Sos pathway In response to a 60 min treatment with anti ERK activation was detected in parental but not in PLC 2 deficient cells Fig 5A lanes 3 4 and 8 9 but control PMA treatment activated ERK in both cell types Fig 5A lanes 5 and 10 Transient ERK activation 5 to 10 min after anti treatment can be detected in PLC 2 deficient cells 13 These kinetics are identical to those observed in Btk deficient cells 13 Together with our Btk ER data this suggests that Btk ER controls sustained ERK activation in B cells by regulating PLC 2 activity The mechanism by which Btk connects to the JNK pathway is not clear One possibility is that Btk can directly activate components of the MEKK1 SEK1 JNK signaling cascade This pathway is controlled by the small GTP binding protein Rac1 and in DT40 cells Rac1 is essential for BCR induced JNK activation 38 Thus another possibility is that Btk might directly regulate Rac1 activity Alternatively since the combination of protein kinase C and calcium signaling is sufficient to activate JNK 9 38 Btk could activate JNK indirectly through activation of PLC 2 In Fig 5Bwe show that Btk ER mediated JNK activation is dependent on PLC 2 Upon 4 HT treatment phosphorylated JNK was detected in parental cells but not in PLC 2 deficient cells Fig 5B lanes 2 and 7 PLC 2 deficient cells also failed to activate JNK in response to anti treatment or a combination of anti and 4 HT Fig 5B lanes 3 4 whereas parental cells did activate JNK following these treatments Fig 5B lanes 8 9 In response to PMA and ionomycin activated JNK was detected in both WT and PLC 2 deficient cells Fig 5B lanes 5 and 10 These data are in agreement with previous reports that document the requirement for PLC 2 in BCR induced JNK activation 38 Moreover the data suggest that Btk ER activates JNK by a mechanism that is dependent on PLC 2 rather than through activation of more downstream elements of the JNK cascade Apoptosis is a major biological response of B cells to BCR cross linking and Btk is clearly necessary for this effect in DT40 cells 12 13 Here we have shown Btk ER activation to be sufficient to induce apoptosis in DT40 cells Fig 3 In Fig 5Cwe have investigated the mechanism by measuring Btk ER induced apoptosis in parental and PLC 2 deficient cells Twenty four hours after 4 HT treatment apoptosis was detected in WT but not in PLC 2 deficient cells Fig 5C The response of parental cells to 4 HT was consistently lower than in response to anti Fig 5Cand data not shown This is in contrast to the Btk deficient cells analysed earlier Fig 3 where 4 HT and anti yielded an equivalent apoptotic response This partially impaired function of Btk ER in parental cells compared to Btk deficient cells in eliciting a biological response may be due to the presence of endogenous chicken Btk that could compete with Btk ER for optimal subcellular location Apoptosis was not detected above background levels in PLC 2 deficient cells that were treated with anti or both anti and 4 HT Fig 5C This is consistent with reports that PLC 2 is necessary for BCR induced apoptosis 37 Apoptosis was detected in parental and PLC 2 deficient cells in response to the control PMA and ionomycin treatment Fig 5C These data suggest that Btk ER induces apoptosis in DT40 B cells by a PLC 2 dependent mechanism In DT40 B cells apoptosis induction by Btk ER may be a consequence of its capacity to activate JNK since in these cells JNK activation correlates more closely with apoptosis than does ERK activation In particular we have found that Btk deficient DT40 cells reconstituted with Txk an atypical Tec family PTK fail to undergo BCR induced JNK activation Tomlinson and Johnston unpublished data and apoptosis 13 but ERK activation is relatively normal 13 In contrast to the pro apoptotic role for Btk in DT40 cells Btk appears to play an anti apoptotic role in mature B cells in vivo The mechanism may involve Btk dependent activation of the transcription factor NF B 7 10 and subsequent upregulation of the anti apoptotic protein Bcl X L 39 40 Previous studies have shown that DT40 cells deficient for Btk and PLC 2 have similar BCR signaling defects Readouts have included calcium mobilization and apoptosis 11 37 MAPK activation 9 38 and NF B activation 41 In addition mice deficient for Btk and PLC 2 have similar defects in B cell development and function reviewed in 30 These findings have lead to the hypothesis that Btk and PLC 2 are components of the same signaling unit or signalosome 30 However these findings have not proved that Btk connects to the above mentioned pathways via PLC 2 In the present study while we cannot rule out the possibility that Btk ER activates PLC 2 in combination with other uncharacterized pathways our data strongly support the Btk PLC 2 signalosome model by showing that PLC 2 is absolutely required for Btk ER induced calcium MAPK and apoptosis responses Conclusions The Btk mutations found in XLA patients and the xid mouse show that Btk is required for normal B cell development but the important pathways activated by Btk have yet to be fully identified In this paper we show that a conditional form of Btk Btk ER is sufficient to activate many signaling pathways downstream of the antigen receptor including PLC 2 phosphorylation calcium mobilization apoptosis and ERK and JNK activation Our findings clearly indicate that all of these Btk ER mediated responses require PLC 2 In future studies Btk ER may be a useful tool for the identification of Btk phosphorylation sites on PLC 2 and for the discovery of novel substrates Materials and methods Cells DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum 1
