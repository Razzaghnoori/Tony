 Introduction Rheumatoid arthritis RA is characterized by synovial tissue leukocyte infiltration and angiogenesis 1 The neovascularization process in RA is dependent on the balance between angiogenic mediators and inhibitors The angiogenic mediators include growth factors cytokines chemokines adhesion receptors and proteolytic enzymes 2 These factors which are released by endothelial cells and macrophages have been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA 2 Tie receptors constitute a family of endothelial tyrosine kinase receptors 3 4 There are two members in this receptor family termed Tie1 and Tie2 also known as Tek Tie1 is an orphan receptor whereas the ligands of Tie2 receptor have been identified as angiopoietin Ang 1 and Ang 2 5 6 Ang 1 has been shown to be responsible for recruiting and sustaining periendothelial support cells 7 It has been reported that Ang 2 disrupts blood vessel formation in the developing embryo by antagonizing Ang 1 induced autophosphorylation of Tie2 6 Transgenic mouse models of Tie2 Ang 1 result in embryonic lethality due to absence of remodeling and sprouting of blood vessels 7 8 The physiologic roles of the Tie2 receptor and its ligands are limited to angiogenic processes that occur subsequently to the earlier vasculogenic and angiogenic actions of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF and its receptors 7 VEGF and the Tie family orchestrate optimal blood vessel formation 9 10 Little is known about the role of Tie receptors and the ligands Ang 1 and Ang 2 in RA synovial tissue To determine which of these angiogenic factors may play a role in RA we investigated both the distribution and the levels of mRNA for Tie1 Tie2 Ang 1 and Ang 2 in synovial tissue obtained from RA patients compared with that from subjects with osteoarthritis OA and normal tissues Materials and methods Antibodies and immunohistochemistry Synovial tissues 4 m were fixed in cold acetone for 20 minutes Endogenous peroxidase was quenched by treatment with 3 H 2 O 2 for 5 minutes Synovial tissues were pretreated with either 3 horse or goat serum for one hour at 37 C before application of primary antibody Indirect immunoperoxidase staining was performed at 37 C for one hour using Vector Elite ABC kits Vector Burlingame CA USA and diaminobenzidine Kirkegaard and Perry Gaitherburg MD USA as a chromogen 11 12 The polyclonal antibodies goat antihuman Ang 1 and Ang 2 and rabbit antihuman Tie1 and Tie2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Santa Cruz CA USA Additionally goat antihuman Tie1 and Tie2 antibodies were purchased from R D Systems Minneapolis MN USA Antibodies did not cross react with other members of the Tie family Macrophage identity was confirmed by reactivity of cells with the mouse antihuman mAb CD11c Becton Dickinson Mountain View CA USA Rabbit antihuman von Willebrand factor Dako Carpinteria CA USA was used to identify endothelium Isotype specific IgG was used as a

chain reaction RT PCR quantification TaqMan and western blot analysis are detailed in the supplementary material Results Ang 1 Ang 1 was expressed on synovial lining cells in RA patients 33 to a significantly higher degree than in OA 10 and normal 1 cells P 0 05 Fig 1 Ang 1 staining on macrophages was also significantly higher in RA 39 compared to OA 10 and normal cells 0 P 0 05 The Ang 1 staining present on vascular endothelium was upregulated in RA 86 compared to OA 8 and normal synovial tissues 6 The inflammatory and vascularity scores were higher in RA synovial tissue in comparison to OA and normal In accordance with the staining data RA synovial tissue demonstrated significantly higher Ang 1 mRNA expression compared to OA and normal tissues Ang 1 mRNA expression was not detected in RA fibroblasts Fig 1 Ang 2 The expression of Ang 2 was detected on synovial lining cells macrophages and vascular endothelium Fig 2 The data demonstrate that Ang 2 was expressed on macrophages 30 and the vascular endothelium 78 in synovial tissue of RA patients more strongly than in the tissue of OA patients macrophages 11 endothelium 66 and normal subjects macrophages 12 endothelium 15 Additionally Ang 2 was detected in the synovial vascular smooth muscle cells 13 from RA patients only The Ang 2 mRNA expression pattern was similar to Ang 2 immunostaining on vascular endothelium The Ang 2 mRNA expression in RA synovial tissue was similar to that from OA patients and both were significantly higher than normal Interestingly in RA synovial tissue fibroblasts Ang 2 mRNA was expressed at low levels compared to that found in whole RA OA or normal synovial tissue Fig 2 Tie1 Tie1 expression was found to be significantly higher in RA and OA synovial tissue lining cells RA 79 OA 81 and macrophages RA 69 OA 66 compared to normal synovial tissue lining cells 24 macrophages 22 using antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Fig 3 Tie1 immunostaining on endothelial cells was significantly higher in RA synovial tissue 75 in comparison to OA 3 and normal 9 synovial tissue The Tie1 positive immunostaining on vascular smooth muscle cells was similar in all test groups RA 74 OA 78 normal 71 Additionally all disease groups demonstrated minimal percentages of Tie1 cell staining on synovial tissue lymphocytes RA 1 OA 2 normal 6 and fibroblasts RA 18 OA 18 normal 30 Immunohistochemistry studies using the goat antihuman Tie1 antibody purchased from R D Systems showed predominantly endothelial cell staining and minimal staining on macrophages and fibroblasts Tie1 mRNA expression was significantly higher in RA synovial tissue compared to OA synovial tissue 3 fold normal synovial tissue 9 5 fold and RA synovial tissue fibroblasts 6 fold Western blot analysis also confirmed the same pattern of expression Tie2 Tie2 was significantly upregulated in RA and OA synovial tissue lining cells RA 71 OA 68 macrophages RA 71 OA 72 and smooth muscle cells RA 71 OA 66 compared to normal synovial tissue P 0 05 using the Santa Cruz antibodies Fig 4 Endothelial cells showed relatively high Tie2 positive staining in all disease groups RA 71 OA 66 normal 49 Only synovial tissue from RA patients demonstrated positive staining for Tie2 on lymphocytes RA and OA patients had similar patterns of Ang 2 on cell lining and endothelial cells Tie1 on lining cells macrophages smooth muscle cells lymphocytes and fibroblasts and Tie2 on lining cells macrophages endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells expression on various synovial tissue components The anti Tie2 antibody from R D Systems demonstrated positive staining mainly on endothelial cells and minimal staining on macrophages and fibroblasts Tie2 mRNA levels were significantly higher in RA synovial tissue compared to OA synovial tissue 1 9 fold normal synovial tissue 4 fold and RA synovial tissue fibroblasts 9 6 fold Tie2 protein expression by western blotting followed the same pattern as the mRNA expression Fig 4 Discussion The Tie receptors and the ligands Ang 1 and Ang 2 appear to be involved in the later stages of vessel growth and remodeling 8 13 Transgenic mice with gene deletions 7 8 13 or overexpression of Ang 2 6 exhibit early embryonic lethality secondary to defects in the developing vasculature Ang 1 was more highly expressed in synovial tissue from RA patients than in either OA or normal synovial tissues expression in OA tissue was similar to normal Positive cells included lining cells macrophages and endothelial cells In RA Ang 1 was most upregulated on endothelial cells The results obtained from RT PCR analysis confirmed that RA synovial tissue had significantly higher Ang 1 mRNA expression than OA and normal synovial tissue Hence no Ang 1 mRNA expression was detected in RA fibroblasts Fig 1 The Tie receptor family is known to be expressed on endothelial cells 5 Otani et al 14 reported Ang 1 and Ang 2 positive staining on macrophages and endothelial cells in choroidal neovascular membranes Macrophages are key angiogenesis effector cells that produce a number of growth factor stimulators and inhibitors proteolytic enzymes and cytokines that can activate one or more steps in the angiogenesis cascade 15 16 17 Recent studies have shown that angiopoietins promote postnatal neovascularization by potentiating angiogenic cytokines such as VEGF 9 10 In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical analyses of RA synovial biopsies revealed that VEGF mRNA and protein localized to subsynovial macrophages lining cells vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts within the pannus which are the putative target of this cytokine 18 19 The localization of Ang 1 is similar to that of VEGF which further supports the crucial role of the interaction between these two pathways Ang 1 modulates VEGF stimulated reorganization of endothelial cells and promotes vascular network maturation 9 20 Additionally both Ang 1 and VEGF are chemotactic and are involved in recruiting endothelial cells to initiate and accelerate endothelialization of blood vessels 21 22 We detected Ang 2 immunopositive cells in synovial lining macrophages and vascular endothelium Vascular smooth muscle immunostaining was found only in RA In agreement with our finding it has been reported that primary cultured macrophages and precursor macrophage cell lines mainly express Ang 2 mRNA 23 In contrast to Ang 1 Ang 2 was distributed in a similar pattern in RA and OA compared to normal synovial tissues Fig 2 The dominance of Ang 2 over Ang 1 mRNA and protein in OA synovial tissue are in agreement with the inactive VEGF receptor 1 pathway angiogenic pathway in OA 24 The Ang 2 mRNA expression pattern correlates with the Ang 2 immunostaining detected on endothelial cells In RA synovial tissue Ang 2 showed a lower percentage of staining in all the cell types compared to Ang 1 Low Ang 2 mRNA expression was also detected on RA fibroblasts Interestingly Ang 2 acts as an agonist for Tie2 receptors expressed on fibroblasts 6 Since the neovascularization process is dependent on the dominance of angiogenic mediators over inhibitors the higher Ang 1 mRNA and protein expression compared to Ang 2 in RA synovial tissue is of importance It has been shown that increasing amounts of Ang 2 can block the chemotactic activity of Ang 1 in endothelial cells 21 Ang 2 alone did not stimulate corneal neovascularization but the combination of Ang 2 and VEGF resulted in longer vessels with greater circumferential extent than those seen with VEGF alone 9 This suggests that Ang 2 expression in the absence of VEGF leads to vessel regression whereas expression of Ang 2 in the presence of VEGF potentiates angiogenesis Using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody Tie1 expression was detected on all cell components examined including a percentage of synovial lining cells macrophages and smooth muscle cells in RA and OA Synovial tissues from normal subjects and those with OA had considerably lower positive immunostaining on endothelial cells compared to RA tissues Immunohistochemical analysis performed with anti Tie1 from R D Systems in synovial tissues supports its expression mainly on endothelial cells However western blot analysis for Tie1 also performed with an antibody from R D Systems showed higher relative abundance of Tie1 in whole RA and OA synovial tissue homogenates compared to RA fibroblasts Fig 3 In accordance with the protein data the mRNA levels of Tie1 in RA synovial tissue were upregulated compared to OA synovial tissue normal synovial tissue and RA fibroblasts Since the ligand for the Tie1 receptor is not known it is difficult to speculate if there is any correlation between this receptor and Tie2 and its ligands In agreement with previous studies the Tie1 receptor was detected on vascular endothelial cells 4 25 and recently on synovial lining cells 26 It has been shown that tumor necrosis factor and VEGF activate membrane associated metalloproteinases that release soluble Tie1 from the cell surface of endothelial cells and thereby decrease membrane bound Tie1 expression 27 The upregulation of Tie1 mRNA and protein expression in RA is not consistent with these findings and this may be due to the fact that the inflammatory milieu in RA synovial tissue is far more complex than the in vitro system Using the Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibody we showed that Tie2 expression was significantly upregulated both in RA and OA synovial tissue lining cells macrophages endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle compared to normal synovial tissue In accordance with Otani et al 14 and Uchida et al 26 we detected Tie2 immunostaining on endothelial cells and fibroblasts in all disease groups Tie2 immunostaining using antibody from R D Systems confirmed the expression of this antigen mainly on endothelial cells Tie2 mRNA and protein expression followed the same pattern of expression as Tie1 There are some possible reasons why the immunohistochemistry studies performed with Santa Cruz Biotechnology R D Systems antibodies differ The Santa Cruz Biotechnology antibodies detected epitopes on the carboxy terminus whereas the R D Systems antibodies recognized the extracelluar domain N terminus or the ligand binding domain of Tie1 and Tie2 There is also some variability between individual RA patient samples however we attempted to use the same RA patient samples in performing immunohistochemistry with the two different antibodies Additionally the results obtained from the RT PCR and western blot analysis confirm our findings Conclusion It is noteworthy that the activating ligand Ang 1 is exclusively higher than Ang 2 at the mRNA and protein levels in RA synovial tissue compared to that from patients with OA and normal subjects Hypothetically in RA synovial tissue the dominating Ang 1 induces the Tie2 pathway whereas in normal synovial tissue higher Ang 2 presence blocks Ang 1 binding to Tie2 and inhibits its autophosphorylation In conclusion the dominance of Ang 1 over Ang 2 expression favors active neovascularization in RA synovial tissue Multiple pathways are probably required to regulate angiogenesis It may be that the inhibition of the VEGF and Tie2 pathways might be an effective therapeutic modality in RA Abbreviations Ang
