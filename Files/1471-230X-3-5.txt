 Background Acute graft versus host disease A GVHD is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT It frequently involves skin intestinal tract and liver The incidence of A GVHD after allogeneic BMT ranges from 30 to 60 with skin as the most commonly affected organ often accompanied by intestinal and or liver involvement 1 2 3 4 Intestinal A GVHD may manifest as abdominal cramps ileus profuse diarrhea and sometimes bleeding However these symptoms are not specific and include broad differential diagnoses such as chemotherapy effect radiation therapy effect infections and side effects of other drugs 5 6 7 8 9 Furthermore the histomorphological features of these conditions overlap significantly with A GVHD Due to this interpretation of colonic biopsies for intestinal A GVHD may be a major diagnostic challenge especially for those not conversant with these findings 10 Only a few studies have statistically evaluated the diagnostic significance of some histopathological features 6 A GVHD is treated with immunosuppression which may worsen an underlying infective condition Thus it is extremely important to diagnose these conditions correctly for proper management In addition to other histopathological features described in association with A GVHD significance of apoptosis crypt abscess and crypt loss has been emphasized 4 11 12 13 14 15 However the distribution pattern of apoptosis in colonic mucosa in A GVHD has not been methodically evaluated Similarly the term crypt abscesses has been used previously in A GVHD although it appears to be a misnomer as discussed later This may lead to confusion with crypt abscess of inflammatory bowel disease Crypt abscess and cryptitis associated with inflammatory bowel diseases not been evaluated in intestinal A GVHD previously were specifically studied to confirm the misnomer status We retrospectively analyzed various histomorphological features in 44 colon biopsies from BMT patients with cutaneous A GVHD and diarrhea These were compared with 48 colon biopsies from negative control groups The goal of this study was to systematically evaluate the diagnostic reliability of various histomorphological features with reference to intestinal A GVHD Methods Group Definitions Group A Consisted of 44 patients 25 males and 19 females 19 to 59 years of age mean 41 6 years with diarrhea and biopsy proven cutaneous A GVHD In this group intestinal A GVHD was strongly favored in the absence of other etiologies such as CMV colitis and NSAIDs 2 4 7 9 12 16 17 CMV colitis cases were excluded morphologically based on the presence of CMV cytopathic effect or CMV immunohistochemistry The cases with suspicious features such as ill defined cytopathic changes and ischemic features were also automatically excluded without performing CMV immunohistochemistry to avoid possibility of inclusion of cases with CMV These 44 colon biopsies were performed 21 to 100 day post BMT median 35 days prior to the commencement of treatment for A GVHD and within 15 days of A GVHD positive skin biopsy for investigating their diarrhea The underlying indications for BMT in these 44 cases in group A are shown in Table 1 The distribution of cases with reference to the grading of cutaneous A GVHD included 20 cases with grade I 13 with grade II 5 with grade III and 6 with grade IV Published clinical and histological criteria were used to define cutaneous and intestinal A GVHD 12 13 14 18 19 Grading of A GVHD was not attempted in colon biopsies Group B negative control I Included 27 patients 13 males and 14 females 20 to 77 years of age mean 51 5 years without immunodeficiency BMT or any other transplantation They had non specific GI symptoms like diarrhoea and abdominal cramps without inflammatory bowel disease The histopathology was negative for any diagnostic pathology with nonspecific changes or normal colonic mucosa Group C negative control II Included 21 kidney transplant patients 14 males and 7 females 46 to 75 years of age mean 60 3 years with non specific GI symptoms like diarrhea and guaiac positive stool The sections of colon biopsies were histopathologically negative for diagnostic pathology These patients in group C were under maintainance immunosupressive therapy with cyclosporine or tacrolimus prednisone and mycophenalate mofetil This group was included to study if any of the histomorphological features evaluted in this study have significant relationship with transplantation in general including effect of immunosupressive therapy Subclinical A GVHD in the absence of cutaneous A GVHD or gastrointestinal symptoms is known 4 10 Because of this reason a fourth hypothetical control group of biopsies from BMT patient without A GVHD though desired was considered impractical as various criteria under scrutiny in this study will be deciding if those biopsies would have to be considered negative for A GVHD Other negative control group desired would be colonic biopsies from the cases undergoing all the therapy components of BMT including cytoreductive therapy but without BMT However such a group would also be impractical during any clinical study due to obvious ethical limitations Autologous BMT case without cyclosporine induced GVHD or viral infection would have been ideal control 28 29 However due to limited number of cases in this group we could not include such a group Histomorphological features secondary to the effects of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs NSAIDs 4 7 and intestinal infections especially cytomegalovirus CMV 2 9 12 16 17 are known to overlap with A GVHD Due to this based on clinical details the cases with such associations were excluded from this study General information Polyethylene glycol solution GoLytely Braintree Laboratories Braintree MA was used for endoscopic preparation in all the groups Due to known subtle differences between left and right side of the colon the proportion of different sites in each group was matched for statistical correction All colon biopsies were fixed in Bouin s fixative and processed routinely Multiple levels of paraffin embedded tissue sections stained with H E were examined in blinded fashion without knowing the category Histopathological Analysis Various histological features important for the differential diagnosis of A GVHD were selected after review of literature 12 13 14 All H E stained sections were evaluated qualitatively or semi quantitatively for histomorphological features shown in table 2 The mucosal thicknesses Table 2 A from the surface epithelium to the internal limit of muscularis mucosa in three places were measured in the area of least thickness and mean was calculated Thickness 500 microns was considered within normal limits 20 Cryptitis and crypt abscess were defined respectively as infiltration of crypt epithelium with neutrophils and presence of neutrophils in crypt lumen Table 2 F Five or fewer intraepithelial lymphocytes per 100 epithelial cells in surface and crypt lining were considered to be within normal limits Table 2 G and H 21 We classified 1 5 extravascular neutrophils per 20 inflammatory cells in the lamina propria LP as mild increase and more than five as marked increase Table 2 L Macrophages with mucin as faintly basophilic foamy cytoplasm in H E stained sections were identified as muciphages Five or more muciphages in LP per 10 crypts were considered significant Table 2 P Presence of five or more endothelial lined blood spaces larger than 50 microns for every 10 crypts was regarded as increased microvessel network Table 2 Q Apoptosis defined as single cell death was indentified in H E stained sections as apoptotic cells with scattered karyorrhectic basophilic globular intracytoplasmic debris of apoptotic bodies Figure 1 Apoptotic cells were counted in 10 high power field HPF at 40 magnification with a field diameter of 0 35 mm Mitotic figures were counted per 10 crypts Table 3 Statistical Analysis Each group was evaluated for the frequency of various histomorphological features shown in table 2 The findings in group A were compared with groups B and C using Fisher s exact test Table 2 Number of apoptotic cells and mitotic figures in group A were compared with those in groups B and C using Wilcoxan Rank Sum Test Table 3 In order to compensate for the multiple testing and thus to avoid imparting spurious significance we used a stringent significance level of 0 002 for each test This was based on the Bonferroni correction factor for multiple testing to achieve an overall significance level of 5 22 Histomorphological features with statistically significant differences were separated for further analysis Table 4 Results The comparative frequency of various histomorphological features observed in all the three groups is shown in table 2 Apoptosis in crypt lining was associated with higher frequency in A GVHD with statisticaaly significant difference Table 3and 4 Other features observed more often in A GVHD with statistically significant differences as compared to the negative control groups included Table 2and 4 Figure 2 pericryptal apoptosis adjacent to the crypts in LP crypt abnormalities including crypt size variation crypt dilatation and irregular crypt distribution reactive changes in LP including reduced mucosal thickness muciphages in LP increased microvessel network and focal fibrosis and reactive changes in the surface epithelium with mucin depletion Apoptosis in crypt lining was observed in 91 of group A cases with A GVHD and demonstrated statistically significant difference as compared to negative control group B and C p 0 002 Fisher s exact test Table 2K 2 Figure 1 In group A 70 of cases showed apoptotic cells in LP around the crypts as compared to 22 in group B and 5 in group C p 0 002 Table 2K 4 Apoptosis in the surface epithelium did not show any significant difference between the three groups Table 2K 1 Apoptotic bodies in LP adjacent to the surface epithelium were also non specific and did not show significant difference between the three groups Table 2K 3 An average 5 3 apoptotic cells per 10 HPF were observed in group A in contrast to only 1 25 in group B and 1 42 in group C p 0 002 Wilcoxan Rank Sum Test Table 3 Intraepithelial lymphocytes and neutrophils in the surface epithelium and the crypt epithelium did not show statistically significant difference in A GVHD group and negative controls Table 2 G H I J Neutrophils eosinophils and edema in LP were nonspecific and were observed with comparable frequencies in all the three categories Table 2 L M O The number of mitotic figures in crypt lining did not show statistically significant difference between the three groups Table 3 Discussion Some of the histological features of A GVHD in colonic biopsies have been studied and reported previously 6 11 14 23 But they have not been evaluated together as collective features with methodical statistical analysis Crypt cell apoptosis has been described as a significant finding in intestinal A GVHD Usually this is focal in nature and results in membrane bound debris of apoptotic bodies in the crypts This phenomenon has been labeled variously as exploding crypt cells 13 24 karyolytic body 1 12 14 apoptotic body 1 12 granular necrosis 2 and popcorn lesions 2 13 Figure 1 Though this lesion is not specific for A GVHD it is a cardinal feature as demonstrated by experimental production of intestinal A GVHD in the Rhesus monkey 14 25 It is a valuable diagnostic feature in the absence of infections especially CMV 2 4 7 9 12 16 17 Other critical differential diagnoses include effects of radiation chemotherapy 12 13 and effects of other drugs such as NSAIDs 7 A higher number of apoptotic bodies were observed in A GVHD than in negative controls Table 3 The distribution pattern of apoptosis in colon biopsies with A GVHD has not been evaluated previously with statistical analysis In this study a statistically significant difference was noted when the distribution of apoptotic bodies in crypts and around the crypts was compared with those in surface epithelium and adjacent to the surface epithelium The frequency of apoptotic bodies in surface epithelium and adjacent LP in all the three groups were comparable and did not show statistically significant difference Table 2 K 1 and K 3 The presence of apoptosis in surface epithelium or in adjacent LP is nonspecific In the absence of apoptosis in the crypts presence of apoptosis along the surface epithelium does not have any diagnostic significance for A GVHD The cause of apoptosis along the surface epithelium is physiological turnover with loss from the surface epithelium and the replacement by proliferation of cells in the crypts Variety of non specific factors may accelerate this with increased number of apoptotic cells along the surface epithelium As compared to the negative controls group B 11 and group C 14 crypt apoptosis was frequent in A GVHD 91 with statistically significant difference Table 2K 2 With proper clinical history the diagnosis of A GVHD can be suggested if apoptosis is observed in and around the crypts Association of cryptal apoptosis with other features Table 4 should increase the diagnostic accuracy These associations included reactive changes in the surface epithelium increased muciphages reduced mucosal thickness focal fibrosis in LP irregular distribution of crypts crypt dilatation and crypt size variation Table 4 However some of these features may be secondary to cytoreductive therapy and other components of BMT In general the effects of cytoreductive therapy are not observed after 20 days 12 Under proper clinical situation their association with apoptosis in crypts and pericryptal apoptosis in LP is consistent with A GVHD in BMT Further evaluation of these features in relation to individual components of BMT protocols may be conducted as animal experiments with proper controls As mentioned under materials and methods such evaluation would be impractical as clinical study due to obvious ethical limitations in organizing proper controls Patients with cutaneous and hepatic A GVHD frequently have apoptosis in their colon biopsies without any intestinal symptoms 4 This may represent sub clinical intestinal A GVHD if the apoptosis is observed in relation to the crypts 10 If other findings Table 4 are present in the absence of crypt apoptosis it may represent evidence of past A GVHD or due to other etiologic factors such as chronic infections and inflammatory bowel disease As noted in this study classical cryptitis with infiltration of crypt lining by neutrophils and crypt abscesses with neutrophils within crypt lumens observed in inflammatory bowel disease were not features of intestinal A GVHD Table 2 F Cryptitis has been described in association with A GVHD but these studies do not define the term 6 12 13 Although reference had been made to crypt abscesses in these reports it is evident that the researchers were looking at the apoptotic debris in gland lumina and suggested crypt abscess like changes 14 In our study only one case 2 7 from group A with A GVHD showed occasional crypt abscess Table 2 and this may represent a coincidental inflammatory bowel disease like damage 26 Mild cryptitis with a few crypt abscesses was also observed in one patient 4 76 in group C with kidney transplantation Table 2 Thus classical cryptitis and crypt abscesses with infiltration of crypt lining and crypt lumen with neutrophils observed in inflammatory bowel disease is not a feature of A GVHD A change that was called focal periglandular infiltrate by Bombi et al 6 was observed by us in three 6 9 cases of A GVHD involving only one or two crypts Table 2 N Sale and colleagues described a comparable feature with focal increase in density of lymphocytes plasma cells and occasional eosinophils in the LP 13 This finding was suggested as a marker for apoptosis favoring the clinical diagnosis of A GVHD 6 They have suggested that the presence of focal periglandular infiltrate warrants a careful search for cryptal apoptosis We did not observe this finding in negative control groups B and C The clusters of enterochromaffin cells in A GVHD have been reported previously 25 27 They have been described in association with apoptosis suggesting their presence as the result of selective sparing of enterochromaffin elements during the process of A GVHD We did not observe them in H E stained sections Table 2 R Conclusions Apoptosis in crypt lining and pericryptal apoptosis adjacent to crypts in LP especially when associated with the features such as crypt abnormalities and reactive changes in mucosa LP and surface epithelium favor the diagnosis of A GVHD Cryptitis and crypt abscesses are not feature of A GVHD and should be differentiated from popcorn lesions which show apoptotic cells instead of neutrophils along the crypt lining and in the crypt lumen List of abbreviations A GVHD Acute graft versus host disease BMT bone marrow transplantation LP lamina propria H E
