 The Flytrap Blame Game One of the few truths universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty Currie deserves our sympathy an honest loyal civil servant dragooned into a scandal she had nothing to do with But does Currie deserve such sanctification After all she knew Clinton s history when she took her job then enabled Clinton s sleaziness anyway She stood by while Clinton cuckolded his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice And did she protest Not as far as we have heard Did she quit on principle No Currie may not be Flytrap s chief malefactor but nor is she the saintly innocent that the American public believes her to be The Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration Monica Lewinsky for example has fantastically low approval ratings much lower than Clinton s One poll I saw pegged her favorability rating at 5 percent even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25 percent Now Monica certainly isn t the heroine of Flytrap She did seduce a married man damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex lie frequently and insouciantly and blab her secret affair to anyone who d listen But she was also sexually exploited by her older sleazy boss had her reputation smeared by Clinton s lackeys and was betrayed by her friend Linda Tripp She hardly deserves such universal contempt Others besides Currie have benefited from the public s excessive generosity George Stephanopoulos has become a white knight of Flytrap the former Clinton aide who had the courage to turn on his boss And bravo to George for chastising Clinton But it smacks of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to discover in 1998 that Clinton is a lying womanizing dog He has after all known this since 1992 Back then Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton s lying denials He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions Mickey Kaus first noted Stephanopoulos unbearable sanctimony in this Chatterbox item in January And while loyalty isn t a universal good it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the moment Clinton s stock was about to plunge Sometimes of course the public s rating is dead on target Linda Tripp s allies a group that includes her lawyers Kenneth Starr the Goldberg family and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell have tried repeatedly to improve her sorry public image Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate No sale Below is Slate s entire scorecard which ranks 31 of Flytrap s key players The scale runs from 10 to 10 Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant Anything above zero rates a sympathy card This is not of course an exact science How for example do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton defenders Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton s misbehavior than The Guys in the White House Yet Lewis didn t quit in disgust Is her outrage a plus or a minus if she doesn t act on it You decide The
