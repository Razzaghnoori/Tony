                            Creative human beings are the torchbearers of civilization How does their creativity        arise What causes some mindsbrains to achieve aweinspiring artistic or scientific        achievements We cannot help but be fascinated by the fact that Shakespearea merchants        son with small Latin and less Greekcould emerge from the nowhere of rural Stratford to        create the richest literary treasure in the English language We wonder how Michelangeloa        stonecutters son who also came from a rural nowherefound within himself the vision to see        the shape of David in a block of discarded marble or the apolcalyptic fresco of         The Last Judgment on the wall of the Sistine Chapel What genetic        influences shaped their brains to createand to create these very specific wondrous things        How did their environments promote or impede them Would Michelangelo have been great        without the patronage of the Medicis or the competitive edge induced by Leonardo Great art        and great science are indeed often forged in the smithy of painwith the fire fueled by        selfdoubt obsessive preoccupation sorrow depression competition or economic        needs                The Midnight Disease The Drive to Write Writers Block and the Creative        Brain by Alice Weaver Flaherty unites two intrinsically fascinating domains of        knowledgethe workings of the brain and the nature of creativity Its author a neurologist        who has also become a writer by virtue of having published her first nonacademic book        draws on her knowledge of neuroscience her medical career as a clinician and her        experiences as a patient Early in the book she describes her own hospitalization for        manicdepressive illness a disclosure that implicitly places her in the pantheon of other        artists who have suffered from serious mental illness and provides her with        lustrebyassociation The result of all these juxtapositions is however a somewhat        disconcerting blend of popscience and popconfessional genres The author frequently talks        to us in the first person but one is not quite sure which person the neuroscientist the        doctor or the patient is actually speaking In other words this book has a jarring lack        of a strong single voice despite a knack for often finding a fine turnofphrase or a        clever word choice        Given that the book topic is promising and that the author can often write very well it        is dismaying that this book is not better than it is It is written for the intelligent lay        public many of whom avidly collect and read brain books to expand their minds Most        painful is the fact that this book is filled with factual errors glib and misleading        generalizations and careless misstatements Perhaps most shocking and most erroneous we        are told by a neurologist that The tips of the temporal lobe can be lopped off without        much changing a persons behavior HM the most famous patient to receive bilateral        temporal lobectomy remains frozen in a past linked to a neverchanging present because he        lost the capacity to retain new memories Temporal lobe syndromes are discussed more        accurately later in the book but that is a weak excuse for this early error        We are also told that manic depression is a genetically transmitted syndrome when in        fact no replicable genetic loci have yet been identified that a very high proportion of        manic depressives become writers the lifetime prevalence rate of bipolar disorder is        approximately  and only a tiny proportion of that  are writers and that        electrophysiology because it is dangerous is rarely performed electrophysiology        toolseg the study of evoked potentials or electroencephalogramsare noninvasive and        frequently used recordings of the activity of individual neurons with electrodes placed in        the gray matter are indeed rare but nothing from the context suggests that this particular        type of electrophysiology is being discussed There are many more such careless        misstatements The intelligent lay reader deserves better than this        The book raises and addresses a variety of interesting questions that have intrigued        many thoughtful people for more than two millennia What is the nature of creativity What        is the difference between skill and creativity What is the relation between mental illness        and creativity Is creativity inhibited when mental illnesses are treated What is the        relation between mind and brain The book also addresses some unique and interesting twists        on these questions Its focus is the domain of writing drawing from the authors own        experience of a compulsion to write or hypergraphia following a pyschic break What is        the relationship between hypergraphia and the brain Between writers block and the brain        Are these problems always pathological or do they sometimes enhance creativity Does that        college student who cant finish a term paper have a disease Can mindexpanding drugs        that affect the brain enhance creativity        In short         The Midnight Disease raises many important questions but fails to        address them completely and accurately There is much more to learn and much more to say        about the nature of creativity its origins in the mindbrain and in the human genome and        its boundaries with health and disease
