 In a Graveyard Spiral of Whimsy Dear Cynthia As long as we re talking about cyber protocol allow me to grouse about why computers constantly have to tell us more about their own internal activities than anybody wants to know Just signing on to check my e mail gives me the impression I might be inadvertently launching a nuclear missile Dialing Communicating at 28 800 bauds Starting PPP Authenticating all of this ending up in an inscrutable Status box with graphs and blinking lights and various pronouncements whose urgent meanings no human could ever know I m with you on MacArthur Park I m with you on Crimson and Clover but Convoy is one of those songs like The Battle of New Orleans Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport Please Mister Custer and Walter Brennan s unforgettable talking rendition of The Epic Ride of John H Glenn it s on the flip side of Old Rivers that I m just going to give a pass to This is our last exchange for the week right From this distance our discussions seem to have started out on a suitably high and somber note with the death of John Kennedy Jr but our ephemeral natures soon got the better of us Before we could move on to the Republican tax cut the Mexican banking crisis or the fate of Taiwan we found ourselves to use a phrase from this unfortunate week in a graveyard spiral of whimsy And it is only with a great effort of will that I now refrain from referring you to my new favorite publication Beer Frame The Journal of Inconspicuous Consumption and its article on the superiority of the Hydrox to the Oreo its salute to products with edible spokescharacters like the Pillsbury Doughboy Charlie the Tuna and Slim Jim and finally its definitive history of the styptic pencil styptic proclaims the editors is such an excellent word If you can top that for meaninglessness you are welcome to try In the meantime it should be stated for the record that your own book on the history of the abortion wars is a marvel of substance and you should not necessarily be judged by the lowbrow online company you ve been keeping all week With lard in my pocket yeccch Steve
