 I Have Read the Future Since the launch of Slate nearly three years ago we ve joked about how you d know when online magazines were ready for mass consumption It would be when you could take them like print magazines to the bathroom Well I m here to tell you I ve read Slate on the john Among the other places I have been reading Slate Salon an electronic version of the Wall Street Journal and the e texts of various novels and short stories in last couple of weeks Aloud to my wife in a car at night In a taxi again at night While brushing my teeth On a plane without an overhead light Standing on the subway In bed While eating Chinese food with chopsticks These are situations in which reading is ordinarily either awkward or impossible They present no challenge however to my new favorite gizmo the Rocket eBook I m not what you would call an early adopter when it comes to consumer electronics I don t have a DVD player an MP3 player or a Palm Pilot But I m ready to blow 499 on a Rocket as soon as I have to send my demo model back This chunky little device which weighs just under a pound and a half actually deserves that overused epithet revolutionary because it has the power to change something as basic to human civilization as the way people read A lot has happened since I wrote about last fall You can now actually buy two different models One is the Softbook which at 299 appears less expensive than the Rocket but actually costs more because you must commit to spending 479 on books over two years as part of the package The Softbook is a writing tablet size screen with a leather cover that gives off what someone must have imagined to be the musty scent of an old book but is actually the smell of a new shoe The Softbook s one big advantage is that you don t need a PC to use it You buy books directly from Softbook and download them into the reader via a phone line But the Softbook has two big disadvantages The first is that it s poorly designed The screen is hard to read navigating text is clumsy and the whole device has an unbalanced feel The second drawback is it doesn t work After reading a bit of preloaded text The Sea Wolf by Jack London I couldn t download anything else and my Softbook soon purged its preloaded content as well The only other person I know who has a Softbook reports a similar failure By contrast the Rocket which is made by a Silicon Valley start up called NuvoMedia is ergonomically sound with the pleasing heft of a folded over paperback The screen is superb and you get a choice of large or small print as well as a variety of lighting settings You can orient the text horizontally or vertically and position the grip for left or right handed use And because it doesn t need to be held open you can read the Rocket one handed In fact you can even prop it up and read no handed if you re eating something greasy or shaving All you need is one clean finger to click the forward and back buttons that move the text a page at a time The battery lasts for some 30 hours before needing to be recharged And while the process of getting stuff to read on the Rocket is a bit involved it actually works remarkably well First you load the Rocket software onto your PC Second you register your eBook and get an ID and a password Third you go to the Barnes Noble Web site which is but won t be for long the exclusive distributor of Rocket formatted content and make your e purchase Fourth Barnes Noble sends you an e mail message with a Web link that allows you to download what you ve purchased into the Rocket Library on your PC Fifth you transfer your book from your PC s Rocket Library to your Rocket which has 4 mb of memory enough to hold 20 medium length novels The only hitch I encountered in this procedure was that Barnes Noble took a few hours to e mail the link I needed to download books I bought I understand that this is not an uncommon problem Instant gratification is an important part of the appeal of e books and I found this delay slightly maddening There are other drawbacks of the sort you would expect from any infant technology Barnes Noble stocks only 524 eBook titles at present an unfortunately large number of them in the business and self help categories You can buy Endless Referrals Network Your Everyday Contacts Into Sales and Life Without Stress The Far Eastern Antidote to Tension and Anxiety which would seem to cancel each other out but not Uncovering Clinton or The Ground Beneath Her Feet Recent publications are gratuitously overpriced The discount price of Angela s Ashes is 10 40 in paperback 17 50 in hardcover and 20 for the eBook edition This makes no sense when you consider that the publisher has eliminated such expenses as paper printing binding warehousing distribution and returns Another advantage for publishers is that because a book is encrypted for a single user it can t be copied forwarded or resold So why are publishers setting e book list prices so high Because they fear e books even as bookstores including a sizable group of independent shops embrace them When you think about it though their positions might well be reversed If e books become a real alternative to p books publishers stand to gain by eliminating most of their fixed costs and by being able to keep everything in print forever They might even envision cutting out the middleman namely the bookstore If I retailed books I d be worried This however is only one scenario Martin Eberhard the CEO of NuvoMedia thinks booksellers will remain part of the process When s the last time you went shopping for a Simon Schuster book he asks And it might be established authors who would try to do an end run around publishers It s not clear who gets disintermediated he says T he really good news is that readers can disintermediate both publishers and booksellers and get thousands of books and magazines free Just last week Rocket released a beta version of software that lets anyone upload texts to its site creating a kind of open source library The site offers Hamlet the Art of War and Aesop s Fables among other titles But more significantly the Rocket eBook lets you download any text based content from the Web or your hard drive With the Rocket software I downloaded Daisy Miller Our Mutual Friend and some other fiction in the public domain from the Project Gutenberg Web site before a transcontinental flight Another feature I love is that you can find remembered passages by word searching these texts You can also highlight words and look them up in the pre installed Random House Dictionary though it didn t have arras which James Wood used in last week s discussion of Vladimir Nabokov in Slate s Book Club it means tapestry And I figured out how to download the full weekly text of Slate in one go by converting the Slate on Paper Microsoft Word file to the HTML format Late model word processors allow you to use the Save As function to save documents in HTML E books are going to evolve They will get lighter their screens will get more legible and their batteries will last longer Soon they may do what a related device called the Audible can do and actually read to you either via sound files or text to voice software E books may converge with other handheld devices You can use the newest palm sized organizers as talking books or readers though you wouldn t want to read a novel on one at least not yet Most important e books will get cheaper They may even be given away or sold at a token price with content purchase agreements or subscriptions on the model of cell phones But I have no doubt that they re coming And when they truly arrive I predict that the Rocket will be remembered as a landmark The first demonstration that reading a book didn t require paper ink or even an overhead light
