 Can I please have your name Tracy Blanchard And your age 19 Where are you from in Charlotte Concord OK And is there anything in particular you want to talk about Are you a Freshman Yes OK And did you like living in Charlotte all your life Um yeah It s a nice place to grow up Um I don t think I ll be able to settle down here though because most of my relatives live up north So when I graduate more than likely I ll move to Boston but Charlotte has definitely been a nice place to live I ve never experienced any problems with crime or anything like that and there s always been something for me to do like in high school or in college there s always things to go do so it s been a nice place to grow up Do you think it will be strange to move up north when you ve lived in Charlotte all your life Do you think there ll be a very big culture shock I don t know that it will be a very big culture shock because I ve grown up going to Boston all the time So it s almost like a second home It won t be too different but the style of the city is a little different so Um hmm Why wouldn t you want to stay on Charlotte Is there any particular reason I need a change I ve lived here all of my life So I need a change and Boston s the place I ve always looked to live at so Um hmm Do you feel that Charlotte has changed a lot since you were growing up here Do feel like it s changed a lot It s definitely grown Uh huh And a lot more things have come up since then for people to do So I don t know If you want to move so bad why did you go to school here Uh the reason I choose to go to school here is because my parents live around 30 minutes away and I wanted to be away from home yet be able to go home if I needed to so Uh huh Are you close to your family Yes Very close to my family I usually go home once or twice a month Don t you think that will be hard if you move all the way up there not seeing them as much Or do you feel you re ready for the change Um I ll definitely be ready for the change I ve been going up as a progress in school so I it will be a good change for me So you ll stay here for the four years and then move or would you transfer schools Um if I was able to get educational opportunities in school I would transfer but I m happy with school here with my sorority with the city with I mean I m happy with the way things are right now so probably when I graduate And what is it you want to do when you graduate I would like to look for a job in education possibly teaching elementary school um hopefully up north I would rather do that up north so How come For any particular reason I mean just mostly because my family lives up there and I enjoy being up there It won t bother you the cold weather and stuff I can say that because I m from there That won t bother you It would definitely be an adjustment but I ve been up there with the weather before and um I m not it s not hard for me to adjust to things so Do you like the weather in Charlotte Do you enjoy Oh I definitely like the weather in Charlotte so that would be kind of a shock for me to have those winters but I ll be able to adjust to it Although I do enjoy Spring and March here How was it going to high school in Charlotte Do you feel like do you think it would have been different if you had gone to school in Boston or someplace else up north I guess actually it would because in high school I was on a State cheerleading championship squad and they don t have squads like that up north as much my cousins tell me from their high school So I think it would definitely been different just because of that Do you feel like that s a Southern thing or a NC thing or Well I actually kind of having guys on a cheerleading squad in high school is more a Southern thing because my cousins in Boston had never heard of that before me so Uh huh So you feel like it s a southern thing Because in NY where I m from they do not cheerleading and that stuff isn t as big as it is down here Well that was a big part for me in high school so I definitely think it would have made a difference it I had lived up there for high school So was an important part of being in high school Oh That was my life It truly was my life in high school And it was an important aspect was there a particular crowd that hung out because of that Oh yes It was the little popular crowd you know the little we re better than everybody else crowd I hate to say that but it is true What about the people that didn t do that I mean I wasn t a particular snobby one but there were some that were so So it was the cheerleaders dated the football players Yeah It really was It was the stereotypical high school It was And do you feel like it was a good thing to grow up around No I really don t You should really give everybody a chance Just because they don t have as much money as you or they don t do the same things as you do doesn t mean they re not a good person inside The money aspect is that in your high school did that affect stuff how a person fit in or It really did because a lot of the people on my group their friends were well off They had awesome cars and they strutted around with their awesome clothes and the other people who didn t really didn t hang out with our group of friends Does that make for a lot of pressure to have a lot of money It does Because my family is by no means rich but we never had that much trouble so You always wanted to have the update styles clothes and the updated car You want to be down anymore than anybody else so Is there anything else you wanted to talk about High school or college I guess I want to say that it s been a real positive experience living here because my my mother really wants to move back up north because that s where she s from But my father loves the South so I guess it would be an adjustment for him if they moved so Charlotte s a good city it s expanding and it s getting better UNCC is a good school it s probably the right size I wouldn t want to go to a bigger school so I enjoy UNC Charlotte Well thank you for sharing your experiences with me and your time I appreciate it Tracy
