heart as it relates to tax rates for married couples Rob McIntyre E Mail to the Editors May 7 takes issue with my arithmetic While he is sadly mistaken in the former instance all marriage penalties are like God s children equally dear to my heart he may be right for all I know in the latter I do know however that my numbers have a source that has nothing to do with my admittedly arthritic arithmetic skills If McIntyre has a problem he should consult the December 2 1996 Taxing Issues column in Barron s titled Marry in Haste by the noted tax lawyer Joseph Gelband In other words consider it fact checked As for Andrew Sullivan s and Katha Pollitt s comments The Breakfast Table given Sullivan s tenure at TNR including but not limited to his brilliant editing there of Stephen Glass I will take his comments as a compliment I will resist the urge to reply to my Nation colleague Katha Pollitt s comments about me and the mother of my daughter whom she so knowledgeably characterizes without ever having been introduced Slate is not the place to air intra Nation feuds despite Katha s verbal incontinence I find it sad moreover to read the same tired tripe over and over from the pen of a writer who once appeared on her way to being a great poet and gave it all up to write a single column over and over for the past 15 years Eric Alterman Tale of the Tape Regarding the May 21 Today s Papers If Richard Nixon s but it would be wrong is really the classic example of what Safire calls tickling the wire how do you explain the fact that no hush money was raised or paid as a result of the March 1973 Watergate era tape to which you refer Nixon detractors say the desultory comments about raising money were the operative as they used to say part of the conversation Nixon defenders of which I as director of the Nixon library of course am one stress that the president said it would be wrong and that if memory serves the White House can t do it Seems that the only way to resolve such ambiguity is to see what actually happened as a result of the taped conversation Ditto one imagines with Hubbell John Taylor Affirmative Track tion As a former track wannabe and somebody with several postgraduate degrees I took exception to this egregious statement in the May 21 Today s Papers Letting slower white American runners into races just because they re white Americans is precisely analogous to letting blacks and Latinos with poor SATs and low grades into colleges just because they re blacks or Latinos There is only one criterion on which to judge road racing time posted You cannot argue about home field advantage equipment differences or help from teammates You are arguing there is only one criterion because it is precisely analogous for determining a good college student SAT scores In a road race you look to see who finished first and in determining who is eligible for race entry you go by the unbiased clock Clay Craighead Viagravation I have this overwhelming need to respond to a remark you made in the May 20 edition of Today s Papers The remark was in response to the Washington Post front page story about a possible bias by insurance companies with regard to payment for Viagra vs oral contraceptives You state that since the second paragraph says that more than half of Viagra prescriptions are being subsidized by health plans and the sixth paragraph says that slightly more than half of all birth control pills are there isn t really any bias and why do we need this story I submit to you that you are overlooking a key fact in this statistic and that is the amount of time it took to get each of those plans to subsidize the drug in question How long have birth control pills been available by prescription 20 years 25 years Yet only slightly more than half of all birth control pills are subsidized by health plans according to the Post By comparison how long has Viagra been available a month How wonderful for impotent men that in that short space of time it has already reached approximately the same level of subsidization by health plans Michele Harvey Centreville Va Antitrust and the Law In his piece Microsuits Jacob Weisberg shows he knows more about current politics than about legal history He states The question whether regulation of commerce is a state or national affair was supposed to have been settled in 1789 Of course this question was by no means settled with either the Constitution 1787 or the Bill of Rights 1789 As there were few firms large enough to cross state lines into federal jurisdiction in the 18 th century the nation s founders generally assumed the states would govern the economy Nineteenth century common law restraint of trade prosecutions fell to the state courts as did the earliest antitrust cases Federal antitrust suits could not exist until Congress enacted a federal antitrust law in 1890 and even after the question of jurisdiction remained Since the Constitution only permitted the national government to regulate commerce whole areas of economic life were outside federal jurisdiction This was the essence of the 1905 E C Knight case which held manufacturing beyond the authority of federal courts The U S Supreme Court did not enable wholesale federal intervention by defining commerce more broadly until the New Deal cases such as NLRB vs Jones and Laughlin 1937 Of course the fact that state prosecutions have a long history does not mean they are desirable On the other hand on the basis of Weisberg s article I m not certain why he finds diverse legal climates so disturbing Are we to discount such antitrust prosecutions because the attorneys general are ambitious This seems a mighty high standard for any policy Though it may be inefficient I think it reasonable that each locality can set the legal conditions of its own economic life as American states do with regard to taxation infrastructure and a thousand other economic issues Andrew Wender
