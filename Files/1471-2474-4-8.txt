 Background Statins potent compounds that inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver by blocking 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA have been reported to induce osteoblast activity and lead to bone formation both in tissue culture and in rats and mice 1 2 3 4 5 6 These findings if confirmed and extended to include humans have the potential to introduce immediate new treatment options to patients with low bone mass and osteoporosis Such treatment is readily available since an estimated 3 million patients in the US alone take statins daily to treat hyperlipidemia with few side effects 7 Osteoporosis is increasingly recognized as an eminent public health problem as the mean age of populations in most Western countries increases and costs related to osteoporosis are expected to grow six fold by the year 2040 8 Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey using a definition of osteoporosis developed by the World Health Organization estimate that in the United States up to 20 of Caucasian women over 50 have osteoporosis and up to 50 have low bone mass Non caucasian women and men tend to have lower rates of osteoporosis but contribute up to 25 of the fractures annually 9 The only bone anabolic agent known to increase bone mineral density in both animal models and clinical settings is human parathyroid hormone 1 34 PTH which has recently been approved by the FDA in patients with advance osteoporosis 10 Bone related basic and clinical research has been searching intensively for alternative anabolic agents for the treatment of osteoporosis Due to the potential clinical impact of statins as a treatment option for patients with low bone mass and osteoporosis it is essential to evaluate its anabolic activity in several in vitro and experimental animal models We have recently reported the anabolic action of PTH in an ovariectomized OVX Swiss Webster mouse model which like the rat model displays a substantial amount of trabecular bone in its femoral metaphyses and a quantifiable loss of bone following OVX 11 The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on the microarchitecture of bone in an established mouse model of osteoporosis and compare its anabolic action with PTH We also verified the presence of systemically administered simvastatin in the mouse serum as this has previously not been reported and is likely to be of critical importance when evaluating the effect of simvastatin on bone Methods Animals 72 eleven week old virgin female Swiss Webster mice were purchased from Taconic Farms Germantown NY and maintained at the animal research facility at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Animals were fed Purina Formulab Diet containing 1 Ca Formulab Richmond IN and water ad libitum throughout the experiment Mice were sacrificed by CO 2 inhalation Experimental protocol Micro computed tomography analysis For a detailed qualitative and quantitative 3 D evaluation whole femoral bones were examined by a desktop CT system CT 20 Scanco Medical AG Bassersdorf Switzerland equipped with a 10 m focal spot microfocus X ray tube as a source 12 For image acquisition the specimen was mounted on a turntable shifted automatically in an axial direction over 216 180 plus half fan angle on either side taking 600 projections To scan the entire femoral width 3 4 5 1 mm including the femoral head a total of 100 150 micro tomographic slices were acquired at a 34 m slice increment CT images were reconstructed in 512 512 pixel matrices using a standard convolution backprojection procedure with a Shepp and Logan filter Images were stored in 3 D arrays with an isotropic voxel size of 34 m A constrained 3 D Gaussian filter was used to partly suppress the noise in the volumes and the mineralized tissue was segmented from soft tissues by a global thresholding procedure 13 Morphometric parameters were determined using a direct 3 D approach 14 in three different pre selected analysis regions whole bone including the articular ends secondary spongiosa in the distal metaphysis and diaphyseal cortical bone Parameters determined in the metaphyseal trabecular bone included bone volume density BV TV bone surface density BS TV trabecular number Tb N trabecular thickness Tb Th trabecular spacing Tb Sp and connectivity density Cortical volume TV percent marrow volume MV and cortical thickness Ct Th were assessed in a 1 mm thick slab in the mid diaphysis Mass Spectrometry Bond Elut C 8 SPE cartridges 1 ml 100 mg were purchased from Varian Sample Preparation Products

100 150 ng Recovery of simvastatin and of simavastatin hydroxy acid from mouse plasma following the extraction procedure below was assessed by comparison of samples at three doses 30 80 and 150 ng which were used to spike 0 1 ml mouse plasma followed by extraction and injection into LC MS to similar doses directly injected to the LC MS The quantitation was based on integration of the area under the respective peaks in the UV spectra obtained at 240 nm approximately the max for both simvastatin and simavastatin hydroxy acid Each of the samples from the in vivo tests 0 15 ml or the recovery test above was diluted with 0 4 ml of water prior to extraction Extraction procedure This procedure was based on the previously published protocol by Wu et al 15 implementing minor modifications Each solid phase extraction cartridge 1 ml 100 mg was conditioned with Methanol water 50 50 The diluted sample see Sample preparation was loaded on to each cartridge followed by low vacuum 1 min and each cartridge was subsequently washed with 1 ml H 2 O 1 ml 5 formic acid 1 ml H 2 O and dried for 1 min Each cartridge was then eluted with 1 ml of methanol water 70 30 solution and with 1 ml of acetonitrile followed by low vacuum 1 min The combined eluates were evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac at 45 C The dry residues were reconstituted in 100 l of ammonium acetate 10 mm pH 4 0 acetonitrile 30 70 The reconstituted extracts were transferred into autosampler vials and 50 l of each sample were injected on to the LC column equivalent to 75 l of plasma sample Osteocalcin assay Blood was sampled prior to sacrifice to determine serum levels of osteocalcin OC Serum intact OC was measured by a two site immunoradiometric assay IRMA kit Immutopics Inc San Clemente CA against the mid region C terminal and amino terminal position of mouse OC with a known sensitivity of 0 1 ng mL Intra and interassay CVs were 2 3 and 4 4 respectively Statistical Analysis A power analysis was conducted in planning the experiments to determine the sufficient number of mouse femurs in this investigation A total sample size of 72 animals n 9 per treatment condition was required to provide 90 power 0 05 0 1 to detect a significant difference of 1 standard deviation effect size 1 0 between the Simvastatin PTH OVX and SHAM treatments with respect to each trabecular and cortical bone parameter using one way analysis of variance ANOVA with a two tailed significance level of 0 05 Sample size calculations were determined using the nQuery Advisor software program version 4 0 Statistical Solutions Boston MA All continuous variables were checked for normality using the Kolmogorov Smirnov goodness of fit test and were found to follow a normal distribution closely 16 Therefore results are reported in terms of means standard deviation SD Treatment groups were compared with respect to trabecular and cortical bone parameters obtained by CT by use of analysis of variance ANOVA with the Fisher least significant difference LSD method for post hoc multiple testing 17 A two tailed value of p 0 05 was established as the criterion for statistical significance Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS version 11 0 SPSS Inc Chicago IL and SAS version 6 12 SAS Institute Cary NC software packages Results Effects of OVX on bone loss Consistent with the findings in our recent study 11 CT analyses of femoral trabecular and cortical bone showed little change over the duration of the study in any of the structural variables for SHAM OVX Swiss Webster mice groups T1 SHAM T5 SHAM T13 SHAM OVX mice demonstrated significantly lower trabecular bone volume density BV TV compared to SHAM controls at 1 week 15 6 vs 26 5 P 0 001 5 weeks 5 3 vs 28 12 P 0

week study course all P 0 20 Table 1 Effect of PTH and SVS treatment on bone At 13 weeks trabecular bone volume density BV TV in mice treated with PTH alone T13 OVX PTH was 4 2 fold higher than vehicle treated animals T13 OVX VEH Table 2 PTH treatment was associated with significant increases in Tb Th and Tb N as well as an expected decrease in Tb Sp In addition significant differences in cortical MV TV and thickness were observed at 13 weeks P 0 01 Table 2 In comparison trabecular BV TV in SVS treated animals at 13 weeks T13 OVX SVS was not significantly increased over that observed in vehicle treated animals T13 OVX VEH Figure 2 Furthermore none of the other trabecular bone parameters Tb Th Tb Sp and Tb N revealed a significant difference after 13 weeks of SVS treatment when compared to T13 OVX VEH animals all P NS Table 2 Similarly whole bone volume density at T13 was higher in animals treated with PTH compared to the OVX group 76 4 vs 67 3 p 0 001 whereas SVS treatment had no significant effect 68 3 vs 67 3 p NS In addition cortical thickness evaluated at T13 was higher in the PTH treatment group compared to the OVX group 0 31 0 03 mm vs 0 26 0 02 mm p 0 001 whereas SVS treatment exhibited no effect 0 27 0 01 mm vs 0 26 0 02 mm p NS Table 2 Osteocalcin Mean serum osteocalcin OC of SHAM and OVX treated animals did not change significantly when compared at 1 5 and 13 weeks PTH treated mice however revealed an increase 596 138 ng ml over T13 OVX VEH animals 252 57 ng ml P 0 001 Figure 2 SVS treatment at 13 weeks however caused no significant increases in OC compared to T13 OVX VEH animals 309 74 ng ml vs 252 57 ng ml p NS Figure 3 Detection of the active Simvastatin hydroxy acid metabolite in mouse serum after gavage administration In this study SVS was administered by gavage and requires hepatic conversion to the metabolically active hydroxy acid SVS OH Because SVS failed to have any effect on any static CT parameter measured at either site in mouse femur we conducted separate experiments designed to detect the presence of SVS OH in mouse serum after SVS gavage by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry LC MS Reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography RP HPLC tandem electrospray ionization mass spectrometry ESI MS method published by Wu et al 15 was used to analyze samples of mouse serum for the presence of SVS and SVS OH The identity of the eluted peak in RP HPLC was established by the determination of the mass associated with it by ESI MS The retention times for SVS and SVS OH were 19 5 0 5 and 15 35 0 20 min respectively Threshold of detection on the LC MS at 240 nm AUFS 0 1 the most sensitive wavelength for both SVS and the SVS OH was 1 ng Calibration curves for both the SVS and the SVS OH extracted from the area under the curve in the HPLC profile was linear in the range of 1 150 ng These curves were used to quantitate the drug and metabolite levels in mouse plasma Based on the spiking of mouse plasma ex vivo with known amounts of drug and subjecting the samples for the extraction procedure the efficiency of drugs recovery was estimated to be 60 75 for SVS and 70 85 for SVS OH Figure 4is a representative example of the LC MS analysis of a sample collected from a mouse 30 min after treatment with 100 mg kg SVS In this sample both the RP HPLC tracing and the ESI MS analysis of the peaks corresponding to the drug and its metabolite confirm the presence of both in the serum Both residual SVS and its in situ generated metabolite SVS OH were detected in the mouse plasma as early as 10 min after gavage administration of 100 mg kg of SVS the shortest sampling interval The levels of SVS and SVS OH in the plasma 10 min after administration were 97 3 and 15 3 ng l respectively These findings establish the bioavailability of the drug following this route of administration Discussion The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Simvastatin on bone in an established mouse model of osteoporosis This Swiss Webster outbred mouse strain utilized in this study has proven to be a valuable model for investigating the efficacy of both anabolic and anti resorptive therapies for the treatment of osteoporosis Here we have used PTH as a positive control 11 and compared its effects to SVS While PTH demonstrated the expected anabolic effect on bone SVS failed to stimulate bone formation despite our verification by LC MS of the active SVS OH metabolite in mouse serum The SVS OH metabolite is first detectable in mouse serum by 10 minutes after gavage administration and serum levels of SVS OH continued to be observed by both mass spectrometric and UV measurements through the last serum samples collected at 50 minutes post gavage Other experiments failed to detect SVS OH at longer post gavage timepoints of 3 and 24 hours These data are in general agreement with studies in both rats and canines that calculate peak serum levels of SVS OH at 40 60 minutes after gavage administration 18 Thus although we failed to document any bone anabolic activity of SVS in a mouse model of OVX induced osteoporosis LC MS analysis of the SVS OH metabolite in mouse serum document the efficacy of our gavage administration of SVS to experimental mice Extrapolating from mice to humans the dose of SVS administered in this study was approximately 400 fold higher than the average dose given to humans The results suggest that Simvastatin does not enhance bone formation in this mouse model in vivo despite our ability to verify the presence of the SVS OH metabolite in mouse serum by LC MS analysis Furthermore the osteocalcin assay did not suggest any increase in osteoblast activity in SVS treated mice consistent with its failure to increase bone density It is generally accepted that the hydroxy acid form of statins are potent inhibitors of 3 hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A HMG CoA reductase an enzyme that plays a critical role in cholesterol metabolism where they block substrate accessibility to HMG CoA reductase effectively subverting cholesterol levels of HDL 19 20 21 In addition to lowering cholesterol statins seem to have a number of additional effects such as the nitric oxide mediated promotion of new blood vessel growth 22 protection against oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein as well as anti inflammatory effects and a reduction in C reactive protein levels 23 All statins limit cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids and sterols 24 Considering the enormous potential impact of statins on the treatment of osteoporosis several groups have further investigated the skeletal effects of statin use Several groups have failed to confirm the initially reported anabolic effect of systemically administered statins in vivo in rats 25 26 27 One obvious criticism of the negative data in these studies is that they did not verify the actual presence of statin in the animal serum This limitation may be of importance as Crawford et al 27 could detect an increase in cortical bone when statin was administered locally Our study demonstrated the presence of systemically administered the SVS OH metabolite in the mouse serum by LC MS analysis The exact mechanism by which statins perform their effects on bone cell function is a central issue It has been hypothesized that statins mediate their effects by increasing the expression in bone of the growth factor bone morphogenic protein 2 BMP 2 which in turn leads to osteoblast differentiation and bone formation 2 This mechanism of action has been addressed by Baumann et al in rats where the anabolic effect of lovastatin on bone was at least partially due to their inhibiting effect on osteoclast development 28 Similarly in the mouse calvaria model Gasser et al failed to detect any anabolic activity of statins in bone and suggested that the disruption of the capillary integrity and local bleeding might explain some of the previously reported bone responses 26 Several studies in humans reported a decreased risk of fracture after statin treatment 3 29 30 However larger human studies failed to confirm statins beneficial effect on bone LaCroix et al found the risk of hip and arm fracture to be similar among women who used statins and those who did not take lipid lowering medication 31 Van Staa et al examining 218 062 individuals with a fracture in the General Practice Database in the United Kingdom and found no relationship between statin use and nonspine fracture 32 Interestingly a report by Meier 3 had used the exact same database as van Staa et al 32 but sampled a much larger cohort 218 062 individuals with fracture than Meier 3940 and in addition selected an age and gender matched control patient for every fracture patient The clinical data available at the moment does not allow the conclusion that statin treatment has a postive relationship with fracture risk Similarly as described in the clinical trials the early animal studies reported data supportive of the initial findings 1 4 5 6 33 34 These results however were not substantiated in later studies in rodents where SVS had no or little effect on bone mineral density 26 However none of the studies has verified the actual presence of the active SVS OH metabolite in the animal serum as shown in this study In combination with the osteocalcin data this report provides strong evidence that simvastatin does not have an effect on bone in an established Swiss Webster mouse model of OVX induced osteoporosis Conclusion In summary the currently available data on the effects of statins on bone has done little to confirm the finding that statin therapy increases bone mass and thereby lowers fracture risk Few of the studies in animals and humans have been able to show a predictable beneficial effect on bone mass and bone turnover This report verifies the presence of the active SVS OH metabolite in the mouse serum yet failed to demonstrate any beneficial effect on bone While statins have clear effects on bone formation in vitro the formulation of existing liver targeted statins may require further refinement for efficacy on bone formation in vivo Competing interests None declared Authors contributions D von Stechow participated in the study coordination perfomed the microCT analysis and drafted
