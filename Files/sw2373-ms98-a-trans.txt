 okay was i supposed to do something no i had to press one good uh let s see so uh were we right in the Middle East sure should we have been there uh huh did we do what was correct there i think we should have stayed longer should we have fought them harder used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren t used uh i think what we did was good but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do oh you agree with Schwartzkopf who says uh Drive on into Baghdad yeah i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in Iraq out now because it s kind of like a civil war going on now And it s almost like they re killing each other off and there is not going to be anything left of Iraq at all would that be so bad was there anything there to begin with well i think i don t think it would be good if we were to completely lose it um it wasn t ours well no i just mean that that the world in general well we ve got to talk so it s just just as well we argue yeah Um i don t know i think we should have helped the the innocent people in Iraq out a little bit more than rather than just quitting where we did i agree wouldn t it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country yes But i think that s almost impossible next to impossible yeah so other political things that s going on i heard mister Bush say uh excuse me President Bush say that he uh wanted to improve the highways oh see i haven t really been keeping up with them so i really don t know what he said what did he say about it oh he wanted to take the current secondary highway system and uh huh turn it into interstates like the rest of the country we don t have the money for that but wouldn t it be wonderful It would be really nice because i m kind of tired of driving in pot holes and back east you all drive at fifty five don t you what s that oh okay um i say back east you all drive at fifty five don t you see out here in the west i m sorry i dropped the phone yeah a lot of our secondary roads are fifty five uh huh we drive sixty five oh yes well oh really oh really i uh last weekend went home to visit my parents my dad s in the hospital and uh uh huh between here and west Texas there was probably three and four hours at sixty five miles an hour oh i didn t realize that nonstop have you have you ever been out here no huh uh how far west have you been only in Ohio oh you ve never i ve never been past Ohio you ve never seen the great American desert no huh uh i ve never seen anything out i never seen the great i ve seen the Rocky Mountains i ve never seen i ve seen pictures of it but Mountains Yellowstone i ve never been there i ve seen pictures i just i m a college student and um i m paying for my own education and i m i come from a large family and we we we re never able to take vacations because there s there s twelve kids in the family so uh well my college education uh thirty six worked for Texas Instruments for seventeen or eighteen now oh my uh know virtually nothing else uh yeah i got my four year got my BS in General Science uh huh yeah i know it s a funny degree uh anyway uh i know nothing other than the west in fact uh really yeah down in east Texas where the company s located there s streams and water and things i don t understand trees and have uh huh uh huh the gulf and it s really interesting so tell me about where you live uh huh well um i m i m originally from Butler and that s about an hour away from where i am now i m at Clairon And um it s it s pretty like windy and hilly uh how high is the highest elevation oh i couldn t even tell you like uh probably it s not like a mountain it wouldn t be like a mountain it s uh three thousand foot oh i don t even know i have no clue close to sea level i would say it s closer to sea level okay uh right here in Colorado Springs where i live uh huh it s over six thousand foot oh well see um um yes when i lived in Texas every year i had to drive you know i drove every year to the gulf and you know so i could have a feast of fresh seafood uh huh six eight twelve hours away um you know just just for fresh i i m really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of America uh huh how many hours have you been from home uh the farthest away from home yes probably i d say five or six oh yeah uh huh uh now when i was growing up in the Panhandle of Texas l ook at your map later and see the the town of Amarillo uh huh fifty miles north of that up in the Panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we d drive an hour oh my oh my gosh when i was growing up now things are different and people buy jeans in town but uh huh uh we thought nothing at all of wake up waking up in the morning hopping into your car grabbing fishing poles and driving four hours oh yes Now see for me that s a long ways yeah it is i imagine uh huh even well like i i m in like a little town right now it s smaller than Butler and um Butler Butler is about an hour north east of Pittsburgh So that will give you some idea of where i m at and i m about okay okay i ll look at my map later i m about two hours north east of Pittsburgh wow how neat and uh i mean just this this little town here is basically a college town the college without the college here this town would be nothing It would be absolutely dead because it s completely made up of fast food restaurants and and in the summer when we come uh my fiancee s family lives up there we come up here in the summer and it s i mean there s just no one around so are you working your way through college um well i go home in the summer and i work in the summer and between what i make in the summer and student loans that s how i go to college well how neat what s your major finance finance uh huh well that s interesting uh huh so uh what do you plan to do with it um well like i said my fiancee savings and loans uh no No no no um my fiancee works down in D C and i d actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a something i d rather work for a company and um like be their financial advisor or something oh that would be great that would be neat let s see uh so we re all excited in Colorado Springs Apple Computer is coming to town uh huh oh really yes the uh new employer in in the city uh huh so we re expecting our local economy to take a boom a little bit uh maybe not a boom but uh at least recover to where we can all hold regular forty hour jobs still well well what would be the unemployment rate out there uh unemployment runs approximately six percent see that s what it is here too but now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent uh huh and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree yeah It s even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs yes it is i know people they are out of school for two or three years and they have a job that has nothing to do
