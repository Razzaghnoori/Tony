        okay   so regarding this proposal um personally i guess my my initial feeling is that it it would be a great experience for kids um i i dont think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community   uhhuh   through school through college i i just dont think people have that opportunity anymore   yeah probably not as much so   i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that they you know they they dont get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like theyre producing um i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they dont participate in something like this you know   right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two   umhum umhum   thats a big chunk out of someones life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned   umhum umhum   but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really   umhum   benefit anybody you know   umhum thats true   so   thats true i mean it might turn people more off than on if theyre forced to do something that they dont want to do   right   i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable   umhum   but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or   right   or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that theres a need for that   or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things   umhum umhum thats true   well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as going overseas to do something but if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now   um umhum   uh you know it could be an advantage to them   umhum i think it would be nice if they could you almost give it as course credit   um umhum   you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh people are feeling like theyre getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes   yeah yeah well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh whats going on and and really enjoy it   umhum right umhum yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program   hm   and besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if its dealing with another person you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that   yeah   you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someones relying on you you need to be there   uhhuh i think a lot of our young people need to learn that   oh its really its true   oh older ones too i know a few of those   yeah well i i work at a in a personnel agency and um ive just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting   yeah   i mean you know ill someone might not show up for work and youll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didnt feel like going to work and so i lose my job ill get another one   umhum yeah i dont understand that either thats thats tough   i i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work  you know       but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but   yeah   but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and were making them do that   yeah well another thing too is if you have uh some young people who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of   yeah umhum   taking them away from that which they are centered on might you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know its hard to say   umhum umhum umhum yeah yeah it is i dont know i think its a very interesting um discussion you know and and theres certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it   umhum   um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice and things that um you know what the problem is that now its seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i dont know remember wasnt it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year   yeah oh yeah and she didnt get around to it very much   right right or something like that and a lot of um you felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service   umhum   and i think its getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldnt be looked at as a punishment   right   it shouldnt be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did   yeah   i i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive um light towards it and have it look as something you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean thats thats a feeling i get now and     yeah   i i wouldnt want it i wouldnt want to be one of those people thats being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way   yeah yeah but i guess thats not a terrible alternative if youve you know youve done something thats not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit  so   umhum but bad enough right yeah thats true   better than ju st sitting in jail all day not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it   yeah right yeah   it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah   really important yeah thats true well this has been interesting   well i yeah enjoyed talking to you all right byebye   you too take care byebye
