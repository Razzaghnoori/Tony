 okay so regarding this proposal um personally i guess my my initial feeling is that it it would be a great experience for kids um i i don t think that they really get that sort of experience working with the community uh huh through school through college i i just don t think people have that opportunity anymore yeah probably not as much so i think it would be a great way to keep kids busy so that they you know they they don t get on the wrong track um you know so that they they have someplace to go after school and they feel like they re producing um i mean who knows what they may be doing in their free time if they don t participate in something like this you know right i guess my i you know i come out am sitting on the fence but i have some concerns about uh you know if you require someone to do this for a year or two um hum um hum that s a big chunk out of someone s life uh certainly you know there could be advantages and things to be learned um hum um hum but on the other hand you know how do you enforce it or what if they are just totally against it then does it really um hum benefit anybody you know um hum that s true so that s true i mean it might turn people more off than on if they re forced to do something that they don t want to do right i guess a year is a long time maybe six months might be a little bit more reasonable um hum but i can see a lot of benefits in that it might uh interest some people that had never thought of maybe going into social work or right or that sort of thing um and gosh we all know that there s a need for that or might teach them a little more empathy towards those who you know have problems and need help with things um hum um hum that s true well i was thinking too um we usually think of the Peace Corps as going overseas to do something but if they required this where you stay in the US and you know benefit the people here and perhaps too the fact that we have more elderly people now um um hum uh you know it could be an advantage to them um hum i think it would be nice if they could you almost give it as course credit um um hum you know um have it be just like real life teaching in a sense and maybe then uh people are feeling like they re getting something out of it too but that certainly everyone else would be getting something out of them participating and and i mean i i even think that that sort of experience is worth a lot more than reading a textbook sometimes yeah yeah well and probably too even those who might initially be opposed once they got into it then they you know would see that hey this this is giving me some benefit as well i mean they they might not express it in words so much but just sort of get in step with with uh what s going on and and really enjoy it um hum right um hum yeah when i was in college i worked um with a group and i actually ran a Big Brother Big Sister program hm and besides just you know having this extracurricular thing i really noticed that it gave people a sense of commitment you know they learned that they need to if they make a a if they have a responsibility especially if it s dealing with another person you know someone else might be relying on them for something um you know depending on them to either be somewhere or take someone someplace or something like that yeah you know that that you really learn to to be dependable you know you learn that when someone s relying on you you need to be there uh huh i think a lot of our young people need to learn that oh it s really it s true oh older ones too i know a few of those yeah well i i work at a in a personnel agency and um i ve just found the work ethics of people to be disgusting yeah i mean you know i ll someone might not show up for work and you ll call them and oh they overslept or oh they just didn t feel like going to work and so i lose my job i ll get another one um hum yeah i don t understand that either that s that s tough i i i know i mean i wish i was lucky enough to not want to work you know but um i mean perhaps that this sort of training early in life before people develop bad habits might not be such a bad idea but yeah but you know it is it is a commitment and perhaps these people would rather be doing something else just as constructive and we re making them do that yeah well another thing too is if you have uh some young people who are really gifted and who are leaning towards maybe the uh math and science and that sort of thing which they say we have a shortage of yeah um hum taking them away from that which they are centered on might you know be a a bad thing to take a couple years out of beginning you know their life in that respect they might you know get off on some other track but you know it s hard to say um hum um hum um hum yeah yeah it is i don t know i think it s a very interesting um discussion you know and and there s certainly uh lots of pros and cons around it um hum um i i wish i had that sort of choice i mean maybe maybe it could end up being a choice and things that um you know what the problem is that now it s seen as almost a punishment like when somebody um i don t know remember wasn t it Zsa Zsa Gabor that had to do community service work for like a year yeah oh yeah and she didn t get around to it very much right right or something like that and a lot of um you felonies felony people you know have to do this sort of community service um hum and i think it s getting the wrong sort of uh um connotation with it it shouldn t be looked at as a punishment right it shouldn t be looked at something to do to make up for other things that you did yeah i i think it needs to be community service needs to have more of a positive um light towards it and have it look as something you know that you did because you wanted to do it because you saw the benefits out of it and not as something that you know oh you you did it instead of going to jail for three months or something like that i mean that s that s a feeling i get now and yeah i i wouldn t want it i wouldn t want to be one of those people that s being taken care of somehow knowing that this person is doing it to get out of a sentence or or you know because they were bad in some other way yeah yeah but i guess that s not a terrible alternative if you ve you know you ve done something that s not too terrible but they want to slap your hand a little bit so um hum but bad enough right yeah that s true better than ju st sitting in jail all day not doing anything but but yeah i agree with your point it yeah right yeah it might not make the other person feel like you were really wanting to be there yeah really important yeah that s true well this has been interesting well i yeah enjoyed talking to you all right bye bye you too take care bye bye
