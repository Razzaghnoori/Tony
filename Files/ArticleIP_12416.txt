 Restoration Joe s A new kind of chain store has emerged to cater to affluent baby boomers who think of themselves as practical but who are easily gulled into buying things for which they have no obvious practical need It is a store that knows yuppie materialism is a kind of materialism that thinks of itself as anti materialistic because yuppies tend to confuse their restless pursuit of Authenticity when purchasing retail goods with an indifference to material things It is a store that takes everyday items and buffs them up just enough that they seem like luxury items and yet usually keeps prices relatively low It is a store that if you happen to be an affluent baby boomer understands more about you and the things that give you pleasure than you understand yourself The typical posture of such an enterprise is that it is to quote promotional material for REI a popular chain of camping gear stores more than a store It is a community You may wander into Borders bookstore without a thought in the world of buying anything except perhaps a cup of coffee Should you happen amid your browsing to find something you want to purchase the store will labor to treat it as an unexpected windfall At the more aggressive and youthful end of the spectrum Urban Outfitters turns its stores into theatrical sets suitable for staging the works of Eug ne Ionesco J Peterman a catalog retailer with a few stores here and there goes so far as to make its products seem incidental to the spirit they re meant to evoke The company describes a 345 cream colored silk jacket thusly in its catalog The photograph on the dust jacket of her book shows her in jeans and blazer standing at the edge of a deep canyon inherited from her father The book itself is serious perceptive skirting the edges of hilarity and terror You d never guess she s a lethal player of poker But the book doesn t go into any of that the congenial barge trips on rivers in France the innocent trips down the Nile the lucrative transatlantic crossings making grown men cry As this passage suggests a common theme in these stores is camp nostalgia Another is the soullessness of retail as practiced by the nonelect I think that giant American corporations should start asking themselves if the things they make are really I mean really better than the ordinary the eponymous Mr Peterman avers on his catalog s first page under the heading Philosophy Two chains in particular excel at this new style of retailing Trader Joe s and Restoration Hardware Although they position themselves as practicality stores you d never visit them to buy more Jell O for the kids or a molly bolt to hang a new warehouse lamp Rather they invite you to question the underlying assumptions behind your everyday needs and to reorder those needs Both stores are somewhat difficult to classify Trader Joe s sells food but it isn t really a grocery store The traditional grocery store handles between 25 000 and 40 000 items says Trader Joe s spokeswoman Michele Gorski We handle between 1 500 and 2 000 But don t think of it as a gourmet shop because it s bigger and less pricey than most gourmet shops When the prices are high the store is quick to make a joke of it as it does with its private label Really Expensive Authentic Handcrafted frozen chicken burrito which sells for 2 19 Similarly Restoration Hardware calls itself a hardware store and stocks a few items that might legitimately be termed hardware multiple head carbine screwdrivers fold up pliers flashlights with old metallic ribbing etc But these items along with a sprinkling of kitchen ware gardening supplies and whimsical doodads such as an old fashioned hand warmer are essentially the amuse bouches served up before the main course which is a sleigh bed a leather and cherry bentwood recliner or some other hunk of massive retro furniture Restoration Hardware is a home furnishings store for people who think of themselves as too austere for such fripperies but really aren t Both chains present themselves as bucking the aesthetic and moral poverty of corporate America Joe Coulombe started Trader Joe s in 1958 as the Pronto chain of convenience stores in Los Angeles A decade later Coulombe reoriented the stores toward gourmet foods offered at cut rate prices Eventually the store ceased to carry lines of goods at all instead selling mostly private label versions of a few staples corn flakes olive oil and more exotic goods such as British style crumpets and carbonated water blended with elderflowers The chain guarantees that if any item can be found cheaper elsewhere it will stop carrying it We like to suggest that some of our best customers are unemployed Ph D s says Gorski These are knowledgeable people that have traveled and read but they re still looking for a bargain Gorski has no secretary neither she says do the company s CEO and two presidents Such austere commitment to Quality and Value would be easier to commend wholeheartedly if it didn t reek quite so much of snob appeal One has to remind oneself that this is an enterprise whose ultimate goal is monetary profit Who owns Trader Joe s anyway Coulombe sold out in 1979 and retired in 1988 Although the chain preserved his hokey South Pacific d cor and still touts the chain s goods in its eccentric fearless flyers illustrated with 19 th century pen and ink clip art no less it treats the identities of its new owners as some sort of state secret When pressed Gorski says they are European and that she s met them Clippings from the Los Angeles Times and U S News World Report identify the owners as the Albrechts a German family that owns about 10 percent of Albertson s a U S supermarket chain What Trader Joe s is owned by supermarket people Say it ain t so R estoration Hardware s origins smack more distinctly of counterculture rebellion The company which is now traded publicly was started in 1980 by a psychologist named Stephen Gordon who was restoring a Queen Anne style house in Eureka Calif and found it maddeningly difficult to locate the period style fixtures he needed Finally he started selling the stuff himself The company s Web page depicts him as a Cincinnatus of retailing one who did not set out to found a retail group but did so as a result of one of his passions the discovery of fine craftsmanship and design Like Trader Joe s Restoration Hardware does not carry lines but rather selects individual items that seem to capture the store s spirit many of which are made exclusively for the chain The presentation of these items is hushed and museumlike with just dash of whimsy The little identifying cards psychologist Gordon sets beside each item display an impressive mastery of the manipulative arts FOUR GENERATIONS OF MAINE FISHERMEN COULD BE WRONG BUT WE DOUBT IT reads a card beside four sizes of woven metal baskets in Restoration Hardware s Georgetown store To refrain from purchasing one would insult the working class and dishonor the labor of our fathers fathers Hey we like you secretly covet recliners purrs the card beside a 1952 style Metro Finer Recliner priced at 990 But there are only a few of us who possess a stout enough psychological profile to allow ourselves or even imagine ourselves purchasing a big cushy wonder boy or girl reclining chair Let s pause for a moment to map the nuances of that pitch 1 Snob appeal We all know recliners are tacky 2 Sympathy And yet you secretly desire one so you can capture some magical moments from your childhood 3 Challenge Dare you rise to the occasion like Raskolnikov and reject the petty rules that govern lesser men 4 Smugness You may be buying your dad s chair but you are not going to play that gender dominance game that he played It s your wife s chair too Wonder boy indeed The editors of the Baffler a little magazine of cultural criticism have coined an extremely handy term to describe the spirit of stores like Restoration Hardware and Trader Joe s Commodify your dissent In a book of essays with that title the process of turning counterculture rebellion into profit making opportunity that does absolutely nothing to challenge the status quo is described in various settings such as Nike which used William S Burroughs to sell sneakers and the films of Quentin Tarantino always hip but scrupulously content free In the case of Restoration Hardware and Trader Joe s the dissent hence the commodification is a bit more subtle and has more to do with the harnessing of postgrad hauteur mingled with a longing for simpler times But in both stores one is similarly invited to live out vain fantasies about who one is or should be The spell is broken only when you leave the store realize that you ve just bought 200 worth of merchandise and understand you re just another schmuck consumer
