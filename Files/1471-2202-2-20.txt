 Background Estrogen as a neuroprotective and neurotrophic factor 1 influences memory and cognition 1 2 2 attenuates the extent of cell death resulting from brain injuries i e from cerebrovascular stroke and neurotrauma 1 2 3 4 5 and 3 decreases the risk and delays the onset of neurological disorders such as Alzheimer s disease 4 5 Numerous studies indicate that estrogen is essential for optimal brain function 1 2 3 4 5 as estrogen has been shown to increase cerebral blood flow 1 2 3 4 5 act as an anti inflammatory agent 1 2 3 4 5 and enhance activity at neuronal synapses 1 2 3 4 5 Through a variety of mechanisms estrogen strongly influences memory and cognition a type of cognition which is especially dependant on gonadal hormones i e estradiol is visual spatial memory VSM 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 In learning and memory tasks which require the use of visual spatial cues males acquire and exhibit superior performance to females 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 This sex difference in rats has been attributed to the hormonal influence of estrogen presumably by way of its in situ conversion from testosterone by the aromatase enzyme in brain 19 20 21 22 and is observable morphologically in visually spatial critical brain areas i e frontal cortex hippocampus 15 16 17 In this regard endocrine disrupters are environmental chemicals that mimic or modulate the physiological effects of steroid hormones especially that of estrogens 23 24 Of all of the considered estrogenic endocrine disrupters examined thus far phytoestrogens have been extensively studied 23 24 however little research has been conducted examining VSM in relationship to phytoestrogens Phytoestrogens are plant compounds that are structurally and functionally similar to estradiol and have the ability to selectively bind estrogen receptors estrogen receptor greater than estrogen receptor 25 Phytoestrogens have received increased investigative attention due to their potential protective effects against age related diseases e g cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and hormone dependent cancers i e breast and prostate cancer 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 These estrogen like molecules with a diphenolic nonsteroidal structure are found in many plants but are especially abundant in soy products 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 which are used as the major protein source in all natural ingredient commercially available rodent diets ranging from 200 to 600 g phytoestrogens gram diet 36 38 Therefore animals ingesting these diets are continually exposed to endocrine active compounds 36 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 The available research regarding cognitive function and phytoestrogens suggests that large amounts of phytoestrogens consumed as tofu have an adverse influence on cognitive ability in men where decreased brain weight increased ventricular size and dementia have been reported 44 In ovariectomized female rats on the other hand phytoestrogen treatments resulted in a dose dependent improvement of VSM 45 This improvement in cognitive ability in phytoestrogen treated females may be due in part to the increased presence of choline acetyltransferase messenger RNA in the frontal cortex which has been shown to be associated with protection and enhancement of cognitive function 45 Furthermore we have shown that phytoestrogens significantly affect the brain calcium binding protein calbindin CALB which acts as a buffer by binding intracellular calcium and plays an important role in mediating cell proliferation programmed cell death apoptosis and neurotoxicity 48 49 50 51 52 This neuroprotective mechanism via CALB appears to be important in neurological disorders such as Parkinson s disease and Huntington s disease 48 49 50 51 52 Additionally Cyclooxygenase 2 COX 2 seems to play an important role in mediating functional neuronal maturation and responses to certain stimuli in the brain 53 54 55 The expression of COX 2 is associated with key pathophysiologic events in Alzheimer s disease deposition of beta amyloid protein in neuritic plaques within the hippocampus and cortex 53 54 55 Of particular importance to this study is the fact that COX 2 has been shown to be influenced by steroidal hormones 53 54 55 Therefore the expression of COX 2 in the frontal cortex may also be hormonally regulated and relevant to cognitive decline The design of this study was to examine the influence of phytoestrogens present via soy in rodent diets on VSM in three separate experiments utilizing radial arm maze methods to examine varying aspects of memory Additionally brain regions critical for diverse parameters of VSM working vs reference memory were assayed to determine phytoestrogen CALB and COX 2 levels Our laboratory has previously reported the phytoestrogen levels in the diets used in this study and circulating plasma and brain phytoestrogen levels obtained in rats exposed to these diets 39 40 41 42 43 Notably we have shown that rats fed the Phyto 600 diet have phytoestrogen plasma levels similar to that of a human Asian population consuming high amounts of soy protein per day and the low levels of plasma phytoestrogens from the Phyto free diet fed animals are reflective of a Western population where soy foods are rarely consumed 22 40 42 Therefore we have established an animal model that approaches the human population in circulating plasma phytoestrogen levels based upon consumption of these phytoestrogen soy rich vs soy free diets Results Acquisition of the Radial Arm Maze shaping to criterion Experiment 1 Males fed the Phyto 600 diet lifelong required significantly more trials 1 trial day to acquire the maze than males fed the Phyto free diet lifelong t 30 2 118 p 0 05 see figure 1a Experiment 2 In a separate study in complete opposition to experiment 1 in experiment 2 phytoestrogens within diet significantly altered acquisition of the maze in females Females fed the Phyto 600 diet lifelong acquired the maze in significantly fewer trials than did females fed the Phyto free diet lifelong t 30 2 173 p 0 05 These results are presented in figure 1b Experiment 3 In this study male and female rats were examined together Examining sexually dimorphic VSM in animals fed the Phyto 600 diet males acquired the maze in significantly fewer trials than females F 1 22 16 58 p 0 05 before the diet switch As can be seen in figure 2 males acquired the maze on average 4 days earlier than females Eight Arm Task Experiments 1 2 Dietary phytoestrogens did not alter working memory as assessed by the 8 arm task in either females or males p 0 05 respectively data not shown when these animals by diet were tested separately by sex Therefore an across sex by diet comparison was not appropriate for these separate data sets Experiment 3 When males and females were tested within the same experiment and exposed to the same diet Phyto 600 again before the diet switch consistent with previous reports on sexual dimorphism in the radial arm maze males performed with more accuracy than females in the 8 arm task A significant sex difference was found on maze performance in the 8 arm task p 0 05 Males entered significantly more correct arms than females during trials 1 2 5 6 and trials 9 10 These results are presented in figure 3 Experiment 3 Four Arm Task baited unbaited In contrast on the 4 arm task male VSM dominance appeared to be dependant upon diet or after the diet switch Multivariate analysis of variance resulted in a significant interaction of sex and diet p 0 05 see figure 4 The Phyto 600 diet improved performance in females while hampering performance in males Further analysis via post hoc comparisons revealed that Phyto 600 females made significantly more correct arm choices than females switched to the Phyto free diet during trial 10 12 p 0 05 and Phyto 600 males on trials 10 12 and 13 15 p 0 05 Males switched to the Phyto free diet displayed significantly more correct arm choices than females switched to the Phyto free diet trials 7 9 and 13 15 p 0 05 and lifelong fed Phyto 600 males trials 10 12 and 13 15 p 0 05 These results are shown in figure 4 Further multivariate statistical analysis and post hoc comparisons were used to identify differences in errors committed in the radial arm maze These data revealed a significant interaction of sex and diet on the incidence of reference errors during trials 10 12 and 13 15 p 0 05 but no significant differences in working or working reference errors p 0 05 Pairwise comparisons revealed that lifelong fed Phyto 600 males committed significantly more reference memory errors than males switched to the Phyto free diet and lifelong fed Phyto 600 females p 0 05 data presented in figure 5a Additionally in analyzing the amount of time required for subjects to enter the first 4 arms in a given trial it was found that a significant diet effect independent of sex was apparent where animals fed the Phyto 600 diet traveled through the maze significantly faster than animals fed the Phyto free diet trials 10 12 p 0 05 figure 5b Brain Content Phytoestrogen Levels Brain phytoestrogen levels are displayed in Table 1 In general in all brain regions examined except the hippocampus Phyto 600 fed males displayed significantly higher phytoestrogen levels compared to Phyto free fed males In the amygdala phytoestrogen levels were 3 fold higher in Phyto 600 males compared to Phyto free values Whereas in the hippocampus there was not a significant difference between the Phyto 600 and Phyto free fed males However when the frontal cortex and cerebellum were examined where an abundance of ER receptors are present Phyto 600 males displayed a 47 fold and 9 fold higher phytoestrogens levels respectively compared to Phyto free male values In each brain site examined except the cerebellum the major phytoestrogen metabolite was equol and there were relatively low levels of daidzein and genistein Frontal Cortex and Hippocampal Calbindin The frontal cortical CALB results are displayed in figure 6 The abundance of CALB from male Phyto 600 rats was significantly lower than males on the Phyto free diet F 1 10 30 7 p 0 05 This suggests that high levels of dietary phytoestrogens significantly decreased frontal cortical CALB levels in male rats however in females there was no significant diet effect on CALB levels and the band intensities were similar to males fed the Phyto 600 diet In examining hippocampal CALB levels between Phyto 600 vs Phyto free fed males there were no significant alterations in CALB levels in the CA 1 CA 3 or dentate gyms regions by the diet treatments data not shown Frontal Cortex COX 2 Western analysis of the same frontal cortex samples as performed for the CALB Western analysis revealed significantly lower COX 2 levels in Phyto free males compared to Phyto 600 males F 1 10 30 7 p 0 05 These results are presented in figure 7 This suggests that high levels of dietary phytoestrogens significantly increased the abundance of COX 2 in the male rat frontal cortex In females similar to the CALB results above there was no significant diet effect on COX 2 levels and the band intensities were almost identical to that of male Phyto free values Note Due to the low abundance of phytoestrogens in the hippocampus in both diet treatments analysis of COX 2 was not preformed Furthermore in preliminary experiments hippocampal COX 2 signals via Western analysis were too weak to quantify Discussion Phytoestrogen research has grown rapidly in recent years due to its potential health benefits in preventing age related and hormone dependent cancers 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 In contrast very little research has been conducted to identify phytoestrogen effects on cognitive behavior Because phytoestrogens are present in virtually all natural ingredient rodent diets that use soy as a source of protein 36 38 and since these compounds are endocrine active 27 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 it is important to determine whether the amounts present in rodent diets are sufficient to affect sexually dimorphic spatial ability The present study addressed these issues in part by investigating the influence of dietary phytoestrogens present in a normal rodent diet on visual spatial ability In tasks requiring the use of spatial skills a sexually dimorphic difference has been consistently demonstrated in which males reliably outperform females 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 This sex difference is most likely due to the presence of testosterone or more likely its metabolite estradiol in brain 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Because phytoestrogens have the ability to bind estrogen receptors and alter many of the biological responses that are evoked by physiological estrogens 25 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 we determined phytoestrogens affects on VSM in adult rats Measurements of accuracy in acquisition determined as trials required for shaping to a predetermined criterion of the radial maze were diet dependent in that males in experiment 1 fed the phytoestrogen free diet and females in experiment 2 fed the phytoestrogen rich diet acquired the maze in fewer days than females or males fed the alternate diet It should be noted that the dietary effects on body weight are the same for both male and female rats and therefore do not account for the sexually dimorphic maze performance 39 There was however no significant dietary effects observed in the 8 arm task performance in either males experiment 1 or females experiment 2 Measures of accuracy on the baited unbaited four arm task experiment 3 demonstrated that a diet change in young adult animals a change from Phyto 600 to Phyto free had a positive influence on the accuracy in males but a negative influence on the accuracy in females In a companion paper the impact of hormonal manipulation and dietary phytoestrogens influence on VSM is examined and validates several aspects of the findings from the present study The discrepancies in maze performance were expressed in two ways 1 Phyto 600 males exposed lifelong to the diet committed more reference errors than males switched to the Phyto free diet and 2 lifelong Phyto 600 fed males and females had increased mobility within the maze which seemed to be advantageous to females but disruptive to males It is intriguing to speculate that the increase in reference errors but not working or working reference errors suggests that disruption of maze performance is occurring within the frontal cortex but not the hippocampus of lifelong Phyto 600 fed males The drop in performance is directly correlated to phytoestrogen levels in brain and the effects of phytoestrogens on brain CALB and COX 2 levels in that phytoestrogens were identified as having a negative relationship with CALB 0 942 and a positive relationship with COX 2 0 974 In all other studies conducted previously the determination of phytoestrogens in the diet circulating in plasma and especially in brain have not been performed together The exception to this line of investigation has been our laboratory where in general we obtained similar values previously to those quantified in the present study 39 42 when overlapping diet exposure and brain regions were examined in Long Evans and Sprague Dawley rats 40 51 As reported phytoestrogens were 47 times higher in the frontal cortex of Phyto 600 vs Phyto free fed males where there is an abundance of ER receptors 2 while phytoestrogen levels were similar in these animals in the hippocampal region Furthermore males fed the Phyto 600 diet displayed a significant decrease in frontal cortical CALB levels in comparison to males receiving the Phyto free diet As CALB plays an important role in regulating intraneuronal cellular calcium which protects against neurodegenerative disease and defends against apoptosis 48 49 50 51 52 a decrease in frontal cortex CALB may result in cognitive impairment due to cell death or abnormal calcium homeostasis 48 49 50 51 52 Furthermore frontal cortical COX 2 was shown to significantly increase in males fed the Phyto 600 diet Because the expression of COX 2 is associated with key pathophysiologic event s in Alzheimer s disease 53 54 55 the significant increase in COX 2 expression in the frontal cortex may be relevant to the cognitive decline seen in the Phyto 600 males In this regard it is known that the hormonal action of estrogens may be mediated by the differential expression of estrogen receptors alpha vs betta in brain structures that activate or inhibit cell death mechanisms 56 Although this parameter was not directly investigated in this study the differing influence that dietary phytoestrogens had on CALB significant decrease and COX 2 significant increase in the male frontal cortex suggests that phytoestrogens may activate programmed cell death In support of this notion since the Phyto 600 fed males displayed a 47 fold greater phytoestrogen levels in the frontal cortex vs Phyto free males and the greater affinity of phytoestrogens is for ER ER it has been shown that estrogen related neuronal apoptosis is determined by ER and the Fas Fas ligand system 57 In fact isoflavones have been shown to cause apoptosis in rat primary cortical neurons in vitro via a calcium dependant mechanism 58 Furthermore the action of phytoestrogens may be tissue site specific As our results show phytoestrogens are more prevalent and have greater affinity for certain brain structures and areas therefore phytoestrogens may act both as agonist and antagonist in a site specific manner or in other words as natural SERM type molecules 35 38 39 40 41 42 Taken together these findings suggest that soy dietary phytoestrogens present in the animal diets or the lack thereof for a relatively short interval even in young adult animals can significantly influence sexually dimorphic cognitive behavior Dietary phytoestrogens sex reversed VSM as expressed in the radial arm maze by enhancing spatial memory in females but inhibited this ability in males this finding corresponds to research regarding increased dementia observed in aged men consuming high tofu levels 44 However while it is important to establish the influence of dietary phytoestrogens on brain function and behavior in animal models the true significance in humans remains to be determined as it relates to the present findings Finally as established by the above findings of particular importance which deserves emphasis is that the Phyto 600 diet used in this study is a typical rat chow formulation that is similar to other rodent diet products that are used in many laboratories whereas phytoestrogen free Phyto free diets are rarely used As previously reported Thigpen et al 38 and Brown and Setchell 36 determined the source and concentration of phytoestrogens in rodent diets The results of this study showed that phytoestrogen concentrations vary widely among diets between 200 g g and 600 g g of phytoestrogens Additionally one of our laboratories has quantified phytoestrogen plasma levels in a variety of physiologic conditions validating the importance of soy derived phytoestrogens via rodent chow diets 36 Therefore not all diets have the same phytoestrogen levels however all diets which have soy as their main protein source contain phytoestrogens It is very unusual to consider the influence of diet in hormone sensitive research investigations This may be a critical error due to the complicating and or confounding role phytoestrogens play For example we have previously shown that soy dietary phytoestrogens significantly alter body weight food and water intake levels puberty onset in females and prostate weights 39 Also we have preliminary unpublished data demonstrating the effects of soy derived phytoestrogens on several endocrine and metabolic parameters However brain aromatase and circulating plasma estradiol levels in male rats does not appear to be influenced by dietary phytoestrogens 22 41 51 As the results from this research imply phytoestrogens have considerable effects on hormonally sensitive parameters and their influence may be in part responsible for many reported sexual dimorphisms such as the establishment and plasticity of sexually dimorphic brain structures like the sexually dimorphic nucleus of the preoptic area SDN POA and the anteroventral periventricular nucleus AVPV 40 41 Therefore dietary soy derived phytoestrogens can influence brain cognition and memory in a manner that was previously unknown where soy phytoestrogens enhance memory in intact females but inhibit memory in intact males Further research is warranted in order to examine this important and growing research field of endocrine disruptors to determine the true significance of phytoestrogens influence that appears to be hormonal and gender dependent Conclusions Male rats acquire and exhibit significantly better performance compared to females in learning and memory task requiring the use of visual spatial cues This study examined the influence of phytoestrogens present in rodent diets on VSM and identified phytoestrogens CALB and COX 2 expression in the rat brain Within the radial arm maze dietary phytoestrogens significantly sex reversed the normal sexually dimorphic expression of VSM Specifically in tasks requiring the use of reference but not working memory VSM was enhanced in females fed the Phyto 600 diet whereas in males VSM was inhibited by the same diet It was determined via TR FIA that males fed the Phyto 600 diet had significantly higher levels of phytoestrogens in a number of brain regions frontal cortex hypothalamus cerebellum but not hippocampus compared to males fed the Phyto free diet Since reference memory is thought to be mediated in the frontal cortex and because males fed the Phyto 600 diet had decreased expression of CALB a neuroprotectant factor and increased COX 2 an inflammatory factor prevalent in Alzheimer s disease levels in this brain region compared to males fed the Phyto free diet these findings suggest that phytoestrogens present in soy dietary sources may alter VSM via there presence and action in the frontal cortex Materials and Methods Experiment 1 examined males while Experiment 2 examined females Experiment 1 and 2 were conducted independent of each other however they were conducted at similar time intervals and each study used the same diet treatment and maze procedure see below Animals Ten 50 day old Long Evans females were purchased from Charles River Laboratories Wilmington MA USA for breeding These animals were caged individually and housed in the Brigham Young University Bio Ag vivarium and maintained on a 10 hour dark 14 hour light schedule lights on 1400 0400 The animals and methods for these studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC at Brigham Young University Upon arrival all animals were allowed ad libitum access to either a commercially available diet with high phytoestrogen levels Harlan Teklad Rodent Diet 8604 Madison WI USA containing 600 micrograms of phytoestrogens gram of diet referred to hereafter as the Phyto 600 diet or a custom phytoestrogen free diet referred to hereafter as the Phyto free diet obtained from Ziegler Bros Gardner PA USA and water For the Phyto free diet the phytoestrogen concentrations were below the detectable limits of HPLC analysis 40 The content and nutrient composition of these diets are described in detail elsewhere 40 At 80 85 days of age the animals were time mated within their respective diet treatments so that the offspring of these pairings would be exposed solely to either the Phyto 600 or Phyto free diet Thirty days following birth the animals were weaned and separated by sex into colony cages 4 animals per cage males were tested in experiment 1 whereas females were tested separately in experiment 2 The animals were fed the same diet as their mother Phyto 600 or Phyto free At 40 days of age animals were singly caged and remained on the assigned diet treatments Experiment 3 Animals Male and female rats utilized in experiment 3 received lifelong exposure to only the Phyto 600 diet using a diet treatment design similar to that described above for experiments 1 and 2 However the diet treatments were switched after acquisition and eight arm maze procedures see below in order to examine the plasticity of visual spatial memory performance in adult animals Apparatus Maze procedure acquisition and eight arm task working memory examining animals in Experiments 1 2 and 3 At 50 days of age rats males tested in experiment 1 or females tested in experiment 2 were put on a limited feeding schedule and maintained at approximately 90 of normal body weight however animals were allowed to gain an additional 5 g per week to account for normal growth One week later the rats were introduced to the radial arm maze On 3 consecutive days each rat was placed into the maze for 5 minutes to explore Following this introduction rats were placed alone in the center of the maze Three Froot Loops FL were placed at the start of each arm If the rat retrieved FL from at least 5 of the piles within 3 minutes then on the following day a single FL was placed at the start of each arm If 5 of the 8 FL were retrieved within 3 minutes then the following day a single FL was placed 5 cm further out on the arms In this manner the FLs were gradually placed farther and farther out on the arms in a systematic manner Training was completed for a given rat when it retrieved FLs from the end of at least 5 of the 8 arms within 3 minutes on 3 consecutive trials The number of trials required to reach this criterion was recorded for each rat Once this criterion level was reached for a given rat it was tested on this task for 10 additional trials one day Each trial was considered complete when all 8 arms were visited or 3 minutes had passed An arm choice was scored if the rat traveled three fourths of the way down the length of an arm A working memory error was recorded if an animal reentered a previously visited arm Following the eight arm task the animals in experiments 1 and 2 were sacrificed and blood was taken to determine circulating phytoestrogen levels and brain samples were collected for CALB and COX 2 determination In experiment 3 following the 8 arm task trials described above these animals were returned to their home cages and a dietary change was initiated One half the total number of male or female random cycling rats was kept on the original Phyto 600 diet long term and the other half was assigned to the Phyto free diet short term This ad lib feeding continued for 15 days Following this ad lib period of feeding rats were again reduced to 90 of normal body weight for 10 days Maze procedure four arm task reference and working memory examining animals in experiment 3 Following the reduction to 90 of normal body weight each rat was tested for an additional 15 days one trial day during which only 4 arms were baited four arm task To begin these trial each animal was placed in a bottomless opaque box in the center of the maze The box was removed opening all arms simultaneously to the rat These trials were considered complete when the 4 baited arms arms 2 3 6 and 8 had been visited or 3 minutes had passed During all trials the amount of time required to visit the initial 4 arms and the order that each rat entered the arms were recorded Again an arm entry was noted if a rat traversed at least three fourths the length of the arm A working memory error was recorded if a rat reentered a baited arm a reference memory error was recorded if an animal entered an arm which was not baited and a working reference memory error was recorded if an animal reentered an arm which was not baited All testing and analysis was accomplished without knowledge of the diet treatments Circulating phytoestrogen levels The concentration and types of phytoestrogens in collected plasma samples were analyzed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry GC MS as previously performed in our laboratories 28 40 51 This was accomplished by liquid solid extraction and liquid gel chromatographic techniques to isolate the phytoestrogen fractions using standard assay methods with internal controls 28 Brain calbindin COX 2 and phytoestrogen levels In Long Evans rats brains tissues were collected for phytoestrogen CALB and COX 2 analysis Brain phytoestrogen concentrations i e daidzein genistein and equol were determined in tissues isolated from the frontal cortex and hippocampus brain structures critical for VSM along with the amygdala and cerebellum brain regions by time resolved fluoroimmunoassay TR FIA using standard methods based on previously published and validated methods for plasma and urine 59 60 The brain tissue method in brief follows The brain samples were lyophilized pooled by treatment n 4 per group from male rats used as breeders that were on the diet treatments from 50 to 120 days of age Following addition of 300 l of water and mixing the samples were left at room temperature for 10 min and thereafter carefully mixed and sonicated for 10 min Tritiated estradiol glucuronide was added as an internal standard and 700 l of methanol were mixed with samples Fatty material was precipitated overnight at 20 C The samples were then centrifuged 3500 rpm for 10 min at 10 C and the supernatant was decanted into another tube The procedure was repeated by adding an additional 1 ml ice cold 70 methanol mixing centrifugating in the cold and decanting the supernatant into the tube containing the extract Methanol was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen until only water remained The samples were extracted once with 2 5 ml of n hexane which removed the remaining fat the remaining n hexane was removed with nitrogen Helix Pomatia enzyme was purified with activated charcoal and used for enzymatic hydrolysis of the phytoestrogen conjugates The hydrolysis 2 h at 60 C was carried out using ascorbic acid in 0 15 M acetate buffer The samples were then extracted twice with 3 ml of diethylether freezing separated the phases and the ether fractions were combined and evaporated After adding 300 l of TRIS buffer pH 7 76 TR FIA buffer a sample was taken for measurement of recovery in a counter The final assay was carried out as described elsewhere 60 61 Equol was determined in the same way genistein and daidzein using an antiserum to 4 O carboxymethyl equol bovine serum albumin and the Europium label was synthesized using the same derivative of equol 62 The cross reactivities of the genistein and daidzein antisera with other isoflavone metabolites have been described previously 60 The equol antiserum showed a cross reactivity of 0 for genistein 12 for dihydrogenistein 4 for dihydrodaidzein and less than 1 for daidzein and its other metabolites The intra assay CV determined from a pool of rat brains varied from 9 7 to 19 5 The relatively high CV was due to the fact that the samples were never completely homogeneous and the differences in phytoestrogen concentrations are great in different brain regions In male and female rats from experiments 1 and 2 CALB and COX 2 levels in the frontal cortex and hippocampus CALB only were determined using Western blot analysis as reported elsewhere 49 55 In brief homogenized samples 30 g per lane for frontal cortex and hippocampus by treatment were resolved on 14 Tri Glycine gels and transferred onto Millipore Immobilon P membranes Millipore Bedford MA USA by electroblotting The membranes were probed with rat calbindin antibody 1 50 000 obtained from Dr Anthony Iacopino Marquette University USA or human COX 2 antibody 1 3 000 obtained from Dr Daniel Simmons BYU USA and detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence ECL Western blotting system Amersham Arlington Height IL USA The immunoreactive bands were quantified by optical density measurements using an imaging system Fotodyne Hartland WI USA and analyzed on an IBM Pentium II 350 computer using the public domain NIH Image program Scion Image Beta 4 02 at http www scioncorp com 8080 Downloads fr_login htm The obtained results represent data derived from 3 to 4 independent immunoblots per brain site Maze statistical analysis experiments 1 2 and 3 acquisition and 8 arm tasks Acquisition A one way analysis of variance ANOVA was used to evaluate acquisition of the radial arm maze based on the number of trials needed for each rat to meet the specified level of performance Accuracy 8 arm task A multivariate analysis

choices baited arms not yet chosen in the trial made in the first 4 arm entries A MANOVA sex by diet change over trials 2 2 5 was used to interpret these findings each 3 trials were averaged Also a sex by diet over trials MANOVA was completed to determine the number and types of errors committed in the initial 4 arm entries All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical software package and all significant main effects were followed by Bonferroni post hoc comparisons The alpha level was set at 0 05
