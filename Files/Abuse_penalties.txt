 Abuse penalties questioned Fines the same for beating a dog in county By Maria Herne Tuesday December 17 2002 If you beat a dog in Schuylkill County you ll probably get a 100 fine If you repeatedly beat a woman you ll probably get the same fine In 2001 county judges heard 98 Protection From Abuse cases finding the defendant guilty in 48 percent of those cases either after a hearing or through a technical violation or plea Of those found guilty the majority were ordered to pay court costs plus a 100 fine No defendants were ordered to pay more than a 250 fine for violating the court order In 27 percent of the cases the charges were dismissed or the defendant was found not guilty In the rest of the cases charges were withdrawn or the matter is not yet resolved Sarah T Casey executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis finds it disturbing that in most cases the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County Casey said What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders That it s OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County because you ll only get a slap on the wrist Under state law the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is 100 the maximum fine is 1 000 and up to six months in jail Like others who are familiar with how the county s legal system does and doesn t work for victims of domestic violence Casey believes some changes are in order Valerie West a manager attorney with Mid Penn Legal Services with offices in Pottsville and Reading regularly handles domestic violence cases She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA up to 18 months as it does in many other counties in the state It places an undue burden on the plaintiff in terms of cost finding legal representation and facing their abuser not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services West said It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred It s counter productive The lack of supervised custody visitation in the county a neutral safe supervised place where children can be exchanged from one parent to another for the purposes of visitation is also a concern Right now we don t have any agency in the county willing to handle supervised custody visits West said Obviously in domestic violence cases this is a major concern to us There s a potential for further incidents of abuse to occur during these meetings without some sort of outside supervision Marsha Chwastiak an attorney in the Pottsville office of Mid Penn Legal Services said she would like to see more funds made available to provide social services for troubled families grappling with domestic violence issues If I had one wish for Christmas it would be to have more resources available to help these families so they can try and sort out their problems Chwastiak said In the majority of domestic violence cases I see alcohol drug and mental health problems are at the heart of the problem I feel these are more social problems than legal cases she said Other problems targeted by SWIC include a need for more expedient service of PFAs the need for free or affordable legal representation and assistance with PFA and contempt hearings and other civil matters related to abuse including custody and support and the lack of proper training by law enforcement officials in handling domestic violence cases Casey said A recent 202 297 federal grant from the U S Department of Justice Violence Against Women Office may be the answer to some of these problems Through the collaborative efforts of Schuylkill Women In Crisis the Schuylkill County Sheriff s Department and county grant writer Lorraine A Bennick the Pathways to Safety program was initiated The two year program is fully funded under the Justice Department s Grants to Encourage Arrest Policies and Enforcement of Protection Orders initiative Some of the ways the funds will be spent include 90 000 to hire a civil justice attorney at 45 000 a year for two years to ensure that all victims of domestic violence are represented at second hearings in PFAs and assisted with other civil matters 20 171 to support overtime costs of two additional officers to serve PFAs during nonscheduled work hours ensuring more expedient and immediate delivery and service of PFA orders 3 645 to develop a domestic violence training program for local police departments led by a victim s advocacy trainer the goal of these mini workshops will be to ensure that local police departments consistently adhere to proper PFA protocol 15 000 to hire a consultant to provide a complete detailed study of establishing the most cost effective link between county facilities and municipal police departments and to establish JNET an information management system funded by the state of PA and operated by the Pennsylvania Justice Network JNET was launched in 1998 by the Ridge Schweiker administration to help local and state police courts prisons and probation and parole officers exchange instantly updated information on individuals moving through the criminal justice system making it possible to better track potentially dangerous individuals By helping justice agencies share criminal files more easily JNET improves efficiency and reduces potential errors that could occur from each agency maintaining disparate data files JNET is also used to prevent the detention of individuals wrongly identified as criminal suspects The Pathways to Safety program will compliment existing SWIC programs and address problems experienced by victims of domestic violence Casey said We believe that victims of domestic violence deserve immediate consistent respectful treatment and that offenders receive swift efficient just punishment
