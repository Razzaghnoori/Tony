 want me to press the one button i m ready whenever you are okay sir Jack do you have any pets Jim Jim i m sorry about that do you have any pets no no i do not i uh i live in an apartment okay well that would kind of preclude having a pet well well not really most of my neighbors hum have pets dogs uh huh of course well we ve got we ve got a cat and this is a very very special cat because uh we lived in the Philippines for thirty months we worked for TI in in Biejo City in the Philippines and uh as you know uh the Filipinos are quite poor and and uh they don t uh generally they eat their pets uh well not generally but dogs they do uh so having a pet uh is is a luxury most of them don t have and we uh were able to find one that was born in a store and the uh a Filipino lady that ran the store was giving them away and we took him home with us when he was uh about three weeks old and uh ultimately my family moved back to Dallas and i had to stay on in the Philippines ten months after they went back and uh eventually i shipped him home by air and you know you have to really love a pet to spend two hundred and forty dollars to ship him across the ocean i agree and how they you know the uh the uh health officials let him in the country yeah there was no problem because there was a veterinarian in our neighborhood and we had all the proper paperwork and and i shipped him uh uh by air and uh let my family know when he was going to be in and they went out to the freight claiming area out at uh DFW airport and claimed him it was it was it was it was pretty interesting uh did you have any pets when you were growing up i always had pets when i grew up oh okay what did you have oh i had uh i started with a cat um hum uh an old you know alley cat an old Tom but i had dogs primarily and uh um hum um hum mostly purebreds oh yeah but uh we had a large yard yeah and uh we did not have the pets in the house uh they all they were always outdoors yeah they they they lived outdoors and you know but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh uh when i was living in in uh Pensacola Florida uh we had a uh cat that i got from again from a friend it was born in a barn uh it was they had a a small farm so there were lots of cats around um hum so i picked out one and got it for my daughter and uh had it uh spayed and declawed and we did keep it in the house restricted to the uh first floor oh yeah and it was uh not a bad experience but for the most part i m i m reluctant to have animals in the house i just i just don t do not feel that particularly dogs uh i do not feel that they fare well yeah they re they re uh in the in the house and it s amazing how they how they adapt to the outside i was raised in New England and we had an Eskimo Spitz and he was never in the house a day in his life and i can you know i remember like this sounds like old grandfather stories but i can remember thirty five below zero and thirty inches of snow on the ground um hum well i yeah i had a malamute at one time and huh and uh stayed outside um hum i was raised in southern West Virginia oh okay so the winters would get fairly cold the only problem with it is that the bloody thing would sit outside my window and bay at the moon at night and uh you know it s uh wolf origins uh came to the fore particularly during the full moon and but i always had uh dogs i had a terrier first and then i had a uh let s see i had a terrier then i had a cocker spaniel then a then the uh malamute and then the last dog i had was a uh basset hound um hum but they all stayed outside oh for goodness sakes yeah uh the only dog we ever had uh we lived prior to living in the Philippines with TI we lived in Malaysia and we were told when we got there that it d be good to get a dog because uh there were a lot of uh breaking and entering and robberies um hum and the uh native Malays by religion are scared of dogs in fact the lick of a dog is supposed to be something very very bad something very evil um hum so what happened uh was anybody that had a dog at least the native Malays made up fifty percent of the population if you had a dog uh you wouldn t get ripped off by a Malay now the other fifty percent was part some Chinese some Indians and they might then they didn t have any qualms any qualms about dogs so we went down to the local SPCA uh the American association in in Gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an SPCA there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet um uh except the only problem is we played badminton in the yard a lot and we used to have to get the little shovel and scoop and go clean the yard at night before we went and play badminton right but i m i m a runner by by hobby and she used to love to get outside the gate and i d put her leash on and take her running with me um hum and it was only years later i read that you shouldn t do it particularly in the tropical climates where we were and when she came back she d drink about three panfuls of water yeah i bet but anyway it wasn t it wasn t in the heat of the day i d always go running about seven o clock in the evening or something like that but boy she was ready i d get that leash and she d come over and start jumping all over me to get ready to go and and well the you know the last one we had the the uh my uh my father owned a plumbing and heating business and my brother and i frequently worked for him during the summer when my brother was in college and i was in high school and so uh this was the only dog that we trained to ride in the automobile and so we used to take it to work with us when we would go on a job pack it a lunch and it would you know get out of the car and find a nice cool spot to rest and my brother and i would go work and we d come uh break for lunch and and the uh unpack the dog s lunch and so forth and the other workers the the carpenters and so forth used to get just a hell of a charge out of it because you know here are these two guys you know walked in with clean clothes you know every day my my of course my mother wouldn t let us leave the house without the clean clothes oh yeah you know with a dog and bringing a dog on the job an d they didn t realize we were working for my father so that uh oh for goodness sake it was uh but the people around here they re you know as i mention them the uh the neighbors a lot of the neighbors have uh pets um hum of course they you see them out walking every evening but they range you know the couple upstairs that uh above me uh has a long hair dachshund right uh the lady is German but uh there are some huge dogs around here it s really phenomenal i cannot see i mean i ve seen everything from you know Great Danes and German Shepherds and just really huge animals and how they keep them confined uh the the apartments are are fine they re relatively large but i m sure to stay there all day is fantastic you know fantastic well we we we live in a in a in a residential neighborhood and the animals pretty well run a lot of people have fences in their backyards and and dogs are kept inside fences uh cat cats are pretty well on the run um hum fortunately people are responsible and they ve all been spayed or neutered so we don t have gigantic litters of kittens running around here but they uh it s interesting the lady across from us has always taken in strays and she s got six or seven cats and one of her cats somehow or other must have get into our house accidentally uh when the door was open and found where our cat s food dish is and he likes our food a lot better than he likes hers and when i pull my car up in the evening i can hear him she leaves her garage door open most of them sleep in the garage at night and no matter what time of night it is he hears my car stop and he s over here and he s forcing his head in the door when i open the door and i go in he goes in he gets a great big mouthful of food because he knows i m going to pick him up right off and put him back out again and some days he ll follow me up the front walk so i ll run around the back of the house and try to go in the back door and he ll he ll go around and beat me there so i ve got so that now i fake him i make a move toward the back so he runs around the back then i go in the front door so i i can i can get in without him but he s he s he s fat as a it s amazing yeah it s amazing how they get conditioned it it really is yeah he s he s he s he s fat as a little pig and she took him to the vet and the vet said you got to stop feeding him so much or he s going to die of a heart attack and so she said to me you ve got to stop feeding and i said i don t do it intentionally i and if i m in the house already sometimes i can keep him out if i m trying to come in the house and he s trying to come in too i just kind of put my foot out uh against his neck while i m i m trying to uh get in the door and that works but other times i ll forget that he s out there at the door and as soon as i open it to go out he s by me like a shot and by the time i can get him he s got a great big gigantic mouthful of food well he might be canvassing the neighborhood you just might be the last stop on his uh on his route during the day no i i think i i i think he he likes our food best uh somehow or another our cat has become a housecat and he uh he sleeps with us he sleeps with my wife and i and either he sleeps across the foot of the bed on top of either my feet or her feet or above the covers and uh except when it s extremely cold and we don t get many days like that here in Texas
