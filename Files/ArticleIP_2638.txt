 The Commoditization Conundrum If there s one thing that microeconomics has demonstrated it is that it s hard to keep your profit margins high if you re in the wheat growing business Wheat is pretty much wheat no matter where it grows and it s pretty easy to grow unless the Dust Bowl is raging That means that the supply of wheat rises quickly to meet demand which in turn keeps a downward pressure on prices Wheat in other words is the definition of a commodity and the market for wheat absent government intervention is about as close to perfect competition as you can imagine The same would be true one might think of salt If anything salt is easier to produce than wheat And salt is the same all around the world It should in theory be impossible for a company to charge more for its basic salt than its competitors do And yet Morton actually owns nearly half the American salt market even though its salt is more expensive at least a few pennies more than other brands If salt is a commodity and surely it is then American consumers appear not to know it The lesson of Morton s success obviously is that even the most mundane and undifferentiated of products can be made into something unique with the right marketing strategy Salt is salt is salt except when it comes in a blue canister with a little girl with an umbrella on it and the promise that rain won t damage its pourability Yet what s striking about American business today and in particular about the very industries that we now think of as the heart of our economy namely information technology and financial services is that the people in charge are not consoled by the thought of Morton s successful branding Instead they are haunted by the specter of that wheat market Luckily for them though we re much further from that world of perfect competition than much recent hype would suggest What corporations fear is the phenomenon now known rather inelegantly as commoditization What the term means is simply the conversion of the market for a given product into a commodity market which is characterized by declining prices and profit margins increasing competition and lowered barriers to entry Commoditization is therefore different from commodification the word cultural critics use to decry the corruption of higher goods by commercial values Microprocessors are commoditized Love is commodified Without this fear corporate America should be in its heyday Profits and stock prices are at record highs and there s no sign of any meaningful challenge regulatory or otherwise But analyses of the prospects for the personal computer industry or the banking industry or even the clothing industry reveal a permanent anxiety What companies rely on for profits today they assume will most likely not be there tomorrow because tomorrow someone else will be making the very same thing for less Click for one recent emblematic account In this universe even the paranoid may not survive Insofar as commoditization is a reality it s all to the good for consumers It is witness to the enormous distance U S corporations have traveled from the inefficiencies and quality control debacles of the 1970s Commoditization can only take place after all in a world in which second tier companies can compete in terms of quality and efficiency with top of the line companies And commoditization or at least the fear of it encourages innovation Those technological breakthroughs that allow a company to distinguish itself from its competition and charge a premium for its product are more likely and fruitful in an economy characterized by price competition than in one dominated by oligopolies Finally and perhaps more dubiously commoditization has furthered the democratization of fashion and interior decoration Whether you deplore or welcome the Gap ification of America it is happening Still this supposed ubiquity of commoditization is difficult to square with one fact A few large corporations dominate many if not most major U S industries From Coke and Pepsi to Compaq Hewlett Packard and Dell to Intel to Gillette companies have been able to maintain high profit margins and market share in businesses that in theory at least should be eminently susceptible to competition In some cases with the auto industry being the best example commoditization has been fended off by the enormous capital investment required to enter the business It takes a much smaller initial investment to make a new word processing program than it does to build a car In other cases like the soft drink industry a curious confluence of taste distinctions and brand identification makes meaningful challenges difficult to imagine Coke does taste different from Pepsi and RC but that taste difference is reinforced by the all American mythology that has been wrapped around it In still other cases the personal computer industry for example the brand name becomes a kind of surrogate for quality and reliability It s possible even likely that XYZ Computer makes a PC every bit as good as Compaq s But because I recognize Compaq s name I ll buy its PC without bothering to check out what XYZ is offering If I pay extra for Compaq which I probably won t have to it s to cover the opportunity cost I avoid by not having to comparison shop The greatest example of a company avoiding seemingly certain commoditization is Intel which continues to charge premium prices for its microprocessors even though by all accounts its Pentium chips are no more powerful than chips made by Intel s two main competitors Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix It s true that Intel s production lines have been consistently more reliable and efficient than either AMD s or Cyrix s That makes PC manufacturers more comfortable putting Intel chips in their computers But other factors contribute to Intel s success The mere fact of its commanding position in the microprocessor market a position it initially achieved by technological superiority has made computer makers leery of doing business with its competitors lest Intel fail to give them access to new more powerful chips in the future More strikingly Intel s successful Intel Inside ad campaign has created a brand name for a product that observers once believed was the very definition of a commodity As one less than prescient ad exec put it in 1991 while labeling Intel s advertising efforts awfully stupid Most people that buy computers don t even know that that chip is in there They care about the performance of the computer It really doesn t matter what the chip is Oh well Cyrix and AMD are now spending millions of dollars on TV ad campaigns in recognition of the fact that it really does matter More intriguing than Intel s success though is the continued market domination of companies like Gillette and Campbell s soup While Gillette s razors are technologically superior to Schick s and Campbell s soup tastes better than its competitors the quality differences aren t big enough to account for these companies ability to combine premium pricing with huge sales Gillette owns 67 percent of the U S razor market and Campbell s has more than 75 percent of the U S soup market Nor can we simply ascribe their market dominance to advertising What s going on seems to be something we might describe as the narcissism of small differences In an odd way the more similar products become the more telling the little differences among them end up being Branding successfully in other words can turn a small difference between products into a huge difference in market share None of this means that Gillette and Campbell s are not pushed by their competition since all the evidence suggests that they are constantly looking for competitive advantages What it does mean though is that commoditization does its work not by becoming a reality which would entail ever shrinking margins and stagnant stock prices but by remaining a perpetually present threat It s the idea that perfect competition might be just around the corner not the competition itself that keeps the paranoid prosperous And alive
