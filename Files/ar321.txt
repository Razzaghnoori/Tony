 Introduction Systemic sclerosis SSc is a connective tissue disease characterized by progressive thickening of the dermis often accompanied by insufficiency of internal organs such as the lungs heart or kidneys 1 These manifestations are due to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins predominantly type I collagen in the affected tissues 2 The cause of SSc is unknown but the early stage is characterized by a dense mononuclear cell infiltrate in tissues suggesting that activation of the immune system results in the development of tissue fibrosis 3 4 A prominent humoral abnormality in SSc is manifested by the presence of anti nuclear antibodies 5 The circulating anti topoisomerase I anti Topo I Scl 70 antibodies are highly specific for SSc 6 and they are found in sera from 30 to 70 of patients 7 The presence of anti Topo I antibodies is associated with diffuse cutaneous involvement and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis 8 and is considered a predictive marker of diffuse SSc Human DNA topoisomerase I Topo I is a 765 amino acid nuclear enzyme 9 involved in topological changes of DNA structure 10 It plays key roles in DNA replication transcription and recombination During the Topo I catalytic process a transient covalent linkage termed the cleavable complex is formed between the enzyme and DNA strand nicks Camptothecin CPT and its derivatives specifically target Topo I by binding noncovalently to these cleavable complexes stabilizing them and interfering with DNA religation 11 As a result of CPT s action single and double strand DNA breaks are generated leading to premature termination of replication and inhibition of transcription 12 Cells can repair DNA breaks caused by low doses of CPT whereas higher doses lead to cell death 13 Since many neoplastic cells are characterized by high levels and or activities of Topo I 14 15 this enzyme has become one of the cellular targets for anticancer therapy 16 17 CPT derivatives such as topotecan and irinotecan CPT 11 are currently used in the treatment of various cancers 16 17 18 Only limited side effects such as manageable neutropenia in patients who received high doses of Topo I inhibitors have been reported 16 17 The mechanism responsible for the production of anti Topo I antibodies in SSc is not fully understood Recent studies suggest that activation of Topo I reactive T cells is responsible for the induction and propagation of these antibodies in SSc patients 19 At present the origin of their target autoantigen is not clear Significantly the disappearance of these antibodies possibly because of removal of the autoantigen has been associated with favorable outcomes 20 Because of the potential pathogenic role of Topo I in SSc we undertook this study to evaluate the utility of noncytotoxic concentrations of Topo I inhibitors for the treatment of SSc We have focused on the effects of the leading Topo I inhibitor CPT on collagen production by dermal fibroblasts obtained from patients with SSc Patients and methods Patients The subjects were patients with diffuse SSc and healthy volunteers The patient group consisted of 18 individuals 10 women and 8 men with a mean age of 39 5 2 6 years All the patients fulfilled the American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of SSc 21 The control group were 18 healthy donors with a mean age of 41 0 3 3 years Cell culture Dermal fibroblasts were obtained from clinically affected skin on the dorsal forearm of the SSc patients and from healthy donors matched with the patients for race age and gender The control fibroblasts were obtained within several days of SSc biopsy and were processed in parallel For the experiments cells were starved for 48 h before the addition of CPT in DMEM 1 fetal bovine serum FBS Reagents CPT was purchased from Sigma St Louis MO USA and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide Sigma Aliquots of stock solution 10 mM were stored at 70 C Determination of collagen types and of elastin production Collagen and elastin deposition in cell and matrix layers was determined by solid phase ELISA with antibodies against goat anti collagen I Chemicon Temecula CA USA mouse anti collagen III Telios San Diego CA USA mouse anti collagen VI Telios or mouse anti elastin Sigma at dilutions recommended by the manufacturers To determine the effect of CPT on newly synthesized collagenous proteins we used an established method of metabolic labeling with 3H proline followed by SDS PAGE electrophoresis 22 The results were visualized by autoradiography The intensity of bands of collagenous protein was quantitated using NIH Image Densitometry Software version 1 55 The effect of CPT on total protein synthesis was examined using metabolic labeling with 35S methionine followed by SDS PAGE and autoradiography RNA preparation and northern blot analysis Fibroblasts were treated with CPT at concentrations from 10 9to 10 6mol l for 24 h Total RNA was extracted and analyzed by northern blotting as described elsewhere 23 Membranes were sequentially hybridized with radioactive probes for 2 I procollagen and glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase GAPDH and scanned with a PhosphorImager Molecular Dynamics Inc Sunnyvale CA for mRNA quantitation Transient transfection and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assays Transient transfections of normal dermal fibroblasts were performed with 20 g of the 353 fragment of 2 I collagen COL1A2 promoter linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase CAT reporter gene by the calcium phosphate DNA coprecipitation technique as described elsewhere 24 CAT values were corrected to reflect the efficiency of transfection relative to the co transfected pSV galactosidase vector Promega Madison WI USA Statistical analysis Statistical signifance was evaluated in paired analyses using the Student s paired t test or the Wilcoxon test nonparametric depending on the data distribution Data values are expressed as means SEM Statistical significance was defined as a P value of 0 05 or less see supplementary material Results Effect of CPT on production of collagen protein The effect of CPT on the production of types I III and VI collagen by 11 pairs of SSc and normal dermal fibroblasts was examined by ELISA using fibroblast cell and matrix layers Fig 1a b c Incubation with CPT for 24 h significantly decreased the expression of all three collagen types although the degree of inhibition varied among the different collagens Although CPT at 10 7mol l decreased collagen production more in SSc than in healthy control fibroblasts by respectively 68 and 48 for type I 38 and 15 for type II and 21 and 7 for type III Fig a b c these differences were not statistically significant The reduction of type I collagen expression by CPT after 24 h was also demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and indirect immunofluorescence data not shown To assess the effect of CPT on production of other extracellular matrix proteins the effect on elastin was measured by ELISA no effect was found in either SSc or control fibroblasts Fig 1d The effect of CPT on newly synthesized collagenous proteins secreted into the media was examined in five pairs of SSc and healthy control fibroblasts in nine independent experiments CPT at concentrations from 10 8to 10 6mol l significantly decreased secretion of collagenous protein by up to 50 in both cell types Fig 2a b The responsiveness of SSc and healthy control fibroblasts to different doses of CPT was also compared No major differences were observed at the three highest doses used 10 8to 10 6mol l but SSc fibroblasts appeared to be slightly more sensitive to the lowest dose of CPT 10 9mol l Secreted collagenous proteins were inhibited by 29 0 06 in SSc fibroblasts versus 14 0 03 in healthy control fibroblasts P 0 09 The total protein synthesis was not affected by CPT treatment even at the highest dose used 10 6mol l Fig 2c The number of cells after CPT treatment was not significantly decreased Table 1 indicating that the doses used were not cytotoxic to fibroblasts CPT is cytotoxic mainly to S phase cells and its effects are dependent on cell type 13 In general human fibroblasts are more resistant than neoplastic cells or lymphoblasts to DNA damaging agents 25 Although it has been shown that CPT at higher concentrations induces cell cycle arrest in proliferating dermal fibroblasts 26 it is unlikely that the inhibition of collagen production was related to cell cycle arrest because our experiments were performed with confluent serum starved cells Taken together the experiments presented in this part of the study suggest that CPT is a relatively specific inhibitor of collagenous protein production in dermal fibroblasts Effect of CPT on expression of COL1A2 mRNA The effect of CPT on COL1A2 steady state mRNA levels was evaluated in seven pairs of SSc and healthy control dermal fibroblasts in 13 independent experiments CPT treatment resulted in a dose dependent decrease of COL1A2 mRNA expression levels in SSc and healthy control fibroblasts as demonstrated by northern blot analysis Note that GAPDH mRNA levels were not inhibited by CPT Fig 3a The highest dose of CPT 10 6 resulted in about 60 inhibition of COL1A2 mRNA levels in both SSc and healthy control fibroblasts Fig 3b c These results suggest that the inhibitory effects of CPT occur at least partially through regulating the levels of expression of collagen mRNA Effect of CPT on activity of COL1A2 promoter The transcriptional activity of the human COL1A2 promoter fragment 353 linked to the CAT reporter gene was examined in transient transfection assays after CPT treatment Consistent with the mRNA data the maximal inhibition of collagen promoter activity was 60 Fig 4 suggesting that the inhibitory effect of CPT on the COL1A2 gene occurs at the transcriptional level As previously reported CPT has no effect on the activity of the control vector 27 The activity of the collagen promoter was inhibited by much lower doses of CPT 10 12and 10 10mol l than those that inhibited collagen mRNA levels 10 8to 10 6mol l This probably reflects the difference in sensitivity to CPT between exogenous and endogenous promoters due to the protective role of chromatin surrounding the endogenous promoter Discussion DNA Topo I is an essential enzyme involved in such crucial cellular functions as replication and transcription This study was undertaken to determine whether inhibition of its activity by noncytotoxic doses of CPT a drug that selectively targets Topo I could reverse the activated phenotype of fibroblasts from patients with SSc CPT an alkaloid that exists in nature and has been used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine is a prototype of a new class of anticancer drugs 16 It is commonly used in in vitro experimental model systems to study the mechanisms of action of Topo I inhibitors Clinically approved Topo I inhibitors irinotecan and topotecan are semisynthetic derivatives of CPT that differ from CPT in toxicity profiles and water solubility but not in the mechanisms of action 16 17 Our results show that CPT significantly inhibits the synthesis of collagen by dermal fibroblasts from patients with SSc The production of types I III and VI collagen was significantly inhibited in SSc and healthy control dermal fibroblasts without affecting total protein synthesis The inhibitory mechanism of CPT was further examined using COL1A2 as a representative collagen gene The drug inhibited COL1A2 steady state mRNA levels and promoter activity by 60 indicating that it directly inhibits transcription of this collagen gene It is not known why collagen genes and particularly type I collagen are more sensitive to CPT than other genes The drug either may directly interfere with the transcription of collagen genes or may influence signaling pathways that regulate collagen gene expression The role of Topo I in the initiation of transcription has previously been shown 28 These previous studies have revealed that Topo I can act as either an activator or a repressor depending on the promoter and the presence of other transcription factors 29 It has been proposed that Topo I may be directly involved in transcription of interstitial collagen genes 30 The nucleotide sequences of these genes contain specific DNA motifs that constitute high affinity Topo I binding sites 31 Three such DNA motifs reside within the COL1A2 promoter 30 Further studies are needed to determine whether Topo I plays a direct role in the regulation of type I collagen transcription Recently a new role for CPT has been proposed 32 It has been shown to activate transcription factor NF B in various cell types including a fibroblastic cell line The activation of NF B by CPT involves degradation of the cytoplasmic I B by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway Topotecan a clinically approved derivative of CPT showed similar effects The activation of NF B by CPT may be directly related to the mechanism of CPT COL1A2 gene regulation It has been shown that the inhibitory effect of TNF on COL1A2 gene transcription is mediated via NF B 33 Thus CPT may inhibit COL1A2 by a mechanism involving activation of NF B This hypothesis could be tested using other DNA topoisomerase poisons known to induce NF B 34 Despite significant progress towards understanding the pathogenesis of SSc and other fibrotic diseases effective treatment is still lacking Specific compounds that have the potential to inhibit collagen production such as CPT and the recently described inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferase I 35 may prove to be clinically useful in the treatment of fibrosis Conclusion In conclusion our study shows that CPT has a potent selective inhibitory effect on collagen gene expression however the specific molecular mechanisms of action are presently not known and will require further study The inhibitory effect of CPT on collagen gene expression suggests that Topo I inhibitors may be an effective treatment for limiting fibrosis in SSc patients Supplementary methods Patients Dermal
