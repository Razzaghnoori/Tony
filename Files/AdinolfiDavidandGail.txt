 OK Um we re going to talk about today childhood stories and what I m wondering is what are the stories you remember as children I recall a number of stories My mother read a great deal to me Ah Uncle Wiggly was a favorite Uncle Wiggly What was that about That s about a rabbit and about a farmer that used to chase the rabbit out of his uh carrot patch and uh all the characters that were associated with that Was that your favorite story I think that s one I remember a lot because when I was in 1st grade I was sick a lot of the year and I was out of school a lot of the year And uh because of that my mother read to me a lot you know to help me me feel better So she uh she read a lot of Uncle Wiggly stories to me But I think the story that was was a favorite was one that my mother made up herself utilizing characters from you know like Bugs Bunny and and Thumper and Bambi and all that And ah she she made it up a story about a me and my cousin Phil ah going on this trip to the Canadian Northwest to hunt and meeting these little characters uh while we were there Of course it can t be published because all those things are copyrighted but my mother made up the story and I thought it was very nice and I still have it uh handwritten uh in our file here OK how about you Mom I remember uhem Peter Cottontail and the farmer chasing him under the wire and Peter Cottontail getting out just in time and I remember Mickey Mouse stories I liked those Disney World things Of course who knew about Disney World a hundred years ago but um Mickey Mouse was a favorite And um Little Women that was and now I had three older sisters and I always kind of envisioned us patterned after Little Women and because there were four girls in that family and I loved that story read it over and over again I fact I took you to Louisa May Alcott s home in Massachusetts and we ah umm Let s see other stories Oh I hated I well I ll just tell you that later Um uh I I I just um I guess I m drawing a blank here I can t think anymore Well what was your favorite story If you had to pick out of all of them My favorite story um oh Cinderella I just loved Cinderella I also saw my sisters as the wicked stepsisters sometimes and I was Cinderella running around waiting on them What ah story in your childhood had the most impact on you I ll ask you first Mom and then Dad Oh um most impact on me I think Oh Heidi I loved Heidi and that in fact I wanted to name one of my children Heidi because I loved Heidi of the Alps Um as far as having an impact on me I guess uh being a good girl and doing all the right things Those were the stories I read OK Dad want to tell What s your favorite Well I ll tell you there was a record Roy Rogers and Gabby Hayes and I still quote it today when I m when I m being funny And it had to do with the description of all the cowboy paraphernalia that was ah existent at the time Like tapaderos that were on the the uh place to protect your boots in the saddle Laughs and reverts to normal voice and all that sort of thing So I remember silly things like that that were a lot of fun I read uh the story that I don t this isn t ah I think the first real story that I read was uh The Red Badge of Courage Uh more serious and that was that was a very interesting story because it was the first time I came upon a character who was real who was afraid who ran away who uh then came back and uh and conquered his fear which is something that we all have to do from time to time What are your least favorite stories When you re thinking of stories that affected you and really you abhorred What are those stories Well Aladdin and the Lamp That genie that came out of that lamp scared me half to death Was that told to you or did you read that Um that was told to me and I saw that genie coming out of the bottle in the picture in the book was not about a kind and loving genie It was kind of scary looking and I thought Ooh I don t think I d like to meet up with that genie Well who told you that story Ooh one of my three older sisters Probably Lois your Aunt Lois I can t think of a story that uh had a real negative impact on me Umm I guess I ll leave it at that Um when you re talking about your favorite stories what was your favorite part of the story Remember I told you about the story my mother wrote and I can remember at the time and in some ways it s still true today Ah the favorite part of the story was the fact that I had somehow bought an old Model T Ford How appropriate That was the favorite part of the story Well I think all the happy endings we read as children Pollyanna you know and uh everything always seemed to turn out right So these were your favorite parts Stories I liked yeah What were your least favorite parts of the story What parts of the story were boring Oh In Little Women when Meg died Oh dear That was so traumatic and ah Swiss Family Robinson Uh I loved the part where they would you know make things out of nothing They made a home out of out of things they found on the island fashioned things oh uh implements uh out of coconut shells and whatever stones and whatever they could find I liked that part Did you identify with any of these characters And what s the one you identified with the most Well I think I identified with Jo She was kind of headstrong and she was um kind of artistic maybe and uh uh liked to have a good sense of humor Yeah the main I The Red Badge of Courage the main character at first I had never you know all of the cowboy stories that I saw or read it was uh uh you know the good the bad and the good were very good and the bad were very bad And this was the first occasion where the good person had some some flaws So I didn t like that at first and then of course you know as the story unfolded you would uh relate that to your own experiences of being afraid and and learning to conquer those fears and that kind of thing So I thought it was uh uh it was at first a part of the story I didn t like but afterward uh you know it certainly taught a lesson We re talking a lot about childhood stories and stories that um were read to you and what were the first what did you start reading when you were first allowed to choose what you read What did you choose Well I chose to read the ones that had been read to me We had a great big book of Grimm s Fairytales and looking back on that they were grim They were scary throwing a child in the oven and all that sort of thing However it didn t seem to be so horrifying It was a story and I you know you knew it was fiction but I would go back and read when I could read myself I read everything I read the backs of cereal boxes I read everything I could get my hands on I didn t do a lot of reading I guess I read a lot of classic comics Classic comics yeah Uh well yeah and I remember Ivanhoe and uh The Disinherited Knight and all that kind of thing I was always into those kinds of heroic things um so I read a lot of those things I forgot about comic books Oh Archie and oh I loved Archie comics Oh yeah superheroes like Captain Marvel Superman Batman and all of them I m talking to you as your you know my Mom and Dad and uh what were if you know what were your Mom and Dad s favorite stories My father read uh liked history and read um a lot of historical uh factual things not into fiction at all Uh my mother was probably so busy running around taking care of all of us I guess she read um I think she read biographical things rather than um novels My father didn t read anything in terms of what you d call a book uh but he was analytical of the Sport of Kings and so would peruse the paper to check on that But uh my mother uh you know didn t read a whole lot but spent a lot of time reading to me uh my being an only child Uh so yeah I took up a lot of her life and she read a lot of children s stories to me as a result of that but I don t believe she read a lot for her own amusement At that time and now later on she she lives at the library just about Absolutely does So it s like she uh and the education wasn t the same back in those days So um you know it was different people would read for different reasons and I think your mother has um you know she s educated herself at the library Yeah that s true We re talking a lot about stories and um novels and children s books was there any poetry that was your favorite Golly I never really got into poetry Yeah I had to take it as children Or high school I just really didn t ever love poetry for some reason I still recall and I m sure your mother does too Whose woods these are I think I know His house is in the village though and I won t go beyond that but uh you recall that Gail when we were when I was in college and we were first dating that was a a favorite poem of uh us and our friends Was that self written Oh no That was Robert Frost OK I thought so Um and we re talking about childhood and middle school what about high school What about high school into college into adulthood what are some of the books that you read Oh gee Um Can we turn that off while I think One in particular I read while in college that we just howled over and that was Catcher in the Rye by J D Salinger Um Peyton Place was had um kind of a fascination because I was at summer camp in NH near Gilmanton Iron Works where that woman the author lived So that was such a racy and shocking book at that time and so of course we had to read it I I liked uh oh gosh go ahead Dave you ve got Well I remember another book that you read that that I didn t read but that uh painting was made 84 Oh Ayn Rand Yeah um And I remember that being appearing to be so far in the future Atlas Shrugged Oh yes and George Orwell books I read uh uh um 1984 and what s the other one Animal Farm and they yeah it was so far in the future and my gosh now it s the past Whew Into adulthood what books do you like now I like uh political non fiction and I ve read The Making of the President series from 1960 on up I I like uh uh those kinds of things that talk about why people do what they do when they re in positions of political power or aspiring to positions of political power I also like to read things about the Civil War I ve read all the the lawyer books Grisham and Turow and a lot of the um current uh writers novelists Um oh gosh Anita Shrever is one um Rosamunde Pilcher Maeve Binchy um I like all of that type of reading Have you ever read any books from foreign authors Somebody who obviously that English was not their first language but they wrote a book Um I m sure I have I just can t think of what Um I just can t think of what one You know what I should have remembered back as a freshmen I read An American Tragedy And and years later we ended up living in the place where that took place and the uh and it was not something that was uh not a subject that people liked to talk about because many of the people in town knew the young man who was charged with that murder And so that was really interesting uh in retrospect I can t remember reading anything foreign authors As I say American political non fiction doesn t exactly lend itself to that Dostoevsky I mean I m sure I have read I just can t even remember what Dr Zhivago I read that Did you notice any differences between an American writer and someone of foreign descent Oh well the cultural differences would come through in the writing yeah sure Um I wish I could think more I just can t remember Go ahead Well I m going to ask a final question that um I mean you re my parents and you imparted a lot of uh a lot of the love of reading to me Uh how important it was to read and we re all English majors I think that has something to do with it my brother sister and I are all we re all English majors in college So what I am going to ask you is what was your philosophy behind that Why is reading so important I can t imagine not reading Reading is the basis of all learning I can t imagine not reading and for pure enjoyment and uh for growth broadening your knowledge base Um reading is fundamental as they say and it truly is What a sad thing if people can t read If I had if I was retired I would definitely be working in aliteracy um you know volunteer literacy capacity I think it s so important It s such a handicap not to read I think uh that intellectual stimulation is very important I think thinking is very important I think reading is a part of that And I uh too often much too often see people um feeling superior somehow because they don t read they don t think they don t experience other ideas And so uh those things come about through the work of reading rather than through listening to some person on the street corner or uh gazing on TV Well thank you for being part of this study Our pleasure Thank you
