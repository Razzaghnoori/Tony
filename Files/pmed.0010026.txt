                    Tumor Antigen Recognition by Cytolytic T Lymphocytes        CD         cytolytic T lymphocytes CTLs are the primary effector cells of the        adaptive immune system and have a major role in protecting us from a vast array of diseases        including cancer CTLs specifically recognize and lyse targets through the interaction of T        cell receptors TCRs on the surface of the T lymphocyte with protein fragments peptides        presented on the surface of target cells in association with major histocompatibility        complex MHC class I molecules When a particular CTL interacts with a target cell it        rapidly divides to form a clonal population of T cells with the identical TCR        Townsend and colleagues first elucidated the molecular basis of target cell recognition        by CTLs in   They showed that antigens are processed inside the target cell into        nine or tenaminoacidlong peptides which are then presented at the surface in        association with MHC class I molecules This discovery suggested the possibility of using        short synthetic peptides mimicking naturally processed antigens as immunotherapeutic drugs        and vaccines Short synthetic peptides are ideal for drug development because of the        relatively low cost of production easy storage and high safety However not all peptides        and MHC alleles work well together to stimulate CTLs So for clinical use either patients        would have to be selected for treatment based on their MHC I type or it would be necessary        to make multiple peptides to cover the majority of MHC class I alleles in a given        population        Furthermore before Boon and colleagues cloned the first antigen recognized by        tumorreactive CTLs in   it was not clear which antigens were recognized by        tumorreactive CTLs in humans so it was not possible to rationally design cancer        vaccines Now however a long list of more or less tumorspecific antigens has been        generated  Most of the peptides identified so far are either normal self proteins        aberrantly expressed in cancer but not in most other adult normal tissues or        tissuespecific antigens also expressed in certain types of cancer Some patients show a        spontaneous CD         T cell response occasionally at high levels that is specific for        several of these antigens The development of such responses however requires a large        tumor load occurs late in the disease and probably does not cause the efficient        destruction of the tumor cells  Thus a central objective in cancer immunotherapy is to        efficiently produce tumorreactive CTLs at an earlier phase of the disease                    Heteroclitic Tumor Antigen Peptides        Unfortunately some synthetic peptides including some corresponding to immunodominant        epitopes those which cause the biggest part of the immune response from tumor antigens        only seem to bind MHC class I molecules with medium to low affinity andor are recognized        by specific T cells with relatively low avidity These characteristics are the likely cause        of the poor immune reaction generated by these peptides  One strategy to improve the        immune reaction is to make what are called heteroclitic antigen variants By improving        either peptide binding to MHC recognition by TCRs or both these variants have increased        peptide antigenicity and immunogenicity        Solinger and colleagues were the first to describe antigen variants producing T cell        responses that were stronger than those elicited by the parental sequences  Some        heteroclitic tumor antigen peptides that showed highly improved antigenicity and        immunogenicity in preclinical studies and which also crossreacted well with CTLs        generated against the parental sequence were tested in clinical trials The peptides        selected for trials mostly contained substitutions of anchoring amino acids that were        designed to increase peptide binding to the MHC molecule while minimally changing the shape        of the epitope         In a study by Lee and colleagues in this issue of         PLoS Medicine  despite the careful study design vaccination with        these peptides resulted in the recruitment of T cells that bound antigens less efficiently        and had lower tumor reactivity than those from the endogenous response to the tumor The        authors propose that the cause for the decreased affinity of vaccineelicited CTLs could be        the high antigen density of these synthetic peptides on antigenpresenting cells An        alternative explanation however is that the synthetic peptides used for vaccination        simply fail to faithfully mimic the naturally processed antigens Figure  The use of        peptides that differ from those resulting from natural intracellular processing has        previously given rise to similar problems  In any case the enormous diversity in        the normal TCR repertoire provides a molecular explanation of the observed phenomenon        These results emphasize how difficult it is to translate findings such as the spectacular        results obtained by the vaccination of TCR transgenic mice with heteroclitic peptides         into an application for normal animals and humans                    Conclusion        It is increasingly clear that even the smallest alteration in the structure of the MHC        peptide complex can result in significant changes in which TCRs are selected after        vaccination Thus manipulating the immune T cell repertoire in vivo through the use of        heteroclitic tumor antigen peptide variants could be harder than anticipated As the field        moves rapidly towards the use of new vaccine adjuvants with high immunogenic potential         reassessment of the immunogenicity of natural sequences could be worthwhile in some        cases In addition the careful analysis of antigenspecific T cell clones such as that        reported here by Lee and colleagues will be crucial to ascertain the quality of the        elicited immune response
