 Tumor Antigen Recognition by Cytolytic T Lymphocytes CD8 cytolytic T lymphocytes CTLs are the primary effector cells of the adaptive immune system and have a major role in protecting us from a vast array of diseases including cancer CTLs specifically recognize and lyse targets through the interaction of T cell receptors TCRs on the surface of the T lymphocyte with protein fragments peptides presented on the surface of target cells in association with major histocompatibility complex MHC class I molecules When a particular CTL interacts with a target cell it rapidly divides to form a clonal population of T cells with the identical TCR Townsend and colleagues first elucidated the molecular basis of target cell recognition by CTLs in 1985 1 They showed that antigens are processed inside the target cell into nine or ten amino acid long peptides which are then presented at the surface in association with MHC class I molecules This discovery suggested the possibility of using short synthetic peptides mimicking naturally processed antigens as immunotherapeutic drugs and vaccines Short synthetic peptides are ideal for drug development because of the relatively low cost of production easy storage and high safety However not all peptides and MHC alleles work well together to stimulate CTLs So for clinical use either patients would have to be selected for treatment based on their MHC I type or it would be necessary to make multiple peptides to cover the majority of MHC class I alleles in a given population Furthermore before Boon and colleagues cloned the first antigen recognized by tumor reactive CTLs in 1991 2 it was not clear which antigens were recognized by tumor reactive CTLs in humans so it was not possible to rationally design cancer vaccines Now however a long list of more or less tumor specific antigens has been generated 3 Most of the peptides identified so far are either normal self proteins aberrantly expressed in cancer but not in most other adult normal tissues or tissue specific antigens also expressed in certain types of cancer Some patients show a spontaneous CD8 T cell response occasionally at high levels that is specific for several of these antigens The development of such responses however requires a large tumor load occurs late in the disease and probably does not cause the efficient destruction of the tumor cells 4 Thus a central objective in cancer immunotherapy is to efficiently produce tumor reactive CTLs at an earlier phase of the disease Heteroclitic Tumor Antigen Peptides Unfortunately some synthetic peptides including some corresponding to immunodominant epitopes those which cause the biggest part of the immune response from tumor antigens only seem to bind MHC class I molecules with medium to low affinity and or are recognized by specific T cells with relatively low avidity These characteristics are the likely cause of the poor immune reaction generated by these peptides 5 One strategy to improve the immune reaction is to make what are called heteroclitic antigen variants By improving either peptide binding to MHC recognition by TCRs or both these variants have increased peptide antigenicity and immunogenicity Solinger and colleagues were the first to describe antigen variants producing T cell responses that were stronger than those elicited by the parental sequences 6 Some heteroclitic tumor antigen peptides that showed highly improved antigenicity and immunogenicity in preclinical studies and which also cross reacted well with CTLs generated against the parental sequence were tested in clinical trials The peptides selected for trials mostly contained substitutions of anchoring amino acids that were designed to increase peptide binding to the MHC molecule while minimally changing the shape of the epitope 7 8 In a study by Lee and colleagues in this issue of PLoS Medicine 9 despite the careful study design vaccination with these peptides resulted in the recruitment of T cells that bound antigens less efficiently and had lower tumor reactivity than those from the endogenous response to the tumor The authors propose that the cause for the decreased affinity of vaccine elicited CTLs could be the high antigen density of these synthetic peptides on antigen presenting cells An alternative explanation however is that the synthetic peptides used for vaccination simply fail to faithfully mimic the naturally processed antigens Figure 1 The use of peptides that differ from those resulting from natural intracellular processing has previously given rise to similar problems 10 11 In any case the enormous diversity in the normal TCR repertoire provides a molecular explanation of the observed phenomenon These results emphasize how difficult it is to translate findings such as the spectacular results obtained by the vaccination of TCR transgenic mice with heteroclitic peptides 12 into an application for normal animals and humans Conclusion It is increasingly clear that even the smallest alteration in the structure of the MHC peptide complex can result in significant changes in which TCRs are selected after vaccination Thus manipulating the immune T cell repertoire in vivo through the use of heteroclitic tumor antigen peptide variants could be harder than anticipated As the field moves rapidly towards the use of new vaccine adjuvants with high immunogenic potential 13 reassessment of the immunogenicity of natural sequences could be worthwhile in some cases In addition the careful analysis of antigen specific T cell clones such as that reported here by Lee and colleagues will be crucial to ascertain the quality of the elicited immune response
