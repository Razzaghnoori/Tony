 Jerry Springer Talk show host Jerry Springer the ringmaster of a lumpenproletariat circus is enjoying a wonderful month The Jerry Springer Show just evicted Oprah from the top spot in nationwide talk show ratings Springer is now watched by nearly 12 million Americans every day more than twice as many as a year ago Jerry Springer Too Hot for TV a video compilation of the show s worst moments has won a cult following and sold 500 000 copies by mail order Even Springer s bad news is good news Two weeks ago Sens Dan Coats R Ind and Joseph Lieberman D Conn demanded the feds stop funding Springer s closed captioning calling the show the closest thing to pornography on broadcast television Activists for free speech and the deaf rose to Springer s defense It s always good business to be censored This is an era of aggressively nice talk shows Oprah has abandoned sleaze for self esteem Rosie O Donnell has never met a guest she could not drown in slobber But the Jerry Springer Show is unrepentantly vicious It s dedicated to strife and misery to the principles that human frailty should be ridiculed that the weak and the stupid should be humiliated and that there is no better cure for your problems than the sorrows of others On Springer s show men learn their girlfriends are actually boys wives learn their husbands are sleeping with their sisters or ex wives or both women learn that their 13 year old daughters are strippers or their 60 year old mothers are whores fat people are poked and prodded and berated Springer is an endless parade of losers perverts and exhibitionists What makes Springer a TV landmark is not its guests though they are the saddest rabble in the medium s history but its violence Jerry seeks out guests who are too confused and too angry to address their problems rationally and too inarticulate to address them verbally Other shows excise fighting and profanity Springer promotes it The audience mostly well groomed college age kids screams for blood When one episode of Geraldo erupted in a brawl in 1988 it made national news Springer has brawls every day and more real life violence than any show on television On the episode I watched last night Tell Her It s Over there were eight separate fights There was also so much cursing that entire segments were incomprehensible they re bleeped out Most talk shows maintain at least the pretense of reasoned discussion not Springer The closest it gets to debate is a robed KKK moron assaulting a black guest as in this clip from Too Hot for TV Springer himself presides oleaginously over this spectacle He s sometimes funny often smarmy and always condescending He brings the dry tinder and lights the match but he s always shocked shocked when a fire breaks out If guests swear he tut tuts them If they fight which is exactly what the host and his producers want them to do exactly why they have burly bouncers at the ready exactly what ratings depend on he admonishes them to control themselves A lecture from the devil It s no mystery why Springer is on television A talk show is cheap to produce one fourth the cost of a news show one tenth the cost of a drama and immensely profitable As for Springer s grotesque content well someone will always push the envelope of good taste And Springer is riveting excruciating television It is unbearable to watch but impossible to turn off You know I know the audience knows he knows No good can come of exposing these horrible problems to the world yet it s impossible not to watch it happen As New York Times media critic Bill Carter put it Jerry Springer does not have viewers he has rubberneckers So the question is not Why is Springer on television It is Why is Springer on television How did Springer with his do gooding r sum end up here The child of Holocaust survivors he earned a law degree at Northwestern University then became a campaign adviser to Robert F Kennedy in 1968 Springer settled in Cincinnati lost a race for Congress in 1970 and was elected to the city council a year later He was only 27 He became a popular outspoken lefty leader his first action was to propose a ban on the drafting of Cincinnati residents for the Vietnam War He resigned in 1974 when he was fingered in a vice investigation he had paid a prostitute with a check duh But a year later he ran for council again and won In 1977 he was elected Cincinnati s mayor Springer was an old fashioned tax and spend liberal He was a beloved figure around town the smart young thing of Ohio politics He even read the New Republic After a failed run for Ohio governor Springer jumped to television He delivered short commentaries at the end of local news broadcasts He was brilliant The minieditorials were concise witty and warm He took over the news desk and soon became Cincinnati s most popular anchor In 1991 he launched his own talk show It was responsible and dull As ratings sagged in 1994 Springer had a change of heart Backed by a producer who d worked at the Weekly World News he went tabloid The 1995 Jenny Jones Show related chagrined the rest of the talk show world but Springer filled the sleaze vacuum He s descended the moral food chain lawyer politician TV journalist TV talk show host and climbed the income ladder During his slide into Hades Springer s liberalism has degenerated into a kind of nihilism If a conservative is a liberal who has been mugged a nihilist is a liberal who is paid 2 million a year to do something revolting Springer makes several tepid attempts to justify Springer It gives voice to disenfranchised folks who would be ignored otherwise Guests are not exploited because they are The show shouldn t be criticized for presenting disgusting behavior because television doesn t create values it only reflects them Click below for his unctuous commentary on this Springer actually teaches moral lessons Bad guests e g wife beaters are booed Springer himself closes each episode with a Final Thought a sermonette that makes it clear how little he thinks of his guests Springer s excuses are halfhearted not to mention contradictory it s not consistent to say that television doesn t create values then lecture your audience about values But mostly Springer doesn t bother with justifications He smiles and admits the truth about the Jerry Springer Show It s stupid human tricks It s all stupid We re all idiots It s bubble gum He has said that kids shouldn t watch it and that he himself has never watched it Most articles about Springer describe this bad mouthing as self effacement But it s not It s more like self loathing Once upon a time Springer was an idealist He hoped to change the world through politics to lead Ohio out of a recession He cast himself as on air adviser to half a million Cincinnati TV viewers Now he is the ringleader of a circus of morons the host of a TV show he doesn t like and doesn t believe in Springer hopes to redeem himself but it s a lost cause He wants to be a political science professor when his contract runs out in 2002 Imagine that Jerry Springer professor of political theory and teen hookers Last year Jerry attempted a return to the straight world A Chicago TV station hired him to deliver the kind of commentary that made him so beloved in Cincinnati a decade ago But the station s anchor and chief correspondent chose to resign rather than share air time with Springer He delivered only two commentaries one a bitter rant against elitists who condemned him before the public outcry drove him to quit He slunk back to his rabble the losers pervs and exhibitionists the only folks who might still listen to his advice
