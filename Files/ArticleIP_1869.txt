 NRA President Charlton Heston By my reckoning Charlton Heston has played a CIA director two prophets Moses twice and Brigham Young two saints Thomas More and John the Baptist an admiral two generals as well as six captains and three majors a cardinal Richelieu two kings Macbeth and Henry VIII and three presidents of the United States Andrew Jackson Thomas Jefferson and Franklin Roosevelt s voice So the National Rifle Association which elected Heston president this week can be forgiven for mistaking the actor for a real commander NRA leaders believe the patriarchal Heston will polish the gun lobby s lousy public image while galvanizing its red meat and gunpowder members Hey Moses is on our side gloats NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre At 73 Heston does remain an awesome presence tall grandfatherly astonishingly handsome his voice as magnificent as ever President Heston has already employed that godly bass to great effect His NRA speech produced a that s being played and replayed on newscasts Heston s ascendance seems to be filling some conservatives with what if regret Why didn t he run for office when he was in his prime Heston s fans are falling victim to Celebrity Identification Disorder the same malady that causes people to write letters to soap opera characters Heston periodically says I am not Moses but his admirers don t quite believe it He s been associated with extraordinary men for so long that they assume he must be one In fact Heston embodies a very different more mundane but still admirable ethos The defining quality of his career is competence not genius He was never a romantic lead but he was Hollywood s superstar during the epic s brief heyday Since the late 50s however he has enjoyed the most workmanlike career of any actor in Hollywood He has made a prosperous living by playing with slight variation the same role for 50 years the hero with a stick up his rear end Heston is the Volvo of Hollywood actors never brilliant never awful always reliable He has appeared in more than 80 movies countless TV films dozens of plays He is always first on the set He s unfailingly polite to co workers and respectful to directors He never misses work because of illness Appropriately modest he credits his success to his physical equipment rather than his talent his height and good health as well as that voice that jaw and that nose Heston researches his roles assiduously memorizing Old Testament passages to play Moses and reading all Michelangelo s letters to play him Unlike many actors of his generation Heston has cheerfully adjusted to senior citizenship He accepts lesser parts in bad movies Call of the Wild and worse television The Colbys a short lived dreadful Dynasty spinoff He has become a hired gun narrator the guy you buy when you need God s voice Heston s signature characters Moses Ben Hur El Cid always took themselves seriously but Heston doesn t He has played self mocking parts in Wayne s World 2 and Bud Light ads He is a pro a hack the guy whose highest value is that he gets the job done Off screen too Heston leads an unremarkable life He has been married for 54 years and is extremely close to his two children He lives quietly on a well armed Los Angeles estate eschewing parties for history books and his journal author of three memoirs he is an excellent funny writer And his activism is a steady hobby rather than an obsession He s an enthusiast but also a dilettante In the early 60s he was a staunch civil rights advocate In the early 80s he advised Ronald Reagan on National Endowment for the Arts funding He has condemned the nuclear freeze movement obscene rap music and overpopulation In every case Heston has been effective without being monomaniacal His rhetoric admittedly is not always restrained He denounces political correctness with froth at the mouth language that would be hilarious if it weren t so nasty Click for a couple of examples Heston has even had moderate instincts about gun rights Until recently he hasn t spent much time pushing the Second Amendment After Robert Kennedy s assassination in 1968 he endorsed strong gun control legislation and as recently as last year he declared that AK 47s are inappropriate for private use Heston s softness on gun rights was an issue in his NRA election but he has quieted critics by backing off his earlier statements and hewing to the NRA s official line He recently said that a Washington state initiative to require trigger locks was written by Satan All this is to say Those who liken him to Reagan misunderstand Heston It is an easy comparison Both are Democrats who converted to conservative Republicanism Both are actors who involved themselves in politics Both served as president of the Screen Actors Guild Both are marvelous speakers But here is the critical point about Heston He never grabbed the ring He declined invitations from Democrats and Republicans to run for the Senate in California and resisted efforts to draft him into the 1988 presidential race He was an actor is an actor and will always be an actor His life is comfortable and he sees no reason to change it It s true that Heston the activist has accomplished more than most private citizens ever hope to But he has never done what his characters would have The extraordinary man the man who believes he can change the world hungers for the power to do it and pursues that power relentlessly Reagan had that hunger and changed the world Heston has all the physical equipment brain voice good looks but not the hunger That s why the NRA presidency is the perfect job for him It s a ceremonial position a grand title with few responsibilities attached He will not actually run the NRA His job is to give speeches to be a symbol to act presidential And there s no one who acts presidential better than Charlton Heston If you missed Heston s NRA sound bite click You can read some of his ornery comments about political correctness
