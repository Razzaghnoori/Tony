 Smoking Is Very Bad for You Tim Did you go to summer camp I went for five years and the one thing I could never get used to was that awful feeling I got in my stomach on the last morning I would wake up the final bars of Stairway to Heaven still running through my head from the last dance the smell of smoke still in my hair from the last campfire and my heart would be filled with despair knowing that in just a few short hours the buses would arrive to transport me from the warm nurturing womb of summer camp back to the harsh unfriendly place that is the Real World Well that s how I felt today our last day of Breakfast Table So let s make sure we exchange numbers and stay in touch you know even after the summer And we ll see each other next year right Right Tim Sigh Oh and sorry about participating in Tie Tim Down and Beat Him on the Stomach With Soap Wrapped in a Towel Night but everyone else in the bunk went along with it Now on to the news On Monday you expressed a desire to antagonize the Fray and I don t know about you but I ve been somewhat disappointed in our results Despite our attempts almost zero outrage So let me try with this one Smoking is very bad for you And according to the New York Times the Canadian government agrees with me as it proposed radical new cigarette packaging rules yesterday that would force tobacco makers to create cigarette packs that carry color photographs of diseased hearts and cancerous lungs and lips Look I think everyone should be warned of the dangers of smoking I think every cigarette pack and ad should have a warning label and a straightforward one at that I propose Smoking is very bad for you I m glad they ve banned cigarettes in restaurants and public spaces in New York so I don t have to breathe in Joe Butts secondhand smoke But I think that as long as someone is an adult key word there scumbags who sell cigarettes to children should be treated to a heavy dose of state sponsored torture then let them enjoy their pack a day trips to Marlboro Country They know what they re getting into It s not like the story about the smoking cancer link got buried on Page C27 under an item about the Rotary Club s new lawn sprinkler Oh and let me say that my feelings are not based on some sort of well considered long held libertarian principle I just came up with this about half an hour ago because I have family in Montreal and when I go to visit them I don t want to stop at a convenience store for a pack of gum and have to look at a display case of diseased lung photos It s worth noting that the redesigned cigarette packs would also carry a warning Cigarettes may cause sexual impotence due to decreased blood flow to the penis This can prevent you from having an erection Yeah and so can looking at pictures of diseased hearts and lungs On the other hand if the Canadian government wants to force Coca Cola to print time lapse photos of a nail dissolving in a glass of their product then go for it Are you with me on this
