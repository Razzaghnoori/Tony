 From Clay to Silicon I find as you suggested that computers are having an impact on student writing More and more students compose at the keyboard and some are even becoming comfortable editing on screen Students spends lots of time using computers and right now that means they re writing and reading a lot since using the Web and sending e mail requires lots of writing and reading In the bookstore yesterday I was looking over Clifford Stoll s new book attacking computer use in education I haven t read the book so I can t summarize his stance but on one page he was complaining that students spent too much time interfacing via computer to the detriment of face to face experience He cites a teen age boy who boasted of spending his entire summer vacation online and quotes one 13 year old girl who insists the only way to meet boys to is log on I think Stoll s probably overestimating how much time teen agers spend wired though I do see that computer technology often blinds us to the possibilities of using more traditional technologies I remember once a colleague who came running into my office complaining that his e mail was down and he needed to get some vital information from a colleague several states away While we scratched our heads figuring out how he could e mail his colleague from my workstation a third friend came up and suggested Why not use the telephone We hadn t thought of that I would argue that all writing is a technology and to emphasize the technological aspect of writing I have my students spend an hour writing in an old unfamiliar technology I give each student 4 ounces of children s modeling clay a wooden skewer a length of inch dowel and a writing assignment Their task is to fashion the clay into a writing surface then do the writing assignment using the clay and the wooden stylus When they are done we talk about how this was different from the more conventional writing technologies they are used to pencil and paper computer few seem to use typewriters anymore As Sam Johnson might have put it writing on clay really concentrates the mind It forces you to think about elements of writing that have become more or less automatic in a more ordinary setting Here are some of things my students find You look at writing differently if you have to prepare the surface Inscribing on clay means you can t use cursive very easily or even rounded print characters Clay s not easy to edit And it s not that easy to read the final product You can t put a lot of writing on four ounces of clay and you can really only use one side so you have to make all the space count Clay could get heavy if you had to carry around more than a few pages of it And clay allows you to play with document design in ways you might not with pencil and paper Will computer use improve student writing Not necessarily although there s some suggestion that writing a lot does help and students are writing more with computers than they were before so far as I can tell It s certainly easier to revise on a computer Students tend to forget that cut and paste once involved literal scissors and glue a laborious process that I used to get me through a dissertation almost 30 years ago I myself can write for longer stretches using a computer with less physical and psychological strain than when I was using an electric typewriter New writing technologies have their downsides inevitably There was a complaint voiced in the New York Times when typewriters were coming into favor in offices that the typewriter depersonalized the written word since the reader seemed further removed from actual contact with the human element in writing To some extent this was true but it was also a bit silly since before the typewriter there was a great emphasis on people developing uniform depersonalized handwriting to ensure legibility The computer allows us to revise true but in that process I see that we lose what I call the archeology of the text the stages through which it passes from first to final draft I used to miss that Now I don t But here s something to ponder and let it be my farewell to this chat which I ve found interesting and hope that the readers over our shoulders did as well The next generation of text processing with computers promises sophisticated voice to text programs Is the keyboarding of text only a temporary phenomenon then Will we or our children be talking their essays into microphones composing peripatetically and out loud like Wordsworth writing his poems or bosses dictating letters to secretaries in 1950s TV sitcoms I trust that that will still count as writing though I imagine some technophobes will insist that it is not writing since the composition will be untouched by human hands In any case Jesse I leave it to you to have the last word Best Dennis
