                        HEROISM AND HORROR            PREPAREDNESS AS OF SEPTEMBER             Emergency response is a product of preparedness On the morning of September                  the last best hope for the community of people working in or visiting the                World Trade Center rested not with national policymakers but with private firms and                local public servants especially the first responders fire police emergency                medical service and building safety professionals            Building Preparedness            The World Trade Center                        The World Trade Center WTC complex was built for the Port Authority of New York and                New Jersey Construction began in  and tenants began to occupy its space in                 The Twin Towers came to occupy a unique and symbolic place in the culture of                New York City and America            The WTC actually consisted of seven buildings including one hotel spread across                 acres of land The buildings were connected by an underground mall the concourse                The Twin Towers  WTC or the North Tower and  WTC or the South Tower were the                signature structures containing  million square feet of office space Both                towers had  stories were about  feet high and were square each wall                measured  feet in length On any given workday up to  office workers                occupied the towers and  people passed through the complex                        Each tower contained three central stairwells which ran essentially from top to                bottom and  elevators Generally elevators originating in the lobby ran to sky                lobbies on higher floors where additional elevators carried passengers to the tops                of the buildings                        Stairwells A and C ran from the th floor to the raised mezzanine level of the                lobby Stairwell B ran from the th floor to level B six floors below ground                and was accessible from the West Street lobby level which was one floor below the                mezzanine All three stairwells ran essentially straight up and down except for two                deviations in stairwells A and C where the staircase jutted out toward the perimeter                of the building On the upper and lower boundaries of these deviations were transfer                hallways contained within the stairwell proper Each hallway contained smoke doors                to prevent smoke from rising from lower to upper portions of the building they were                kept closed but not locked Doors leading from tenant space into the stairwells were                never kept locked reentry from the stairwells was generally possible on at least                every fourth floor                        Doors leading to the roof were locked There was no rooftop evacuation plan The                roofs of both the North Tower and the South Tower were sloped and cluttered surfaces                with radiation hazards making them impractical for helicopter landings and as                staging areas for civilians Although the South Tower roof had a helipad it did not                meet  Federal Aviation Administration guidelines                        The  Terrorist Bombing of the WTC and the Port Authoritys Response Unlike most                of America New York City and specifically the World Trade Center had been the                target of terrorist attacks before  At  PM on February   a                pound bomb stashed in a rental van was detonated on a parking garage ramp                beneath theTwinTowers The explosion killed six people injured about  more                and exposed vulnerabilities in the World Trade Centers and the citys emergency                    preparedness                        The towers lost power and communications capability Generators had to be shut down                to ensure safety and elevators stopped The publicaddress system and emergency                lighting systems failed The unlit stairwells filled with smoke and were so dark as                to be impassable Rescue efforts by the Fire Department of New York FDNY were                hampered by the inability of its radios to function in buildings as large as the                Twin Towers The  emergency call system was overwhelmed The general evacuation                of the towers occupants via the stairwells took more than four hours                        Several small groups of people who were physically unable to descend the stairs were                evacuated from the roof of the South Tower by New York Police Department NYPD                helicopters At least one person was lifted from the North Tower roof by the NYPD in                a dangerous helicopter rappel operation  hours after the bombing General                knowledge that these air rescues had occurred appears to have left a number of                civilians who worked in the Twin Towers with the false impression that helicopter                rescues were part of the WTC evacuation plan and that rescue from the roof was a                viable if not favored option for those who worked on upper floors Although they                were considered after  helicopter evacuations in fact were not incorporated                into the WTC fire safety plan                        To address the problems encountered during the response to the  bombing the Port                Authority spent an initial  million to make physical structural and                technological improvements to the WTC as well as to enhance its fire safety plan                and reorganize and bolster its fire safety and security staffs                        Substantial enhancements were made to power sources and exits Fluorescent signs and                markings were added in and near stairwells The Port Authority also installed a                sophisticated computerized fire alarm system with redundant electronics and control                panels and stateoftheart fire command stations were placed in the lobby of each                    tower                        To manage fire emergency preparedness and operations the Port Authority created the                dedicated position of fire safety director The director supervised a team of deputy                fire safety directors one of whom was on duty at the fire command station in the                lobby of each tower at all times He or she would be responsible for communicating                with building occupants during an emergency                        The Port Authority also sought to prepare civilians better for future emergencies                Deputy fire safety directors conducted fire drills at least twice a year with                advance notice to tenants Fire safety teamswere selected from among civilian                employees on each floor and consisted of a fire warden deputy fire wardens and                searchers The standard procedure for fire drills was for fire wardens to lead                coworkers in their respective areas to the center of the floor where they would                use the emergency intercom phone to obtain specific information on how to proceed                Some civilians have told us that their evacuation on September  was greatly aided                by changes and training implemented by the Port Authority in response to the                     bombing                        But during these drills civilians were not directed into the stairwells or provided                with information about their configuration and about the existence of transfer                hallways and smoke doors Neither full nor partial evacuation drills were held                Moreover participation in drills that were held varied greatly from tenant to                tenant In general civilians were never told not to evacuate up The standard fire                drill announcement advised participants that in the event of an actual emergency                they would be directed to descend to at least three floors below the fire Most                civilians recall simply being taught to await the instructions that would be                provided at the time of an emergency Civilians were not informed that rooftop                evacuations were not part of the evacuation plan or that doors to the roof were                kept locked The Port Authority acknowledges that it had no protocol for rescuing                people trapped above a fire in the towers                        Six weeks before the September  attacks control of the WTC was transferred by net                lease to a private developer Silverstein Properties Select Port Authority                employees were designated to assist with the transition Others remained onsite but                were no longer part of the official chain of command However on September  most                Port Authority World Trade Department employeesincluding those not on the                designated transition team reported to their regular stations to provide                assistance throughout the morning Although Silverstein Properties was in charge of                the WTC on September  the WTC fire safety plan remained essentially the                    same                        Preparedness of First Responders            On  the principal first responders were from the Fire Department of New York                the New York Police Department the Port Authority Police Department PAPD and the                Mayors Office of Emergency Management OEM            Port Authority Police Department On September   the Port Authority of New                York and New Jersey Police Department consisted of  officers many of whom were                trained in fire suppression methods as well as in law enforcement The PAPD was led                by a superintendent There was a separate PAPD command for each of the Port                Authoritys nine facilities including the World Trade Center                        Most Port Authority police commands used ultrahighfrequency radios Although all                the radios were capable of using more than one channel most PAPD officers used one                local channel The local channels were lowwattage and worked only in the immediate                vicinity of that command The PAPD also had an agencywide channel but not all                commands could access it                        As of September  the Port Authority lacked any standard operating procedures to                govern how officers from multiple commands would respond to and then be staged and                utilized at a major incident at the WTC In particular there were no standard                operating procedures covering how different commands should communicate via radio                during such an incident            The New York Police Department                        The officer NYPD was headed by a police commissioner whose duties were not                primarily operational but who retained operational authority Much of the NYPDs                operational activities were run by the chief of department In the event of a major                emergency a leading role would be played by the Special Operations Division This                division included the Aviation Unit which provided helicopters for surveys and                rescues and the Emergency Service Unit ESU which carried out specialized rescue                missions The NYPD had specific and detailed standard operating procedures for the                dispatch of officers to an incident depending on the incidents magnitude                        The NYPD precincts were divided into  different radio zones with a central radio                dispatcher assigned to each In addition there were several radio channels for                citywide operations Officers had portable radios with  or more available                channels so that the user could respond outside his or her precinct ESU teams also                had these channels but at an operation would use a separate pointtopoint channel                which was not monitored by a dispatcher The NYPD also supervised the citys                 emergency call system Its approximately  operators radio dispatchers and                supervisors were civilian employees of the NYPD They were trained in the rudiments                of emergency response When a  call concerned a fire it was transferred to FDNY                    dispatch                        The Fire Department of New York                        The member FDNY was headed by a fire commissioner who unlike the police                commissioner lacked operational authority Operations were headed by the chief of                department the sole fivestar chief                        The FDNY was organized in nine separate geographic divisions Each division was                further divided into between four to seven battalions Each battalion contained                typically between three and four engine companies and two to four ladder companies                In total the FDNY had  engine companies and  ladder companies Onduty ladder                companies consisted of a captain or lieutenant and five firefighters onduty engine                companies consisted of a captain or lieutenant and normally four firefighters                Ladder companies primary function was to conduct rescues engine companies focused                on extinguishing fires                        The FDNYs Specialized Operations Command SOC contained a limited number of units                that were of particular importance in responding to a terrorist attack or other                major incident The departments five rescue companies and seven squad companies                performed specialized and highly risky rescue operations                        The logistics of fire operations were directed by Fire Dispatch Operations Division                which had a center in each of the five boroughs All  calls concerning fire                emergencies were transferred to FDNY dispatch                        As of September  FDNY companies and chiefs responding to a fire used analog                pointtopoint radios that had six normal operating channels Typically the                companies would operate on the same tactical channel which chiefs on the scene                would monitor and use to communicate with the firefighters Chiefs at a fire                operation also would use a separate command channel Because these pointtopoint                radios had weak signal strength communications on them could be heard only by other                FDNY personnel in the immediate vicinity In addition the FDNY had a dispatch                frequency for each of the five boroughs these were not pointtopoint channels and                could be monitored from around the city                        The FDNYs radios performed poorly during the  WTC bombing for two reasons                First the radios signals often did not succeed in penetrating the numerous steel                and concrete floors that separated companies attempting to communicate and second                so many different companies were attempting to use the same pointtopoint channel                that communications became unintelligible                        The Port Authority installed at its own expense a repeater system in  to                greatly enhance FDNY radio communications in the difficult highrise environment of                the Twin Towers The Port Authority recommended leaving the repeater system on at                all times The FDNY requested however that the repeater be turned on only when it                was actually needed because the channel could cause interference with other FDNY                operations in Lower Manhattan The repeater system was installed at the Port                Authority police desk in  WTC to be activated by members of the Port Authority                police when the FDNY units responding to the WTC complex so requested However in                the spring of  the FDNY asked that an activation console for the repeater system                be placed instead in the lobby fire safety desk of each of the towers making FDNY                personnel entirely responsible for its activation The Port Authority complied                        Between  and  fewer people died from fires in New York City than in any                threeyear period since accurate measurements began in  Firefighter deathsa                total of  during the scompared favorably with the most tranquil periods in                the departments history                        Office of Emergency Management and Interagency Preparedness                        In  Mayor Rudolph Giuliani created the Mayors Office of Emergency Management                which had three basic functions First OEMs Watch Command was to monitor the                citys key communications channelsincluding radio frequencies of FDNY dispatch and                the NYPDand other data A second purpose of the OEM was to improve New York Citys                response to major incidents including terrorist attacks by planning and conducting                exercises and drills that would involve multiple city agencies particularly the                NYPD and FDNY Third the OEM would play a crucial role in managing the citys                overall response to an The World Trade Center Radio Repeater System Rendering by                Marco Crupi incident After OEMs Emergency Operations Center was activated                designated liaisons from relevant agencies as well as the mayor and his or her                senior staff would respond there In addition an OEM field responder would be sent                to the scene to ensure that the response was coordinated                        The OEMs headquarters was located at WTC Some questioned locating it both so close                to a previous terrorist target and on the rd floor of a building difficult to                access should elevators become inoperable There was no backup site                        In July  Mayor Giuliani updated a directive titled Direction and Control of                Emergencies in the City of New York Its purpose was to eliminate potential                conflict among responding agencies which may have areas of overlapping expertise and                responsibility The directive sought to accomplish this objective by designating                for different types of emergencies an appropriate agency as Incident Commander                This Incident Commander would be responsible for the management of the Citys                response to the emergency while the OEM was designated the On Scene Interagency                    Coordinator                        Nevertheless the FDNY and NYPD each considered itself operationally autonomous As                of September  they were not prepared to comprehensively coordinate their efforts                in responding to a major incident The OEM had not overcome this problem            SEPTEMBER              As we turn to the events of September  we are mindful of the unfair perspective                afforded by hindsight Nevertheless we will try to describe what happened in the                following  minutes                            the  minutes from the crash of the hijacked American Airlines Flight  into                     World Trade Center the North Tower at  until the South Tower was hit                the  minutes from the crash of the hijacked United Airlines Flight  into                     World Trade Center the South Tower at  until the collapse of the South                    Tower                the  minutes from the collapse of the South Tower at  until the collapse                    of the North Tower at  From  until  AM                        At  the hijacked American Airlines Flight  flew into the upper portion of                the North Tower cutting through floors  to  Evidence suggests that all three                of the buildings stairwells became impassable from the nd floor up Hundreds of                civilians were killed instantly by the impact Hundreds more remained alive but                    trapped                        Civilians Fire Safety Personnel and  Calls            North Tower                        A jet fuel fireball erupted upon impact and shot down at least one bank of elevators                The fireball exploded onto numerous lower floors including the th and nd the                West Street lobby level and the B level four stories below ground The burning                jet fuel immediately created thick black smoke that enveloped the upper floors and                roof of the North Tower The roof of the South Tower was also engulfed in smoke                because of prevailing light winds from the northwest                        Within minutes New York Citys  system was flooded with eyewitness accounts of                the event Most callers correctly identified the target of the attack Some                identified the plane as a commercial airliner                        The first response came from private firms and individualsthe people and companies                in the building Everything that would happen to them during the next few minutes                would turn on their circumstances and their preparedness assisted by building                personnel onsite            Hundreds of civilians trapped on or above the nd floor gathered in large and small                groups primarily between the rd and th floors A large group was reported on                the nd floor technically below the impact but unable to descend Civilians were                also trapped in elevators Other civilians below the impact zonemostly on floors in                the s and s but also on at least the th and nd floorswere either trapped                or waiting for assistance                        It is unclear when the first full building evacuation order was attempted over the                publicaddress system The deputy fire safety director in the lobby while                immediately aware that a major incident had occurred did not know for approximately                ten minutes that a commercial jet had directly hit the building Following protocol                he initially gave announcements to those floors that had generated computerized                alarms advising those tenants to descend to points of safetyat least two floors                below the smoke or fireand to wait there for further instructions The deputy fire                safety director has told us that he began instructing a full evacuation within about                ten minutes of the explosion But the first FDNY chiefs to arrive in the lobby were                advised by the Port Authority fire safety directorwho had reported to the lobby                although he was no longer the designated fire safety directorthat the full building                evacuation announcement had been made within one minute of the building being                    hit                        Because of damage to building systems caused by the impact of the plane                publicaddress announcements were not heard in many locations For the same reason                many civilians may have been unable to use the emergency intercom phones as they                had been advised to do in fire drills Many called                         The  system was not equipped to handle the enormous volume of calls it received                Some callers were unable to connect with  operators receiving an all circuits                busymessage Standard operating procedure was for calls relating to fire                emergencies to be transferred from  operators to FDNY dispatch operators in the                appropriate borough in this case Manhattan Transfers were often plagued by                delays and were in some cases unsuccessful Many calls were also prematurely                    disconnected                        The  operators and FDNY dispatchers had no information about either the location                or the magnitude of the impact zone and were therefore unable to provide information                as fundamental as whether callers were above or below the fire Because the                operators were not informed of NYPD Aviations determination of the impossibility of                rooftop rescues from the Twin Towers on that day they could not knowledgeably                answer when callers asked whether to go up or down In most instances therefore                the operators and the FDNY dispatchers relied on standard operating procedures for                highrise firesthat civilians should stay low remain where they are and wait for                emergency personnel to reach them This advice was given to callers from the North                Tower for locations both above and below the impact zone Fire chiefs told us that                the evacuation of tens of thousands of people from skyscrapers can create many new                problems especially for individuals who are disabled or in poor health Many of the                injuries after the  bombing occurred during the evacuation                        Although the guidance to stay in place may seem understandable in cases of                conventional highrise fires FDNY chiefs in the North Tower lobby determined at                once that all building occupants should attempt to evacuate immediately By                 FDNY chiefs had instructed the PAPD and building personnel to evacuate the South                Tower as well because of the magnitude of the damage caused by the first planes                    impact                        These critical decisions were not conveyed to  operators or to FDNY dispatchers                Departing from protocol a number of operators told callers that they could break                windows and several operators advised callers to evacuate if they could                        Civilians who called the Port Authority police desk located at  WTC were advised to                leave if they could                        Most civilians who were not obstructed from proceeding began evacuating without                waiting for instructions over the intercom system Some remained to wait for help                as advised by  operators Others simply continued to work or delayed to collect                personal items but in many cases were urged to leave by others Some Port Authority                civilian employees remained on various upper floors to help civilians who were                trapped and to assist in the evacuation                        While evacuating some civilians had trouble reaching the exits because of damage                caused by the impact Some were confused by deviations in the increasingly crowded                stairwells and impeded by doors that appeared to be locked but actually were jammed                by debris or shifting that resulted from the impact of the plane Despite these                obstacles the evacuation was relatively calm and orderly                        Within ten minutes of impact smoke was beginning to rise to the upper floors in                debilitating volumes and isolated fires were reported although there were some                pockets of refuge Faced with insufferable heat smoke and fire and with no                prospect for relief some jumped or fell from the building                        South Tower                        Many civilians in the South Tower were initially unaware of what had happened in the                other tower Some believed an incident had occurred in their building others were                aware that a major explosion had occurred on the upper floors of the North Tower                Many people decided to leave and some were advised to do so by fire wardens In                addition Morgan Stanley which occupied more than  floors of the South Tower                evacuated its employees by the decision of company security officials                        Consistent with protocol at  the deputy fire safety director in the South Tower                told his counterpart in the North Tower that he would wait to hear from the boss                from the Fire Department or somebody before ordering an evacuation                        At about this time an announcement over the publicaddress system in the South Tower                stated that the incident had occurred in the other building and advised tenants                generally that their building was safe and that they should remain on or return to                their offices or floors A statement from the deputy fire safety director informing                tenants that the incident had occurred in the other building was consistent with                protocol the expanded advice did not correspond to any existing written protocol                and did not reflect any instruction known to have been given to the deputy fire                safety director that day We do not know the reason for the announcement as both                the deputy fire safety director believed to have made it and the director of fire                safety for the WTC complex perished in the South Towers collapse Clearly however                the prospect of another plane hitting the second building was beyond the                contemplation of anyone giving advice According to one of the first fire chiefs to                arrive such a scenario was unimaginable beyond our consciousness As a result of                the announcement many civilians remained on their floors Others reversed their                evacuation and went back up                        Similar advice was given in person by security officials in both the groundfloor                lobbywhere a group of  that had descended by the elevators was personally                instructed to go back upstairsand in the upper sky lobby where many waited for                express elevators to take them down Security officials who gave this advice were                not part of the fire safety staff                        Several South Tower occupants called the Port Authority police desk in  WTC Some                were advised to stand by for further instructions others were strongly advised to                    leave                        It is not known whether the order by the FDNY to evacuate the South Tower was                received by the deputy fire safety director making announcements there However at                approximately less than a minute before the building was hitan instruction                over the South Towers publicaddress system advised civilians generally that they                could begin an orderly evacuation if conditions warranted Like the earlier advice                to remain in place it did not correspond to any prewritten emergency                    instruction                        FDNY Initial Response            Mobilization                        The FDNY response began within five seconds of the crash By  many senior FDNY                leaders including  of the  most highly ranked chiefs in the department as well                as the Commissioner and many of his deputies and assistants had begun responding                from headquarters in Brooklyn While en route over the Brooklyn Bridge the Chief of                Department and the Chief of Operations had a clear view of the situation on the                upper floors of the North Tower They determined that because of the fires                magnitude and location near the top of the building their mission would be                primarily one of rescue They called for a fifth alarm which would bring additional                engine and ladder companies as well as for two more elite rescue units The Chief                of Department arrived at about  general FDNY Incident Command was transferred                to his location on the West Side Highway In all  of the  senior chiefs and                commissioners arrived at the WTC before                         As of  the units that were dispatched including senior chiefs responding to                headquarters included approximately  firefighters These units consisted of                 engine companies nine ladder companies four of the departments elite rescue                teams the departments single Hazmat team two of the citys elite squad companies                and support staff In addition at  nine Brooklyn units were staged on the                Brooklyn side of the BrooklynBatteryTunnel to await possible dispatch orders                        Operations                        A battalion chief and two ladder and two engine companies arrived at the North Tower                at approximately  As they entered the lobby they encountered badly burned                civilians who had been caught in the path of the fireball Floortoceiling windows                in the northwest corner of the West Street level of the lobby had been blown out                some large marble tiles had been dislodged from the walls one entire elevator bank                was destroyed by the fireball Lights were functioning however and the air was                clear of smoke                        As the highestranking officer on the scene the battalion chief initially was the                FDNY incident commander Minutes later the onduty division chief for Lower                Manhattan arrived and took over Both chiefs immediately began speaking with the                former fire safety director and other building personnel to learn whether building                systems were working They were advised that all  elevators in the North Tower                appeared to be out and there were no assurances that sprinklers or standpipes were                working on upper floors Chiefs also spoke with Port Authority police personnel and                an OEM representative                        After conferring with the chiefs in the lobby one engine and one ladder company                began climbing stairwell C at about  with the goal of approaching the impact                zone as scouting units and reporting back to the chiefs in the lobby The radio                channel they used was tactical  Following FDNY highrise fire protocols other                units did not begin climbing immediately as the chiefs worked to formulate a plan                before sending them up Units began mobilizing in the lobby lining up and awaiting                their marching orders                        Also by approximately  FDNY chiefs had asked both building personnel and a Port                Authority police officer to evacuate the South Tower because in their judgment the                impact of the plane into the NorthTower made the entire complex unsafenot because                of concerns about a possible second plane                        The FDNY chiefs in the increasingly crowded North Tower lobby were confronting                critical choices with little to no information They had ordered units up the stairs                to report back on conditions but did not know what the impact floors were they did                not know if any stairwells into the impact zone were clear and they did not know                whether water for firefighting would be available on the upper floors They also did                not know what the fire and impact zone looked like from the outside                        They did know that the explosion had been large enough to send down a fireball that                blew out elevators and windows in the lobby and that conditions were so dire that                some civilians on upper floors were jumping or falling from the building They also                knew from building personnel that some civilians were trapped in elevators and on                specific floors According to Division Chief for Lower Manhattan Peter Hayden We                had a very strong sense we would lose firefighters and that we were in deep trouble                but we had estimates of  to  civilians and we had to try to rescue                    them                        The chiefs concluded that this would be a rescue operation not a firefighting                operation One of the chiefs present explained                             We realized that because of the impact of the plane that there was some                    structural damage to the building and most likely that the fire suppres sion                    systems within the building were probably damaged and possibly inoperable                       We knew that at the height of the day there were as many as  people in                    this building We had a large volume of fire on the upper floors Each floor was                    approximately an acre in size Several floors of fire would have been beyond the                    fireextinguishing capability of the forces that we had on hand So we                    determined very early on that this was going to be strictly a rescue mission                    We were going to vacate the building get everybody out and then we were going                    to get out                                        The specifics of the mission were harder to determine as they had almost no                information about the situation  or more stories above them They also received                advice from senior FDNY chiefs that while the building might eventually suffer a                partial collapse on upper floors such structural failure was not imminent No one                anticipated the possibility of a total collapse                        Emergency medical services EMS personnel were directed to one of four triage areas                being set up around the perimeter of the WTC Some entered the lobby to respond to                specific casualty reports In addition many ambulance paramedics from private                hospitals were rushing to the WTC complex                        NYPD Initial Response            Numerous NYPD officers saw the plane strike the North Tower and immediately reported                it to NYPD communications dispatchers                        At  while en route the NYPD Chief of Department raised the NYPDs mobilization                to level  thereby sending to the WTC approximately  lieutenants  sergeants                and  police officers from all over the city The Chief of Department arrived at                Church and Vesey at                         At  the NYPD patrol mobilization point was moved to West and Vesey in order to                handle the greater number of patrol officers dispatched in the higherlevel                mobilization These officers would be stationed around the perimeter of the complex                to direct the evacuation of civilians Many were diverted on the way to the scene by                intervening emergencies related to the attack                        At  the Aviation Unit of the NYPD dispatched two helicopters to the WTC to                report on conditions and assess the feasibility of a rooftop landing or of special                rescue operations En route the two helicopters communicated with air traffic                controllers at the areas three major airports and informed them of the commercial                airplane crash at the World Trade Center The air traffic controllers had been                unaware of the incident                        At  an NYPD ESU team asked to be picked up at the Wall Street heliport to                initiate rooftop rescues At  however after assessing the North Tower roof a                helicopter pilot advised the ESU team that they could not land on the roof                becauseit is too engulfed in flames and heavy smoke condition                        By  a third NYPD helicopter was responding to the WTC complex NYPD helicopters                and ESU officers remained on the scene throughout the morning prepared to commence                rescue operations on the roof if conditions improved Both FDNY and NYPD protocols                called for FDNY personnel to be placed in NYPD helicopters in the event of an                attempted rooftop rescue at a highrise fire No FDNY personnel were placed in NYPD                helicopters on September                         The  operators and FDNY dispatchers were not advised that rooftop rescues were not                being undertaken They thus were not able to communicate this fact to callers some                of whom spoke of attempting to climb to the roof                        Two onduty NYPD officers were on the th floor of the North Tower at  They                climbed to the th floor urging civilians to evacuate but did not locate a group                of civilians trapped on the nd floor                        Just before  an ESU team began to walk from Church and Vesey to the North Tower                lobby with the goal of climbing toward and setting up a triage center on the upper                floors for the severely injured A second ESU team would follow them to assist in                removing those individuals                        Numerous officers responded in order to help injured civilians and to urge those who                could walk to vacate the area immediately Putting themselves in danger of falling                debris several officers entered the plaza and successfully rescued at least one                injured nonambulatory civilian and attempted to rescue others                        Also by about  transit officers began shutting down subway stations in the                vicinity of the World Trade Center and evacuating civilians from those                    stations                        Around the city the NYPD cleared major thoroughfares for emergency vehicles to                access the WTC The NYPD and PAPD coordinated the closing of bridges and tunnels                into Manhattan                        PAPD Initial Response            The Port Authoritys onsite commanding police officer was standing in the concourse                when a fireball erupted out of elevator shafts and exploded onto the mall concourse                causing him to dive for cover The onduty sergeant initially instructed the                officers in the WTC Command to meet at the police desk in  WTC Soon thereafter he                instructed officers arriving from outside commands to meet him at the fire safety                desk in the North Tower lobby A few of these officers from outside commands were                given WTC Command radios                        One Port Authority police officer at the WTC immediately began climbing stairwell C                in the North Tower                        Other officers began performing rescue and evacuation operations on the ground floors                and in the PATH Port Authority TransHudson station below the WTC complex            Within minutes of impact Port Authority police officers from the PATH bridges                tunnels and airport commands began responding to the WTC The PAPD lacked written                standard operating procedures for personnel responding from outside commands to the                WTC during a major incident In addition offi cers from some PAPD commands lacked                interoperable radio frequencies As a result there was no comprehensive                coordination of PAPDs overall response                        At  the PAPD commanding officer of the WTC ordered an evacuation of all                civilians in the World Trade Center complex because of the magnitude of the                calamity in the North Tower This order was given over WTC police radio channel W                which could not be heard by the deputy fire safety director in the South Tower                        Also at  the PAPD Superintendent and Chief of Department arrived separately and                made their way to the North Tower                        OEM Initial Response            By  officials in OEM headquarters on the rd floor of  WTCjust to the north                of the North Towerbegan to activate the Emergency Operations Center by calling such                agencies as the FDNY NYPD Department of Health and the Greater Hospital                Association and instructing them to send their designated representatives to the                OEM In addition the Federal Emergency Management Agency FEMA was called and                asked to send at least five federal Urban Search and Rescue Teams such teams are                located throughout the United States At approximately  a senior                representative from the OEM arrived in the lobby of the North Tower and began to act                as the OEM field responder to the incident He soon was joined by several other OEM                officials including the OEM Director                        Summary            In the minute period between  and  AM on September  New York City and                the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had mobilized the largest rescue                operation in the citys history Well over a thousand first responders had been                deployed an evacuation had begun and the critical decision that the fire could not                be fought had been made            Then the second plane hit            From  until  AM            At  the hijacked United Airlines Flight  hit  WTC the South Tower from                the south crashing through the th to th floors What had been the largest and                most complicated rescue operation in city history instantly doubled in magnitude                The plane banked as it hit the building leaving portions of the building undamaged                on impact floors As a consequenceand in contrast to the situation in the                NorthTowerone of the stairwells A initially remained passable from at least the                st floor down and likely from top to bottom                        Civilians Fire Safety Personnel and  Calls            South Tower                        At the lower end of the impact the thfloor sky lobby hundreds had been waiting                to evacuate when the plane hit Many had attempted but failed to squeeze into packed                express elevators Upon impact many were killed or severely injured others were                relatively unharmed We know of at least one civilian who seized the initiative and                shouted that anyone who could walk should walk to the stairs and anyone who could                help should help others in need of assistance As a result at least two small                groups of civilians descended from that floor Others remained on the floor to help                the injured and move victims who were unable to walk to the stairwell to aid their                    rescue                        Still others remained alive in the impact zone above the th floor Damage was                extensive and conditions were highly precarious The only survivor known to have                escaped from the heart of the impact zone described the st floorwhere the wing of                the plane had sliced through his officeas a demolition site in which everything                was broken up and the smell of jet fuel was so strong that it was almost                impossible to breathe This person escaped by means of an unlikely rescue aided by                a civilian fire warden descending from a higher floor who critically had been                provided with a flashlight                        At least four people were able to descend stairwell A from the st floor or above                One left the th floor immediately after the building was hit Even at that point                the stairway was dark smoky and difficult to navigate glow strips on the stairs                and handrails were a significant help Several flights down however the evacuee                became confused when he reached a smoke door that caused him to believe the stairway                had ended He was able to exit that stairwell and switch to another                        Many civilians in and above the impact zone ascended the stairs One small group                reversed its descent down stairwell A after being advised by another civilian that                they were approaching a floor in flames The only known survivor has told us that                their intention was to exit the stairwell in search of clearer air At the st                floor joined by others from intervening floors they perceived themselves to be                trapped in the stairwell and began descending again By this time the stairwell was                pretty black intensifying smoke caused many to pass out and fire had ignited in                the ndfloor transfer hallway                        Others ascended to attempt to reach the roof but were thwarted by locked doors At                approximately  a lock release orderwhich would unlock all areas in the                complex controlled by the buildings computerized security system including doors                leading to the roofswas transmitted to the Security Command Center located on the                nd floor of the North Tower Damage to the software controlling the system                resulting from the impact of the plane prevented this order from being                    executed                        Others attempting to descend were frustrated by jammed or locked doors in                stairwells or confused by the structure of the stairwell deviations By the lower                s however stairwells A and B were welllit and conditions were generally                    normal                        Some civilians remained on affected floors and at least one ascended from a lower                point into the impact zone to help evacuate colleagues or assist the injured                        Within  minutes after the impact debilitating smoke had reached at least one                location on the th floor and severe smoke conditions were reported throughout                floors in the s and s over the course of the following half hour By  a                number of civilians who had failed to reach the roof remained on the th floor                likely unable to descend because of intensifying smoke in the stairwell There were                reports of tremendous smoke on that floor but at least one area remained less                affected until shortly before the building collapsed There were several areas                between the impact zone and the uppermost floors where conditions were better At                least a hundred people remained alive on the th and th floors in some cases                calling  for direction                        The  system remained plagued by the operators lack of awareness of what was                occurring Just as in the North Tower callers from below and above the impact zone                were advised to remain where they were and wait for help The operators were not                given any information about the inability to conduct rooftop rescues and therefore                could not advise callers that they had essentially been ruled out This lack of                information combined with the general advice to remain where they were may have                caused civilians above the impact not to attempt to descend although stairwell A                may have been passable                        In addition the  system struggled with the volume of calls and rigid standard                operating procedures according to which calls conveying crucial information had to                wait to be transferred to either EMS or FDNY dispatch                        According to one civilian who was evacuating down stairwell A from the heart of the                impact zone and who stopped on the st floor in order to call  I told them when                they answered the phone where I was that I had passed somebody on the th floor                injuredthey need to get a medic and a stretcher to this floor and described the                situation in brief and the person then asked for my phone number or something and                they saidthey put me on hold You gotta talk to one of my supervisorsand                suddenly I was on hold And so I waited a considerable amount of time Somebody else                came back on the phone I repeated the story And then it happened again I was on                hold a second time and needed to repeat the story for a third time But I told the                third person that I am only telling you once I am getting out of the building here                are the details write it down and do what you should do                        Very few  calls were received from floors below the impact but at least one                person was advised to remain on the rd floor despite the callers protests that                oxygen was running out The last known  call from this location came at                                            Evidence suggests that the publicaddress system did not continue to function after                the building was hit A group of people trapped on the th floor however made                repeated references in calls to  to having heard announcements to go down the                stairs Evacuation tones were heard in locations both above and below the impact                    zone                        By  the West Street lobby level of the SouthTower was becoming overwhelmed by                injured people who had descended to the lobby but were having difficulty going on                Those who could continue were directed to exit north or east through the concourse                and then out of the WTC complex                        By  at least one person had descended from as high as the st floor of that                tower and stairwell A was reported to have been almost empty Stairwell B was also                reported to have contained only a handful of descending civilians at an earlier                point in the morning But just before the tower collapsed a team of NYPD ESU                officers encountered a stream of civilians descending an unidentified stairwell in                the s These civilians may have been descending from at or above the impact                    zone                        North Tower                        In the North Tower civilians continued their evacuation On the st floor the                highest floor with stairway access all civilians but one were uninjured and able to                descend While some complained of smoke heat fumes and crowding in the                stairwells conditions were otherwise fairly normal on floors below the impact At                least one stairwell was reported to have been clear and bright from the upper s                    down                        Those who called  from floors below the impact were generally advised to remain in                place One group trapped on the rd floor pleaded repeatedly to know whether the                fire was above or below them specifically asking if  operators had any                information from the outside or from the news The callers were transferred back and                forth several times and advised to stay put Evidence suggests that these callers                    died                        At  the Port Authority police desk at Newark Airport told a third party that a                group of Port Authority civilian employees on the th floor should evacuate The                third party was not at the WTC but had been in phone contact with the group on the                th floor At  in response to an inquiry from the employees themselves the                Port Authority police desk in Jersey City confirmed that employees on the th floor                should be careful stay near the stairwells and wait for the police to come up                When the third party inquired again at  the police desk at Newark Airport                advised that they absolutely evacuate The third party informed the police desk                that the employees had previously received contrary advice from the FDNY which                could only have come via  These workers were not trapped yet unlike most                occupants on the upper floors they had chosen not to descend immediately after                impact They eventually began to descend the stairs but most of them died in the                collapse of the North Tower                        All civilians who reached the lobby were directed by NYPD and PAPD officers into the                concourse where other police officers guided them to exit the concourse and complex                to the north and east so that they might avoid falling debris and victims                        By  only a few civilians were descending above the th floor in stair well B                these primarily were injured handicapped elderly or severely overweight                civilians in some cases being assisted by other civilians                        By  tenants from the st floor had already descended the stairs and exited the                concourse However a number of civilians remained in at least stairwell C                approaching lower floors Other evacuees were killed earlier by debris falling on                the street                        FDNY Response            Increased Mobilization                        Immediately after the second plane hit the FDNY Chief of Department called a second                fifth alarm                        By  the number of FDNY personnel en route to or present at the scene was far                greater than the commanding chiefs at the scene had requested Five factors account                for this disparity First while the second fifth alarm had called for  engine and                 ladder companies in fact  engine and  ladder companies were dispatched                Second several other units selfdispatched Third because the attacks came so                close to the  shift change many firefighters just going off duty were given                permission by company officers to ride heavy and became part of those onduty                teams under the leadership of that units officer Fourth many offduty                firefighters responded from firehouses separately from the onduty unit in some                cases when expressly told not to or from home The arrival of personnel in excess                of that dispatched was particularly pronounced in the departments elite units                Fifth numerous additional FDNY personnelsuch as fire marshals and firefighters in                administrative positionswho lacked a predetermined operating role also reported to                the WTC                        The Repeater System                        Almost immediately after the South Tower was hit senior FDNY chiefs in the North                Tower lobby huddled to discuss strategy for the operations in the two towers Of                particular concern to the chiefsin light of FDNY difficulties in responding to the                 bombingwas communications capability One of the chiefs recommended testing                the repeater channel to see if it would work                        Earlier an FDNY chief had asked building personnel to activate the repeater channel                which would enable greatlyenhanced FDNY portable radio communications in the                highrises One button on the repeater system activation console in the North Tower                was pressed at  though it is unclear by whom As a result of this activation                communication became possible between FDNY portable radios on the repeater channel                In addition the repeaters master handset at the fire safety desk could hear                communications made by FDNY portable radios on the repeater channel The activation                of transmission on the master handset required however that a second button be                pressed That second button was never activated on the morning of September                         At  FDNY chiefs tested the WTC complexs repeater system Because the second                button had not been activated the chief on the master handset could not transmit                He was also apparently unable to hear another chief who was attempting to                communicate with him from a portable radio either because of a technical problem or                because the volume was turned down on the console the normal setting when the                system was not in use Because the repeater channel seemed inoperablethe master                handset appeared unable to transmit or receive communicationsthe chiefs in the                NorthTower lobby decided not to use it The repeater system was working at least                partially however on portable FDNY radios and firefighters subsequently used                repeater channel  in the South Tower                        FDNY North Tower Operations                        Command and control decisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what was                happening    and  floors above According to one of the chiefs in the                lobby One of the most critical things in a major operation like this is to have                information We didnt have a lot of information coming in We didnt receive any                reports of what was seen from the NYPD helicopters It was impossible to know how                much damage was done on the upper floors whether the stairwells were intact or                    not                        According to another chief present People watching on TV certainly had more                knowledge of what was happening a hundred floors above us than we did in the lobby                   Without critical information coming in    its very difficult to make                informed critical decisions                        As a result chiefs in the lobby disagreed over whether anyone at or above the impact                zone possibly could be rescued or whether there should be even limited firefighting                for the purpose of cutting exit routes through fire zones                        Many units were simply instructed to ascend toward the impact zone and report back to                the lobby via radio Some units were directed to assist specific groups of                individuals trapped in elevators or in offices well below the impact zone One FDNY                company successfully rescued some civilians who were trapped on the nd floor as a                result of damage caused by the initial fireball                        An attempt was made to track responding units assignments on a magnetic board but                the number of units and individual firefighters arriving in the lobby made this an                overwhelming task As the fire companies were not advised to the contrary they                followed protocol and kept their radios on tactical channel  which would be                monitored by the chiefs in the lobby Those battalion chiefs who would climb would                operate on a separate command channel which also would be monitored by the chiefs                in the lobby                        Fire companies began to ascend stairwell B at approximately  laden with about                 pounds of heavy protective clothing selfcontained breathing apparatuses and                other equipment including hoses for engine companies and heavy tools for ladder                companies Firefighters found the stairways they entered intact lit and clear                of smoke Unbeknownst to the lobby command post one battalion chief in the North                Tower found a working elevator which he took to the th floor before beginning to                    climb                        In ascending stairwell B firefighters were passing a steady and heavy stream of                descending civilians Firemen were impressed with the composure and total lack of                panic shown by almost all civilians Many civilians were in awe of the firefighters                and found their mere presence to be calming                        Firefighters periodically stopped on particular floors and searched to ensure that no                civilians were still on it In a few instances healthy civilians were found on                floors either because they still were collecting personal items or for no apparent                reason they were told to evacuate immediately Firefighters deputized healthy                civilians to be in charge of others who were struggling or injured                        Climbing up the stairs with heavy protective clothing and equipment was hard work                even for physically fit firefighters As firefighters began to suffer varying levels                of fatigue some became separated from others in their unit                        At  a senior chief radioed all units in the North Tower to return to the lobby                either because of a false report of a third plane approaching or because of his                judgment about the deteriorating condition of the building Once the rumor of the                third plane was debunked other chiefs continued operations and there is no                evidence that any units actually returned to the lobby At the same time a chief in                the lobby was asked to consider the possibility of a rooftop rescue but was unable                to reach FDNY dispatch by radio or phone Out on West Street however the FDNY                Chief of Department had already dismissed any rooftop rescue as impossible                        As units climbed higher their ability to communicate with chiefs on tactical                 became more limited and sporadic both because of the limited effectiveness of FDNY                radios in highrises and because so many units on tactical  were trying to                communicate at once When attempting to reach a particular unit chiefs in the lobby                often heard nothing in response                        Just prior to  in the North Tower one engine company had climbed to the th                floor at least two other companies of firefighters had reached the sky lobby on the                th floor and numerous units were located between the th and th floors                        FDNY South Tower and Marriott Hotel Operations                        Immediately after the repeater test a senior chief and a battalion chief commenced                operations in the South Tower lobby Almost at once they were joined by an OEM field                responder They were not however joined right away by a sizable number of fire                companies as units that had been in or en route to the North Tower lobby at                 were not reallocated to the South Tower                        A battalion chief and a ladder company found a working elevator to the th floor and                from there proceeded to climb stairwell B Another ladder company arrived soon                thereafter and began to rescue civilians trapped in an elevator between the first                and second floors The senior chief in the lobby expressed frustration about the                lack of units he initially had at his disposal for SouthTower operations                        Unlike the commanders in the North Tower the senior chief in the lobby and the                ascending battalion chief kept their radios on repeater channel  For the first                 minutes of the operations communications among them and the ladder company climbing                with the battalion chief worked well Upon learning from a company security official                that the impact zone began at the th floor a ladder company transmitted this                information and the battalion chief directed an engine company staged on the th                floor to attempt to find an elevator to reach that upper level                        To our knowledge no FDNY chiefs outside the South Tower realized that the repeater                channel was functioning and being used by units in that tower The senior chief in                the South Tower lobby was initially unable to communicate his requests for more                units to chiefs either in the North Tower lobby or at the outdoor command post                        From approximately  on the ascending battalion chief was unable to reach the                South Tower lobby command post because the senior chief in the lobby had ceased to                communicate on repeater channel  The vast majority of units that entered the                SouthTower did not communicate on the repeater channel                        The first FDNY fatality of the day occurred at approximately  when a civilian                landed on and killed a fireman near the intersection of West and Liberty                    streets                        By  chiefs in charge of the South Tower still were in need of additional                companies Several factors account for the lag in response First only two units                that had been dispatched to the North Tower prior to  reported immediately to                the South Tower Second units were not actually sent until approximately five                minutes after the FDNY Chief of Department ordered their dispatch Third those                units that had been ordered at  to stage at the BrooklynBattery Tunneland thus                very close to the WTC complexwere not dispatched after the plane hit the South                Tower Fourth units parked further north on West Street then proceeded south on                foot and stopped at the overall FDNY command post on West Street where in some                cases they were told to wait Fifth some units responded directly to the North                Tower Indeed radio communications indicated that in certain cases some firemen                believed that the South Tower was  WTC when in fact it was  WTC Sixth some                units couldnt find the staging area at West Street south of Liberty for the South                Tower Finally the jumpers and debris that confronted units attempting to enter the                SouthTower from its main entrance on Liberty Street caused some units to search for                indirect ways to enter that tower most often through the Marriott Hotel or simply                to remain on West Street                        A chief at the overall outdoor command post was under the impression that he was to                assist in lobby operations of the South Tower and in fact his aide already was in                that lobby But because of his lack of familiarity with the WTC complex and                confusion over how to get to there he instead ended up in the Marriott at about                 Here he came across about  units many of which had been trying to find safe                access to the South Tower He directed them to secure the elevators and conduct                searchandrescue operations on the upper floors of the Marriott Four of these                companies searched the spa on the hotels top floorthe nd floorfor civilians                and found none                        Feeling satisfied with the scope of the operation in the Marriott the chief in the                lobby there directed some units to proceed to what he thought was the SouthTower In                fact he pointed them to the NorthTower Three of the FDNY companies who had entered                the NorthTower from the Marriott found a working elevator in a bank at the south end                of the lobby which they took to the rd floor                        In response to the shortage of units in the South Tower at  an additional second                alarm was requested by the chief at the West and Liberty streets staging area At                this time the units that earlier had been staged on the Brooklyn side of the                BrooklynBattery Tunnel were dispatched to the South Tower some had gone through                the tunnel already and had responded to the Marriott not the South Tower                        Between  and  the ascending battalion chief continued to lead FDNY                operations on the upper floors of the South Tower At  an FDNY ladder company                encountered numerous seriously injured civilians on the th floor With the                assistance of a security guard at  a group of civilians trapped in an elevator                on the thfloor sky lobby were found by an FDNY company They were freed from the                elevator at  By that time the battalion chief had reached the th floor on                stairwell A he reported that it looked open to the th floor well into the impact                zone He also reported numerous civilian fatalities in the area                        FDNY Command and Control Outside the Towers                        The overall command post consisted of senior chiefs commissioners the field                communications van Field Comm numerous units that began to arrive after the South                Tower was hit and EMS chiefs and personnel                        Field Comms two main functions were to relay information between the overall                operations command post and FDNY dispatch and to track all units operating at the                scene on a large magnetic board Both of these missions were severely compromised by                the magnitude of the disaster on September  First the means of transmitting                information were unreliable For example while FDNY dispatch advised Field Comm                that  people were reported via  to be trapped on the th floor of the North                Tower and Field Comm then attempted to convey that report to chiefs at the outdoor                command post this information did not reach the North Tower lobby Second Field                Comms ability to keep track of which units were operating where was limited                because many units reported directly to the North Tower the South Tower or the                Marriott Third efforts to track units by listening to tactical  were severely                hampered by the number of units using that channel as many people tried to speak at                once their transmissions overlapped and often became indecipherable In the opinion                of one of the members of the Field Comm group tactical  simply was not designed to                handle the number of units operating on it that morning                        The primary Field Comm van had access to the NYPDs Special Operations channel used                by NYPD Aviation but it was in the garage for repairs on September  The backup                van lacked that capability                        The Chief of Department along with civilian commissioners and senior EMS chiefs                organized ambulances on West Street to expedite the transport of injured civilians                to hospitals                        To our knowledge none of the chiefs present believed that a total collapse of either                tower was possible One senior chief did articulate his concern that upper floors                could begin to collapse in a few hours and that firefighters thus should not ascend                above floors in the s That opinion was not conveyed to chiefs in the North Tower                lobby and there is no evidence that it was conveyed to chiefs in the South Tower                lobby either                        Although the Chief of Department had general authority over operations tactical                decisions remained the province of the lobby commanders The highestranking officer                in the North Tower was responsible for communicating with the Chief of Department                They had two brief conversations In the first the senior lobby chief gave the                Chief of Department a status report and confirmed that this was a rescue not                firefighting operation In the second conversation at about  the Chief of                Department suggested that given how the North Tower appeared to him the senior                lobby chief might want to consider evacuating FDNY personnel                        At  the Chief of Department called an additional fifth alarm and at  an                additional  engine and  ladder companies were sent to the WTC As a result more                than onethird of all FDNY companies now had been dispatched to the WTC At about                 an EMS paramedic approached the FDNY Chief of Department and advised that an                engineer in front of  WTC had just remarked that the Twin Towers in fact were in                imminent danger of a total collapse                        NYPD Response            Immediately after the second plane hit the Chief of Department of the NYPD ordered a                second Level  mobilization bringing the total number of NYPD officers responding                to close to                         The NYPD Chief of Department called for Operation Omega which required the                protection of sensitive locations around the city NYPD headquarters were secured                and all other government buildings were evacuated                        The ESU command post at Church and Vesey streets coordinated all NYPD ESU rescue                teams After the South Tower was hit the ESU officer running this command post                decided to send one ESU team each with approximately six police officers up each                of the Twin Towers stairwells While he continued to monitor the citywide SOD                channel which NYPD helicopters were using he also monitored the pointtopoint                tactical channel that the ESU teams climbing in the towers would use                        The first NYPD ESU team entered the West Streetlevel lobby of the North Tower and                prepared to begin climbing at about  AM They attempted to check in with the                FDNY chiefs present but were rebuffed OEM personnel did not intervene The ESU                team began to climb the stairs Shortly thereafter a second NYPD ESU team entered                the South Tower The OEM field responder present ensured that they check in with the                FDNY chief in charge of the lobby and it was agreed that the ESU team would ascend                and support FDNY personnel                        A third ESU team subsequently entered the North Tower at its elevated mezzanine lobby                level and made no effort to check in with the FDNY command post A fourth ESU team                entered the South Tower By  a fifth ESU team was next to  WTC and preparing                to enter the North Tower                        By approximately  the lead ESU team had reached the st floor observing that                there appeared to be no more civilians still descending This ESU team encountered a                large group of firefighters and administered oxygen to some of them who were                    exhausted                        At about  the officer running the ESU command post on Church and Vesey streets                had a final radio communication with one of the ESU teams in the South Tower The                team then stated that it was ascending via stairs was somewhere in the s and was                making slow progress because of the numerous descending civilians crowding the                    stairwell                        Three plainclothes NYPD officers without radios or protective gear had begun                ascending either stairwell A or C of the NorthTower They began checking every other                floor above the th for civilians Only occasionally did they find any and in                those few cases they ordered the civilians to evacuate immediately While checking                floors they used office phones to call their superiors In one phone call an NYPD                chief instructed them to leave the North Tower but they refused to do so As they                climbed higher they encountered increasing smoke and heat Shortly before                 they arrived on the th floor                        Throughout this period  to  a group of NYPD and Port Authority police                officers as well as two Secret Service agents continued to assist civilians                leaving the North Tower They were positioned around the mezzanine lobby level of                the North Tower directing civilians leaving stairwells A and C to evacuate down an                escalator to the concourse The officers instructed those civilians who seemed                composed to evacuate the complex calmly but rapidly Other civilians exiting the                stairs who were either injured or exhausted collapsed at the foot of these stairs                officers then assisted them out of the building                        When civilians reached the concourse another NYPD officer stationed at the bottom of                the escalator directed them to exit through the concourse to the north and east and                then out of the WTC complex This exit route ensured that civilians would not be                endangered by falling debris and people on West Street on the plaza between the                towers and on Liberty Street                        Some officers positioned themselves at the top of a flight of stairs by WTC that led                down into the concourse going into the concourse when necessary to evacuate injured                or disoriented civilians Numerous other NYPD officers were stationed throughout the                concourse assisting burned injured and disoriented civilians as well as                directing all civilians to exit to the north and east NYPD officers were also in                the South Tower lobby to assist in civilian evacuation NYPD officers stationed on                Vesey Street between West Street and Church Street urged civilians not to remain in                the area and instead to keep walking north                        At  the NYPD Chief of Department instructed that no units were to land on the                roof of either tower At about  one of the helicopters present advised that a                rooftop evacuation still would not be possible One NYPD helicopter pilot believed                one portion of the North Tower roof to be free enough of smoke that a hoist could be                lowered in order to rescue people but there was no one on the roof This pilots                helicopter never attempted to hover directly over the tower Another helicopter did                attempt to do so and its pilot stated that the severity of the heat from the jet                fuelladen fire in the North Tower would have made it impossible to hover low enough                for a rescue because the high temperature would have destabilized the                    helicopter                        At  an aviation unit warned units of large pieces of debris hanging from the                building Prior to  no NYPD helicopter pilot predicted that either tower would                    collapse                        Interaction of  Calls and NYPD Operations                        At  a civilian on the th floor of the South Tower reported to a  operator                that a lower floorthe something floorwas collapsing This information was                conveyed inaccurately by the  operator to an NYPD dispatcher The dispatcher                further confused the substance of the  call by telling NYPD officers at the WTC                complex that the th floor is crumbling at   minutes after the  call                was placed The NYPD dispatcher conveyed this message on the radio frequency used in                precincts in the vicinity of the WTC and subsequently on the Special Operations                Division channel but not on City Wide channel                         PAPD Response            Initial responders from outside PAPD commands proceeded to the police desk in  WTC                or to the fire safety desk in the North Tower lobby Some officers were then                assigned to assist in stairwell evacuations others were assigned to expedite                evacuation in the plaza concourse and PATH station As information was received of                civilians trapped above groundlevel floors of the NorthTower other PAPD officers                were instructed to climb to those floors for rescue efforts Still others began                climbing toward the impact zone                        At  the PAPD Superintendent and an inspector began walking up stairwell B of the                North Tower to assess damage near and in the impact zone The PAPD Chief and several                other PAPD officers began ascending a stairwell in order to reach the Windows on the                World restaurant on the th floor from which calls had been made to the PAPD                police desk reporting at least  people trapped                        Many PAPD officers from different commands responded on their own initiative By                 the PAPD central police desk requested that responding officers meet at West                and Vesey and await further instructions In the absence of a predetermined command                structure to deal with an incident of this magnitude a number of PAPD inspectors                captains and lieutenants stepped forward at around  to formulate an onsite                response plan They were hampered by not knowing how many officers were responding                to the site and where those officers were operating Many of the officers who                responded to this command post lacked suitable protective equipment to enter the                    complex                        By  one PAPD officer had reached the thfloor sky lobby of the North Tower                Also in the North Tower one team of PAPD officers was in the mids and another                was in the lower s Numerous PAPD officers were also climbing in the South Tower                including the PAPD ESU team Many PAPD officers were on the ground floors of the                complexsome assisting in evacuation others manning the PAPD desk in  WTC or                assisting at lobby command posts                        OEM Response            After the South Tower was hit OEM senior leadership decided to remain in its                bunker and continue conducting operations even though all civilians had been                evacuated from  WTC At approximately  a senior OEM official ordered the                evacuation of the facility after a Secret Service agent in  WTC advised him that                additional commercial planes were not accounted for Prior to its evacuation no                outside agency liaisons had reached OEM OEM field responders were stationed in each                towers lobby at the FDNY overall command post and at least for some period of                time at the NYPD command post at Church and Vesey                        Summary            The emergency response effort escalated with the crash of United  into the South                Tower With that escalation communications as well as command and control became                increasingly critical and increasingly difficult First responders assisted                thousands of civilians in evacuating the towers even as incident commanders from                responding agencies lacked knowledge of what other agencies and in some cases                their own responders were doing            From  until  AM            At  the South Tower collapsed in ten seconds killing all civilians and                emergency personnel inside as well a number of individualsboth first responders                and civiliansin the concourse in the Marriott and on neighboring streets The                building collapsed into itself causing a ferocious windstorm and creating a massive                debris cloud The Marriott hotel suffered significant damage as a result of the                collapse of the South Tower                        Civilian Response in the North Tower            The  calls placed from most locations in the North Tower grew increasingly                desperate as time went on As late as  people remained alive in some                locations including on the nd and th floors Below the impact zone it is                likely that most civilians who were physically and emotionally capable of descending                had exited the tower The civilians who were nearing the bottom of stairwell C were                assisted out of the building by NYPD FDNY and PAPD personnel Others who                experienced difficulty evacuating were being helped by first responders on lower                    floors                        FDNY Response            Immediate Impact of the Collapse of the South Tower The FDNY overall command post                and posts in the NorthTower lobby the Marriott lobby and the staging area on West                Street south of Liberty all ceased to operate upon the collapse of the SouthTower                as did EMS staging areas because of their proximity to the building                        Those who had been in the North Tower lobby had no way of knowing that the South                Tower had suffered a complete collapse Chiefs who had fled from the overall command                post on the west side of West Street took shelter in the underground parking garage                at  World Financial Center and were not available to influence FDNY operations for                the next ten minutes or so                        When the South Tower collapsed firefighters on upper floors of the North Tower heard                a violent roar and many were knocked off their feet they saw debris coming up the                stairs and observed that the power was lost and emergency lights activated                Nevertheless those firefighters not standing near windows facing south had no way                of knowing that the SouthTower had collapsed many surmised that a bomb had                exploded or that the North Tower had suffered a partial collapse on its upper                    floors                        We do not know whether the repeater channel continued to function after                         Initial Evacuation Instructions and Communications                        The South Towers total collapse was immediately communicated on the Manhattan                dispatch channel by an FDNY boat on the Hudson River but to our knowledge no one                at the site received this information because every FDNY command post had been                abandonedincluding the overall command post which included the Field Comm van                Despite his lack of knowledge of what had happened to the SouthTower a chief in the                process of evacuating the NorthTower lobby sent out an order within a minute of the                collapseCommand to all units in Tower  evacuate the building Another chief                from the North Tower lobby soon followed with an additional evacuation order issued                on tactical                         Evacuation orders did not follow the protocol for giving instructions when a                buildings collapse may be imminenta protocol that includes constantly                repeatingMayday Mayday Maydayduring the  minutes between the fall of the                SouthTower and that of the NorthTower In addition most of the evacuation                instructions did not mention that the SouthTower had collapsed However at least                three firefighters heard evacuation instructions which stated that the North Tower                was in danger of imminent collapse                        FDNY Personnel above the Ground Floors of the North Tower                        Within minutes some firefighters began to hear evacuation orders over tactical  At                least one chief also gave the evacuation instruction on the command channel used                only by chiefs in the North Tower which was much less crowded                        At least two battalion chiefs on upper floors of the North Towerone on the rd                floor and one on the th floorheard the evacuation instruction on the command                channel and repeated it to everyone they came across The chief on the rd floor                apparently aggressively took charge to ensure that all firefighters on the floors in                the immediate area were evacuating The chief on the th floor also heard a                separate radio communication stating that the South Tower had collapsed which the                chief on the rd floor may have heard as well He subsequently acted with a sense                of urgency and some firefighters heard the evacuation order for the first time when                he repeated it on tactical  This chief also had a bullhorn and traveled to each of                the stairwells and shouted the evacuation orderAll FDNY get the fuck outAs a                result of his efforts many firefighters who had not been in the process of                evacuating began to do so                        Other firefighters did not receive the evacuation transmissions for one of four                reasons First some FDNY radios did not pick up the transmission because of the                difficulties of radio communications in highrises Second the numbers trying to                use tactical  after the South Tower collapsed may have drowned out some evacuation                instructions According to one FDNY lieutenant who was on the st floor of the                North Tower at the time Tactical channel  just might have been so bogged down                that it may have been impossible to get that order through Third some firefighters in the North Tower were offduty and did not                have radios Fourth some firefighters in the NorthTower had been dispatched to the                South Tower and likely were on the different tactical channel assigned to that                    tower                        FDNY personnel in the North Tower who received the evacuation orders did not respond                uniformly Some unitsincluding one whose officer knew that the South Tower had                collapsedeither delayed or stopped their evacuation in order to assist                nonambulatory civilians Some units whose members had become separated during the                climb attempted to regroup so they could descend together Some units began to                evacuate but according to eyewitnesses did not hurry At least several                firefighters who survived believed that they and others would have evacuated more                urgently had they known of the South Towers complete collapse Other firefighters                continued to sit and rest on floors while other companies descended past them and                reminded them that they were supposed to evacuate Some firefighters were determined                not to leave the building while other FDNY personnel remained inside and in one                case convinced others to remain with them In another case firefighters had                successfully descended to the lobby where another firefighter then persuaded them                to reascend in order to look for specific FDNY personnel                        Other FDNY personnel did not hear the evacuation order on their radio but were                advised orally to leave the building by other firefighters and police who were                themselves evacuating                        By  approximately five FDNY companies reached the bottom of stairwell B and                entered the North Tower lobby They stood in the lobby for more than a minute not                certain what to do as no chiefs were present Finally one firefighterwho had                earlier seen from a window that the SouthTower had collapsedurged that they all                leave as this tower could fall as well The units then proceeded to exit onto West                Street While they were doing so the NorthTower began its pancake collapse killing                some of these men                        Other FDNY Personnel                        The Marriott Hotel suffered significant damage in the collapse of the South Tower                Those in the lobby were knocked down and enveloped in the darkness of a debris                cloud Some were hurt but could walk Others were more severely injured and some                were trapped Several firefighters came across a group of about  civilians who had                been taking shelter in the restaurant and assisted them in evacuating Up above at                the time of the South Towers collapse four companies were descending the stairs                single file in a line of approximately  men Four survived                        At the time of the SouthTowers collapse two FDNY companies were either at the                eastern side of the North Tower lobby near the mall concourse or actually in the                mall concourse trying to reach the SouthTower Many of these men were thrown off                their feet by the collapse of the South Tower they then attempted to regroup in the                darkness of the debris cloud and evacuate civilians and themselves not knowing that                the South Tower had collapsed Several of these firefighters subsequently searched                the PATH station below the concourseunaware that the PAPD had cleared the area of                all civilians by                         At about  the FDNY Chief of Department and the Chief of Safety who had                returned to West Street from the parking garage confirmed that the South Tower had                collapsed The Chief of Department issued a radio order for all units to evacuate                the North Tower repeating it about five times He then directed that the FDNY                command post be moved further north on West Street and told FDNY units in the area                to proceed north on West Street toward Chambers Street At approximately  he                radioed for two ladder companies to respond to the Marriott where he was aware that                both FDNY personnel and civilians were trapped                        Many chiefs including several of those who had been in the North Tower lobby did                not learn that the South Tower had collapsed until  minutes or more after the                event According to two eyewitnesses however one senior FDNY chief who knew that                the SouthTower had collapsed strongly expressed the opinion that the NorthTower                would not collapse because unlike the South Tower it had not been hit on a                    corner                        After the South Tower collapsed some firefighters on the streets neighboring the                North Tower remained where they were or came closer to the North Tower Some of                these firefighters did not know that the South Tower had collapsed but many chose                despite that knowledge to remain in an attempt to save additional lives According                to one such firefighter a chief who was preparing to mount a searchandrescue                mission in the Marriott I would never think of myself as a leader of men if I had                headed north on West Street after the South Tower collapsed Just outside the                North Tower on West Street one firefighter was directing others exiting the                building telling them when no jumpers were coming down and it was safe to run out                A senior chief had grabbed an NYPD bullhorn and was urging firefighters exiting onto                West Street to continue running north well away from the WTC Three of the most                senior and respected members of the FDNY were involved in attempting to rescue                civilians and firefighters from the Marriott                        NYPD Response            A member of the NYPD Aviation Unit radioed that the South Tower had collapsed                immediately after it happened and further advised that all people in the WTC                complex and nearby areas should be evacuated At  NYPD aviation reported that                the top  stories of the North Tower were glowing red and that they might                collapse At  a helicopter pilot warned that he did not believe the North                Tower would last much longer                        Immediately after the South Tower collapsed many NYPD radio frequencies became                overwhelmed with transmissions relating to injured trapped or missing officers As                a result NYPD radio communications became strained on most channels Nevertheless                they remained effective enough for the two closest NYPD mobilization points to be                moved further from the WTC at                         Just like most firefighters the ESU rescue teams in the North Tower had no idea that                the South Tower had collapsed However by  the ESU officer running the command                post at Church and Vesey ordered the evacuation of all ESU units from the WTC                complex This officer who had observed the South Tower collapse reported it to ESU                units in the North Tower in his evacuation instruction                        This instruction was clearly heard by the two ESU units already in the North Tower                and the other ESU unit preparing to enter the tower The ESU team on the st floor                found the full collapse of the South Tower so unfathomable that they radioed back to                the ESU officer at the command post and asked him to repeat his communication He                reiterated his urgent message                        The ESU team on the st floor conferred with the FDNY personnel there to ensure that                they too knew that they had to evacuate then proceeded down stairwell B During                the descent they reported seeing many firefighters who were resting and did not                seem to be in the process of evacuating They further reported advising these                firefighters to evacuate but said that at times they were not acknowledged In the                opinion of one of the ESU officers some of these firefighters essentially refused                to take orders from cops At least one firefighter who was in the North Tower has                supported that assessment stating that he was not going to take an evacuation                instruction from a cop that morning However another firefighter reports that ESU                officers ran past him without advising him to evacuate                        The ESU team on the th floor began descending stairwell C after receiving the                evacuation order Once near the mezzanine levelwhere stairwell C endedthis team                spread out in chain formation stretching from several floors down to the mezzanine                itself They used their flashlights to provide a path of beacons through the                darkness and debris for civilians climbing down the stairs Eventually when no one                else appeared to be descending the ESU team exited the North Tower and ran one at a                time to  WTC dodging those who still were jumping from the upper floors of the                North Tower by acting as spotters for each other They remained in the area                conducting additional searches for civilians all but two of them died                        After surviving the SouthTowers collapse the ESU team that had been preparing to                enter the North Tower spread into chain formation and created a path for civilians                who had exited from the NorthTower mezzanine to evacuate the WTC complex by                descending the stairs on the north side of  and  WTC which led down to Vesey                Street They remained at this post until the NorthTower collapsed yet all                    survived                        The three plainclothes NYPD officers who had made it up to the th floor of the                NorthTower felt the building shake violently at  as the SouthTower collapsed                though they did not know the cause Immediately thereafter they were joined by                three firefighters from an FDNY engine company One of the firefighters apparently                heard an evacuation order on his radio but responded in a return radio                communication Were not fucking coming out However the firefighters urged the                police officers to descend because they lacked the protective gear and equipment                needed to handle the increasing smoke and heat The police officers reluctantly                began descending checking that the lower floors were clear of civilians They                proceeded down stairwell B poking their heads into every floor and briefly looking                for civilians                        Other NYPD officers helping evacuees on the mezzanine level of the North Tower were                enveloped in the debris cloud that resulted from the SouthTowers collapse They                struggled to regroup in the darkness and to evacuate both themselves and civilians                they encountered At least one of them died in the collapse of the NorthTower At                least one NYPD officer from this area managed to evacuate out toward  WTC where he                teamed up with a Port Authority police officer and acted as a spotter in advising                the civilians who were still exiting when they could safely run from  WTC to  WTC                and avoid being struck by people and debris falling from the upper floors                        At the time of the collapse of the South Tower there were numerous NYPD officers in                the concourse some of whom are believed to have died there Those who survived                struggled to evacuate themselves in darkness assisting civilians as they exited the                concourse in all directions                        Port Authority Response            The collapse of the South Tower forced the evacuation of the PAPD command post on                West and Vesey compelling PAPD officers to move north There is no evidence that                PAPD officers without WTC Command radios received an evacuation order by radio Some                of these officers in the North Tower decided to evacuate either on their own or in                consultation with other first responders they came across Some greatly slowed their                own descent in order to assist nonambulatory civilians                        After  AM            The North Tower collapsed at  AM killing all civilians alive on upper                floors an undetermined number below and scores of first responders The FDNY Chief                of Department the Port Authority Police Department Superintendent and many of                their senior staff were killed Incredibly twelve firefighters one PAPD officer                and three civilians who were descending stairwell B of the North Tower survived its                    collapse                        On September  the nation suffered the largest loss of lifeon its soil as a                result of hostile attack in its history The FDNY suffered  fatalities the                largest loss of life of any emergency response agency in history The PAPD suffered                 fatalitiesthe largest loss of life of any police force in history The NYPD                suffered  fatalitiesthe second largest loss of life of any police force in                history exceeded only by the number of PAPD officers lost the same day                        Mayor Giuliani along with the Police and Fire commissioners and the OEM director                moved quickly north and established an emergency operations command post at the                Police Academy Over the coming hours weeks and months thousands of civilians and                city state and federal employees devoted themselves around the clock to putting                New York City back on its feet                        EMERGENCY RESPONSE ATTHE PENTAGON            If it had happened on any other day the disaster at the Pentagon would be remembered                as a singular challenge and an extraordinary national story Yet the calamity at the                World Trade Center that same morning included catastrophic damage  feet above                the ground that instantly imperiled tens of thousands of people The two experiences                are not comparable Nonetheless broader lessons in integrating multiagency response                efforts are apparent when we analyze the response at the Pentagon            The emergency response at the Pentagon represented a mix of local state and federal                jurisdictions and was generally effective It overcame the inherent complications of                a response across jurisdictions because the Incident Command System a formalized                management structure for emergency response was in place in the National Capital                Region on                         Because of the nature of the eventa plane crash fire and partial building                collapsethe Arlington County Fire Department served as incident commander                Different agencies had different roles The incident required a major rescue fire                and medical response from Arlington County at the US militarys headquartersa                facility under the control of the secretary of defense Since it was a terrorist                attack the Department of Justice was the lead federal agency in charge with                authority delegated to the FBI for operational response Additionally the                terrorist attack affected the daily operations and emergency management requirements                of Arlington County and all bordering and surrounding jurisdictions                        At  the west wall of the Pentagon was hit by hijacked American Airlines Flight                 a Boeing  The crash caused immediate and catastrophic damage All  people                aboard the airliner were killed as were  people inside the Pentagon                 civilians and  military service members One hundred six people were seriously                injured and transported to area hospitals                        While no emergency response is flawless the response to the  terrorist attack on                the Pentagon was mainly a success for three reasons first the strong professional                relationships and trust established among emergency responders second the adoption                of the Incident Command System and third the pursuit of a regional approach to                response Many fire and police agencies that responded had extensive prior                experience working together on regional events and training exercises Indeed at                the time preparations were under way at many of these agencies to ensure public                safety at the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank                scheduled to be held later that month in Washington DC                        Local regional state and federal agencies immediately responded to the Pentagon                attack In addition to county fire police and sheriff s departments the response                was assisted by the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Ronald Reagan                Washington National Airport Fire Department Fort Myer Fire Department the Virginia                State Police the Virginia Department of Emergency Management the FBI FEMA a                National Medical ResponseTeam the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms and                numerous military personnel within the Military District of Washington                        Command was established at  At the same time the Arlington County Emergency                Communications Center contacted the fire departments of Fairfax County Alexandria                and the District of Columbia to request mutual aid            The incident command post provided a clear view of and access to the crash site                allowing the incident commander to assess the situation at all times                        At  the incident commander ordered an evacuation of the Pentagon impact area                because a partial collapse was imminent it occurred at  and no first responder                was injured                        At  the incident commander ordered a full evacuation of the command post                because of the warning of an approaching hijacked aircraft passed along by the FBI                This was the first of three evacuations caused by reports of incoming aircraft and                the evacuation order was well communicated and well coordinated                        Several factors facilitated the response to this incident and distinguish it from                the far more difficult task in New York There was a single incident and it was not                 feet above ground The incident site was relatively easy to secure and                contain and there were no other buildings in the immediate area There was no                collateral damage beyond the Pentagon                        Yet the Pentagon response encountered difficulties that echo those experienced in New                York As the Arlington County AfterAction Report notes there were significant                problems with both selfdispatching and communications Organizations response                units and individuals proceeding on their own initiative directly to an incident                site without the knowledge and permission of the host jurisdiction and the Incident                Commander complicate the exercise of command increase the risks faced by bonafide                responders and exacerbate the challenge of accountability With respect to                communications the report concludes Almost all aspects of communications continue                to be problematic from initial notification to tactical operations Cellular                telephones were of little value    Radio channels were initially oversaturated                   Pagers seemed to be the most reliable means of notification when available and                used but most firefighters are not issued pagers                        It is a fair inference given the differing situations in New York City and Northern                Virginia that the problems in command control and communications that occurred at                both sites will likely recur in any emergency of similar scale The task looking                forward is to enable first responders to respond in a coordinated manner with the                greatest possible awareness of the situation            ANALYSIS            Like the national defense effort described in chapter  the emergency response to                the attacks on  was necessarily improvised In New York the FDNY NYPD the                Port Authority WTC employees and the building occupants themselves did their best                to cope with the effects of an unimaginable catastropheunfolding furiously over a                mere  minutesfor which they were unprepared in terms of both training and                mindset As a result of the efforts of first responders assistance from each other                and their own good instincts and goodwill the vast majority of civilians below the                impact zone were able to evacuate the towers            The National Institute of Standards and Technology has provided a preliminary                estimation that between  and  civilians were in the WTC complex as of                 AM on September  At most  individuals died at the WTC complex who                were not  fire or police first responders  security or fire safety personnel                of the WTC or individual companies  volunteer civilians who ran to the WTC after                the planes impact to help others or  on the two planes that crashed into                theTwinTowers Out of this total number of fatalities we can account for the                workplace location of  individuals or  percent Of this number  or                 percent either worked or were supposed to attend a meeting at or above the                respective impact zones of the Twin Towers only  or  percent of those who                died worked below the impact zone While a given persons office location at the                WTC does not definitively indicate where that individual died that morning or                whether he or she could have evacuated these data strongly suggest that the                evacuation was a success for civilians below the impact zone                        Several factors influenced the evacuation on September  It was aided greatly by                changes made by the Port Authority in response to the  bombing and by the                training of both Port Authority personnel and civilians after that time Stairwells                remained lit near unaffected floors some tenants relied on procedures learned in                fire drills to help them to safety others were guided down the stairs by fire                safety officials based in the lobby Because of damage caused by the impact of the                planes the capability of the sophisticated building systems may have been impaired                Rudimentary improvements however such as the addition of glow strips to the                handrails and stairs were credited by some as the reason for their survival The                general evacuation time for the towers dropped from more than four hours in  to                under one hour on September  for most civilians who were not trapped or physically                incapable of enduring a long descent            First responders also played a significant role in the success of the evacuation                Some specific rescues are quantifiable such as an FDNY companys rescue of                civilians trapped on the d floor of the North Tower or the success of FDNY PAPD                and NYPD personnel in carrying nonambulatory civilians out of both the North and                South Towers In other instances intangibles combined to reduce what could have                been a much higher death total It is impossible to measure how many more civilians                who descended to the ground floors would have died but for the NYPD and PAPD                personnel directing themvia safe exit routes that avoided jumpers and debristo                leave the complex urgently but calmly It is impossible to measure how many more                civilians would have died but for the determination of many members of the FDNY                PAPD and NYPD to continue assisting civilians after the South Tower collapsed It                is impossible to measure the calming influence that ascending firefighters had on                descending civilians or whether but for the firefighters presence the poor behavior                of a very few civilians could have caused a dangerous and panicked mob flight But                the positive impact of the first responders on the evacuation came at a tremendous                cost of first responder lives lost                        Civilian and PrivateSector Challenges            The first first responders on  as in most catastrophes were private sector                civilians Because  percent of our nations critical infrastructure is controlled                not by government but by the private sector privatesector civilians are likely to                be the first responders in any future catastrophes For that reason we have                assessed the state of private sector and civilian preparedness in order to formulate                recommendations to address this critical need Our recommendations grow out of the                experience of the civilians at the World Trade Center on             Lack of Protocol for Rooftop Rescues                        Civilians at or above the impact zone in the North Tower had the smallest hope of                survival Once the plane struck they were prevented from descending because of                damage to or impassable conditions in the buildings three stairwells The only hope                for those on the upper floors of the North Tower would have been a swift and                extensive air rescue Several factors made this impossible Doors leading to the                roof were kept locked for security reasons and damage to software in the security                command station prevented a lock release order from taking effect Even if the doors                had not been locked structural and radiation hazards made the rooftops unsuitable                staging areas for a large number of civilians and even if conditions permitted                general helicopter evacuationswhich was not the caseonly several people could be                lifted at a time            The WTC lacked any plan for evacuation of civilians on upper floors of the WTC in the                event that all stairwells were impassable below            Lack of Comprehensive Evacuation of South Tower                        Immediately after the North Tower Impact No decision has been criticized more than                the decision of building personnel not to evacuate the South Tower immediately after                the NorthTower was hit A firm and prompt evacuation order would likely have led                many to safety Even a strictly advisory announcement would not have dissuaded                those who decided for themselves to evacuate The advice to stay in place was                understandable however when considered in its context At that moment no one                appears to have thought a second plane could hit the South Tower The evacuation of                thousands of people was seen as inherently dangerous Additionally conditions were                hazardous in some areas outside the towers                        Less understandable in our view is the instruction given to some civilians who had                reached the lobby to return to their offices They could have been held in the lobby                or perhaps directed through the underground concourse Despite the initial advice                given over its publicaddress system the South Tower was ordered to be evacuated by                the FDNY and PAPD within  minutes of the North Towers being hit If not for a                second unanticipated attack the evacuation presumably would have proceeded            Impact of Fire Safety Plan and Fire Drills on Evacuation                        Once the South Tower was hit civilians on upper floors wasted time ascending the                stairs instead of searching for a clear path down when stairwell A was at least                initially passable Although rooftop rescues had not been conclusively ruled out                civilians were not informed in fire drills that roof doors were locked that rooftop                areas were hazardous and that no helicopter evacuation plan existed In both                towers civilians who were able to reach the stairs and descend were also stymied by                the deviations in the stairways and by smoke doors This confusion delayed the                evacuation of some and may have obstructed that of others The Port Authority has                acknowledged that in the future tenants should be made aware of what conditions                they will encounter during descent Impact of  Calls on Evacuation The NYPDs                 operators and FDNY dispatch were not adequately integrated into the emergency                response In several ways the  system was not ready to cope with a major                disaster These operators and dispatchers were one of the only sources of                information for individuals at and above the impact zone of the towers The FDNY                ordered both towers fully evacuated by  but this guidance was not conveyed to                 operators and FDNY dispatchers who for the next hour often continued to advise                civilians not to selfevacuate regardless of whether they were above or below the                impact zones Nor were  operators or FDNY dispatchers advised that rooftop                rescues had been ruled out This failure may have been harmful to civilians on the                upper floors of the South Tower who called  and were not told that their only                evacuation hope was to attempt to descend not to ascend In planning for future                disasters it is important to integrate those taking  calls into the emergency                response team and to involve them in providing upto date information and assistance                to the public            Preparedness of Individual Civilians                        One clear lesson of September  is that individual civilians need to take                responsibility for maximizing the probability that they will survive should                disaster strike Clearly many building occupants in the World Trade Center did not                take preparedness seriously Individuals should know the exact location of every                stairwell in their workplace In addition they should have access at all times to                flashlights which were deemed invaluable by some civilians who managed to evacuate                the WTC on September             Challenges Experienced by First Responders            The Challenge of Incident Command                        As noted above in July  Mayor Giuliani updated a directive titled Direction                and Control of Emergencies in the City of New York The directive designated for                different types of emergencies an appropriate agency as Incident Commander it                would be responsible for the management of the Citys response to the emergency                The directive also provided that where incidents are so multifaceted that no one                agency immediately stands out as the Incident Commander OEM will assign the role of                Incident Commander to an agency as the situation demands                        To some degree the Mayors directive for incident command was followed on  It                was clear that the lead response agency was the FDNY and that the other responding                local federal bistate and state agencies acted in a supporting role There was a                tacit understanding that FDNY personnel would have primary responsibility for                evacuating civilians who were above the ground floors of the Twin Towers while NYPD                and PAPD personnel would be in charge of evacuating civilians from the WTC complex                once they reached ground level The NYPD also greatly assisted responding FDNY units                by clearing emergency lanes to the WTC                        In addition coordination occurred at high levels of command For example the Mayor                and Police Commissioner consulted with the Chief of the Department of the FDNY at                approximately  There were other instances of coordination at operational                levels and information was shared on an ad hoc basis For example an NYPD ESU team                passed the news of their evacuation order to firefighters in the North Tower                        It is also clear however that the response operations lacked the kind of integrated                communications and unified command contemplated in the directive These problems                existed both within and among individual responding agencies            Command and Control within First Responder Agencies                        For a unified incident management system to succeed each participant must have                command and control of its own units and adequate internal communications This was                not always the case at the WTC on             Understandably lacking experience in responding to events of the magnitude of the                World Trade Center attacks the FDNY as an institution proved incapable of                coordinating the numbers of units dispatched to different points within the acre                complex As a result numerous units were congregating in the undamaged Marriott                Hotel and at the overall command post on West Street by  while chiefs in charge                of the South Tower still were in desperate need of units With better understanding                of the resources already available additional units might not have been dispatched                to the South Tower at  The task of accounting for and coordinating the units                was rendered difficult if not impossible by internal communications breakdowns                resulting from the limited capabilities of radios in the highrise environment of                the WTC and from confusion over which personnel were assigned to which frequency                Furthermore when the South Tower collapsed the overall FDNY command post ceased to                operate which compromised the FDNYs ability to understand the situation an FDNY                marine units immediate radio communication to FDNY dispatch that the South Tower                had fully collapsed was not conveyed to chiefs at the scene The FDNYs inability to                coordinate and account for the different radio channels that would be used in an                emergency of this scale contributed to the early lack of units in the South Tower                whose lobby chief initially could not communicate with anyone outside that                    tower                        Though almost no one at  on September  was contemplating an imminent total                collapse of the TwinTowers many first responders and civilians were contemplating                the possibility of imminent additional terrorist attacks throughout New York City                Had any such attacks occurred the FDNYs response would have been severely                compromised by the concentration of so many of its offduty personnel particularly                its elite personnel at the WTC The PortAuthoritys response was hampered by the                lack of both standard operating procedures and radios capable of enabling multiple                commands to respond in unified fashion to an incident at the WTC Many officers                reporting from the tunnel and airport commands could not hear instructions being                issued over the WTC Command frequency In addition command and control was                complicated by senior Port Authority Police officials becoming directly involved in                frontline rescue operations            The NYPD experienced comparatively fewer internal command and control and                communications issues Because the department has a history of mobilizing thousands                of officers for major events requiring crowd control its technical radio capability                and major incident protocols were more easily adapted to an incident of the                magnitude of  In addition its mission that day lay largely outside the towers                themselves Although there were ESU teams and a few individual police officers                climbing in the towers the vast majority of NYPD personnel were staged outside                assisting with crowd control and evacuation and securing other sites in the city                The NYPD ESU division had firm command and control over its units in part because                there were so few of them in comparison to the number of FDNY companies and all                reported to the same ESU command post It is unclear however whether nonESU NYPD                officers operating on the ground floors and in a few cases on upper floors of the                WTC were as well coordinated            Significant shortcomings within the FDNYs command and control capabilities were                painfully exposed on September  To its great credit the department has made a                substantial effort in the past three years to address these While significant                problems in the command and control of the PAPD also were exposed on September                 it is less clear that the Port Authority has adopted new training exercises or major                incident protocols to address these shortcomings                        Lack of Coordination among First Responder Agencies Any attempt to establish a                unified command on  would have been further frustrated by the lack of                communication and coordination among responding agencies Certainly the FDNY was                not responsible for the management of the Citys response to the emergency as the                Mayors directive would have required The command posts were in different                locations and OEM headquarters which could have served as a focal point for                information sharing did not play an integrating role in ensuring that information                was shared among agencies on  even prior to its evacuation There was a lack of                comprehensive coordination between FDNY NYPD and PAPD personnel climbing above the                ground floors in the Twin Towers            Information that was critical to informed decisionmaking was not shared among                agencies FDNY chiefs in leadership roles that morning have told us that their                decision making capability was hampered by a lack of information from NYPD aviation                At  AM a helicopter pilot cautioned that large pieces of the South Tower                appeared to be about to fall and could pose a danger to those below Immediately                after the towers collapse a helicopter pilot radioed that news This transmission                was followed by communications at   and  that called into question                the condition of the North Tower The FDNY chiefs would have benefited greatly had                they been able to communicate with personnel in a helicopter            The consequence of the lack of realtime intelligence from NYPD aviation should not                be overstated Contrary to a widely held misperception no NYPD helicopter predicted                the fall of either tower before the South Tower collapsed and no NYPD personnel                began to evacuate the WTC complex prior to that time Furthermore the FDNY as an                institution was in possession of the knowledge that the South Tower had collapsed                as early as the NYPD as its fall had been immediately reported by an FDNY boat on a                dispatch channel Because of internal breakdowns within the department however                this information was not disseminated to FDNY personnel on the scene            The FDNY PAPD and NYPD did not coordinate their units that were searching the WTC                complex for civilians In many cases redundant searches of specific floors and                areas were conducted It is unclear whether fewer first responders in the aggregate                would have been in the Twin Towers if there had been an integrated response or what                impact if any redundant searches had on the total number of first responder                fatalities            Whether the lack of coordination between the FDNY and NYPD on September  had a                catastrophic effect has been the subject of controversy We believe that there are                too many variables for us to responsibly quantify those consequences It is clear                that the lack of coordination did not affect adversely the evacuation of civilians                It is equally clear however that the Incident Command System did not function to                integrate awareness among agencies or to facilitate interagency response                        If New York and other major cities are to be prepared for future terrorist attacks                different first responder agencies within each city must be fully coordinated just                as different branches of the US military are Coordination entails a unified                command that comprehensively deploys all dispatched police fire and other first                responder resources            In May  New York City adopted an emergency response plan that expressly                contemplates two or more agencies jointly being lead agency when responding to a                terrorist attack but does not mandate a comprehensive and unified incident command                that can deploy and monitor all first responder resources from one overall command                post In our judgment this falls short of an optimal response plan which requires                clear command and control common training and the trust that such training                creates The experience of the military suggests that integrated into such a                coordinated response should be a unified field intelligence unit which should                receive and combine information from all first respondersincluding  operators                Such a field intelligence unit could be valuable in large and complex incidents            Radio Communication Challenges The Effectiveness and Urgency of                Evacuation Instructions                        As discussed above the location of the NYPD ESU command post was crucial in making                possible an urgent evacuation order explaining the South Towers full collapse                Firefighters most certainly would have benefited from that information            A separate matter is the varied success at conveying evacuation instructions to                personnel in the North Tower after the South Towers collapse The success of NYPD                ESU instruction is attributable to a combination of  the strength of the radios                 the relatively small numbers of individuals using them and  use of the                correct channel by all            The same three factors worked against successful communication among FDNY personnel                First the radios effectiveness was drastically reduced in the highrise                environment Second tactical channel  was simply overwhelmed by the number of                units attempting to communicate on it at  Third some firefighters were on the                wrong channel or simply lacked radios altogether It is impossible to know what                difference it made that units in the North Tower were not using the repeater channel                after  While the repeater channel was at least partially operational before                the South Tower collapsed we do not know whether it continued to be operational                after  Even without the repeater channel at least  of the at most                 companies who were dispatched to and actually in the North Tower received the                evacuation instructioneither via radio or directly from other first responders                Nevertheless many of these firefighters died either because they delayed their                evacuation to assist civilians attempted to regroup their units lacked urgency or                some combination of these factors In addition many other firefighters not                dispatched to the North Tower also died in its collapse Some had their radios on                the wrong channel Others were offduty and lacked radios In view of these                considerations we conclude that the technical failure of FDNY radios while a                contributing factor was not the primary cause of the many firefighter fatalities in                the North Tower                        The FDNY has worked hard in the past several years to address its radio deficiencies                To improve radio capability in highrises the FDNY has internally developed a post                radio that is small enough for a battalion chief to carry to the upper floors and                that greatly repeats and enhances radio signal strength                        The story with respect to Port Authority police officers in the NorthTower is less                complicated most of them lacked access to the radio channel on which the Port                Authority police evacuation order was given Since September  the
