                             Yeah oh well         Yeah         Yeah OK         Do you want me to tell my story now                     Yes please                     OK         I am a native of Charlotte as was my mother and her parents before her         Mother always enjoyed telling me stories of how she spent her summer as summers as a young child         Mother was raised not far from the square in Charlotte which is a very center of Trade and Tryon Street         She had neighbors and a church close by and the trolley stopped not far from her home         She and her sister could walk to school         When summer arrived with the steamy hot weather the family would pack up and go out to the country to the river the Catawba River         This meant packing a tent with cots for sleeping pots to use over an open fire dishes because of course there were no paper product at that time food and most important of all a cane pole pole to go fishing         They would set out in an old car up Highway  to Shuffletown then down a long dirt road till they came to the creek bed         There they would set up camp near the creek for washing a spring for drinking the river was not far down the road         As I was growing up Mother would often show me the very spot that they camped         My great grandmother who was in a big wooden wheelchair paralyzed with arthritis would go on this camping trip for the whole summer also         Mother and her sister spent their days playing in the woods wading in the creek swimming on the scuppernong vines and sometimes picking berries and going fishing         When the rain came my grandfather would tell Mother not to touch the tent with her finger because then the tent would leak so of course Mother would lay on her cot looking up at the tent close to her and touch it with her finger a slow drip would come and Mother would be in trouble but not as much trouble as when she was playing on the muddy creek bank and lost her shoe the only pair she had         Thank goodness this happened shortly before their return to the city where she could got another pair         All of Mothers life she loved to go barefooted she loved to go fishing for the small perch that she would fry with grits and the rain falling at night                     Uhhuh                     When they were camping at the river my grandfather would trap beavers and there were beaver dams                     Uhhuh                     The edge of the lake of the river                     Uhhuh                     Like the Catawba River and he would trap beaver and then he would come and he would skin them                     Uhhuh                     And he would hang up their hides                     Uhhuh                     And let them dry and then he would tan them with some process                     Uhhuh                     And bring them back to Charlotte and sell them but in an a especially to the haberdasheries is that a hot oh a hat manufacturer                     Uhhuh         New                     OK         A hat maker         And uh because at that time the ladies liked to wear beaver hats                     Oh yeah I see                     And so that was a way of getting added income                     Oh so they are beavers in the Catawba River                     They were at that time                     Now they are no longer anymore                              Her grandfather trapped them all                                       So he trapped the beavers just for the hide to make hats so he could make fashionable hats for the ladies                     To sell them to for whoever would purchase them well                     Oh uhhuh         Yes I see                     A big customer was the hat makers                     They were very slippery right         The beaver hide                     No its uh well it might be slippery but its furry                     Uh but its sparkling it look very elegant um                     Probably                     The men wore hats made out of beaver too                     Did they                     Why I never see a beaver in the river                              It has a big flat tail                     Um                     And they build dams                     Um oh                     And he used some type of a

        OK thats one  minutes but I dont thats about it                     She was born in Charlotte and raised         and lived all her life in Charlotte         Her uh she lived in a city until the late s when uh her father my grandfather lost his job         And the next job that he found was with the Charlotte Water Department and uh had to move to the Water Department and that was about six miles from the center of the city and it was like the country         It was definitely the country         Most of the roads were dirt roads and uh was far away from any public transportation         So Mother had to adjust to becoming used to a being a country girl         And         one day in the summertime her good friend named Jackie had come from the city         Jackie had been a neighbor of Mothers and she had come to from the city out to the country to visit with Mother         And they were playing and they decided that they would go and pick up Jackies sister who was at Jackies house in the city         Well they had a little cart had two wheels on it         And they hooked it up to a pony and they went riding towards Charlotte in the pony cart         They got just to the edge of the city uh when something spooked the pony and the pony reared up and when he reared up the uh cart turned over                     Uhhuh                     And the pony took off running                     Oh                     Well it ended up with the pony found his way with the cart behind it back to the house out in the country                     Uhhuh                     But there was Mother and Jackie halfway between town and halfway between the country house having to walk all the way and of course they were all scuffed up and their clothes were all dirty         and they were reprimanded when they uh arrived back home                      Oh so the pony                        Because they were not supposed to do it                              Um the cart got turned over and the pony found his own way back                      Yes the pony found own way back                               While your mother and Jackie were just left in the middle of the way and have to walk all the way back                               That was on the                      That was all the transportation                              That was on the west side                     Uhhuh                     of Charlotte                     OK                     OK
