 Roanoke Times World News Legal Aid Group Celebrates 30 Years of Service Paul Dellinger Thursday November 14 2002 Southwest Virginia Legal Aid serves 17 counties with 14 lawyers and a 32 member staff but Joe Tate remembers it didn t start that way The first day I showed up at Legal Aid I interviewed myself he said He was its only lawyer at first Tate now in private practice in Marion was hired as the program s first director in 1972 after a Marion based community action program secured grant money to establish the Smyth Bland Legal Aid Society That was the start of legal aid in Southwest Virginia and Tate was among those who gathered here over the weekend to celebrate its 30 years of service It now covers localities from Lee County to Christiansburg The Smyth County bar was rather small and the Bland County bar was Sam Hardy Tate said referring to the man who for many years was the only lawyer in Bland County So the effort to bring legal services to those who could not otherwise afford them began in a small way Many viewed the early legal aid lawyers as wild eyed radicals Tate said We started with a budget that today wouldn t pay the salary of one staff person The office handled 60 cases in its first year By 1973 it had opened an office in Abingdon and in 1976 in Wytheville Most of its early cases involved divorce and family law In 1978 it changed its name to Southwest Virginia Legal Aid Society Eilene McIlvane who was not a lawyer became its executive director in 1981 By then the program had added Carroll and Grayson counties and the city of Galax and had five attorneys Larry Harley who became its executive director in 1993 and still holds that office joined it in 1975 as a paralegal and came back in 1979 as a lawyer In the 1960s Harley said legal aid lawyers were banned from practicing in some courts so the Southwest Virginia group became partners with the private bar to avoid that During the early 1980s federal funding for legal aid was reduced and by 1984 only the Marion office was still in business By the late 1980s state funding increased By 1990 the program s work mainly involved helping people with food stamps housing health care and other basic needs By 1995 it employed four lawyers We caught our stride in the 80s and 90s We still have a long way to go Harley said I like to think we will never feel that we have arrived The Legal Services Corp which is now the program s major funding source began pushing in 1995 for smaller programs to merge Between 2000 and 2001 those west of Roanoke did The board of the New River Valley Legal Aid Society voted to join the Southwest Virginia group The head of Client Centered Legal Services in the westernmost part of the state opposed the merger but the Southwest Virginia group eventually hired nine former employees of that agency and opened a new office in the coalfields Its offices are now in Castlewood Marion and Christiansburg Asked later about the program s future Harley said it is only now settling in to its expanded service area and seeking continuing partnerships with the private bar and various agencies We re entering a time of reduced funding for much of our work but we just got an increase in our domestic violence funding and we are working closely with the seven domestic violence programs within our service area he said The new funding comes through the U S Department of Justice Justice Cynthia Kinser of the Virginia Supreme Court keynote speaker for the celebration said the concept of legal aid can be traced back to wording in England s Magna Carta but the first version in this country was an 1876 program in New York to help German immigrants That organization changed its name to Legal Aid Society in 1890 It was the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 that began providing federal funding for programs to bring legal services to the poor Kinser said Legal Services has fundamentally changed how government agencies relate to the poor she said
