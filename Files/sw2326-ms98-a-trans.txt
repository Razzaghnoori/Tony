 yeah i just bought one so well that should be interesting okay you ready yeah guess so here we go what kind of car did you buy Ralph uh Mazda a Mazda how come you got a Mazda uh price basically oh price and uh what it all the things it came with for the price i couldn t beat it you couldn t couldn t find an American built car uh i didn t really look at American cars uh had a couple bad experiences with American cars huh just not holding up so uh my last car was a foreign foreign made car and it held up real well and the car before that was American and it fell apart so i ll be darned i just decided to go foreign i ve had pretty much the i ve had pretty much the opposite experience really yeah i generally drive a a large Ford super cab you know like one fifty or something and the one time i traded and got something different i got a little Datsun uh king cab it didn t last eighteen months i had had more trouble with that really hell it comes to trucks though i would probably think to go American because everybody know has got a American made truck they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart yeah i that s that s probably true i m getting ready to i think i m going to trade off the super cab and i m considering going with either one of those four door S10 Blazers a four door Explorer or four door Jeep but i can t decide which one get out there and test drive yeah that s about the only thing to do i m just i i m looking for uh fuel economy and and durability and i ve got to have some high road clearance we got some property and i need to get out in the pasture a lot but i don t need to haul a pickup as much haul around stuff in the pickup as much as i used to we got an old one there at the ranch we use now yeah but i just got to have something i can get out in the field and of course that truck is only getting like eight to ten miles a gallon maybe twelve on a good day and that just kills me right especially a dollar a gallon or more for gas i don t know how much going to how much better you re going to get with a Blazer there well those small ones uh those little bitty ones i m going to go with the small one with the two wheel drive i don t really i i haven t had a use for four wheel drive tell you the truth they say they re getting eighteen to twenty in them yeah i ve got a friend of mine s got a uh he bought a four door Jeep with the positrack rear end instead of the four wheel drive really he s getting sixteen to eighteen in town and twenty to twenty two on the road oh that s not so bad then no he s not really and he s not he said he s pretty heavy footed he s clipping along at sixty five or so around there when he can get away with it so i think i could probably stand you know twice the gas mileage it wouldn t hurt my feelings a bit i just don t know if i could stand one that small because i m fairly large and i ve always driven a truck or something right i don t know yeah i don t know i haven t been in the now ones that you know they look big on the road some of these uh they don t look too bad i just you know i i have have to get in one to find out i just don t know if i could stand you know being cooped up my wife s got uh three old cars of hers she s never sold a car she s bought she has thirty nine Chevy a fifty three and a sixty seven and anytime i drive any of those i just you know it s like being in a coffin i just feel hemmed in i ve got to have something fairly large yeah yeah but i think probably probably my whole problem is going to be trying to find something that will that will blend you know uh fuel economy and and price and uh durability durability yeah if you got to take it out in the field you know the little those smaller trucks yeah they show them jumping over those ramps but hey yeah i know that s i think it would be fun if you didn t have to pay for the repairs to it yeah but that s what they don t show you when they get you know when they get them off they show them jumping up and down hills and like that but they don t show you the repairs right you know the front ends impossible to line up on mine last time i lined my Ford front end up it cost me a hundred and ten dollars so i don t know how you getting gas mileage in your Mazda have you had it long enough to know oh about uh twenty six twenty seven in the city it s a it s a four cylinder and it s kind of a sports coupe guess a little sports car but you do most of your driving you do most of your driving in the city you do most of your driving in the city it it does pretty good huh yeah i haven t even had a chance i ve only had it for about three months i haven t had a chance to take it out on the road i ll probably be heading down your way in uh oh the end of May end of April i guess when school s out um well watch it coming down south down when you get through uh round round Georgetown and Roundrock they got a highway patrol that just patrols up and down that thing in those little fast Mustangs i ll have to keep that in mind because uh he just he just lives out there he makes his living on the road out there Roundrock and where Georgetown Georgetown or Georgetown Georgetown on down through Roundrock he just he just patrols up and down through that area now that s a neat little car those little five little five point oh Mustangs the fast ones oh uh yeah i i wanted to get a Mustang i wanted to get a convertible but the convertibles you know they tack on an extra five six grand oh yeah and it s like i can t see paying that for a for just being able to take the roof down you can get a sunroof a lot cheaper yeah it s probably more functional i don t think i had a convertible once in college and it was fun when you know during the warm months but God it was miserable during the winter i don t care what they say yeah it s like i got and plus the way crime is going around here in the city you know take a knife to it break in yeah and those convertible tops used to be three hundred dollars i don t know what they are now probably eight probably eight hundred by now yeah i m sure they re yeah and you tack on the insurance they can add to it because if you ever roll one that s pretty much it insurance yeah you know that that that that and the windshield post doesn t stop much i had a friend that rolled a convertible not too long ago it was a BMW totaled the car he walked out of it though um you don t give those they don t give those BMWs away those are expensive machines um well think we about done our five minutes all right i got a meeting to get to so okay good talking to you great see you later bye bye bye
