 Waiting for Reno to Deal With Congress in recess the White House on vacation and Iraq relatively quiet the pundits served moldy leftovers on Thanksgiving weekend Issue 1 was Janet Reno s decision whether to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Clinton s and Gore s fund raising phone calls The pundits and political guests unanimously agreed that Reno wouldn t Susan Page CNN s Late Edition expressed the consensus that such a decision will set off World War III between congressional Republicans and the White House and that Reno will surely appoint an independent counsel to investigate the alleged link between campaign contributions and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt s rejection of an Indian casino license Once authorized that independent counsel will follow the money back to the White House and investigate the phone calls anyway Page explained Offering the only new spin on the independent counsel was Sen Daniel Patrick Moynihan guesting on CNN s Capital Gang He insisted that Reno must appoint comparing the sneaky Chinese donations to the rampant spying and other efforts to influence American politics by the Soviet Union after World War II The U S government concealed the extent of the Soviet penetration injuring democracy and fueling conspiracy theories in the process Unless government comes clean about the Chinese influence peddlers the tragedy will repeat Moynihan said The pundits combined the ongoing Asian economic meltdown with the Pacific Rim economic summit to frame Issue 2 Mark Shields PBS s NewsHour With Jim Lehrer and Alan Murray Washington Week in Review marveled at the difference between Vancouver and earlier Pacific summits In the old days U S officials would arrive at the meetings and concede the 21 st century to the Asian tigers Then they d submit to public browbeatings from the tigers for running such huge trade deficits Roles were reversed at this summit Shields and Murray noted Asian countries are pandering to the United States for bailouts and Asian capital is flowing into U S markets Several pundits recited the economic arithmetic of the Asian meltdown 1 Desperate Asian economies will dump goods here benefiting U S consumers but hurting U S workers and reducing our inflation 2 U S exports won t fall because Asia isn t an important export market for U S goods 3 Japan is rich enough to bail itself out Pat Buchanan The McLaughlin Group denounced the crony capitalism of Asia and predicted that the coming International Monetary Fund bailout will run into the hundreds of billions of dollars Kate O Beirne NewsHour called the bailout welfare for undeserving corporations Al Hunt Capital Gang represented the pro IMF caucus citing the success of the Mexican bailout Iraq dropped to Issue 3 after three weeks at No 1 Suffering issue fatigue the pundits could only repeat themselves George Stephanopoulos ABC s This Week still thinks we have no alternative but to assassinate Saddam Bill Kristol This Week still thinks we have no alternative but to commit ground troops George Will This Week still thinks that the diminished U S military gives us no alternative at all In such a situation description substitutes for opinionizing Saddam blinks and so does the White House said Margaret Carlson on Fox News Sunday Repetitive Pundit Syndrome took its toll on O Beirne On NewsHour recorded Friday night O Beirne made sense when she argued for a unilateral strike against Iraq Her logic Saddam s neighbors want to appease whoever they think between the United States and Saddam is going to be the ultimate victor Therefore a show of force will rally the region to our side By the next evening on CNN s Capital Gang O Beirne had fused her two salient NewsHour points the IMF smells like corporate welfare and a unilateral strike against Iraq is warranted into a Unified Bill Clinton Theory She said the president reliably says the correct things about foreign policy and economics and then reliably blows it by deferring to the internationalists at the United Nations and the IMF O Beirne s theoretical overreach proves that pundits like truck drivers can only work a fixed number of hours before they become reckless Yuck Yuck We should back the Republican proposal to rename Washington National Airport in honor of Ronald Reagan said Bill Shecky Kristol on This Week just to annoy Democrats like Stephanopoulos every time they land in D C Surfacing The pundits plumbed the upcoming global warming treaty conference in Kyoto for its political content The American left has gone international to win a phony treaty that curbs greenhouse gases Kristol alleged because they can t accomplish their goal domestically He added the non sequitur that nerve gas is more of a threat to our children than global warming Page predicted that no breakthrough would emerge from Kyoto because Stuart Eisenstat was attending as lead U S representative instead of Gore Bob X Rowland Evans Robert Novak and Iraq bound guest the Rev Louis Farrakhan all pretended to be reasonable people on CNN s Evans Novak After Farrakhan left the set Novak congratulated himself and Farrakhan for exhibiting such good talk show manners Predicting that he would get a lot of heat for treating the minister with respect Novak said that Farrakhan was more measured and a lot less confrontational and provocative than a lot of the politicians we talk to regularly on this program Yes yes the measured and polite Farrakhan Has Novak never attended one of the minister s rallies Farrakhan is always circumspect in the first act But when the groundlings grumble for red meat in the second act Farrakhan abandons the smiling visage and the angel of peace routine and spews If Evans and Novak want to capture the real Farrakhan Pundit Central suggests that they accompany him to one of his rallies His transformation from reasonable man to demagogic bigot is as frightening as it is predictable Jack
