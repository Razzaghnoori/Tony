 Background The promise of improved outcome with the use of hematopoietic growth factors in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia AML has yet to be realized In several prospective trials patients were randomized to either a hematopoietic growth factor or a placebo after induction chemotherapy in an attempt to accelerate neutrophil recovery and improve outcome These studies consistently show accelerated neutrophil recovery without an increase in leukemic relapse in patients treated with either granulocyte colony stimulating factor G CSF or granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GM CSF 1 2 3 4 Unfortunately these studies have failed to consistently show a benefit in terms of remission and survival when administered in such an adjuvant fashion 5 6 The hematopoietic growth factors have also been studied for their therapeutic benefits when given before chemotherapy Both G CSF and GM CSF recruit quiescent leukemic blasts into cell cycle thus rendering them more susceptible to the S phase specific cytotoxicity of cytarabine 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 Several studies suggest a potential therapeutic benefit from administering hematopoietic growth factors before starting cytarabine based chemotherapy 14 15 16 17 18 19 However the results of larger randomized trials have been disappointing 20 21 22 23 Not only have remission and survival rates not been increased but the direct effect of growth factors on the untreated leukemia has led to severe toxic reactions and death 24 25 26 Chemotherapy also recruits quiescent leukemic blasts into cell cycle Burke and colleagues demonstrated in an in vitro model that following an initial cycle of chemotherapy humoral factors are generated which are capable of recruiting quiescent leukemic blasts into S phase 27 The maximal recruitment occurred about 4 to 6 days after chemotherapy was administered To apply these observations clinically patients were first treated with cytarabine and daunorubicin This initial cycle of chemotherapy was then followed by either a second course of cytarabine on day 10 or AMSA on days 8 10 This timed sequential therapy achieved a complete remission rate of 88 in de novo and 70 in secondary AML 28 Timed sequential therapy has been employed in relapsed and de novo acute leukemia and achieves complete remission rates comparable to those achieved with other salvage chemotherapeutic regimens 29 30 The combination of timed sequential chemotherapy and hematopoietic growth factors allows for an initial cytoreductive course of chemotherapy before starting growth factors The growth factor could then work with the other humoral factors generated by chemotherapy to maximize recruitment of leukemic blasts into cell cycle Few studies have tested this approach We report the results of a clinical trial assessing the potential benefit of adding G CSF to a proven timed sequential chemotherapeutic regimen Materials and Methods Patients All patients had AML defined according to the standard French American British FAB cytologic and cytochemical criteria 47 Patients were considered to have good risk cytogenetics if their karyotype revealed either t 8 21 inv 16 t 16 16 or t 15 17 A normal karyotype defined intermediate risk cytogenetics All other clonal abnormalities were considered poor risk Patients were eligible for this protocol if their leukemia was 1 refractory to previous induction chemotherapy 2 in first or subsequent relapse after initial complete remission following induction chemotherapy 3 secondary to transformation from an antecedent hematologic disorder or 4 secondary to previous exposure to cytotoxic agents All patients were over 18 years of age Only patients with a performance status of 2 or less and no organ failure less than grade 2 according to the World Health Organization WHO grading system could enter the study except if organ failure was related to the leukemia itself Patients with leukemic meningitis were excluded All patients gave signed informed consent and were treated on clinical protocols approved by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation s Institutional Review Board EMA G Regimen The EMA regimen contains etoposide mitoxantrone and cytarabine administered in a timed sequential fashion 32 We added G CSF to the EMA regimen thus EMA G EMA G consists of mitoxantrone 12 mg m 2per day intravenous IV bolus for 3 days day 1 to 3 with cytarabine 500 mg m 2per day IV continuous infusion CI for 72 hours day 1 to 3 Etoposide 200 mg m 2per day IVCI for 72 hours and cytarabine 500 mg m 2per day IVCI for 72 hours were administered on day 8 to 10 G CSF 5 mg kg per day subcutaneouly was started on day 4 and continued until the absolute neutrophil count ANC rose above 0 5 10 9 L for two consecutive days Fig 1 Only one course of EMA G induction was given Post remission therapy included chemotherapy allogeneic bone marrow transplantation BMT or peripheral stem cell transplantation PSCT at the treating physician s discretion and availability of a transplant donor All patients were cared for in semi private rooms supplied with HEPA filters on a regular oncology unit All patients received standard supportive care including blood component support for severe cytopenias as previously described 31 Acyclovir 250 mg m 2per day IV or 400 800 mg PO bid allopurinol 300 mg PO qd and fluconazole 400 mg PO qd were administered prophylactically Evaluation of Therapy Bone marrow aspirates and biopsies were obtained on day 8 of chemotherapy and then at the discretion of the treating physicians When a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy obtained on or after Day 14 contained 5 or more blast cells G CSF was stopped Complete remission CR was achieved when the following parameters were met 1 bone marrow was normocellular containing 5 blasts 15 erythroid cells and 25 normal granulocytes 2 peripheral blood had neutrophils 1 5 10 9 L hemoglobin 11 gm dl and platelets 1 10 11 L 3 no evidence of extramedullary leukemia and 4 all of the above fulfilled for at least 4 weeks Nonresponse to EMA G induction was defined as the absence of CR after one course of induction therapy Relapse was defined by the appearance of circulating blasts or bone marrow blasts 5 in a patient previously in complete remission Evaluation of Toxicity Severity of treatment related toxicity was graded according to the WHO criteria World Health Organization Handbook for Reporting Results of Cancer Treatment 1979 Statistical Analysis The method of Kaplan and Meier was used to analyze overall survival relapse free survival time to neutrophil recovery and time to platelet recovery Exact 95 confidence intervals CI based on the binomial distribution were calculated for proportions such as the complete response rate Results Patients From August 1994 to November 1996 30 patients were enrolled onto this study One patient received high dose cytarabine instead of EMA G for induction therapy after enrollment and was therefore excluded from further analysis Thus 29 patients received EMA G induction therapy and are evaluable for treatment related toxicity Only 28 patients are evaluable for induction response since 1 patient was lost to follow up shortly after receiving induction therapy no evidence of persisting leukemia by the post induction bone marrow biopsy The characteristics of the evaluable patients are listed in Table 1 Twenty eight patients had cytogenetic studies of bone marrow aspirates Most patients 61 had unfavorable karyotypes The majority of patients 69 had secondary AML transformed from either MDS n 10 CML n 5 or other myeloproliferative diseases n 4 or secondary to cytotoxic agents n 1 Overall 15 patients with secondary but untreated AML were enrolled Four patients were enrolled with AML refractory to previous induction therapy and 10 were enrolled with relapsed AML Recovery of neutrophil and platelet counts The median time from the start of chemotherapy to recovery of an absolute neutrophil count exceeding 0 5 10 9 L was 30 days range 19 to 47 days Three patients died of febrile neutropenia and sepsis during induction therapy The median duration of platelet transfusion dependence was 30 days range 22 to 48 days Efficacy of Therapy Twenty eight patients are evaluable for treatment response Thirteen patients 46 95 CI 27 66 achieved a complete remission Seven of those 13 patients with CR had secondary leukemia Twelve patients 43 failed to achieve CR following induction treatment One of the non responders had no evidence of leukemia after induction treatment and proceeded to bone marrow transplant before meeting all of the criteria for complete remission Three patients 10 died during induction treatment Of the 13 patients who achieved CR 6 patients received further consolidation chemotherapy 3 with high dose cytarabine and 3 with intermediate dose cytarabine combined with daunorubicin etoposide or interleukin 2 and 6 patients received either allogeneic BMT or allogeneic PSCT One patient relapsed before any post remission therapy was given Of the 13 patients who did not achieve CR 1 received salvage chemotherapy 2 received allogeneic BMT and 10 died due to rapid disease progression Survival The median overall survival OS for all evaluable patients is 9 months range 0 5 66 months Median relapse free survival RFS for those who achieved CR is 3 months range 0 5 63 months with 6 patients censored at allogeneic BMT or PSCT At five years of follow up 3 patients 11 were still alive Two of them were in CR one of whom had allogeneic BMT and the other had high dose cytarabine as post remission therapy The third patient is alive with recurrent leukemia Treatment related Toxicity All patients experienced fever in the setting of severe neutropenia Fifteen 15 patients had documented infections Three patients 10 died from febrile neutropenia and sepsis Other WHO grades III IV toxicity included mucositis 17 diarrhea 17 skin rash 14 nausea and vomiting 14 bleeding 3 Ten 34 patients had reversible hyperbilirubinemia and 5 17 had WHO grades III IV renal insufficiency Three 10 patients experienced severe neurological toxicity 1 with seizure 2 with severe vertigo but those complications resolved shortly after the completion of induction therapy GCSF was stopped in 1 patient due to persisting peripheral blasts When G CSF was discontinued the peripheral blasts cleared and the patient achieved a complete remission Discussion Hematopoietic growth factors clearly increase the cytotoxicity of cytarabine to leukemia cells in vitro 33 Clinically however they fail to increase remission rates when started from 24 to 48 hours before any chemotherapy 20 21 22 23 Potential explanations for the failure of growth factors to improve results when administered in this fashion may reflect either their adverse effect on a large leukemic burden or the necessary delay to the onset of chemotherapy 34 In our study we started growth factors after the initial leukemic burden was reduced and then optimized the timing of a second course of chemotherapy to take advantage of known leukemic blast cell cycle kinetics 27 Our results are comparable to those achieved with other salvage chemotherapeutic regimens that employ high dose cytarabine 35 36 37 38 39 Rather than use a standard high dose cytarabine regimen we employed the EMA chemotherapy protocol devised by Archimbaud and colleagues 40 This regimen is effective in patients with relapsed and refractory AML with a reported CR rate of 60 In addition EMA avoids the cerebellar neurotoxicity of high dose cytarabine Recognizing the potential value of hematopoietic growth factors Archimbaud and colleagues added GM CSF to the EMA regimen beginning on Day 4 of treatment Unlike the current report however GM CSF was discontinued on Day 10 of treatment Unfortunately the addition of GM CSF did not increase the CR rate when it was compared to placebo in a prospective randomized study in patients with relapsed and refractory AML 41 The results with EMA and EMA plus GM CSF are compared with our own results in Table 2 Clearly the patient population in our study was different than the population studied in the other two studies employing the EMA regimen Our population is older and a majority of our patients had secondary AML These two characteristics are among the most predictive of a poor outcome Although 15 of our patients were untreated at the time of study enrollment all 15 had secondary AML and 5 of them had CML in blast crisis unresponsive to hydroxyurea therapy The poor risk features of our patient population probably explain our relatively low CR rate compared to other EMA studies but also confirm the efficacy of our treatment protocol since remissions would only be expected in 40 50 of untreated patients with secondary AML receiving initial induction chemotherapy 42 43 44 Our study did not demonstrate a significant advantage to the addition of G CSF to the EMA regimen Potential reasons include the possibility that G CSF failed to increase the population of leukemic stem cells in S phase over that achieved with chemotherapy alone Alternatively recruitment of blasts into S phase may not increase cytotoxicity to a clinically significant degree Finally even if S phase increases cytotoxicity and G CSF is effective in increasing the proportion of blasts in S phase these effects may not be sufficient for patients with advanced leukemia In the few studies exploring the role of timed sequential chemotherapy as primary treatment for de novo untreated AML results have been more encouraging with high remission rates and prolonged survival 45 46 An initial concern with EMA G was the effect the concurrent administration of G CSF and chemotherapy might have on bone marrow recovery However the concern was unfounded since the median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery is not different than that noted with EMA Table 2 This observation suggests that G CSF may be administered concurrently with chemotherapy without an increase in toxicity to normal residual bone marrow Other studies utilizing hematopoietic growth factors administered before and concurrently with chemotherapy also demonstrate no adverse effect on bone marrow recovery 20 21 22 Conclusions The treatment of advanced high risk AML patients remains challenging The use of EMA G in the current study failed to demonstrate a better CR rate than published data of EMA alone or EMA with GM CSF EMA GM However the 46 CR rate achieved in our cohort of patients with a higher proportion of secondary AML and older median age suggests that the EMA G regimen deserves further study in a population of patients with less advanced disease Competing interests None declared Author s Contributions X YH collected and compiled the data and reviewed the manuscript with MK PE participated in the design of the study performed
