 Background Prostate cancer is one of the major diseases that pose serious health problems for aging men 1 It is generally believed that androgen has a significant role in the development and progress of this disease 2 Changes in the growth response of cancer cells to androgen ablation and anti androgen during the progress of the disease 3 4 5 6 suggest that multiple androgen related signaling events are involved in neoplasia and disease progression It has also been documented that prostate epithelial cells exhibited squamous metaplastic phenotype during vitamin A deficiency 7 and prostate cell carcinogenesis could be prevented by retinoic acid RA and its analogs in vitro 8 9 10 These findings suggest that retinoid dependent cellular events were involved in tumorigenic transformation of prostate epithelial cells Retinoic acid receptors RARs and retinoid X receptors RXRs are nuclear transcription factors that mediate the action of retinoids 11 12 We have demonstrated that in the rat castration resulted in an increase in mRNAs for RAR and in the prostate such effects were prevented by T replacement 13 We also demonstrated that the levels of mRNAs for RAR and in non tumorigenic rat epithelial cells NRP152 were down regulated whereas those in tumorigenic cells NRP154 were unaffected or up regulated following T treatment 14 In addition RAR was over expressed in tumorigenic NRP154 cells These findings suggest that tumorigenic transformation and perhaps neoplasia of prostate epithelial cells are associated with abnormal expression and androgen regulation of RARs Androgen exerts its biologic effects by binding to and activation of androgen receptor AR that trans activates target genes through androgen responsive element ARE in the promoter of target genes 15 In human breast cancer cells the effectiveness of retinoids in cell growth suppression was dictated by the presence of RAR 16 Estrogen regulation of the expression of RAR was mediated by interactions between estrogen receptor ER and estrogen responsive element ERE in the promoter of RAR gene 17 Because the DNA binding domains of steroid receptors including AR and ER are highly homologous we postulated that similar mechanisms might also mediate the effect of androgen on RAR genes in prostate cells The current experiments investigate the effects of T and its interaction with RA on cell growth and the expression of RARs in human prostate cancer cells LNCaP Furthermore we present evidence to suggest that T may affect the expression of RAR gene through direct interaction between AR and putative ARE in the promoter of RAR gene Because EGF and its receptor EGF R are involved in prostate cell growth and their expression can be modulated by androgen and RA 18 19 20 we also examined the interaction of T and RA on the expression of EGF R Materials and methods Cell culture Human prostate carcinoma cells LNCaP ATCC Rockville MD were maintained and propagated in T25 flasks in RPMI 1640 media GIBCO BRL Gaithersburg MD supplemented with 10 FCS Gemini Bio Products Calabasas CA 2 mM glutamine Fungizone 1 g ml and penicillin 200 unit ml streptomycin 200 g ml referred as complete medium in a 37 C humidified 5 CO 2 incubator 3H thymidine incorporation Sub confluent 80 90 LNCaP cells propagated in T25 flasks were washed with 5 ml of plain RPMI 1640 medium and trypsinized with 5 ml trypsin EDTA solution GIBCO BRL Gaithersburg MD The cells were then seeded onto the 12 well plates 2 5 10 4cells well in 4 ml complete media Two days later the cells were well attached and covered 40 50 of the surface area At this time the FCS in the medium was replaced by charcoal stripped FCS cFCS Gemini Bio Products and various concentrations of T and or all trans retinoic acid RA were added in triplicates Three days later the medium was removed and the cells were incubated in 1 ml plain medium containing 3H thymidine 0 5 Ci ml for an additional 4 h After washing twice with 3 ml of plain medium the cells were lysed with 0 2 ml of lysis buffer containing 0 1 M NaCl 0 01 M EDTA 0 3 M Tris HCl pH 8 0 0 2 M sucrose and 0 5 SDS DNA was extracted with phenol chloroform isoamyl alcohol 25 24 1 solution and precipitated with an equal volume of isopropanol After washing with 70 ethanol DNA was subsequently precipitated by centrifugation The specific activity of 3H thymidine was then determined and expressed as cpm g DNA Northern blot analysis of RAR mRNA To determine the effects of T on RAR mRNA expression LNCaP cells were propagated in 20 ml complete medium in T175 flasks with medium change every 4th day until the monolayers reached 90 confluence usually 8 10 days after seeding The FCS in the medium was then replaced by cFCS 48 h later various concentrations of testerone were added in the absence or presence of 100 nM RA The cells were harvested 6 h later This time was selected based on results of preliminary experiments data not shown Detailed procedures for isolation of total RNA enrichment of poly A RNA by oligo dT cellulose chromatography and electrophoresis and Northern blotting of RNA have been described previously 13 The cDNA probes of mouse RAR and RAR 21 22 were isolated by agarose electrophoresis after appropriate endonucleases digestion and were radio labeled with 32P dCTP using random priming kit Boehringer Mannheim Indianapolis IN The blots were pre hybridized in a solution containing 6 strength SSC 150 mM NaCl 15 mM Na citrate pH 7 0 0 5 SDS 50 formamide and 100 mg ml denatured sperm DNA at 42 C for 2 4 h and were hybridized overnight in the same buffer containing approximately 10 6cpm ml of radiolabeled cDNA probe The membranes were washed in 1 SSC solution containing 0 1 SDS at 68 C for 20 30 min followed by several changes in 0 2 strength SSC and 0 1 SDS at 68 C for 2 4 h The radioautographs were developed after they were exposes to Kodak Eastman Kodak Rochster NY XAR 5 film for 2 10 days using an intensifying screen The membranes were subsequently stripped and rehybridized with 32P labeled cDNA for 18S ribosomal RNA The relative abundance of different transcripts RAR 3 4 and 2 7 Kb RAR 3 4 Kb were scanned and area under the curve was estimated by densitometry The result of each sample was normalized against that of the 18S ribosomal RNA in each sample The average ratio between the mRNA and the 18 S ribosomal RNA of untreated control cells were considered 100 and the results for individual experimental samples in each blot were expressed as a percentage of this average Electrophoretic mobility shift assays

3 17 was synthesized by the New Jersey Medical School Molecular Resource Facility The oligo probes were radiolabeled using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase and 32P dATP The binding between DNA and AR was determined by gel electrophoretic mobility shift assay Purified human AR protein over expressed in the baculovirus 23 or nuclear protein extracts of LNCaP cells were incubated with 2 g polydeoxynosinic deoxycytidylic acid and 1 binding buffer 10 mM HEPES pH 7 5 1 mM mercaptoethanol 10 glycerol and 50 mM KCl on ice for 30 60 min After addition of 32P labeled probe 1 ng reaction the mixture was incubated for an additional 30 min on ice Non specific competitor 5 CGCCC GGGGT CCTCA GCG 3 or excess unlabeled specific probe were added 10 15 min before adding the radioactive probe To super shift the AR DNA complex AR protein was incubated with polyclonal AR specific antibody CW2 24 prior to the addition of the radioactive oligo probe The reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on a 6 non denaturing polyacrylamide gel acrylamide bisacrylamide 30 0 8 containing 5 glycerol at 180 V in TAE buffer 1 mM DEAE 3 3 mM sodium acetate and 6 7 mM Tris pH 7 5 The gels were dried at 60 C and DNA protein binding was visualized by radioautography The same experiments were repeated at least 3 times Measurement of EGF receptor Ligand binding assay Duplicates of membrane preparations equivalent to 0 1 mg protein were incubated with 125I EGF 50 or 100 ng Amersham Life Sciences Arlington Heights IL in 200 l reaction buffer 5 mM Tris HCl pH 7 0 125 mM sucrose 75 mM NaCl 0 5 mM Ca 2 and 0 5 BSA at 25 C for 60 min Non specific binding was obtained by adding 100 non radioactive EGF Sigma Biochemicals St Louis MO The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 ml ice cold washing buffer 5

Specific binding was obtained by subtracting non specific binding in the presence of a 100 fold excess unlabeled EGF from total binding The results were expressed as fmol mg protein Western blots analysis of EGF R The cell pellets were re suspended in 1 ml PBS lysed by boiling and stored as 0 1 ml aliquots at 70 C For Western blot analysis 15 l of samples containing 20 g protein were mixed with equal volume of 2 loading buffer 1X 125 mM TRIS HCl pH 6 8 2 SDS 5 glycerol 0 003 bromphenol blue and 1 1 mercaptoethanol and boiled for 5 min Fifteen 15 l of the samples were electrophoresed on a 7 5 SDS polyacrylamide mini gel for 1 h at 150 V The proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane Amersham Life Sciences Arlington Heights IL using a Mini Trans blot Cell Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules CA at 50 mA The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 C in TBST 10 mM Tris HCl 150 mM NaCl 0 05 Tween pH 8 0 containing 3 fat free dry milk Thereafter the membrane was incubated with a monoclonal anti human EGF R antibody Oncogene Research Products Cambridge MA diluted 1 10 in TBST at room temperature for 2 h After washing in TBST for 1 h the membrane was incubated with anti mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate 1 8 000 in TBST for 1 h at room temperature The signal was enhanced by ECL Western blot detection kit Amersham Life Sciences Arlington Heights IL and exposed to Kodak X OMAT film The identical experiments were repeated 3 times Statistics Analysis of variance ANOVA was used to detect the dose effect of T and or RA using the JMP statistical software package SAS Institute Cary NC Subsequently Dunnetts multiple range test was used to compare the means among groups Unpaired Student s t test was used to determine the effect of RA on the RAR mRNA responses to T Results 3H thymidine incorporation Treatment of LNCaP cells with 0 02 2000 nM T alone for 3 days resulted in dose dependent biphasic stimulation of 3H thymidine incorporation p 0 05 Figure 1A While effects of 0 02 nM T was abolished by 1 and 100 nM RA p 0 05 the effect of higher doses of T were suppressed by all doses of RA used p 0 05 The extent of suppression depended on the doses of both T and RA Specifically 3H thymidine uptake in cells treated with 20 2000 nM T was suppressed by the presence of 1 nM RA to an extent that was significantly lower than untreated controls p 0 05 Similarly treatment of LNCaP cells with 0 01 10 nM RA alone resulted in 50 70 stimulation of 3H thymidine uptake p 0 05 Figure 1B these effects were suppressed by concomitant presence of 0 02 200 nM T p 0 05 Such effects became less pronounced when higher doses of RA were used Combination of 100 and 1000 nM RA with 0 02 nM T resulted in lower 3H thymidine uptake than those cells treated with RA alone p 0 05 RAR and mRNA Treatment of LNCaP cells with T alone for 6 h resulted in dose dependent biphasic increases in levels of RAR and mRNA transcripts with the maximal effect of 2 20 nM P 0 05 Figure 2 When the cells were treated with T in the presence of 100 nM RA the RAR and mRNAs in LNCaP cells were suppressed in a dose dependent manner P 0 05 Figure 3 The 4 0 kb RAR mRNA was not affected by these treatments Electrophoretic mobility shift assay EMSA Incubation of AR protein with the 32P labeled oligo probe of RAR promoter resulted in a protein DNA complex after EMSA Figure 4A radioactivity of the complex was displaced by unlabeled oligo probe but not by oligo probe of unrelated sequences This complex was not present when the probe was incubated with BSA Incubation of nuclear extracts of LNCaP cells with the 32P oligo probe also resulted in a complex that migrated to the same distance as that achieved by AR 32P oligo probe complex Figure 4B The specificity of such complex was demonstrated by displacement of radioactivity with unlabeled specific oligo probe Incubation of AR protein with anti AR polyclonal antibody CW2 prior to the addition of 32P labeled oligo probe resulted in super shifting of the protein DNA complex Figure 4C Interaction of RA and T on EGF R Figure 5shows that treatment of LNCaP cells with RA 100 nM alone for 24 h resulted in 20 decrease in the binding of 125I EGF and membrane proteins P 0 05 On the other hand binding of 125I EGF was stimulated by 75 in cells treated with 20 nM T P 0 05 but this effect was attenuated by the presence of RA Western blot analysis revealed a similar pattern of change in the 170 kd EGF R protein Discussion Androgen is essential for normal prostate function but has also been implicated in the pathogenesis and neoplasia of prostate cancer 1 2 26 On the other hand retinoid is essential for normal prostate function 7 27 28 and exhibits anti proliferative and chemopreventive efficacy in experimental prostate carcinoma 8 9 10 The dose dependent stimulation of 3H thymidine incorporation in LNCaP cells by T and RA when administered alone and reciprocal suppression of such effects by each other are consistent with previous findings 29 30 31 32 These results illustrate interactions between androgen and retinoid in the control of LNCaP cell growth A correlation between dose effect of T on 3H thymidine incorporation and that on RAR and mRNA levels further suggests that RAR signaling events might be involved in such interaction Stimulation of LNCaP cell growth by RAR analog 33 and over expression of RAR in tumorigenic rat prostate epithelial cells 14 support the above notion Modulation of the expression of EGF and its receptor EGF R in prostate cells by androgen 18 19 26 and over expression of EGF R during the advanced stages of prostate cancer 34 imply that EGF EGF R signaling events might be involved in neoplasia and perhaps progression of prostate cancer An increase in EGF R in LNCaP cells after treatment with growth stimulating dose of T is consistent with this postulate Suppression of EGF R in LNCaP cells after treatment with a dose of RA that also attenuated the stimulating effect of T on EGF R further suggest that EGF R signaling might have a role in the interaction between T and RA on LNCaP cell growth In this regard RA was reported to blunt the growth response of LNCaP cells to EGF 31 These investigators also reported increases and decreases in LNCaP cells in S phase after exposure to growth stimulating and anti proliferative doses of RA respectively Treatment of LNCaP cells with an RXR agonist also caused an increase in G1 cells and a decrease in S phase cells 33 suggesting that cell cycle kinetics are involved in the effects of RA RAR signaling Binding between AR and nucleotide sequences of the promoter of the RAR gene and that such protein DNA complex was super shifted in the presence of anti AR serum suggest the presence of ARE in RAR gene This notion is supported by the presence within the oligo probe of nucleotides sequences 5 AGATCC 3 n 98 to 93 and 5 ACTGGT 3 n 85 to 80 which are identical or complementary to half of the palindromic ARE motif of prostatien C3 subunit gene 5 AGTACG 3 35 and that of PSA promoter 5 AGTGCT 3 20 respectively Binding between LNCaP cell nuclear extract and oligo probe of RAR promoter thus suggests that AR ARE interaction might mediate the effects of T on the expression of RAR in LNCaP cells A similar mechanism may also pertain for the effects of T on RAR since the DNA binding domains are highly homologous among RARs In addition sequences in other segments of the RAR promoter including 5 GGGACA 3 n 46 to 41 and 5 TCTGCT 3 n 25 to 20 were similar or complementary to that of half site of the up stream ARE GGAACAtatTGTATC and promoter ARE AGAACAgcaAGTGCT of PSA gene 20 respectively Oligo probes containing these sequences also interacted with AR protein data not shown These results further suggest possible presence of multiple AREs in the RAR gene Functional importance of multiple AREs in androgen effects has been demonstrated in PSA gene 20 Stimulation of RAR and mRNA in LNCaP cells by T differed from that in normal rat prostate and non tumorigenic rat prostate epithelial cells NRP 152 but was comparable to that in tumorigenic rat prostate epithelial cells NRP 154 13 14 In cervical carcinoma cells the RAR gene was abnormally down regulated by RA 36 In ER positive human breast cancer cells RAR mRNA was also up regulated by estrogen 16 Thus T stimulation of RAR mRNAs in LNCaP cells could be related to the pathologic state of the cells LNCaP cells contain high levels of functional AR with mutated ligand binding domain and exhibit aberrant cellular responses to androgen 5 37 38 The mutated AR when interact with the ARE of the RAR gene may trans activate the gene in an abnormal fashion resulting in increases in its mRNA In summary current results demonstrate interactions between T and RA in the expression of RAR and and EGF R as well as cell growth in LNCaP cells These results suggest that RAR and EGF R signaling events might be involved in the effects of RA and T on LNCaP cell growth Moreover EMSA demonstrated the presence of putative ARE on RAR promoter suggesting that AR protein DNA interaction might be involved in the effects of T on RAR genes While the importance of these in vitro findings for prostate cell patho physiology in vivo must be interpreted with caution current results nevertheless provide a molecular basis for the interaction between androgen and retinoid in LNCaP cells Further understanding the down stream signaling events in such interaction will provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying normal and pathologic growth of prostate cells and will facilitate the use of retinoid analogs in the prevention or treatment of such diseases as prostate cancer Competing interests None declared Authors
