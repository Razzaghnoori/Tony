 Current Federal Frequent Traveler Policy Under current federal laws and regulations the frequent traveler benefits1 received by a federal employee in conjunction with official travel are generally considered government property and the employee may not retain the benefits for personal use As a result the employee should accept the benefits on behalf of the government and turn them over to the employee s agency The agency should then integrate the benefits into its travel plans to maximize their value to the government Initially this policy was enunciated and followed in a number of prior Comptroller General decisions These decisions were based on the fundamental rule of law that a federal employee is obligated to account for any gift gratuity or benefit received from private sources incident to the performance of official duty Any such gifts gratuities or benefits tendered to the employee are viewed as having been received on behalf of the government 2 In 1994 Congress enacted a statute designed to help realize to the maximum extent practicable cost savings for official travel from frequent traveler benefits The statute directed the Administrator of GSA to issue guidelines to ensure that agencies promote encourage and facilitate the use of frequent traveler programs offered by airlines hotels and car rental vendors by federal employees who engage in official travel 3 This act specifically provides that any awards granted under such a frequent traveler program accrued through official travel shall be used only for official travel 4 GSA has incorporated these policies into the Federal Property Management Regulations5 and the Federal Travel Regulation 6 applicable to most federal civilian employees Similarly the Joint Federal Travel Regulations 7 applicable to members of 1 These include the benefits offered by airlines hotels and car rental vendors 2 See 67 Comp Gen 79 1987 quoting B 199656 July 15 1981 and 63 Comp Gen 229 1984 See also 63 Comp Gen 233 1984

24 1995 advising agencies of the provisions of P L No 103 355 6008 and reminding them of the existing provisions of the Federal Travel Regulation concerning cost saving opportunities provided by the use of frequent traveler benefits In Bulletin FTR 17 GSA also encouraged agencies to establish programs under the Government Employees Incentive Awards Act 5 U S C 4501 4507 to reward employees who take the initiative to accrue travel savings and GSA offered its program as a guide in establishing such reward programs 541 C F R 101 25 103 2 6 41 C F R part 301 53 7 Paragraph U2010B the uniformed services recognize that promotional material received by a uniformed service member traveling on official business at government expense belongs to the government and must be relinquished in accordance with service regulations 8 Legislation would be required to change the government s general policy to allow civilian employees and uniformed service members to retain for personal use frequent traveler benefits accrued on official travel Such legislation would be necessary to repeal the current requirement that such benefits be used only for official travel9 and to affirmatively authorize employees and members to retain for personal use these benefits that are now considered the property of the government Use of Frequent Flyer Miles for Official Travel Is Difficult and Appears Limited Comprehensive governmentwide data are not readily available on the extent to which federal agencies capture and use frequent flyer miles for official travel GSA officials told us that they do not collect such data However our task team did obtain information on GAO s practices as well as those of several other federal organizations This information follows GAO s Experience GAO has never had a centralized formal program to reduce its travel costs by capturing and using its employees official travel miles Several years ago we pilottested a program in one of our headquarters units but soon discontinued it for a variety of reasons These reasons which have also discouraged other headquarters units include the airlines refusal to establish separate official and personal travel accounts for employees employees reluctance to participate administrative burdens and costs and limited savings Furthermore few frequent flyer seats were available at desired travel times transfers of free tickets to other employees took time and effort and employees who flew on different airlines often took a long time to accumulate enough miles for free trips Although we never set up a GAO wide program to capture and use frequent flyer miles several of our field offices tried to establish such programs Of these the majority discontinued their efforts for the same reasons that discouraged our headquarters units Two field offices did however establish programs and continue to operate them yet their dollar savings have been very limited One office saved 6 600 over about 33 months This office has many employees with enough miles on single carriers for free trips but these miles have been difficult to use because few seats have been available when employees have needed to travel Furthermore in past years the unit s savings were reduced by the 50 fee that the contract carrier charged for reservations made less than 3 weeks in advance Accumulating sufficient 8 There are some federal organizations that are not covered by 6008 of P L 103 355 and also have their own property disposal authority One such organization we are aware of that does not prohibit its employees from retaining frequent flyer benefits for their personal use is the U S Postal Service 9 6008 of P L 103 355 frequent flyer miles for this unit s employees has become more problematic since the government contracted with a different carrier for one of the unit s most heavily traveled routes The other field office which reported saving about 32 000 over 6 years also noted that multiple changes in contract carriers have made it more difficult to accumulate and effectively use frequent flyer miles Experiences of Other Federal Organizations The other federal organizations we contacted had varied approaches to capturing and using frequent flyer benefits for official travel A representative from one the U S Postal Service which is not subject to the travel rules that apply to most federal agencies said that the Service does not prohibit its employees from making personal use of the frequent flyer miles received on official travel In 1998 the Department of the Interior considered establishing a frequent traveler program that would have been managed by a contractor However the Department rejected the contractor s proposal as too expensive and difficult to implement Interior believed that the fees the contractor would have charged were excessive and the savings were uncertain In addition under the contractor s proposal Interior would have had to provide the contractor with data on the frequent flyer miles received by its employees It would have had to obtain the data from the employees because the airlines would not provide the information to the agency An Interior Department representative told us that some of its bureaus use frequent flyer benefits to enable their employees to take training and attend conferences because their budgets do not cover non program related travel Therefore if frequent flyer miles received on program related travel were not captured and used for this type of travel the bureaus might not be able to send their employees to these types of events At the same time if employees were allowed to retain the frequent flyer benefits they might be willing to use some of their miles for such travel on a voluntary basis GSA IRS and the Department of Justice have established gain sharing programs that enable frequent travelers to share in the savings they achieve in airfares lodging costs or both Under these programs employees can obtain cash awards based on savings they can document by using free tickets from airline frequent flyer programs or by securing lodging rates below the maximum amounts allowed According to GSA officials GSA considered establishing a frequent traveler program in the early 1990s but abandoned the idea because the airlines would neither pool the miles received by GSA employees for the agency s use nor provide data to GSA on the miles its employees received In 1995 however GSA established a voluntary gainsharing program under which employees who use free tickets awarded for official travel miles or secure lodging at less than the established lodging rates can receive cash awards of up to half the amount saved for the government GSA reported that from January 1995 through September 2000 almost 823 000 was saved under the program and employees received about half that amount in cash awards These savings do not take into account the costs of administering the gain sharing program which GSA officials believe were minimal However GSA officials view the program as a limited success because the savings are low relative to GSA s overall travel costs which totaled about 190 million for the last 6 years In addition GSA officials believe that most of the savings are from the lodging portion of the program rather than from the use of frequent flyer miles IRS established a program similar to GSA s in 2000 at the request of the National Treasury Employees Union Employees can accrue savings by such means as using frequent flyer miles to obtain free airline tickets sharing hotel rooms with coworkers or staying with friends or relatives IRS travel officials did not have data on the savings achieved through their program because the program is less than a year old However they view the program as a success They said employees like the program and most of the savings are in lodging costs The Justice Department established its gain sharing program at the beginning of fiscal year 1996 Like GSA and IRS Justice shares savings its employees achieve by using frequent flyer miles and obtaining lodging at reduced costs The program is discretionary and Justice components can choose whether they want to include frequent flyer savings lodging savings or both Administrative support staff who assist travelers who achieve savings can also share in the savings awards According to Justice it saved about 70 000 in fiscal year 1996 and 202 000 in fiscal year 1997 and paid cash awards equaling about half of the savings Again these financial benefits do not factor in the gain sharing program s administrative costs Justice did not provide savings data beyond fiscal year 1997 According to a representative from DOD the Department does not have a departmentwide frequent traveler program and has no data on the extent to which its components have such programs He said that in the mid 1990s his command attempted to but could not find an effective program for capturing and using employees official frequent flyer miles anywhere in DOD He believes the use of free tickets awarded for frequent flyer miles in DOD is spotty at best He cited many of the same practical difficulties with implementing the current federal policy that we and other agencies identified including the reluctance of both the airlines and employees to provide frequent flyer data to the government and the problems with tracking and using miles for official travel He also identified another difficulty the time and expense associated with taking disciplinary action against employees who violate the current policy by making personal use of miles received on official travel He said his agency completed a demotion action against an employee for personal use of miles but assistance from the airlines was difficult to obtain Such action he maintained was not cost effective These difficulties combined with a departmental emphasis on adopting private sector practices have led DOD to prepare draft legislation that would abolish the current restriction and allow military and civilian employees governmentwide to retain for personal use frequent flyer benefits received on official travel He said that DOD has discussed its proposal with other federal agencies which have been supportive DOD is currently considering submitting its proposal to the Office of Management and Budget An SEC representative informed us that SEC began using a contractor s software 2 to 3 years ago to facilitate the use of frequent flyer mileage She said that employees participation in SEC s frequent flyer program is voluntary and that SEC s savings have been minimal in part because frequent flyer tickets do not give travelers flexibility in arranging their travel Specifically she said that it is difficult for SEC employees to obtain seating using frequent flyer tickets because many trips are scheduled canceled or changed at the last minute Finally she said that SEC is likely to discontinue its contract because the savings minus the contractor s 30 percent commission are not sufficient to offset SEC s hidden management and oversight costs and employees have not been enthusiastic about participating in the program The Private Sector s Practices According to the results of three recent surveys the private sector commonly allows its employees to retain for personal use frequent flyer miles received on business travel This practice may give the private sector including government contractors an advantage over the federal government in recruiting and retaining employees While small compared with the higher salaries companies often pay this advantage may nonetheless influence the job choices of some employees especially if they are frequent travelers In April 2001 the National Business Travel Association surveyed its members via the Internet on frequent traveler programs According to the Association 200 companies responded Of these 98 percent said they do not recover frequent traveler benefits received by employees on business travel for their companies and 95 percent said they have no plans to do so According to the Association most companies do not want to become involved in capturing these benefits because it is too difficult to track miles or points received In May 2000 the Bureau of National Affairs reported the results of a 1999 survey of about 1 800 companies on their business travel policies These companies about 450 of which responded to the survey represented a cross section of U S employers 34 percent were manufacturing companies 36 percent were nonmanufacturing e g service businesses and about 30 percent were other establishments such as health care facilities educational institutions and government agencies Seventy percent of the companies had fewer than 1 000 employees and the remainder had more According to the survey most employers with business travelers allowed their workers to keep frequent flyer miles received on business travel for their own use About two thirds of the responding companies reported specifically allowing their employees to retain the miles for their personal use about 20 percent reported having no policy at all and under 10 percent reported requiring their employees to relinquish mileage received to the company A few companies reported having gain sharing programs similar to GSA s IRS and Justice s The findings from these two surveys appear consistent with the results of an American Express survey of business travel management reported in July 1999 by Business Travel News a business travel industry publication According to the article discussing this survey the trend in the private sector was away from collecting frequent flyer awards and the number of corporations doing so was declining Specifically the survey showed that the proportion of companies managing and using frequent flyer miles received by their travelers fell from 9 percent in 1994 to 4 percent in 1996 According to the article most companies neither want the headache of tracking miles nor the disincentive that taking them away might present to employees In addition the article discussed the views of the travel services manager of a company that was using a contractor to aggressively track and use frequent flyer miles for company business Although this approach was saving the company 10 percent of its overall air travel costs the manager said he would rather receive discounts from the airlines than deal with frequent flyer miles These survey results are also consistent with the experience of one large corporation that we contacted in 1994 after learning that it had established a program to capture and use for company travel frequent flyer miles received by employees on company business The company later told us that it had discontinued the program because of its adverse effect on employee morale In April 2001 we contacted the company again and a representative told us that the company continues to allow its employees to make personal use of frequent flyer miles received on company travel Views on Frequent Flyer Issue You asked for our views on this issue as well as those of the Foreign Service Officers Association I will discuss the Association s views first In April 2001 the Director of Congressional Affairs for the Foreign Service Officers Association told us that the Association would support legislation that would allow federal employees to keep for personal use frequent flyer miles earned on official travel He said the Association recognizes that many foreign service officers frequently travel long distances and would therefore receive considerable benefits from such legislation However he noted that these officers are often assigned to hardship locations that require difficult travel He also said that if this type of legislation is not feasible the Association s members would like to be able to use their frequent flyer miles to upgrade to business class on long flights In our view the current federal policy on frequent flyer miles was well intentioned as a potential means for reducing federal travel costs and promoting economy in government We recognize that federal agencies including GAO might be able to achieve some additional savings by taking more advantage of frequent flyer miles for government travel However the practical obstacles to achieving significantly greater savings are such that few agencies have overcome them without creating incentives such as gain sharing plans that have generally reduced the government s savings by half Additionally more aggressive efforts to use frequent flyer miles to reduce the government s travel costs could according to GSA jeopardize its ability to negotiate significant savings under its contract air carrier program This negotiated travel program saves the government over 2 billion annually GSA officials responsible for the program told us they believe the savings achieved through this program far outweigh the benefits the government would gain through more aggressive efforts to capture and use frequent flyer miles for official travel We do not know how a change in the current federal policy to permit individual use would affect GSA s ability to negotiate savings in contract airfares However a change would not seem likely to have a negative impact since in contrast to the current policy it would be consistent with the airlines position that frequent flyer miles belong to the individual traveler Changing the federal policy on frequent flyer miles would have some disadvantages for the government First it would eliminate any savings that certain agencies currently achieve by implementing the policy In addition some employees who now travel on free tickets obtained with frequent flyer miles might no longer be able to travel when funds for air travel were not available or were in short supply However these disadvantages would we believe be far outweighed by the advantages of a change both to federal employees and to the government A change would eliminate the current disparity in practice between the private sector and the government and would put federal employees on a par with their private sector counterparts including federal contractor personnel in this area Like private sector employees federal employees who put up with flight delays and cancellations and travel on their own time to meet work schedules would then feel that they were being compensated in part for these frustrations and sacrifices Establishing parity between the federal government and the private sector in this area would also aid the government in recruiting and retaining top quality employees If the current policy is changed to allow federal civilian and military employees to retain their official travel miles for personal use controls over the need for travel and the selection of routes and carriers would have to be effectively implemented These controls are designed to prevent employees from selecting certain carriers to earn miles or otherwise undercutting the government s negotiated fare agreements with major carriers Today millions of frequent flyer miles earned on official travel are going unused benefiting neither the government nor its employees Changing the federal frequent flyer policy and changing it retroactively so that employees can take advantage of these unused miles would boost federal employees morale and strengthen the federal government s ability to compete with the private sector We therefore believe Congress should consider allowing federal employees to keep and make personal use of the frequent flyer miles they have already received and will receive for official travel In order to assist the Committee we have enclosed draft legislation that would accomplish this objective see enc I If you have any questions on the information we are providing or if we can be of further assistance please call me on 202 512 5500 or John H Anderson Jr Managing Director Physical Infrastructure Issues on 202 512 2834 Sincerely yours David M Walker Comptroller General Of the United States Enclosure I Draft Legislation Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States in Congress assembled SEC 1 Section 5702 of title 5 United States Code is amended 1 by redesignating subsection c as subsection d and 2 by inserting after subsection b the following new subsection c c Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection d promotional items an employee including a justice or judge receives as a consequence of using travel or transportation services procured by the United States or accepted pursuant to 31 U S C 1353 may be retained by the employee for personal use Promotional items include only those obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the government Promotional items include but are not limited to frequent flyer miles upgrades and access to carrier clubs or facilities SEC 2 Section 404 of title 37 United States Code is amended 1 by redesignating subsection j as subsection k and 2 by inserting after subsection i the following new subsection j Promotional items a member receives as a consequence of using travel or transportation services procured by the United States or accepted pursuant to 31 U S C 1353 may be retained by the member for personal use Promotional items include only those obtained under the same terms as those offered to the general public and at no additional cost to the government Promotional items include but are not limited to frequent flyer miles upgrades and access to carrier clubs or facilities SEC 3 Section 6008 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 Public Law 103 355 5 U S C 5702 note is repealed SEC 4 Sections 1 and 2 of this act shall apply to promotional items received prior to the effective date of this act Sectional Analysis Section 1 of this legislation would amend section 5702 of title 5 United States Code Per diem employees traveling on official business This amendment would authorize federal civilian employees including justices and judges who receive promotional items incident to using government procured travel or transportation services or such services accepted from non Federal sources pursuant to 31 U S C 1353 to retain such promotional items for personal use The travel or transportation services from which the promotional benefits accrue are intended to include services provided by airlines hotels and rental car vendors The Administrator of the General Services Administration would be expected to prescribe regulations under existing authority in 5 U S C 5707 to protect the government from incurring excess costs or improper selection of travel or transportation providers for the benefit of the employee Enclosure I Section 2 of this legislation would amend section 404 of title 37 United States Code Travel and Transportation Allowances This amendment would provide the same treatment for members of the uniformed services The Secretaries of the services concerned under existing authority in 37 U S C 404 would be expected to prescribe regulations similar to those prescribed by the Administrator of General Services Section 3 of the legislation would repeal section 6008 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 Pub L 103 355 108 Stat 3367 1994 5 U S C 5702 note Section 6008 requires the Administrator of the General Services Administration to issue guidelines to ensure that agencies promote encourage and facilitate the use of frequent traveler programs offered by airlines hotels and car rental vendors by Federal employees who engage in official travel for the purpose of realizing cost savings for official travel Section 6008 also provides that any awards granted under such a frequent traveler program accrued through official travel shall be used only for official travel It would be necessary to repeal section 6008 since its provisions conflict with the purposes of sections 1 and 2 of the proposed legislation Section 4 would make it clear that the legislation is applicable to any unused promotional benefits received by an employee or service member prior to the effective date of the legislation as well as to such benefits received on and after the effective date of the legislation
