 Great Performances Dear Everyone Roger s entry captured it perfectly From minute to minute in the movies this year you didn t know what was going to happen next you couldn t spot the formula because there wasn t a formula in sight Roger I d really like to explore your comparison of 1999 and 1974 That fabled year has been mythologized so much Did you feel at the time like the movies had more in common than just sharing in a sudden outburst of creativity I m asking because I wonder if this year s highlights wildly disparate as they are from the slickly commercial Toy Story 2 to the uncompromising Boys Don t Cry don t have some concerns in common the way looking back we can see that some of the great early 70s films took messed up naive hypocritical America as a theme David I agree with you about Chlo Sevigny and thank you too for singling out Reese Witherspoon playing the pathological goody goody in Election as one of the year s best performances your description of her leaps and bounds brought back images that match any this year for memorability the scene where she s alone in the hallway bouncing higher than a pogo stick her feet kicked way back behind her in unison as she leapt I know people who have tried to imitate this upon leaving the theater Also the freeze frame on her in the classroom her hand waving in the air like a tentacle her eye lid half closed her lips moving into position for that grin that wants to ingratiate but looks like a grimace It s hard to write about this performance because it s so natural that it looks tossed off and especially because Witherspoon quite deliberately doesn t put across much presence compared with an old time star or a technical wizard like Meryl Streep she seems kind of small But if you think of her as representing a whole new style a generous style a kind of post narcissism she looks pretty great She s quite real but at the same time abstract almost cartoony she s loose and free associative but attentive above all to the needs of the story Also David sorry for the slam on South Park You could be right that a packed whooping theater would have helped But you know I reserve my right to find the South Park phenomenon a little toxic I can t cut it too much slack because I don t sense half as much going on upstairs as you do I mean forget about art Can it really be that difficult to write a song called Kyle s Mom Is a Bitch I bet any number of people reading this exchange could do as well or better All best Sarah
