 Chatterbox Debates Ballot Box Chatterbox who rarely disagrees with his Slate colleague Jacob Weisberg a k a Ballot Box must dissent from Weisberg s view that Bill Bradley made Al Gore look like a jerk today on Meet the Press As Weisberg rightly points out the key moment was when Gore proposed to Bradley that they both agree to stop all television and radio advertising until the nomination is decided and instead debate twice a week for the duration of the campaign That can get a lot of the money out of the presidential campaign and accomplish one of the best reforms Gore said What about it Bradley s contemptuous response was to tell Gore Sounds to me like you re having trouble raising money and to call Gore s proposal a ploy In Weisberg s view Bradley succeeded in making Gore look like a complete ass But to Chatterbox s mind it was Bradley who looked like the ass or to be more specific the hypocrite As Weisberg has rightly pointed out Bradley s grandiose plan for campaign reform which requires a constitutional amendment and which he trumpeted this week at a joint appearance with John McCain is far less practical than McCain s campaign reform plan It is also less practical than Gore s Bradley portrays himself as a candidate who sees campaign reform as a far more urgent issue than Gore does But when Gore proposes doing something about the problem right now Bradley mocks it as a stunt Bradley can t have it both ways If the political process is as corrupted by cash as he says then he can t refuse an offer like Gore s out of hand without looking like a phony The fact that Gore s motive was to make Bradley look like a phony didn t make it any less wrong for Bradley to mock and reject Gore s offer Even if it was a bluff Bradley ought to have called it
