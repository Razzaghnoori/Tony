        were all set there um     okay   have you ever been tested for drugs   uh no i sure havent huhuh   yeah yeah ive worked in uh many jobs where it was a requirement to uh for the actual position ive worked for power plants across the country as a nuclear inspector   uhhuh   and one of their requirements for that job was basically to have a drug test   what kind of test do they do i mean just   just urine urine tests   for urine tests   yeah checking for various types of drugs   uh have you heard that they can test so far back as say six or seven months whether youve done drugs by uh taking some of your hair   um ive heard of that happening ive from everything ive experienced the only way theyve ever done it is urine tests   oh okay   yeah   but is that possible though   i would imagine it probably is   oh okay uh hm well no ive never been tested for uh drugs or anything like that   umhum how do you feel about uh testing in in the uh   work place   work place   uh i dont think its really necessary it just depends on the type job it is if its a job thats uh dealing with say uh like a pharmacy job or something like that maybe   umhum   you know a certain amount of testing should be done or in the field of a doctor or something like that but uh as far as just yeah every day job i would say no   umhum   just certain categories i would say   anything dealing with the safety of the public or   right   yeah i feel pretty strong about that too   yeah   its strange i the last job i had up in uh Plymouth New Hampshire it was for an accounts position   umhum   and uh i actually had to take a drug test prior to getting that job   really   which i thought was rather unusual since i didnt really wasnt effecting the safety of the public at all   hm that is unusual   but it i think it shows a growing trend uh in the work place to do drugs testing they dont want people who uh basically have that characteristic characteristic in there or that trait in their character   um but the thing is that do you think at some some point you know probably about everyone has has experienced drugs of some type   what excuse me i didnt hear that   do you think that its possible that uh about every individual have experienced some drugs of some type do you think   no i dont think so at all we were uh recently at a little camp out with about fifteen people and well im thirty one but lot a lot of the people that were there were in the twenty one to twenty four age group   umhum   and a good portion of them had not experienced drugs because that topic had come up they hadnt even experimented with it   oh thats   which i see as a good trend toward the future   right is it a pretty large so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right   i think in the past there has been   oh okay   i think definitely in the seventies and early eighties   uhhuh   um it almost became a a popular thing to just to experiment and try it   right   uh as far as users regular users um again it also depends on what what what areas youre looking at too   right right   i think in more in your suburban suburban areas i think you see less of it um and more in the cities uh its more likely youre more likely to encounter that   umhum yeah thats true well what what do you think the chances of of drugs ever diminishing uh because a lot of it i feel that they catch the people that handling drugs but theyre not catching the people that bring in drugs into the country   um i think its not necessarily a losing battle but i dont think its one you can win i think its   umhum   its drugs have been around since the beginning of time just about um in one form or another people looking for a way to relax   umhum   um unfortunately theyre people the drug makers the illegal drug makers are experimenting with more dangerous variations of what use to be very harmless drugs   hm   or relatively harmless and also our technical our society has become more technical so that the when you use a drug the ramifications of uh side of uh a side effect harming other people has become more uh frequent   hm thats interesting   you know the chance of getting into an automobile now a days and hurting someone being on drugs or in a plane if youre a pilot   umhum   um   well thats true   its pretty uh pretty high whereas three hundred years ago  the worse you could do was probably fall off a horse   it sure was true uh
