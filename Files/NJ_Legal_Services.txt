 New Jersey Law Journal N J Legal Services Consolidated Plan Panned in Passaic Mary P Gallagher Monday October 14 2002 The Passaic County Legal Aid Society is suing to block a proposal to reduce New Jersey s 14 legal services areas to six claiming the consolidation is a concerted effort to defund the Passaic branch The federal court suit Passaic County Legal Aid Society v Legal Services Corp 02 CV 3866 names as defendants the national Legal Services Corp which distributes federal grants to providers and Legal Services of New Jersey which distributes state money Passaic Legal Aid argues that LSC has effectively debarred it from receiving future grants without providing the notice and hearing required by law The Passaic office is refusing to join in that reconfiguration which goes into effect Jan 1 Deputy Director Maxim Thorne says the plan would threaten innovative programs that have expanded the range of services offered and won awards and broad community support LSC and LSNJ on the other hand say Passaic Legal Aid voluntarily sacrificed its chance for federal funding They say the local organization seeks special treatment by being exempted from requirements that apply to all LSC grantees in the country It was Passaic s choice not to be part of the consolidation says LSNJ President Melville D Miller Jr None of the state s other legal services programs opposes the reconfiguration adds Miller who is a named defendant in the suit Under the reconfiguration plan only Essex Newark Legal Services would continue to serve a single county The rest of the state would be divided into five regions of two to seven counties each Passaic County has been rolled into a Northeast service area that also includes Bergen and Hudson At present 10 providers serve a single county three serve two counties and one serves five The reconfiguration is part of a nationwide effort by LSC to boost cost effectiveness by reducing the number of providers through a competitive bidding process imposed by Congress under a 1996 law As a result of the process many states including Maine Connecticut Colorado and Washington now have only a single LSC grantee while Illinois and Texas have a mere three Bergen and Hudson have submitted a joint bid to serve the Bergen Hudson Passaic area Though Passaic submitted its own bid LSC deemed it nonconforming because it disregarded the reconfiguration and sought to continue serving only Passaic County Because it is now too late to submit a proper bid Passaic will not receive LSC funding in 2003 That will leave almost a 400 000 hole in its budget of over 2 million estimates Passaic Executive Director John Atlas That is bad but not fatal news If all we lost was the federal money we could easily accommodate that says Atlas He and Thorne however say the loss of federal funds is the first step in a process that will also cost them about 1 5 million in state funding which makes up the bulk of their budget Most of the state funding is IOLTA money and state appropriations funneled through LSNJ And says Atlas LSNJ seems to be in lockstep with LSC Miller would not say whether Passaic s loss of the LSC grant would be followed by a cutoff of state funding but comments we have only historically had one provider in any geographical service area The consolidation has not cost any staff jobs but will reduce the number of executive directors he adds Hostility and Antagonism LSNJ originally proposed a state plan that would leave the Passaic area separate because of its size and problems that made it an undesirable merger partner LSC s vice president for programs Randi Youells rejected that suggestion and adopted the plan merging Passaic and Bergen and Hudson In a letter last March 28 she said her decision was based on years of unresolved problems with Passaic combined with its hostility and antagonism Youells wrote It is highly unlikely that PCLAS will ever be in a position to give clients in this service area the level of service and benefits commensurate with the amount of resources available to them A February 2000 Site Visit Report on Passaic Legal Aid by LSC LSNJ and the state Office of Legal Services supports that view It found strengths like a high caliber diverse staff and an active community education program that includes a cable television show But these were offset by a poor intake system uneven supervision a failure to undertake aggressive legal work and a disturbing intransigence by management to address longstanding morale and turnover problems Four former Passaic Legal Aid lawyers who requested anonymity confirm that those problems drove them and others to leave the program Passaic Legal Aid argues that LSC used the consolidation process to deny funding based on performance without a required hearing Though Passaic Legal Aid did meet with LSC president John Erlenborn in June Thorne says the meeting was too limited in scope to satisfy due process Though LSNJ recommended keeping the Passaic service area separate Passaic Legal contends that LSNJ is acting as LSC s agent in defunding the Passaic unit Further Passaic charges that LSNJ is breaching a fiduciary duty owed to local programs by competing with them for money to fund its own programs The Passaic group also accuses Youells of retaliating against it for refusing Miller s suggestion to hire her as a consultant in 1998 an argument Miller dismisses as preposterous On the policy side Atlas and Thorne contend that the combined Hudson Bergen entity would not be able to take over the community and economic development type services Passaic Legal Aid has been providing along with the core litigation services traditionally offered by legal aid providers They boast of national recognition for their work in this area including the American Bar Association s Lawyer as Problem Solver Award in August Passaic Legal has been marshalling political and community opposition to the merger For example Rep William Pascrell Jr D NJ wrote to LSC the Passaic County Board of Chosen freeholders passed a resolution against it and local mayors the state and local bar associations and various community groups clients have written letters on behalf of Passaic Legal Aid Passaic Legal Aid also met with Assignment Judge Robert Passero to warn that it might soon be forced to pull out of many of its cases Passero says he is pleased with Passaic Legal Aid s work in the courts and is concerned because of the differing demographics of the counties Compared with Bergen Passaic has many more people who are poor and Spanish speaking and receive housing aid and they should not have to travel elsewhere for legal aid he says Miller says they will not have to as no county will lose an office on account of the merger Nor will community development help be sacrificed Hudson County was one of the first to do that kind of work though not to the extent that Passaic does says Hudson Legal Aid Director Tim Madden Madden Bergen County director Anna Navatta and others met with Passaic Legal Aid representatives in August and discussed the possibility of directing some of the LSC money to Passaic as a subgrantee for its community development work Bergen and Hudson nixed the plan last month We were willing to explore possibilities and maybe even lend assistance says Madden But the new entity does not want to have any responsibility for administering a grant What the case comes down to is LSC s discretion to reconfigure the service areas in the state says Alan Kraus who represents LSC and Youells A similar legal challenge in Virginia failed says Kraus a partner with the Newark office of Latham Watkins citing O Donnell v Eidleman No 00 1901 4th Cir 2001 Linda Harvey a partner with Newark s Greenberg Dauber Epstein Tucker who represents LSNJ and Miller calls Passaic Legal Aid a renegade that is asking the court to buck the national trend and the wishes of Congress Robert Magnanini counsel at Latham Watkins worries that a grant of injunctive relief could hold up LSC funding for Bergen and Hudson But Miller says I would be stunned if there was an injunction Legally I don t think there s any ground No federal judge will block funding for legal assistance Unless U S District Judge William Walls who is assigned to the case calls a halt to the process LSC expects to make final grant awards by early December LSC and LSNJ have both moved to dismiss the case Those motions and Passaic Legal Aid s request for relief are scheduled to be heard on October 29
