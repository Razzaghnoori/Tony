andfor how many years you were there as a career person and as a politicalappointee            You and Kathleen werefriends At around the time of her husbands death The President has claimedit was after her husband died Do you reallywant to contradict him she cameto you after she allegedly came out ofthe oval and looked however shelooked you dont recall her exact words but she claimed at the timewhatever she claimed and was very happy            You did not see her go in orsee her come out            Talk about when you becameout of touch with her and maybe why            The next you heard of herwas when a Newsweek reporter I wouldnt name him specifically showed up inyour office saying she was naming you as someone who would corroborate that shewas sexually harassed You spoke with her that evening etc and she relayedto you a sequence of events that was very dissimilar from what you rememberedhappening As a result of your conversation with her and subsequent reportsthat showed that she had tried to enlist the help of someone else in her liethat the President sexually harassed her you now do not believe that what sheclaimed happened really happened You now find it completely plausiblethat she herself smeared her lipstick untucked her blouse etc            You never saw her go intothe ovaloffice or come out of the oval office            You are not sure youve beenclear about whose side youre on Kirbyhas been saying you should look neutralbetter for credibility but you arent neutral Neutral makes you look likeyoure on the other team since you are a political appointee            Its important to youthat they think youre a team player after all you are a politicalappointee You believe that they think youre on the other side because youwouldnt meet with them            You want to meet with Bennett You are upset about the comment he made butyoull take the high road and do whats in your best interest            December th you were ina better position to attend an all day or halfday deposition but now you areinto JCOC mode Your livelihood is dependent on the success of this programTherefore you want to provide an affidavit laying out allof the facts in lieu of a deposition            You want Bennetts people tosee your affidavit before its signed            Your deposition should include enough information to satisfy their questioning            By the way remember how Isaid there was someone else that I knewabout Well she turned out to bea huge liar I found out she left the WH because she was stalking theP or something like that Well at least that gets me out of anotherscandal I know about            The first few paragraphsshould be about mewhat I do now what I did at the White House and for howmany years I was there as a career person and as a political appointee            Kathleen and I were friendsAt around the time of her husbands death she came to me after she allegedlycame out of the oval office and looked I dont

that she herself smearedher lipstick untucked her blouse etc            I never saw her go into theoval office or come out of the oval office            I have never observed the President behave inappropriately with anybody                                                     Note                         Here areseven good guesses about the authorship of the TP                           Lewinsky the Lone Gunman Panicstricken by Tripps threat that she wouldexpose Lewinskys affair with Clinton if asked about it in a depositionLewinsky mustered all her intellectual resources to cobble together the TPLewinskys former lawyer William Ginsburg never denied his clientsinvolvement in the documents preparation Strikes against this theory aLewinsky doesnt have enough knowledge of the law b Apparently she is notthe sharpest tool in the shed Tripp has said she immediately suspected the TPwas too deftly crafted to have originated with Lewinsky c Lewinsky was toopanicstricken to have acted this rationally Before Christmas for examplethe tapes record her suggesting that Tripp have a foot accident and behospitalized during the time her deposition was scheduled to take place                           Tripp the Manipulative Bitch Gunning to bring down the president afterBennett denounced her Tripp entrapped Lewinsky One scenario has her proddingthe gullible young woman to write the TP so she Tripp could get physicalevidence of obstruction of justice Another has her drafting a chunk of theTPor even the entire thingherself A senior White House official has evensuggested a draft of the TP lives on the hard drive of Tripps computer Thetheorys defects a Why would Tripp risk getting caught fabricating evidencewhen she has mountains of damning tapes and email b While the tapes exposeTripp as a horrible friend and a vicious schemer we have no evidence that sheis capable of conceiving of such a complicated machination                            TheRightWing Conspiracy An elaboration of the Tripp theory Without anyspecific evidence proponents of this theory posit that Tripp drafted the TPwith the assistance of lawyers involved in the Jones case or otherwisecommitted to conservative causes                           Behre the White House Mole When Tripp testified before Congress aboutTravelgate and Fosters death the White House helped her retain Behre Shefired him three days before the TP surfaced when he asked her to hand thetapes over to Bennett Behre has the knowledge and the motive hes loyal tothe White House to write the TP Some implicate Behres replacement JamesMoody It seems unlikely however that Moody a conservative stalwart wouldhave helped Tripp prepare talking points apparently so favorable to thepresident And while the document presents legalsounding advice its toorambling repetitive and errorridden to have been written out by a lawyerworth his salt though it might be notes based on a lawyers advice Inaddition lawyers know better than to give a witness written instructions aboutthe preparation of false testimony Note however that as one observerargues if the TP is entirely true Willey did muss her own clothes etcassisting in its preparation would not be unethical or tantamount tosubornation of perjurythough it would then be most unlikely that the TP wasprepared by Moody or a rightwing cabal                           Clinton the Dictator A lawyer by training Clinton spent much time on thephone with Lewinsky He could have dictated points during his calls and he hasa clear interest in changing Tripps testimony But in crises such as this oneClinton has historically turned to proxies for his dirty work Moreover the TPis wrong about what Clinton said in his Jones deposition about when his meetingwith Willey took place                           Lindsey the Fixer Immediately following the TPs release reportersfingered the presidents confidant as a suspect He was the administrationspoint man on the Jones case and has been known to wipe up after Clintons bimboeruptions And he had reason to believe he could change or blunt the impact ofTripps testimony In August Tripp told Newsweek she doubted Clintonsadvances to Willey constituted sexual harassment as Willeydespite her laterprotestationshad not seemed upset at the time Tripp also contacted Lindseylast summer to discuss the Willey affair Tripp and Lindsey spoke on at leasttwo more occasions according to the New York Times  However there isno evidence that Lewinsky and Lindsey knew each other or ever communicated                            ACombo of the Above While there is no credible scenario in which the peoplementioned above could have concocted the TP on their own several of thesuspects could have worked in concert For instance it is plausible Tripp andLewinsky collaborated on the TP with insight from a trained lawyer ClintonLindsey Behre As our annotation of the text shows the TP appears to be thehandiwork of multiple authors                           Back to story                           Note                         Onescenario has the president dictating points over the phone to Lewinsky withwhom he spent much time talking A lawyer by training Clinton has a clearinterest in changing Tripps testimony But the author of the TP seemsunfamiliar with Clintons actual testimony in the Paula Jones case in which hesaid Willeys visit occurred before her husbands suicide Thiscontradiction might exculpate Clinton            But it doesnot necessarily clear aide Lindsey or others close to the president After allthe presidents sealed private testimony contradicts his lawyer Bennettspublic pronouncements that the encounter with Willey took place afterher husbands suicide                           Back to story                           Note                         Accordingto Howard Kurtzs book Spin Cycle  this characterization of the OvalOffice is common only among White House staffers            And itseems possible that a White House staffer wrote a chunk of the TP Immediatelyfollowing the TPs release reporters fingered Lindsey as the leading suspectMany speculate that he wipes up after the presidents bimbo eruptions he wasalso the administrations point man on the Jones case Lindsey also had reasonto believe he could change Tripps testimony Last summer Tripp contactedLindsey to discuss the Willey affair she told Newsweek that becauseWilley didnt seem upset at the time she didnt think Willey had been sexuallyharassed Tripp and Lindsey spoke at least two more times according to theNew York Times  However there is no evidence that Lewinsky and Lindseyknew each other or ever communicated                           Back to story                           Note                         Theparenthetical phrasing is emblematic of the tight construction of the firsthalf of the TP Some theorists have pointed to it as evidence that a lawyerdraftedor at least advised on the drafting ofthe document Fabricatingevidence would of course be a highly unethical activity for a lawyer but ifas some administration advocates maintain the TP is all true assistance inits drafting would not be unethical However as noted later the TP makeslegal errors and the smooth phrasing could as easily be that of a PR personjournalist or nonpracticing lawyer Nonetheless it casts doubt on the theorythat Lewinsky was the lone author Tripp told Newsweek she suspectedimmediately that the TP was too deftly crafted to have originated withLewinsky Lewinskys former lawyer Ginsburg never denied his clientsinvolvement in the documents preparation his theory is that it was acollaborative effort                           Back to story                           Note                         Why doesntthe author want to mention Isikoff the reporter in question Only Tripp had aclear interest in not seeming unduly familiar with him For months she hadbeen meeting clandestinely with Isikoff discussing her conversations withLewinsky Tripp had hoped to remain anonymous in Isikoffs story Theres nogood reason why Lindsey should have inserted this detail            Aside fromthis sentence there is no specific hint that Tripp penned the TP to entrapLewinsky However Tripp had a motive She wanted to take down the presidentafter Bennett his lawyer denounced her One scenario has Trippwith theassistance of lawyers involved in the Jones case or otherwise committed toconservative causesprodding the gullible Lewinsky to write the TP so sheTripp would have clear evidence of attempted obstruction of justice Anotherhas Tripp drafting a chunk of the TPor even the whole thingherself Asenior administration official has suggested that a draft of the TP lives onTripps hard drive The defect with these theories Why would Tripp riskgetting caught fabricating evidence when she has mountains of damning tapes andemail                           Back to story                           Note                         Someoneelse apparently refers to Julie Steele a friend of Willeys Steele initiallytold Newsweek that Willey had confided the details of the incident withClinton to her shortly after it happened Later Steele changed her storysaying Willey had told her that the president had made a pass at her onlyweeks after the alleged incident and that she had lied at Willeys behest                           Back to story                           Note                         On itsface the suggestion seems highly unlikely that Willey who had gone inseeking a job from the president would leave the Oval Office and stop to mussherself hoping to run into someone who could later confirm a false allegationof sexual advances by Clinton However by this time Steele had changed herstory saying Willey had asked her to lie about exactly when Willey hadconfided in her and also about the details of the alleged sexual encounter Thesuggestion in the TP would be consistent with the amended Steele statementsThe TP also says Willeys blouse was untuckeda point that has been cited asevidence Willey was lying since an untucked blouse would probably have beennoticed by the other people waiting in the reception area outside the OvalOffice However Tripp is quoted in Newsweek as observing only thatWilley was disheveled Her face was red and her lipstick was off So theadded detail in the TP may have been intended to further discredit Willey                           Back to story                           Note                         At thisjuncture it seems another author takes over Note the the oval is nowreferred to as the oval office Also this sentence essentially repeats theadvice already given You did not see her go in or see her come out The TPstenor and tone shift from legalistic to colloquial                           Back to story                           Note                         The authoris obviously on the side he or she thinks Tripp would do well to be on Assubsequent sentences make clear that side is the administrationsas distinctfrom Jones                           Back to story                           Note                         When Tripptestified before Congress about Travelgate and Vince Fosters death the WhiteHouse helped her retain lawyer Kirby Behre She fired Behre three days beforeshe gave the TP to Starr when she says Behre asked her to hand the tapesover to Bennett Behre has the knowledge and the motive hes loyal to theWhite House to have written the TP            The writeris familiar with what Behre has been telling Tripp and calls him by his firstname which might suggest Tripp or perhaps Lewinsky who has been discussingTripps legal strategy with her is the author However New YorkObserver columnist Philip Weiss says presidential adviser andtroubleshooter Lindsey also commonly refers to everyone but the president by afirst name However Behre denies having talked with Lindsey                           Back to story                           Note                         This isclumsily phrased The identity of the other side is ambiguous It sounds morelike loose drafting by a PR person than it does the work of a practicinglawyer                           Back to story                           Note                         The NewYork Times and others quoting lawyers connected to the case reportLindsey had earlier advised Tripp to seek Bennetts help advice Trippeschewed                           Back to story                           Note                         Bennett wasquoted as saying that Linda Tripp is not to be believed in the Willeycontroversy                           Back to story                           Note                         The datewhen Tripp was originally scheduled to be deposed by Jones lawyers                           Back to story                           Note                         This is theacronym for the Joint Civilian Orientation Course a program Tripp ran at thePentagon Lewinsky as well as Tripp would be familiar with the acronym aswould people in the White House who knew where Tripp had been placed followingher transfer                           Back to story                           Note                         Presumablyonly someone with legal trainingthough not necessarily a practicinglawyerwould know that an affidavit could substitute for a depositionHowever this is not good lawyerly advice It is unlikely that Jones lawyerswould have accepted an affidavit in lieu of a deposition from someone who hadchanged her story                           Back to story                           Note                         The writermeans affidavit since the stated point of this exercise is to enable Trippto avoid being deposed in person This is not a mistake that a practicinglawyer would make though it could be a mistake made in dictation                           Back to story                           Note                         Theremainder of the document is cast in the first rather than the second personAnd in this paragraphthough not in the following onesthe tone becomes morechatty This might suggest that Tripp herself is writing the TP in her ownwords However if Tripp were creating a bogus document for purposes ofentrapment it would not seem in her interest to recast secondpersonparagraphs from earlier in the document in such a way that they are potentiallyconfusing                           Back to story                           Note                         Thisapparent reference to Lewinsky is the only substantive addition to the secondpart of the document It seems unlikely that Lewinsky would refer to herself asa big liar who was stalking the president However Lewinsky had recentlygiven sworn testimony in the Jones case that flatly contradicted her lengthytaped conversations with Tripp in which she had talked about her affair withClinton So it is possible that she decided it was better to label herself aliar in this context than to face perjury charges The word huge whichappears here is used by Tripp three times in the transcript of her tapedconversations with Lewinsky reported in Newsweek  This point is made bySkip Fox and Jack Gillis two academics at the University of SouthwesternLouisiana whose analysis of the TP may be found here                           Back to story

made to fill in the blanks This suggests Tripp is not attempting toconstruct a first draft in her own words following the earlierinstructions                           Back to story

document it appears in both places Both the Post andABC claim to have copies of the original TP In itself the discrepancy has noapparent significance although it has been pointed to by theorists who contendthat the TP was leaked through more than one source                           Back to story
