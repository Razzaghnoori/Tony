 See Saw on which a boy smiling at his friend stuck on the raised end of the plank hops off his glee to watch that boy drop Rage and delight a sugar bowl filled with salt We need a chump to cheer us so God rubs Job with brine playing Satan but Job is too human cannot dance in pain and make God happy What joke is this life you gave me Suffering grows a worm of delight for those who watch the pitted eyes of Oedipus make our play worm of Ben Gay squirted in your pants burn your ass Happy the ghoul in ghoul s mask handing the children apples with razors inside there s your trick or punch line obituary The farmer looped a chain from tree to tractor drove off and pulled it down on his head The woman arrested for resisting arrest Domine sing the doughty Monks of Masoch the man pinned by a tree underwater giggling as his friend gives him mouth to mouth giggling drowning Domine chant the monks Domine and smash their mouths with boards denying us our casual voodoo the pleasure to give pain that gives pleasure of pain unmerited cruel free creation in a falling world that falls but we kick it further the axe man whispers run to the convict he beheads so the body for our delight jumps up headless a sick story but undying we would empty Hell for such life whip the mad dog for its palindrome god dam just kidding just pulling your leg you hanging from the tree of Love
