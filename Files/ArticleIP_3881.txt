analysis in The Marriage Contract omits the case where there is a third party involved i e the kids If Tom and Gerri would each individually be better off with a divorce but their kid Terri would be worse off to a greater degree than the sum of the benefits to Tom and Gerri and may not be involved in the negotiations wouldn t it be safe to say that the covenant marriage is clearly superior in maximizing total well being Andrew Brecher Washington Soul Man In Plain Folk an otherwise fine review of The Anthology of American Folk Music Luc Sante states I t is just as surprising to find out that such bluesmen as Hutchinson and Richard Rabbit Brown were white This was a surprise to me because I was sure that among the very few biographical details known about Brown was the fact that he was black I ve checked several sources and had this confirmed and seen nothing to the contrary There is nothing to this effect in the liner notes I therefore wonder what the basis for Sante s statement may have been Tom Freeland The Cook the Thief Although it s hard to disagree with James Surowiecki s roasting of Wade Cook in The Book on Cook Surowiecki s assertion that the equity stock option market is simply a big casino that contribute s nothing to the smooth functioning of capital markets is both wrong and silly Equity options just like commodity and currency futures can and often do serve a hedging function Consider for example someone who owns shares of IBM at 100 and has a 20 paper profit on the stock If that investor were willing to pay extra for the security of limited downside she could buy put options with a strike price of 98 which would lock in her profit on the shares at 18 less whatever the options cost Hardly the act of a speculator in a casino Equity options themselves aren t the problem they have legitimate uses and without the ability to lock in positions that equity options offer certain folks might not be in the equity market in the first place People like Wade Cook are the problem I wish Surowiecki had made that distinction Joe Osha New York City To Di For The very insinuation that Hillary Rodham Clinton could possibly have anything to learn from Princess Diana was intriguing enough to make me click on Margaret Carlson s Hillary and Di Though I had hoped for something more interesting than spin control for women in a man s world I was impressed with the breathtakingly casual lack of fairness to the first lady that created the intriguing premise Carlson contends that Diana was more successful for her causes than Hillary has been for hers even though Diana was clearly less committed to her charity work than to her jet setting lifestyle Carlson writes that l and mines made it onto the world s agenda because Diana put them there implying that Diana was a success and that there are still 47 million people with no health insurance implying that Hillary is a failure Apparently Carlson is unfamiliar with the old saying about apples and oranges All Diana had to do to succeed in Carlson s mind was to get people talking The first lady on the other hand had to actually make an unprecedented change in American public policy before she could measure up If we use the same standard for both Hillary was a great success more people talked about health care than are talking about land mines and at best the jury is still out on Diana though I imagine land mines will go on killing people for decades to come I m afraid that Carlson has been infected with the same virus epidemic since Diana s death that makes people recast all criteria for a good and successful life in terms that only Diana can meet No matter that another woman might have done more good than Diana She doesn t stand a chance unless she too has the public relations windfall of a spectacular and tragic death That s quite a legacy for the late princess Shane Ham Washington The Searchers In Where the Sidewalk Ends David Plotz reviewed CitySearch and several other online guides to a variety of American cities He commended our arts and entertainment coverage but concluded that something is missing namely the city A more comprehensive review of the online city guides might have led Plotz to the community section of CitySearch7 San Francisco where he might have found the city he was looking for He said that the local guides ignore politics although we list and describe the work of over 300 activist organizations in the Bay Area and 200 municipal agencies The charge that our guide is limited to capsule reviews and short cheerleading columns about yuppiedom is unfair We write about and for an audience that reflects the vast sociological spectrum that is part and parcel of San Francisco life Plotz concludes that online guides perceive of cities solely as place s of consumption but at CitySearch7 San Francisco we can t just gobble up our city we have to live in it too Marc Vogl politics and activism editorCitySearch7 San Francisco Contact Regarding Stephen Harrigan s Endless Summer on plot holes in Contact please allow me to nit pick your nit picking You remark on the implausibility of Matthew McConaughey eating Cracker Jack in the Costa Rican jungle that whole sequence takes place in Arecibo Puerto Rico which when I last checked was a commonwealth of the United States One can safely assume that they import certain rare delicacies from the mainland You wonder at how after the destruction of the extremely expensive machine another one is built on Hokkaido the entire premise spelled out in the film was that two were built at the same time one as a backup Nor does John Hurt s millionaire eccentric float around on his own custom made Mir He is actually on Mir where he says the Russians are happy to rent him space Finally you express shock that the alien Jodie Foster meets speaks English The whole point is that upon her arrival they read her memories Or didn t you find it odd that an alien intelligence appeared to her in the form of her father Now why didn t you complain about something really important like how fake the computer displays were I mean everyone knows that in real life computers don t have 3 D displays and make cool noises Those pesky movies Michael Tritter New York City Stephen Harrigan replies As to the Puerto Rico vs Costa Rica issue I am gravely wrong I apologize to the readers of Slate the makers of Contact the manufacturer of Cracker Jack and the citizens of the territories and commonwealths of the United States G I Jane I feel the need to bring to your attention a major major flaw in One Woman s War Sarah Kerr s review of G I Jane Toward the end of this review Kerr makes one of the most absurd statements I have ever read It left me wondering if she is mentally competent let alone capable of intelligently reviewing a film Here s what she said after disclosing that she recently saw Demi Moore on a talk show looking more feminine like an innocent wistful pixie than her on screen character in G I Jane She did not seem to be a person likely to say suck my dick It s tempting to conclude from this that she s empty at the core trying on different personas to hide her lack of a self Hello Ms Kerr are you familiar with the term acting That s what Demi Moore does for a living and that s what she was doing in G I Jane Why should it be a surprise that an actor appears different in real life from an on screen persona Do you expect Sigourney Weaver to tote around an Uzi in real life looking for aliens to shoot If you saw Patrick Stewart on a talk show and he wasn t wearing his Star Trek uniform would you assume that he was empty at the core Someone with such a clear lack of understanding of the distinction between acting and being should perhaps not be writing movie reviews James Flood Baltimore Address your e mail to the editors to letters slate com Please include your address and daytime phone number for confirmation only
