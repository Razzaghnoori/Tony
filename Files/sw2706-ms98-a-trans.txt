        Texas how you doing   all right   good good good have you been participating in this uh program very much   oh uh ever since they really got started   oh okay   uh maybe a phone call a week or something like that   yeah yeah i try to get one a day and im leaving the country here in next week and i wanna get every i want to get as many as i can       uh okay Bill you about ready to get started   i guess so     uh Bill what kind of a company you with   im with a  electronics company   oh okay   uh ive been an engineer all my life and uh thats one of the the issues that i have with the company that uh you know salary is is one benefit but uh i feel as an engineer that uh you know i take pride in my work and uh getting credit for that and recognition for the work that you do and uh having challenging work uh doing challenging assignments is one of the one of the payments that you get for your time      right uh do do you think the benefits package is fair   i think our benefits package is pretty fair at the company   umhum   but uh you know its uh sometimes quite a struggle to uh to do work thats challenging and find challenging assignments   yeah   i feel that one of the things that happens in this country is that uh you know engineers become what i call clerical engineers they spend their time pushing paper and doing mundane tasks that could be assigned to uh to other people   yeah you sound like you sound like my own situation uh how how old are you Bill   im uh fifty four   oh hey im fifty seven sounds like same situation here uh im with TI of course and our our benefits it its interesting uh because thats one of the biggest gripes in the company is the benefits whether it be the health insurance or or the food or  or other things   umhum   uh however recently ive had a chance to sample the outside and uh probably by industry standards were probably in the top seventy percent   umhum yeah   uh the uh uh ive ive really in fact what im doing is im uh retiring effective Tuesday and going with another company   umhum   uh primarily for some of the things that you stated uh ive spent uh eight of my last ten years in offshore sites in Asia   yeah   and ive just had a real ball and uh since ive been back part of my job is is trouble shooting into the offshore site plants which is okay but the other part  the other parts pushing paper   umhum   and uh uh which i dont like i got the opportunity to go with another company in fact uh a uh a semiconductor uh uh assembly house that supplies us uh where the uh where the job will be a hundred percent going into their various plants trouble shooting   umhum   and and im going to do that beginning the first of May but uh uh interestingly interestingly interestingly enough though uh the the biggest grind ive been with ive been with TI thirty two years uh the biggest gripe in TI is the benefits package but as i go looking at other companies as ive ive had a chance to do uh its really not all that bad uh the one of the biggest gripes of the benefit package is the insurance program and i guess theyve all fallen victim to the high rising costs of medical care   umhum yes i think so   and and i i think thats the type of thing that uh uh that it that it amounts to uh what kind of vacation policy how long have you been with your company Bill   ive been there thirty two years   thirty two ha ha sounds familiar  what kind of vacation uh uh restrictions do you have or or shouldnt say restrictions policy   yeah well after being there for this long i get uh four weeks a year and i have an option to uh trade salary for an extra week   oh neat neat neat uh when when did you get into the uh uh when did you go through the break where you started getting four weeks   uh let me see how does it work uh after you get two weeks up until five years and then you get an additional day uh each year thereafter up until ten years   umhum   and then thereafter every other year you get an additional day so by the time youve been there twenty years you get the four weeks   umhum you get a full four weeks yeah yeah we get two weeks after a year uh uh three three three weeks between five and fifteen and four weeks over fifteen   hum okay   and uh uh are you allowed to how many days are you allowed to accrue   none no carryover whatsoever   oh so you have to flush it out at the end of every year or or you lose it   right   okay well weve got were allowed to accrue a fair bunch im not exactly sure uh on a year to year basis what it is because i accrued most of mine before they put in the restrictions uh and then they they grandfathered our old days   umhum right   uh but what it what it uh the bottom line is that when you die retire or quit the most you can get paid for is seventy days   umhum   which is fourteen weeks which is which is a pretty nice little bonus so i think with with retiring here in the next three days   yeah   uh i have eighty five days vacation and and it would have been nice to been able to use up fifteen of them in April but i had so many things i had to do before i finished i didnt get to do that so im in essence going to be giving those back to the company or most of them back   um   but at least i get paid for seventy days which in your situation you dont i mean when you go out you probably get just the ones you have in that current year right   thats right   uhhuh uhhuh thats interesting interesting   now were allowed to accrue sick leave but uh   oh okay well see we we dont have any any such thing as sick leave uh if youre exempt and youve been here over three years or four years or something like that you can be sick up to six months and still get paid and and and uh uh that uh do you have a uh long and short term disability program   hum okay yes we do   yeah and we get half half pay uh or full pay for six months and half pay for the remainder of the disability i guess how it works   hum   and uh uh thats interesting how how many vacation days do yall get   you mean uh mean holidays   yeah i meant holidays yeah   uh i dont know the exact count uh they took away some of the minor holidays a few years back and we get Christmas week off   oh okay okay so it probably all adds up to the same   so yeah we traded in Veterans Day and uh and i guess Good Friday or something like that uh in favor of having a week off at Christmas i im not too enthusiastic about taking a vacation at Christmas time because   yeah it yeah yeah no i guess thats true i i guess see most of us and like yourself where youve got four weeks you can take plenty throughout the year and still have a week even if it werent a company holiday youd still have some time left over at Christmas   yeah   and uh i i guess what happens is we dont have Christmas week we have Christmas plus a day around Christmas a day before or a day after as official holidays   umhum   but theres so many people that are so senior and have so much time off so much vacation time coming that you will find virtually no one in the plant   well i think thats the reason our plant went that way what we we have uh a lot of government contract work and we find that in that last uh couple of week of the year all the government people are use it or lose it situation   yeah probably yeah yeah so theyre all gone   yeah so all our customers are nonexistent   yeah yeah thats thats what happened to us i think the last the last holiday we got was in the middle uh seventies and uh uh and that one was the uh Friday after Thanksgiving and i think the reason we got it for a holiday was nobody worked it anyway   yeah   it just kept us from taking a days vacation   umhum   uh we get we get uh New Years Day Good Friday Memorial Day July Fourth Labor Day uh Thanksgiving and the day after and then Christmas and a day either side of it   oh okay   which which comes out to about nine and uh and and just since ive been here i mean when i got here we didnt even get Memorial Day   yeah huh thats strange   and it it wasnt recognized here in the deep South and we got uh uh and Good Friday came along i think uh in about nineteen seventy we got a chance to vote on it and we had to vote on on that versus the Friday after Thanksgiving because we didnt get that day then   huh   and i always felt that it wasnt a religious motive that gave us Good Friday the the the employees voted for Good Friday it was just that New Years Day to Memorial Day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring   yeah were sort of in that situation we do get uh uh George Washingtons birthday but its still a long dry stretch from then until uh Memorial Day   oh okay so you yeah are are you fairly satisfied with your health insurance   uh im kind of cross with it this year we changed uh uh managers for the plan we had been with Blue Cross and Blue Shield and uh we got to know them pretty well and how to work with the system   yeah   but theyve gone to a managed care program and we had to even even though we were right in the middle of the area we had to opt out because there are no physicians in the area that are taking patients   oh my goodness   and its absolutely pathetic up here uh so far the insurance company owes us about two thousand dollars and the checks are not coming in   my goodness thats tough uh we had uh weve been with Aetna actually i think we find fund our own insurance program Aetna just administers paying the bills   yeah thats the way our company works   yeah and and and the uh uh they started out with having Managed Mental Health Care   uhhuh   and then they went to Managed Hospital Network where you had to go to a network hospital and we just got a notice the other day saying that uh that were going to have uh uh network doctors   yeah   and and theyre going to the way theyre going to work into this is theyre going to look at the doctors that have been providing care for people and uh write to them all and tell them that theyve got an opportunity  to be part of this program and they and   yeah our in our area they all turned it down they say forget it uh if this patient wants to wants to go somewhere else let him go there   no kidding
