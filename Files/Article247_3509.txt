 Do Vacations Kill Two people died this week riding Shockwave stand up roller coasters at King s Dominion parks one in Hanover County Va and one in Santa Clara Calif To read the Washington Post s account click here There is the usual back and forth about whether the injuries were the fault of the riders or the amusement parks But Chatterbox is more interested in the broader question Is leisure time more dangerous than work The answer of course varies depending on what type of work you happen to do In my world anyway people sitting in offices are obviously not at risk very much observes Jeffrey Hadley a research associate at the Center for Injury Research and Policy at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health A coal miner on the other hand subjects himself to a lot of risk on the job The type of leisure you tend to prefer is also a factor Some people go on vacation and lie on the beach notes Hadley and some people do things that are more exciting like skiing and rock climbing Presumably the folks who seek physical thrills in their leisure activity tend not to get them on the job and people who get them on the job don t seek them out while on vacation But probably there are a few coal miners out there who go hang gliding in August There s no question that vacations can cause harm According to The Injury Fact Book sports and recreation account for the majority of drownings many firearm fatalities about 10 percent of all brain injuries 7 percent of spinal cord injuries and 13 percent of facial injuries treated in hospitals Overall more than 6 000 deaths each year are associated with sports and recreation not including the many thousands that occur in connection with recreational use of motor vehicles in traffic the book says three quarters of the sports and recreation deaths result from water recreation The most dangerous water sports in declining order are swimming boating and scuba diving But are vacations more dangerous in the aggregate than normal life Chatterbox alas couldn t pose this question to the book s principal author Susan P Baker of the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health because she s on vacation But her book includes a chart that sheds a little light on the subject by comparing the percentage of unintentional injury deaths in various categories drowning falling object etc in homes public buildings such as offices industrial settings and places where people engage in recreational activities Thus 14 6 percent of drownings occur during recreation compared with 12 8 percent at a home or resident institution and 4 2 percent in a public building on a farm or in an industrial setting or a mine A hauntingly large 68 4 percent of drownings however are attributable to other or unspecified causes On the other hand if you re going to die by falling it s much more likely to happen to you while you re at home 51 5 percent of deaths as a result of falling happen in a home or residential institution compared with only 0 8 percent during recreation and 5 9 percent in a public building on a farm or in an industrial setting or a mine Presumably those who die from falls at home are mostly old people for people under 65 falls are responsible for more recreational deaths than any other recreational activity except swimming Falling objects are most likely to get you at work 33 4 percent in a public building on a farm or in an industrial setting or a mine of which fully 20 1 percent is attributable to an industrial setting or a mine But home is pretty dangerous too 25 8 percent in a home or resident institution Vacations are pretty safe in this regard only 1 1 percent of falling object related deaths occur during recreation However lightning is more likely to kill you while you re engaged in recreation 14 3 percent with the workplace a close second 14 percent in a public building on a farm or in an industrial setting or a mine farms are the biggest risk here responsible for 8 6 percent and home placing third 12 4 percent at a home or resident institution Collision with an object or person apparently not one that s falling on you is the third biggest vacation killer after drowning and lightning 11 2 percent of these deaths occur during recreation though most such deaths occur at work 27 6 percent in a public building on a farm or in an industrial setting or a mine industrial settings and mines are the biggest risk here responsible for 17 9 percent and at home 23 9 percent in a home or resident institution It s important to remember of course that not engaging in certain kinds of leisure activity read exercise will also kill you heart disease remains the No 1 cause of death in the United States So the question Are vacations more dangerous than work which on reflection should really be Are vacations more dangerous than work or hanging around the house is a complex one Chatterbox will continue to collect data on this subject in hopes of reaching a definitive conclusion next week Correction Aug 29 Chatterbox misidentified both the amusement park and the ride where the Santa Clara Calif death occurred The park was Great America and the ride was Drop Zone which apparently isn t a roller coaster Great America and King s Dominion share a common parent company Paramount Parks But Chatterbox s general alarmism about amusement park dangers was if anything understated according to NBC News emergency room visits attributable to amusement park rides have increased by 24 percent during the last five years
