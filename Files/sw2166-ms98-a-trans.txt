 so what kind of eating out do you like oh preferably Mexican food or seafood yeah i i like seafood or Chinese or especially Mongolian we ve got a real nice little Mongolian restaurant here yeah i go out there probably once a week it s not bad you know oh really hum wow you have to find out the right things to get so you get the most for your money but the the two meat the two plates of meat and one plate of vegetables is a pretty good deal yeah yeah oh yeah we uh we haven t found a whole you know the are the best Mexican food we ve found is back in Houston naturally and uh same goes for the seafood of course to there s not much smack right here out in the middle of nowhere yeah no but uh you know i think our luxury here is Red Lobster and uh but back home there s you know different places family owned seafood restaurants oh yeah do you do yeah do you have a Steak do you have a Steak and Ale there uh not close about an hour away in Waco there s the closest one um i haven t been to Steak and Ale for a long time but my favorite used to be their steak and uh Alaskan king crab oh that was good yeah uh it s been a while since i ve been there i was always jumped on the steak whenever i went there yeah instead of the seafood yeah they they had they had really nice Alaskan king crab of course it was expensive though dinner for two was about fifty bucks yeah yeah uh huh and now that i m full time poor student uh i got to watch the pennies consequently that s why you go out to Mongolian all the time yeah oh so no i i pretty you know Mexican food or or seafood pretty much i could probably live on that yeah i haven t found a good Mexican restaurant around here anywhere i i m at i usually do all my own Mexican food i my i m partial to burritos and tacos and i and i do them better than anywhere i ve had out so oh there you go and i can do them cheaper and i can do them my way yeah yeah right right well what do you like about your your Chinese food place there that makes you keep going back and places place uh basically the food and the price i it s sort it s set up on a sort of a buffet sort of thing you go up and pick your own vegetables and all that fill up your own plate and then you drop it off at the uh grill uh huh and then go sit down and they they fry it out and season it the way you want it seasoned and then they bring it out to you and the price is really reasonable the the drawback is that oh all the uh all the staff are uh are uh either Koreans or uh or Thais and they can t speak English very well so it gets a little bit difficult trying to explain uh some things to them but if you can get past that it s okay the food is really good oh yeah i don t know i to me that s the thing that you got to have if the food is bad you re obviously not going to go back but if the food is good and the price is decent and the service is lousy i have a tough time going back again right course a yeah yeah i mean it s it s not worth the hassle just for the good food there s plenty of places that have good food yeah uh right yeah um there s there s a couple places around here that we ll go back to now and again um one being a a Chinese food place and and another one being another Mexican food place and and it it just seems that if the if the help is is good and they re like they re supposed to be that you know you re you re tempted to give the food a second try but not the people for some reason uh huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody s rude to me or excuse me somebody s rude or something like that i won t go back i don t care how good the food was yeah but generally i i the places i ve been where i ve had trouble with the help generally the food hasn t been that good anyway which is sort of indicative of the whole problem yeah yeah uh well gosh now what i guess it s been about five minutes now what let s see how long do you eat do you go out once a week i try to go out once a week sometimes more than that i about every other weekend i go down to Charlotte and uh see my my ex college buddy down there and uh we go out running around down there and there s some pretty good places down there to eat yeah but we ve got a uh family there s a family restaurant here i don t know if they re over in Texas yet i know they re in Louisiana it s called Ryan s um it s a it s a good restaurant they uh they have like a big food bar and you can order from the menu or hum uh just take the food bar and the food bar usually has all kinds of entree items or salads and all that and they ve just got tons of stuff and it s really cheap one person for about it s about six bucks and it s all you can eat uh huh wow and the food is good and of course you your service is pretty good because it s serve yourself can t complain too much they they they have people come around and uh yeah right so you can t complain about that really deliver your your meal from the kitchen if you ordered a steak or something and fill up your iced tea but other than that they don t they don t bother you so it s a pretty good place i bet you don t have those over there i don t think so i haven t heard of it we have uh there s two of them in Charlotte and we ve been to both of them and they re both terrible it was it was i was amazed because i ve been in a lot of Ryan s in Alabama and Georgia oh no and this is my first time in one in North Carolina and they were terrible oh and we got one in Raleigh here and i thought it was pretty bad until i had gone to those ones in Charlotte yeah we we figured this is probably the best one but uh it s it s a pretty neat chain because they they don t take out loans for anything they made you reconsider hm oh when they build a building they pay for it right then so that when they open the door they re making money immediately it s it s a smart operation hum right well that s a good way to go about it yeah there s there s kind of a a little place set up like that i know that they ve got one in Austin and San Antonio and one in uh Houston it s called You Are Cook and that s exactly what you are and it a it turned out it s a cattle rancher who owns the restaurant and has his own cattle so it s an ongoing circle uh huh you know and you uh you get your all your salad and everything for your salad is at one part of the restaurant and then everything for a baked potato and everything you can imagine to put on it is another section and then right smack in the middle is these three huge grills that they have set up for the p eople to use and you go in and you pick out your own selection of meat that you want to to cook you know filet or T bone or whatever it is and they re just huge then there you know there the meat is just massive just massive i think the smallest the smallest they have is um hum yeah um uh i think a nine ounce filet i mean just we re taking taking doggy bags home every time we go and it s it s it s like twelve dollars a person but you are you re getting three or four meals out of it by the time you take it home i would yeah exactly and and you and you cook it yourself yeah you take it up to the grill and you flip it or or they ll cook it they ll charge you an extra dollar to cook it for you gosh that s half the fun cooking it yourself yeah it s really a lot of fun because they get up there and well that s that s an interesting sounding place yeah season it and throw it on the grill and and you know sit around and and just talk while it s cooking and some people go back and eat their salads and leave it there most people stay up there so they get to take their own steak back to their table but uh it s really neat i never thought it would go over much because nobody you know i don t want to cook my own dinner i want to go out and you know pay for it but it s really a it s really a neat phenomena how it all works out yeah yeah yeah that sounds pretty neat it d be worth giving a try yeah yeah if you re ever in or around the area do give it a try because it s really good food that s pretty interesting i ve never heard of anything like that yeah i m not sure where all you know he s Texas bound obviously because i haven t heard him go any farther than those three cities but that it s it s really neat too so yeah huh that s a unique idea i guess i guess that s part of the game nowadays in fast food you got to come up with some catchy idea yeah yeah yeah and it s it s and i and you know the fact that it s his own cattle it s just an ongoing yeah he he surely doesn t have to worry about supply right right that s a pretty good idea huh maybe i ll start a restaurant now so yeah yeah you got all these tips i don t know if i trust these people in Raleigh to cook anything though probably burn the place down oh yeah i bet you can t get find Mexican food over there i had always wondered what i d do if i lived somewhere other than Texas well come to think i ve never even seen a Mexican here we got lots of Kuwaitis and Iranians and Iraqis but gosh oh well hum oh well well i guess that about does it on the fast food circuit doesn t it i guess so some of the subjects i tell you yeah well they ve they ve been a lot worse yeah right it was good talking to you Jackie you have a good night um bye bye you too Dave you too bye bye
