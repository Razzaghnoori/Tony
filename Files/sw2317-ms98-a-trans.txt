well you don t have a choice oh it just comes down when it wants to well you don t have a choice of where you re going so when you get ready to come down you have to you know you it s more or less like letting the air out he can land more or less where he wants to it s just that there s no like if he wanted to go one place he would have to know which way the wind is blowing yeah uh huh right

one one year and i can t think of the rest of them but they they you know they have sponsors for certain balloons and all they do is just put the name of the bank or whoever s sponsoring that balloon that balloon yeah it s pretty good yeah and it looks so pretty when they re all you know when there s a bunch of them that way uh oh yeah and it s so peaceful we went out to Texas Stadium one time for a Boy Scout jamboree um hum and we we was inside of the stadium like like i was thinking it the Astrodome um hum and they filled it up the football field yeah and inflated all the balloons oh and it s it was so pretty that if you got way up at the top it looked like you could just dive off and and and bounce on a bunch of pillows you know it was good it was fun i had fun yeah wow sounds fun but that that s my that s probably my main hobby that sewing and reading books that s about it oh i like to read too what kind of books do you like do you really romance yeah i like those i like mysteries i like murder mysteries too uh um um hum have you ever read any Dean Koontz huh uh he s he s sort of it s he he s writes real good but usually it s the kind though that you don t want to start if you have to put it down very soon go anywhere yeah yeah yeah the he does well they re sort of scary you know but they re they re just really really good uh uh The Watchers you know they made a movie of The Watchers here not too long ago uh huh and that was a book that he wrote that that was my favorite one it s about this dog named Einstein and this it was he was an experimental government thing you know huh uh huh and they were trying to do like like robotic stuff and everything oh i seen that movie yeah yeah well the the book was just ever so much better yeah really yeah it was great i don t like i don t like scary books i can t i can t read those i get paranoid you like uh uh who is it uh Victoria Victoria Holt is that right yeah she s one yeah those are good i like those but i like i i m a Danielle Steele fan oh really yes well that s i i have every book the woman s ever wrote really and two of her books have been on three of them s been on TV yeah and i got all three of them on tape and i m fixing to tape this other one that s coming on Monday Changes yeah oh what what what one is that Changes hum and i had the book and i hadn t read it in so long so i read it the other day to see if i could so i can watch the movie yeah yeah usually the the movies are not as good the book is always the book is always better yeah you know but you know but because i know some of the stuff like that one Judith Krantz made that one they did that one really they did okay but i liked the book better um hum it was good yeah that s usually the way it is um hum sometimes they just change them completely yeah and you think it s the same but it s really not yeah um hum like Jaws do you remember Jaws did you yeah the book was different from the yeah the book was a lot better i thought oh yeah but they just they just um hum so what else do you like to do besides reading well my dancing is i i like to belly dance oh belly dance yeah you mean like those little thin in the little roll the bellies yeah i can t do that i ve always tried to do that i ve always wanted to though i didn t how people can get they stomach well you know it s it s real funny because when i first started it was like i saw someone at a Halloween party this lady was from Turkey and she d been belly dancing since she was four years old you know so i thought well jeez you know that looks like fun i ll learn that in a couple of weeks ha um hum yeah yeah you know i mean you could just you could just take lessons forever forever i think yeah right um course i m tend to be a slow learner i guess anyway but it s a lot of fun and it s it s a good way to get exercise you know fooling yourself because you don t realize you re getting exercise you know it s so much fun you don t really think about it um and exercising i mean let s face it exercising stinks um oh i go to aerobics classes and stuff but i like that do you aerobics yeah i like aerobics are you do do you are you at TI in Dallas so so you go to the fitness center in Dallas no i go to jazzercise no oh yeah yeah i well the only time i can go in too and all these classes that are available are like Saturday oh really yeah Saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can oh they have them at night over here yeah well they have uh the they have them like at six um hum you know here but i no we have six and seven no six and then one is at seven ten or something like that yeah um hum yeah but i like jazzercise i like it better than aerobics yeah that s a lot of fun well yeah that s the same kind of thing like belly dancing you know you don t really realize that you re working as hard as you are because you re having fun yeah and it s sort of cute too and yeah i like jazzercise i ll tell anybody i d go to jazzercise before i d go to aerobics yeah yeah well see i belong to the fitness center so i feel like i have to go to the aerobics class to get my money s worth you know yeah i used to belong i i but i stopped that because i never used it yeah you know the the fitness centers so oh well that s a waste of money um hum yeah well it s so neat because it s right there and i can go just right after work and you know before i get home because once i get home that that tends to be it so yeah i m thinking about it my husband wants he wants to go to and sign up for the weights um hum yeah and yeah that s handy and they re just there you know when you want to use them so but um hum and they re open till i think ten um hum yeah so yeah and i i did the family thing so my sweetie could go too i don t know um hum do the weights yep he ll he ll he would never do an aerobics he d die before he in aerobics class oh yeah but he likes the weights and the you know stationary bicycle and all that um hum yep my husband likes the weights period that s it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i m going to pump up i said uh huh body build huh yeah because i m always looking at those guys i love them um hum but i always ask him how come they don t ever have no hair because i ve never i think they shave it yeah they do and i told him i said well if you do it you can t shave your hair yeah and put i m sorry i can t handle it and then then oil up i think um hum they do and then i don t know how they get because normally they re not that pumped up and i
