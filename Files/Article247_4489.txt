 Bradley in a Box A couple of months ago I described Al Gore s attempt to create a lose lose situation for Bill Bradley Through the use of relentless often unfair attacks Gore and his staff thought they could trap Bradley between a rock and hard place If Bradley remained on the high road emphasizing his positive message and ignoring the vice president s hectoring the unanswered criticism would damage him But if on the other hand Bradley responded to Gore in kind he would be descending to his opponent s level dispelling his aura of moral superiority in the process Gore s tactic has worked perfectly During the past several months Bradley has remained Buddha like on his mountaintop dismissing Gore s attacks as politics as usual but not criticizing his opponent directly or even answering most of his complaints The result has been ebbing momentum for the challenger Bradley has suffered from both Gore s specific charges such as the distortion that he opposed flood relief for Iowa farmers and from the general sense that he is a Michael Dukakis or Paul Tsongas type of political victim As if to underscore the unhelpful comparison with Tsongas the Bradley campaign has been running 30 second TV ads in which Niki Tsongas Paul s widow says that Bradley is falling prey to the kind of smear that undermined her husband in 1992 So with Plan A plainly failing Bradley has finally switched at to Plan B His own revised strategy was on view in last night s WMUR CNN debate in which Bradley pointedly went after Gore in a way he has not done previously Bradley repeatedly called Gore a liar though he only used the actual l word after the debate sneakily compared him to Richard Nixon and Rudy Giuliani blasted him for pandering to every special interest group under the sun and wondered how Gore would muster enough public credibility to serve as president if elected And my question to you is why should we believe you that you will tell the truth as president if you don t tell the truth as a candidate Bradley asked in one of many direct confrontations He also accused Gore of having once opposed abortion of distorting Bradley s health care plan and of being too cozy with corporate lobbyists and special interests After the debate Bradley congratulated himself for finally taking the gloves off I thought I was doing pretty well counter punching tonight quite frankly he told Larry King in a post game appearance Today at a rally in Manchester Bradley described his performance as a fresh start to his campaign Last night I decided I d had it he declared We re going to call my opponent on what he s been doing I expect that Bradley s satisfaction will be short lived His newfound pugnacity plays into Gore s hands as much as his earlier pacifism did In the debate Gore was completely ready for Bradley turning every accusation of foul play back on his accuser If that s not negative I don t what it is Gore said in response to Bradley s charge that he is a favorite of Washington lobbyists The vice president also brought up the fact that Bradley injected Willie Horton into the campaign and was forced to apologize for an unfair ad I have never mentioned your name in an ad I have never used your picture in an ad Gore said There is nothing I have said in this campaign that is in any way mean spirited Every time Bradley took a whack at him Gore appealed to the ref I didn t foul him he fouled me Many who saw this debate judged the nonstop quarrelling about who started it to be childish But that s fine with Gore since it reduces the two men to the same level The point of Gore s litigiousness isn t to establish that Bradley s campaign behavior really is worse than his own though he claims it is It s to establish that there s no real difference in their behavior If they re the same then Gore is better because he doesn t hold himself out as a paragon of political saintliness By his own rules Gore can go negative so long as he doesn t make it personal But if Bradley goes negative he s a sanctimonious hypocrite If you re going to talk about a higher standard you re going to have to live by them Gore said clearly delighted to be yanking Bradley off his high horse He knows that once Bradley has thrown even a few punches he can t reclaim the status of a conscientious objector Is there any way for Bradley to escape from Gore s box Not that I can think of Click here for Ballot Box s review of the Republican debate
