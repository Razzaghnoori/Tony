 Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudence I am an American who lives in Wales and I have a problem with geographically challenged American friends who confuse England just a part of the whole and the United Kingdom and are constantly sending mail addressed to me in Wales England instead of Wales U K Should I make a pest of myself and keep telling my friends that I live in Wales not England or should I just shrug it off Adopted Welshman Dear Ad Ah yes a gray matter issue But you have come to the right person A geographically challenged American that is Prudie thinks she was in the bathroom when other people learned these things in grade school In any case speaking as one who would be on the receiving end of your pestering by all means offer the mini education Sending mail and wanting it to arrive makes your little lesson one with actual value If however you find yourself having to tell the same person more than once then shrug it off and Prudie hopes you will be compassionate Prudie geographically Dear Prudence Just a quick note of support for your reply to regarding forms of address I think your first instinct that children should address adults in the manner in which the adults ask to be addressed is absolutely dead on Not only as a child but even now well into my adulthood this rule has served me well Not only do people appreciate my respect for their preferences but I also don t have to choose to whom to cater in mixed situations It is one of those rare cases in which I can please everyone Best of all though I avoid the hubris of pushing my ideas of appropriate formality on others even those who agree with me Now I just wish more forms would allow me to omit Mr from my name Accommodating in Seattle Dear Ac Prudie thanks you for the vote of confidence and doubly so because she was taken to task by some readers who disagreed We are kindred in another way as well Prudie just likes to use her first and last name and would happily ditch the Ms or the Mrs or the Miss Prudie gratefully Dear Prudence Does a bridesmaid have to give the future bride a gift for every shower given The Professor Dear Prof Certainly not Some brides have so many people entertaining for them that it would seem to be constantly raining luncheons and teas and etiquette calls for the attendants to be invited to every such event The bridesmaids may skip giving shower presents unless they simply feel they d like to Or a token gift would be appropriate And since Prudie is living in America in 1999 a small addendum about those brides who ve previously been up at bat Emily Post wrote this Those who attended a shower for the bride before she was married the first time should not be invited to a second shower unless they are very close relatives or very dear friends who would want to be present Prudie graciously Dear Prudie We got to be friends with our neighbors with whom we had much in common We shared tools went to see Bob Dylan together cared for each other s cats while away on trips They borrowed a bottle of wine while we were gone and they were doing the cat thing for us It was not a wine that was known to them i e they didn t know if it was a gift or special in some other way But they took it anyway drank it and told us about it as soon as we returned It was not in fact a special or expensive bottle of wine but not to belabor the point they didn t know that They also didn t replace it in a timely fashion When we let them know we weren t happy with the whole thing they were offended and have since completely severed the friendship What do you think about taking something like this from someone s home while you re doing them a favor If it had been a Bud or two from the fridge we wouldn t have given it a second thought But a bottle of wine that may have been irreplaceable Thanks Sad in Philly Dear Sad First they told you and second they failed to replace it This suggests they view things differently than you two and their idea of correct behavior is different from yours There is a chance that by their lights they assumed that had you been home you would have lent them the wine Prudie agrees with you that this was not first rate behavior It could be though that they just didn t know any better Should you feel generous and lonesome for the friendship you might make the first move and say you wish to let bygones be bygones because the relationship was important to you I mean you all went to see Bob Dylan together Their severing ties bespeaks their embarrassment at having made a social misstep and perhaps anger that you wouldn t cut them some slack So Prudie recommends that you patch it up if you wish the whole thing had never happened And she is certain if relations are repaired that the neighbs will never again help themselves to anything in your house Prudie soothingly
