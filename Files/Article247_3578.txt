 Passing on the Left Dear Tamar Bill Bradley was known as Dollar Bill when he played professional basketball not because of how he played but because he squeezed his dollars until they wept and cried While his teammate Walt Frazier ran around in mink coats and Rolls Royces Dollar Bill wore the same ratty trench coat and shoes run down at the heels Just something I thought you d like to know We are back again at tactics The Bradley inside crew has looked at what seems like a lock by Al Gore and decided to run to Gore s left The Gorites have seen this and are protecting that flank but not too flagrantly They showed this recently with the Gore proposal to achieve health insurance for more of America s children Not all tactics are evil This a worthy goal one that will save us all those emergency room dollars but it is part of a political maneuver as well Bradley has rightly sensed discontent among traditional Dems about Clinton s me tooism with respect to Republican philosophy The problem is that the discontent was eclipsed by public anger about the impeachment drama The brilliance of the conservative movement take a bow you crafty Kristols lies principally in how it changed the language of American politics Liberal became a pejorative synonymous with weakness taxation overspending and blind obeisance to welfare cheats and Negroes Liberals were nonplused and bit their nails as the conservative ideology machine turned them into pulp That machine would still be dominating the debate had it not been for Newt and the radicals who overplayed the mandate and made the American people edgy Dollar Bill Rhodes Scholar that he is is smart enough to know all this and is betting that there will be some daylight to the left of Gore George W is in the same ball park He saw that frothing Republican convention in 92 that spelled disaster for his party He will not be out compassioned and will utter sweet nothings even as he pulls the switch on the electric chair Both Dollar Bill and George W recognize that Americans are a people of the middle But as for Dollar Bill he s caught in the passing lane behind the Gore express As that girl group used to say in the famous doo wop song It s gonna take a miracle yes it s gonna take a miracle Speaking of loaded terminology The big conservative coup was transforming the phrase affirmative action into preferences as you do in your posting such that newspapers use the two interchangeably I refer you to the Chicago Tribune columnist Clarence Page just about the only prime time journalist in the country to really jump on this this linguistic hijacking The two terms are not interchangeable Affirmative action connotes reaching out to underrepresented minorities on the grounds that some racial mixture is socially desirable When I go out to find and hire people I do not prefer someone nonwhite But I do in fact prefer to have a staff that reflects something of the population that my business is meant to serve lest my company falter and die Hence the New York City cops searching for gay police officers Wise move in this capital of Wigstock that Labor Day drag ball On the question of how we salvage inner city schools We as a people must be willing to ensure at the minimum that the kids have a qualified teacher at the front of the room a set of books and a safe school When the schools are particularly bad as in the case of Washington D C I have advocated vouchers not penny ante ones proposed by some in Congress last year but real ones that would send at least a few kids out of the city to the very best schools available We can t do anything about bad parents be they white bad parents or black bad parents and simply must treat that issue as such If it takes federal subsidies or a Peace Corps strategy so be it The ACLU suit in California may be slow going but it has highlighted the principle problem As a culture we have tended to believe that good education is wasted on the black and brown poor who will soon be the majority And as Ward Connerly said the other day that sets up a self fulfilling prophecy that is killing the kids and America s future in the bargain We can either throw up our hands or send in the troops It s that simple I think
