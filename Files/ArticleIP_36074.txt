 The Road to Beverly Hills Hays Kan Wednesday Oct 6 1999 Last night was not the best As part of her ongoing I am not a princess campaign E has been claiming she wants to stay at motels that cost 29 95 I have resisted so far Last night we picked out a nice looking 62 95 establishment that shall remain nameless for reasons that will become obvious We were heading up to our room when the pleasant Midwestern clerk said Oh one thing If you turn on the heater the smoke alarm will go off Since it was a cold night this had a slight Monty Pythonesque quality Should a man come into your room and hit you over the head with a hammer pay no mind We imprudently forged ahead and settled into our room we re sharing though as part of my hands off policy see below I always ask for two beds After a couple of hours of sleep E turned on the light and announced I m not feeling well Indeed she was feverish and large red welts had appeared all over her body I rushed her to the local emergency room The doctor s diagnosis The sheets had poisoned her The doctor explained this was not uncommon apparently the detergent used by some motels can cause an allergic reaction and sent her home with three different prescriptions which returned her skin to its previous lustrous condition but rendered her semi comatose This incident decisively ended the I am not a princess campaign which quite frankly wasn t working anyway Note to E I see where you have called me a hypochondriac in your earlier entry But I don t have to be taken to the hospital if my thread count falls below 250 To be fair E has until last night required less maintenance than expected Her morning beauty routine is minimal to nonexistent She just jumps into the shower and puts her wet hair back into a ponytail which emphasizes her deceptively childlike appearance and makes me feel slightly Humbertish at check in time It doesn t help when I ask for two beds Some non E related points Trends noticed in America s Heartland 1 Skyline improvement Postmodernism may have worn out its welcome but it has certainly made cities look better from a distance Louisville St Louis Kansas City all now have a fabulous turreted Oz like appearance 2 More hitchhikers than there were a few years ago 3 The Lindy Hop whatever that is 4 Peter Frampton Revival Favorite Billboard Monks Yes 1 800 Me a Monk The Tipper Principle By June 2000 I predict we will all hate Tipper Gore This is not because she is particularly unlikable To the contrary it s precisely because she is likable that her husband s handlers will stick her in our faces until we can t stand the sight of her This now appears to be an ineluctable law of modern politics All first ladies become unpopular If they re unpopular to begin with the law is satisfied ab initio If they are popular to begin with they will be overexposed until they aren t Ernestine Bradley is next Back to E I do think I may have scored some points with my protective response during the Princess and the Pea episode In general my Darwinian strategy is to take no overt romantic actions in keeping with the founding lie of this journey Make her wonder why I m not hitting on her She hasn t made any moves on me either Perhaps she s trying the same approach
