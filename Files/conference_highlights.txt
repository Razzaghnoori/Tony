 A CONFERENCE OF STATEWIDE PROGRAMS February 8 9 2002 Indianapolis Indiana Introduction In the summer of 2001 LSC s State Planning Team determined that there is a critical need to communicate clearly the key elements of planning related to statewide legal services programs The Team suggested a national initiative to bring together executive directors of statewide programs around the state planning agenda The goal was to focus executive directors on the fundamentals of planning for client centered comprehensive integrated statewide justice communities This initiative was specifically designed to bring together executive leadership from newly created statewide LSC funded programs and the experienced leadership of the more historical statewide programs This peer group benefited from the opportunity to come together to discuss the challenges and new opportunities created by the processes of state planning Background This meeting was originally scheduled for September 13 15 2001 but was postponed in the aftermath of the September 11th attack on the U S LSC staff planned and coordinated this conference and the Corporation sponsored the participation of executive directors by covering their travel costs Additionally programs were offered the option of sending additional staff to the conference at their own expense Amidst a professional and amiable backdrop the conference

Attachment A Friday February 8 2002 Session I Three Statewide Models A Panel Presentation This session provided participants with a snapshot of three statewide programs and focused on Planning for Client Centered Comprehensive Integrated State wide Justice Communities Executive Directors Nan Heald Maine Patrick McIntyre Washington and Jon Asher Colorado spoke from the perspectives of a longtime statewide program Maine a state that was reconfigured several years ago Washington and a newly reconfigured statewide Colorado Each provided a perspective on developing a vision setting goals and determining strategies for achieving access to a full range of civil legal services Each emphasized three central themes 1 The imperative that each state must have a vision that encompasses a full range of services 2 The challenge of orienting existing staff to a new or changing vision inculcating the vision and mission within the staff and uniting staff old and new over a common vision whether in a single office or scattered office setting and 3 The challenge of balancing vision with fiscal reality recognizing that as funds remain static or decline the need for collaboration increases and at the same time the threat of fractionalization increases Session II Group Discussion A group discussion facilitated by Robert Gross and Melissa Pershing followed The discussion provided a forum for participants to share thoughts challenges and best practices in the context of developing and fostering a statewide vision Participants suggested that statewide program leadership needed to be able to Talk consistently and constantly about vision and quality Set high expectations for staff Delegate appropriate management functions so that the Executive Director can be a visible leader among staff and the greater equal justice community Work closely with the state court system and get involved in collaborations Build on the program strengths that already exist Seek assistance from experienced consultants Visualize state planning holistically Know that there are positive long term advantages that ensue from the state planning initiative Perform environmental scans for information vital to the creation of a statewide vision Appreciate and respect the differences in office and staff culture and use them as a genesis for a unified vision Think critically about how to unify systems noting that sometimes uniformity is necessary and sometimes it is not appropriate Understand that the pursuit of justice is different from the pursuit of access to justice Session III Press Public Relations

the national Russenello research Mr Vivero encouraged participants to use the media to publicize meaningful program events He stressed the importance of getting the right message out delivered by the

focused on the importance of embracing cultural diversity leadership succession planning and the general expansion of program leadership especially as a part of a state planning initiative Transformation An Overarching Achievement Identified It was obvious from the remarks made by a number of recently merged states that some kind of critical phase had been passed Participants recognized that programs were turning or had turned that critical corner from being resistant to or resentful of change to an embracing of new visions by staff board members and other stakeholders Participants shared experiences about these transformations and acknowledged the benefits of reconfiguration as programs complete the critical work of reorganization The Future Participants have already been provided detailed contact information so that they can network and follow up with others who attended the conference LSC asked attendees to identify what they feel would be the next appropriate steps A report of the conference will also be provided to all participants complete with a package containing handouts This information will also be shared with LSC s OPP staff A total of 14 completed evaluations were received from participants All were unanimous in their praise and appreciation for the statewide conference and expressed a desire for an annual or semi annual conference of this nature to be held either in person or with the use of videoconferencing Several suggested that separate break out sessions could be developed for long time statewides and recently merged statewides which would allow more time attention and specifically tailored agendas and discussions for both It was also noted that not all programs were state wides and that perhaps there would be value in getting the island programs together Hawaii Puerto Rico the Virgin Islands Micronesia and Guam since they face similar delivery issues Ideas from both attendees and staff for additional follow up included i Regional leadership conferences small intense retreat like group meetings of Executive Directors plus 1 or 2 identified potential leaders from each of iv Mentoring exchange program for newer leaders or leaders who could benefit from exposure to other programs v Online leadership clearinghouse with links to non profit management and leadership sites and materials M I E etc vi Resources protocols and guidelines for conducting meaningful statewide needs assessment vii More regional meetings and meetings of like programs i e rural with rural or small with small for mutual problem solving viii Directory of statewide programs that includes information such as number of employees number of offices amount percentage type of funding level of tech usage types of services collaborations partnerships etc that would allow us to look for a comparable program to brainstorm a particular issue ix A place to share materials information and best practices documents orientation packages training ideas Many attendees also asked for additional information on the following topics Technology technology innovations technology connecting state government courts agencies and programs technology as a means of outreach technology use between programs offices Resource development fundraising ideas Public relations initiatives Internal staff communications Ways to establish and maintain a statewide equal access committee Final comments from one participant s evaluation The real challenge in legal services today is how to change and expand our mission through new and innovative approaches to the poverty around us I feel this can be done within the current LSC restrictions but it requires entirely new approaches and combinations of services I would encourage an agenda that challenges us to change and expand our mission Change is good
