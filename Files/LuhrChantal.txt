 OK um just to give you a little bit background on my heritage my mother is French and Italian and my father is American and German but I am a born native of Charlotte NC if you can t tell by the accent Um I have traveled back and forth to France Uh the story that comes to mind the most for me um I guess in my life is the story of my grandmother who s now presently 85 years old and actually had flew down here the Friday after the tragedy so it was um I think it was the fourteenth of September she flew by herself from France to here to visit us and is still here until December 24th Um her story actually is what impacted me the most in my life um when I think of the things she went through growing up and um how my mother was conceived and everything on that nature which it gets a little personal but it s you don t think of your grandmother telling you that but she did Um my grandmother and my grandfather was in the error of the war and so they were constantly moving My grandfather was Italian full blooded Italian and he was um a prisoner of war for a while Um he did escape and get out and so him and my grandmother were like he would travel get missing and come back you know but he would always be back with my grandmother and everything And there was one particular incident where they were um there were bombs going off because again this was like in the war with the Germans and so forth Um and they thought they literally thought they were going to die because they were on a train and the train part of the train that they were on wasn t hooked to the caboose So when the train pulled off to get from away from all of the stuff that was going on they were left behind So they thought they were going die so they decided I guess what better way to die than um to make love on the train and that s how my mother actually was conceived was on a train and my grandmother had told me about that you know the different things they went through with that Um OK um back to me When I grew up my mother taught us French It was me and my sister and she taught us French before she thought us English Um and I remember as a child mixing the two languages like I might say a sentence in French and throw in two words in English um because we learn French in the household and then English in school And all my life she constantly brought us back and forth from um France to um America um to visit my family there So I still am fluent in French and I am very thankful for that um because recently when my grandmother came to visit she has never had heart trouble and um never had anything go wrong with her heart or anything and one day while she was here which was here recently her heart rate dropped real low so we had to um rush her to the emergency room and this was something very scary for her because she doesn t speak any English She speaks like one or two words of English um not to mention she doesn t like to going to the doctor so it was like we had to hit her over the head to bring her there But um we finally got her to the hospital and they um ended up doing surgery on her that the next day and placing a putting a pace maker um so for her you know to be here you know and get treatment under under those circumstances was kind of scary but she s doing better OK now she s supposed to still be going back December 24th Um and when they say it rains it pours because my mom um recently moved back in with me but I don t know how long that will be but um she did and she had been up one night from she had gotten up one morning at like five o clock in the morning By the time I had got home from work and so forth it was like 11 o clock at night and she was extremely tired but my mom is one of these people who constantly has to go and do something she can t sit still it drives her crazy So she thinks she s going to make you know she moved all her stuff back in my house and she thinks she s going to clean it up all in one day so my house is like a tornado hit it by this time but you know I m fine I haven t said anything about it because you know I know it s going take a few days but she wants to do it all in one day so she s still up at like 11 30 at night going back and forth between the attic which you know in the in the attic is in the top of my house You have to climb a ladder a pull down ladder to get to it and I was telling her you know she d needed to be careful she needed to go to bed because she was tired and furthermore there is like a hairline crack in my ceiling in my bedroom um where apparently she had stepped wrong or stepped on the wrong place or something before and it created a hairline crack and I was telling and I stressed to her you know Be careful you know don t step in this area There s a hairline crack in my ceiling So I m sleeping midnight you know it s past midnight and all of a sudden I hear this big loud noise and I look up and she s hanging through my ceiling And here s her feet dangling and of course it startles me but I m a very quick reactor so I jump out of bed and I was pushing her feet up so she wouldn t fall all the way through my ceiling um but mind you this is after I told her to specifically not to walk in this area but I tell you if you know anything about my mom it s like I can talk to the wall better than I can talk to her and tell her something But so then if that wasn t bad enough um we were in the hospital and my instincts told me not to let her drive my car but I m thinking you know if my friends can drive my car from time to time then why can t I let my mom drive my car from time to time Dumb question because I know my mom and I know how she drives and she s doesn t she s not careful but I m thinking the hospital is 10 minutes from my house OK so I m thinking 10 minutes from my house what can happen Well she s gone and no sooner than she comes back what do she tell me Oh I hit something She hit something So not only has she torn a hole in my ceiling which still isn t fixed by the way but now my car is all dented up So I m just like Lord by the grace of God just let me get through this But um you know she felt real bad about it but this was after I specifically told her I m like Mommy you know you re real emotional right know I m saying you know you know upset and be extremely careful what you re doing you know when you drive my car home and she said OK OK And then she comes back and she was like Don t ever let me drive your car again and I was like You do not have to worry
