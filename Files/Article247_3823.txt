 Harry Potter and the Iowa Caucuses This February people from all over the small and ethanol subsidy dependent state of Iowa will gather to cast the first votes in the 2000 presidential nominating process The method whereby this is done is understood by almost no one click here for a summary of how the Democrats do it and here for a summary of how the Republicans do it and has been subjected to much intelligent criticism click here to read Chatterbox s predecessor in this column Mickey Kaus on the subject But Chatterbox is not one to knock the status quo without proposing a practical alternative In that spirit he suggests replacing the Iowa caucus with a Sorting Hat Readers of J K Rowling s phenomenally popular Harry Potter books will recognize the Sorting Hat as a magical wizard s hat pointed and patched and frayed and extremely dirty that assigns new students at Hogwarts the boarding school for aspiring wizards to one of four houses Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw or Slytherin Gryffindor is where the series hero Harry is assigned and Slytherin is where its murderous villain Lord Voldemort was assigned when he was a boy it now houses Harry s obnoxious rival Draco Malfoy and Malfoy s half wit sidekicks Crabbe and Goyle Chatterbox may as well quote from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone the song the Sorting Hat sings to the assembled new students in full Oh you may not think I m pretty But don t judge on what you see I ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me You can keep your bowlers black Your top hats sleek and tall For I m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can cap them all There s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can t see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be You might belong in Gryffindo r Where dwell the brave at heart Their daring nerve and chivalry Set Gryffindors apart You might belong in Hufflepuff Where they are just and loyal Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of toil Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw If you ve a ready mind Where those of wit and learning Will always find their kind Or perhaps in Slytheri n You ll make your real friends Those cunning folk use any means To achieve their ends So put me on Don t be afraid And don t get in a flap You re in safe hands though I have none For I m a Thinking Cap The advantage of the Sorting Hat is that it doesn t tell you which candidate is best it merely sorts the candidates according to their most pronounced characteristics Chatterbox can t know of course how the Sorting Hat would assign the current candidates in the Democratic and Republican primary races but in the spirit of political punditry offers the following prediction Chatterbox gratefully acknowledges technical assistance for this item from Rosina B Williams age 11 of Jersey City N J
