 Cybermag in Tabloid Love Nest One goal of Slate is to help you to stay efficiently abreast of developments you aren t wildly interested in You may have skipped all those worthy newspaper articles about that coup in Burundi but we hope you ll feel guilty enough to read a short Gist column on the subject Relax that s only a theoretical example There wasn t a coup in Burundi As far as we know In that spirit we introduce a new feature this week called Keeping Tabs which will track developments in the world of the tabloids It will be posted Wednesday evening Aug 6 Slate readers of course are much too morally austere to have any genuine interest in the sex lives of Hollywood stars the diets of talk show hosts and suchlike paranormal phenomena But we all have a duty to stay well informed of what engages other people And Washington writer Emily Yoffe has heroically volunteered to wallow in the mud on our behalf and distill it into a palatable essence Weld Done Last week was not the first time Bill Weld quit a high profile job in a high profile manner At dinner in a leafy Washington neighborhood a decade ago the talk turned to real estate The Welds house down the street is for sale Is that William Weld head of the Justice Department s Criminal Division Is he leaving town Yes he s moving back to Massachusetts his wife s up there now checking out schools Many weeks later a front page story in the Washington Post reported that Weld and another top Justice official abruptly announced their resignations yesterday as an act of conscience over revelations about ethically questionable behavior by Attorney General Ed Meese Meese had no advance warning that Weld s mounting frustration had reached the breaking point So we have long harbored the suspicion that Bill Weld jolly and appealing character that he is might be a bit um self styled an impression discussed in this week s Assessment That said it should be noted that Slate is forever in the debt of the Weld family David Weld the governor s nephew and then a Microsoft employee came up with the name Slate last year at a moment when we had almost despaired of finding any name for our magazine that was both euphonious and trademarkable In Your Interface There are two new ways to enjoy Slate without soiling your fingers in the World Wide Web Our popular new feature Today s Papers a summary and analysis of the front pages of the five major national newspapers can be e mailed to you every morning Sunday through Friday free as sunshine for now Today s Papers appears on our site overnight and soon next week we hope
