                 yeah huh   all right um exercise huh   yeah   um as a matter fact i work out in the mornings i belong to Presidents and uh ive got a routine for every morning of the week and i dont work out on Saturday or Sunday   uhhuh uhhuh   but uh i do a i do a combination of uh uh running and weight training   they set that up for you   no i i actually i just you know joined on my own and ive been thinking about getting with a uh one of their counselors just so see what uh what they might have to offer as far as you know alternatives   uhhuh   but i pretty much uh  worked on my own routine   and uh what kind of running do you do   theyve got the track on the inside and uh i run one mile on Monday Wednesdays and Fridays and then on Tuesdays and Thursdays i run two miles   uhhuh umhum   and then after that i work out with weights   is it just aerobic or   uh and i work out with free weights   no i mean the running   oh uh yeah its really uh aerobic work out part   you do it you do a mile in about eight minutes or less   uh about seven minutes   uhhuh and then you wouldnt then you dont get um out of breath   uh no i do  yeah thats thats a pretty good pretty good clip and ill be im pretty winded by the time i get done   oh oh   so   but i mean hes just not pushing it real hard like you know if you tried to make six or something like that   oh yeah i i could i could probably go faster but then id wear myself out  and i wouldnt be able to work out anything else   yeah right yeah uhhuh   yeah how about you   yeah i i dont run much any more i did when i was in school i right now i just lift um   umhum   weights and and do push ups and sit ups and and i jump rope a little bit and thats about it   umhum yeah yeah   and i dont i dont lift any heavy weights uh theyre about a third of my body weight   oh i see so just uh just try and keep them uh i guess uh firm and   yeah and um um i play the trumpet and uh the more upper body strength the easier it is to play you you have to do a you have to do a whole lot of sit ups and uh   yeah yeah thats true umhum   and then i i hurt my neck uh about three years ago so you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from   hm yeah   um hurting yourself when you play high   oh i see i see   you have to you have to do it correctly its you know its like an exercise in itself but a lot of people uh strain themselves doing it   umhum oh i see uh so youre in uh in part of a band   um i play at church   oh i see i see i used to play an instrument when i was in in high school but it wasnt the trumpet  so i was just wondering if thats what it was or something   and umhum yeah   i see   well yeah   so you you have any plans of maybe running running more when the weather gets nicer   well yeah well the weathers nice except for when it rains you know i mean in Dallas yeah i keep thinking about it but that doesnt that doesnt get it done i i i mostly jump rope more you know   yeah yeah umhum yeah i used to do a little bit of jumping rope and uh when i was uh a while back i was more into basketball and uh i used to do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves   uhhuh umhum   and uh but its been a while since ive done that   yeah i i do a toe lift and squats for that but you know i it it doesnt um   i see   it doesnt um accustom your your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when youre running for a long time they they tend to tighten up whenever you whenever you have to do something at a at a great length of time   right right umhum yeah i i thats true ive noticed that uh   and it also builds too much mass if you just you know   umhum   so and its like i i lift weights with about the the same curl weight as i do the squats with   uhhuh   and um then it doesnt bother me very much   yeah yeah huh thats thats interesting though i you know ive been thinking of changing ive done the same routine for almost two years now and im thinking it of changing it up   umhum   uh thats why well you know i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and see what different exercises they could get me on to get out of the routine   right   because ive heard that you know you get locked into routines and youre gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing   umhum   so im looking at changing things a little bit   yeah thats i i started doing more push ups and it its helped a lot and then i add sets to it so that i dont like you said wear it out i dont try to push it to the end in one set   umhum yeah
