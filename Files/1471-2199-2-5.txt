 Introduction The murine CD5 protein Ly 1 a 67 kD membrane associated glycoprotein found on all T cells and at low levels on B 1a cells a CD5 expressing subset of B lymphocytes 1 2 3 4 CD5 levels on the developmental and functional subsets range are ordered in a characteristic fashion Thymic CD4 T Splenic CD4 T Thymic CD8 T Splenic CD8 T Thymic CD4 CD8 T B 1a cells 5 6 The CD5 surface and mRNA expression levels in these subsets are highly correlated suggesting that CD5 expression is primarily regulated at the transcriptional level Structurally CD5 belongs to the scavenger receptor family of proteins based on the homology of its three extracellular scavenger receptor cysteine rich SRCR domains to other family members 7 Several potential CD5 ligands have been reported so far the pan B cell marker CD72 8 an as yet unidentified lymphocyte specific inducible glycoprotein 9 and VH framework determinants on immunoglobulins 10 While none of these potential ligands have been unequivocally shown to physiologically interact with CD5 these potential CD5 receptor ligand pairs suggest that CD5 may play a role in T B or B 1a B cell cell communication CD5 has been shown to be physically associated with the T cell receptor TCR CD3 complex in T cells and with B cell receptor BCR in B 1a cells 11 12 13 Although several laboratories reported that crosslinking CD5 on the surface augments T cells signaling by inducing calcium flux and enhancing mitogenic response 14 15 16 recent studies using CD5 deficient mice indicate that CD5 may be more important as a negative modulator of TCR and BCR signal transduction 17 18 Consistent with this idea the positive and negative selection in the thymus of CD5 deficient mice is altered in that their thymocytes are hyperresponsive and hyperproliferative to activation induced by anti CD3 antibodies 17 Similarly CD5 deficient B 1a cells show higher proliferative responses to surface IgM ligation than heterozygote littermates 18 CD5 most likely exerts its negative modulation of receptor signal transduction by associating with SH 2 containing signaling molecules This association could be directed by an imperfect immunoreceptor tyrosine based activating motif ITAM 19 or by a motif similar to immunoreceptor tyrosine based inhibitory motif ITIM located in the CD5 cytoplasmic domain 20 Consistent with SH 2 interaction CD5 cytoplasmic tyrosine residues are phosphorylated by p56 lck kinases upon TCR CD3 ligation and serve as targets for association with proteins containing SH2 domains in both T and B 1a cells 12 21 22 In human Jurkat cells and phytohemagglutinin expanded T lymphoblasts the CD5 ITIM like motif is crucial for association with SHP 1 a cytosolic tyrosine phosphotase implicated in the negative regulation of antigen receptor mediated signaling 23 However in murine B lymphoma cells the CD5 pseudo ITAM motif mediates its inhibitory action via a SHP 1 independent mechanism 24 Several studies have examined the CD5 promoter Comparison of the sequences of the CD5 promoters cloned from man and mouse 25 26 revealed conserved transcription factor binding sites In addition deletion analysis of the murine CD5 promoter indicated the presence of lymphoid specific regulatory elements 25 Here we present a detailed analysis of the CD5 promoter Using unstimulated EL4 thymoma cells as a model system we demonstrate that a CD5 expression is regulated by a 43 bp region 172 to 215 bp upstream of the methionine start codon for CD5 The presence of the Ets binding site in this regulatory region is particularly interesting because levels of Ets 1 a lymphoid specific member of the Ets family 27 28 have been shown to closely resemble the mRNA and protein levels observed for CD5 in different T cell subsets 29 5 6 In addition CD5 surface protein expression is greatly reduced in ets 1 T cells 30 31 We show here that Ets 1 protein recognizes and binds the Ets site in the 43 bp regulatory region and that CD5 expression is positively correlated with Ets 1 levels in co transfection studies Thus we closely link Ets 1 to CD5 regulation In addition we show that two other evolutionarily conserved regions located close to the Ets site provisionally named CD5X and CD5Y play a role in CD5 expression Based on these data we propose a model for CD5 transcriptional control in resting T cells that includes interaction between CD5X CD5Y and Ets 1 Results Characterization of regions on the CD5 promoter necessary for CD5 transcription We constructed luciferase reporter constructs containing progressively deleted fragments of a 3 kb genomic DNA clone which contains the CD5 promoter 1 32 Figure 1a Each deletion luciferase construct and a control LacZ reporter construct pON405 were co transfected into the EL4 T cell line and lysates prepared after cells were grown for 36 48 hours were assayed for luciferase activity Results show that the 3 kb fragment induces a large increase in luciferase activity which we define as the full level of CD5 expression in resting T cells Figure 1b Transfections with constructs containing successive deletions of the 3 kb fragment show that removal of DNA regions upstream of a StuI site at 215 relative to the CD5 protein initiation methionine codon does not significantly decrease luciferase expression from the level obtained with the full length fragment However the deletion of an additional 43 bp from StuI to HincII site at 172 reduces the reporter activity by more than five fold to basal level which is somewhat higher than the background level obtained with a promoterless luciferase construct GLB pGLBasic Additional deletion from the HincII to the HinfI site at 67 further reduced the basal reporter activity down to the background level These deletion constructs define two regions as important for CD5 expression a minimal core promoter region HincII to HinfI site that is required for basal activity and a regulatory region necessary for the full CD5 expression StuI to HincII site in resting T cells The Ets binding site is important for full CD5 expression Three potential transcription factor binding sites CCAAT E2 and Ets were previously identified by database sequence comparison in the 43 bp region described above StuI to HincII 25 However only the E2 and Ets site are conserved between mouse and human 26 To determine which of these potential transcription factor binding sites is responsible for regulating normal CD5 expression we performed site directed mutagenesis on the CCAAT mutC E2 mutK and Ets mutE sites from the StuI B reporter construct Wild type control and the mutant constructs were tested for their promoter activity in EL4 cells As figure 2shows mutations in the CCAAT or E2 binding site resulted in minor reductions in reporter activity In contrast the mutation in the Ets binding site completely abolished the full induction of transcription and reduced the luciferase activity to the basal level The Ets binding site is recognized by Ets 1 protein The above experiments demonstrate that a potential Ets binding site on the CD5 promoter is necessary for the full induction of transcription Since Ets 1 is lymphoid specific and its expression levels in T cell subsets correlate with the CD5 expression levels we focused our study on Ets 1 interaction with this Ets binding site For the following experiments we used an Ets 1 expression plasmid pEVRF ets 1 which encodes Ets 1 protein 33 34 We then performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays EMSA using radiolabelled Ets oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts prepared from pEVRF ets 1 transfected M12 cells figure 3a lane 3 9 This olignucleotide corresponds to the Ets binding site in the 43 bp regulatory region of the CD5 promoter It has the core Ets binding concensus with and additional 6 bases on each side The pEVRF ets 1 transfected M12 nuclear extracts form an additional protein DNA complex complex 1 figure 3 lane 3 compared with the nuclear extracts from M12 cells transfected with the control plasmid pEVRF0 figure 3 lane 2 This complex is easily competed away by increasing amount of unlabeled Ets oligos figure 3 lanes 4 and 5 but not by increasing amounts of irrelevant E2 oligos figure 3 lanes 6 and 7 Furthermore its formation is prevented by pre incubating the nuclear extract with anti Ets 1 polyclonal antibodies which recognize the Ets 1 DNA binding domain figure 3 lane 8 but not by pre incubation with pre immune polyclonal antibodies figure 3 lane 9 Thus this complex represents true Ets 1 binding We observed two additional endogenous complexes complex 2 and 3 that were competed away with increasing amount of unlabeled Ets oligos However these two complexes were also competed away with increasing amounts of irrelevant E2 oligos Furthermore complex 1 and 2 are not inhibited by pre incubation with anti Ets 1 antibodies Therefore we conclude that complex 1 and 2 are not Ets 1 specific These competition and inhibition experiments demonstrate that Ets 1 specifically binds to the oligonucleotide used for these studies As indicated above this olignucleotide corresponds precisely to the Ets binding site in the 43 bp regulatory region of the CD5 promoter with the core Ets binding concensus and only an additional 6 bases on each side Therefore we conclude that Ets 1 binds to the Ets site in the 43 bp regulatory region of the CD5 promoter or very closely to that site Ets 1 affects CD5 expression in T cells To understand the effect of Ets 1 on CD5 expression we co transfected EL4 cells with increasing amounts of Ets 1 expression plasmid pEVRF ets 1 along with a StuI B reporter construct containing either the wild type S or mutated Ets binding site E As figure 4shows the luciferase reporter activity from the wild type StuI B reporter construct increased in a dose dependent fashion with increasing amounts of Ets 1 expression plasmid lanes 1 4 Importantly the increase in reporter activity from Ets 1 expression was mediated by the Ets binding site on the CD5 promoter as the increase in reporter expression did not occur when the Ets binding site on the CD5 promoter was mutated lane 4 and 5 Based on these transfections results and the EMSA observations described above we conclude that Ets 1 regulates CD5 expression by binding to the Ets site located with in the 43 bp regulatory region The CD5Y region is essential for basal transcription in T cells Using the Intelligenetics sequence analysis program to compare the human and murine CD5 minimal promoter regions we found two conserved regions provisionally designated CD5X 172 to 154 and CD5Y 133 to 119 figure 5a that abut the Ets binding site These sequences did not show any homology to known transcription factor binding sites Transfection studies show that deletion upstream of CD5X abolishes the regulatory promoter activity but does not hamper the basal promoter activity In contrast deletion of the region containing CD5X and CD5Y eliminates both the regulatory and basal promoter activity figure 1b To determine whether the CD5X or CD5Y site is responsible for basal level expression we generated three mutations encompassing the CD5X region Xmut1 Xmut2 and Xmut3 and two mutations on the CD5Y region of the HincII B reporter plasmid Ymut1 and Ymut2 These mutant reporter constructs were transiently transfected into EL4 cells and subsequently analyzed for luciferase reporter activity None of the three mutated sites on the CD5X region had any effect on the basal level of transcription figure 5b In contrast both mutations in the CD5Y region resulted in reduction of the reporter activity In fact the luciferase activity was reduced almost to background levels with the Ymut1 mutation Thus we conclude that the CD5Y particularly the Ymut1 site is important for basal transcription Both CD5X and CD5Y regions affect full CD5 expression To determine whether either the CD5X or the CD5Y region can affect the full level of transcription controlled by the 43 bp CD5 regulatory promoter we generated the mutations described above in the CD5X and CD5Y regions in the StuI B reporter construct The Xmut2 mutation had a measurable effect 2 fold decrease on the full level of transcription and the Ymut2 mutation reduced the reporter activity by more than three fold figure 5c However the Ymut1 mutation decreased the luciferase activity more than five fold and brought the transcription activity to slightly below basal levels of CD5 transcription figure 5c These results demonstrate that both CD5X and CD5Y regions contribute to overall CD5 transcription by modifying the transcriptional activation from the 43 bp regulatory region and that the most important regulation comes from the CD5Y region EMSA analysis revealed specific proteins binding to the CD5X and CD5Y regions We performed EMSA using oligonucleotide probes containing either the CD5X or the CD5Y region to characterize protein binding to the respective regions As figure 6a shows several protein complexes can be seen binding to the 32P labeled CD5X oligo lane 2 Competition with 100 fold excess unlabeled CD5X oligo eliminated complexes 1 3 figure 6a lane 3 These complexes are specific to the CD5X probes as they can not be competed away with the addition of excess irrelevant oligos CD5Y CK and KE figure 6a lanes 4 6 Similarly several protein DNA complexes can be seen in EMSA with 32P labeled CD5Y oligo figure 6b lane 2 Competition analysis demonstrated that complex 1 can specifically be competed away by excess unlabeled CD5Y oligo figure 6b lane 3 but not by excess irrelevant CD5X CK and KE oligos figure 6b lanes 4 6 Thus we conclude that there are distinct intracellular proteins that specifically bind to CD5X and CD5Y and likely mediate the transcriptional activity of these newly recognized sites Discussion Studies here define the regions within the CD5 promoter that control transcriptional regulation in resting unstimulated T cells growing in culture By constructing a deletion series of CD5 promoter constructs using luciferase as the reporter gene we demonstrate that a 43 bp region between the StuI and HincII sites at 215 to 172 is necessary for normal resting CD5 expression level in T cells Further we show that this region contains an Ets binding site that regulates CD5 transcription two previously unrecognized regions that also control CD5 expression one of which is responsible for controlling basal expression of the promoter Weichert and Schwartz 25 have also reported a deletion analysis of the CD5 promoter Several of their deletions overlap the deletions we report For those constructs which were similar in both studies our results agree However these workers observed negative regulation with a construct that that we did not have None of our constructs showed negative regulation We investigated three potential transcription factor binding sites CCAAT E2 and Ets within the 43 bp regulatory promoter region and showed that only the Ets binding site influences CD5 expression in EL4 T cells Further we showed that the Ets 1 protein binds to the Ets site and that overexpression of Ets 1 leads to increased promoter activity Thus we conclude that Ets 1 positively regulates CD5 expression levels in T cells Theses findings are consistent with previous evidence showing that Ets 1 levels in T cell subsets correlate with the expression of CD5 on these subsets see Introduction to this paper In addition they are consistent with evidence demonstrating that CD5 expression is drastically reduced in gene targeted mice in which the Ets 1 locus is disrupted While the possibility that the decreased CD5 surface expression that was demonstrated in the gene targeted mice is due to post translational rather than transcriptional effects our co transfection studies with the Ets 1 expression plasmid and the CD5 promoter constructs demonstrate argue that Ets 1 is regulating transcription in all cases Thus the weight of our findings in combination with findings with presented by others leads us to conclude that the distinctive CD5 expression levels observed in T cell subsets is due to the different amounts of Ets 1 protein in the cells in these subsets This conclusion does not eliminate the possibility that Ets family members other than Ets 1 also participate in the regulation of CD5 expression PU 1 for example could be important in the regulation of CD5 expression on B 1 cells since it is predominantly expressed in B cells and macrophages 35 36 In fact preliminary evidence from our laboratory suggests that this may indeed be the case Ets 2 which is ubiquitously expressed could also contribute to CD5 regulation 29 37 38 However the data from Ets 1 gene targeted mice argues against this possibility since disruption of the Ets 1 gene is sufficient to prevent CD5 expression on T cells Therefore Ets 1 is the likely regulatory molecule in T cells We also characterized two regions CD5X and CD5Y that contribute to CD5 expression These two regions which contain previously unrecognized transcription binding factor sequence are conserved between mouse and human Our results showed that the CD5Y region is necessary for basal level of CD5 transcription Computer analysis of the CD5Y region did not reveal any potential transcription factor binding site or a canonical TATA box for establishing the typical RNA polymerase II transcription complex However the Ymut1 site contains a very weak homology to the TdT ML intiator consensus sequence 5 PyPyCAPyPyPyPyPy 3 39 The Ymut2 site which is the most important site for controlling basal expression overlaps a potential initiator site fitting the consensus 5 CTT CCC TTT TCC 3 for the ribosomal protein Inr family with only one mismatched base 40 Interestingly both Ymut1 and Ymut2 are positioned near the most upstream transcriptional start site 25 The initiator Inr element has been shown to be critical in positioning RNA polymerase II complex for transcription initiation in TATA less promoters 39 Since the CD5 promoter does not contain a TATA box these initiator binding sites may play a more important role in establishing transcription initiation Several Inr binding protein have been identified TFII I 41 YY1 42 43 and a 150 kDa TATA binding protein TBP associated factor TAF II 150 44 Recognition of the Inr element by these Inr binding proteins ITF provides a way for formation of transcription competent complex via their interaction with TBP or with other subunits of RNA polymerase II Thus we suggest that CD5Y region interacts with these ITFs to regulate transcription Like CD5Y CD5X region does not contain any consensus transcription factor binding sites This region is not necessary for basal CD5 transcription but it affects the overall level of CD5 transcription obtained with the full length 3 Kb promoter At least three specific protein DNA complexes are formed in EMSA using the CD5X oligonucleotides We speculate that proteins binding to the CD5X region may interact with other upstream transcription factors e g Ets 1 rather than with proteins binding to the CD5Y region This interaction we suggest acts to stabilize a transcriptional competent complex and thereby to increase the CD5 expression to normal levels This suggestion underlies the model proposed in figure 6 for regulating CD5 expression in T cells In this model the CD5Y region sets up the basal transcription machinery by interacting with components in the RNA polymerase II transcription complex and or with transcription initiators since CD5 lacks a TATA box for establishing a typical RNA polymerase II trancription initiation complex The CD5X region recruits transcription factors to the upstream 43 bp region identified as necessary for overall CD5 expression The proteins binding to the CD5X region in this model recruit Ets 1 protein and perhaps other Ets family members to the Ets binding site Alternatively these proteins help to alleviate the internal Ets 1 inhibition domains and stabilize the binding of Ets 1 to its cognitive site 33 34 45 In any event they facilitate the interaction of Ets 1 with other factors to form activate transcription and increase it from the basal to the overall level Our studies here focus on characterizing the promoter elements responsible for regulating the constitutive CD5 expression in unstimulated T cells These elements we have shown exist in a region proximal to the translation start and quite distant from an enhancer element shown in other studies 46 47 48 to regulate the activation of CD5 expression in BCR stimulated LPS induced B cell blasts This enhancer element located at approximately 2 kb upstream of the translation start on the CD5 promoter is dependent on NF AT activation to induce CD5 expression in anti IgM stimulated primary splenic cells cultured with LPS for 3 days 48 It is reported to interact with proteins in the proximal region of the CD5 promoter which contains the all three regions characterized here An Ets binding site also has been implicated in the activity of the enhancer discussed above In addition this CD5 response to BCR stimulation has been shown to be mediated in part by vav 2 which activates of NF AT 49 Our studies with constitutive expression of CD5 on B cells are still in progress However preliminary evidence suggests that unlike the stimulated CD5 expression in these other studies the low level constitutive expression of CD5 on the M12 B cell line is enabled by the same 43 bp regulatory region that we have shown here is sufficient to induce full constitutive CD5 expression on T cells Materials and Methods Plasmids The reporter constructs were created as follows The 3 kb genomic fragment upstream of the CD5 translation start was excised by restriction digest with HindIII and NcoI from p12 1 32 a

restriction enzymes blunted with Klenow DNA polymerase and then cloned into pGL2Basic luciferase reporter plasmid The resulting deletion reporter plasmids were further modified by mutating the blunted
