 Background DNA microarray experiments have huge potential for screening for gene expression of relevance in particular contexts However the output of such an experiment is often just a list of fold changes in gene expression levels and so researchers face the question of whether their hits can be trusted or not In the absence of any knowledge of what to expect most researchers simply draw a line at a given fold change and examine whatever is above it The largest fold changes in highly expressed genes can usually be trusted However because the correct fold change limit typically shifts with decreasing intensity of expression a fixed fold change line is inadequate in the range of expression levels where most genes actually lie Most papers reporting microarray experiments cut off their candidate lists in essentially arbitrary ways at the level that the researchers feel comfortable with rather than on the basis of statistics Here we present an easy but sound recipe for quantifying statistical significance based on careful statistical characterization of a large dataset of GeneChip experiments A particular feature of GeneChip arrays is that each transcript is probed by many short snippets of sequence instead of a single longer probe as in cDNA arrays 1 2 3 Therefore translating the measured probe intensities into a global gene intensity or ratio score requires a composite scoring function In principle the redundancy in the probes offers a way to reduce the noise level for each gene on the other hand finding the best estimator is difficult and it is likely that the variability in probe behavior will prevent a single estimator from being optimal in all cases Studying the raw data reveals its great complexity and the hybridization processes underlying the measured perfect match PM versus single mismatch MM intensities prove hard to interpret physically The principal difficulties stem first from the large number of probes with MM intensities higher than the corresponding PM and therefore not conforming to the usual hybridization picture and second from the very broad intensity distributions within each probe set The first task is therefore to design a method that can robustly handle such input data Second once reliable measures for differential expression from two experiments are obtained one would like to measure their significance level It is now widely accepted that such measures should be derived in an intensity dependent fashion 4 5 6 7 8 There are at least two independent sources of variability to be considered first the intrinsic noise levels related to the technology type I noise which includes noise components introduced by the enzymatic step used in the cRNA preparation see Materials and methods and the fluorescence measurement scan and second the variability encountered in biological replicates Previous studies have addressed significance issues in both cDNA and GeneChip arrays they have discussed significance according to intrinsic noise levels 4 5 or focused on variability in replicates only 6 7 or considered both simultaneously 8 High density oligonucleotide microarrays HDONAs are composed of 25 base oligonucleotide probes synthesized and attached to a glass matrix by photolithographic techniques As such a short oligonucleotide sequence would not give sufficiently specific hybridization alone GeneChip uses 14 20 different oligonucleotides to probe each transcript and each comes in two versions the PM probe and the MM probe In the latter the central base has been substituted by its complement and this probe is intended to control for nonspecificity The pairs PM MM are called probe pairs and the full set of probes for a given gene is called a probe set The standard picture used to interpret the hybridization is based on the following model 2 9 10 PM I S I NS B MM 1 I S I NS B where PM MM is the observed brightness I S the contribution from specific complementary binding I NS the amount from nonspecific binding and B a background of physical origin that is the photodetector dark current or light reflections from the scanning process The proper technique for estimating the background and its fluctuations is discussed in 11 Then thought to be positive reflects the loss of binding due to a single substitution and are the susceptibilities for nonspecific binding In the ideal case which is usually assumed and therefore the subtraction PM MM 1 I S is directly proportional to the desired signal However the susceptibility can be strongly varying within a given probe set We shall focus on the following two aspects of GeneChip data analysis first we describe a method to evaluate ratio scores and associated quality measures In this step we shall relax the assumption that and consider either the PM probes only or the usual PM MM subtraction These cases were chosen to bracket the extremes of an ideally performing MM probe and a poor MM Second we use the assigned ratio scores and show how one can with moderate effort attribute a significance level to differentially expressed genes Our approach is somewhat similar to that described in 8 in the sense that it relies on an empirical characterization of the noise envelope and is more distantly related to that described in 5 Both these approaches were developed and applied in the context of cDNA arrays see Materials and methods for a discussion of the difference between our method and 8 Results Relations between single gene measurements Figures 1and 2show the general trends in the relations between the ratio measurements and their quality measures for both the PM and PM MM cases We look at a collection of 12 Mu11KsubA chips hybridized to mRNA extracts from different mouse brain regions see Materials and methods There are 66 internal pairwise comparisons possible for each of the 6 595 genes We randomly picked 120 000 ratios out of the possible 435 270 for plotting these figures For the purpose of the present discussion we believe the trends are well captured by the set of ratios shown we picked this dataset because compared with other datasets we studied the ratios span a relatively large dynamic range The arrays were locally normalized as explained in Materials and methods The main observation is that the three quantities the log ratio LR the standard error SE and the Wilcoxon rank sign test p value show little correlation with each other and therefore represent relatively independent indicators see Materials and methods for the precise definitions The lines indicating a signal to noise ratio of 1 clearly show that the vast majority of the measurements are well defined especially for the larger log ratios The behavior of SE when the number of probes N good retained for deriving the ratio score is small as indicated by the colored dots is well understood in terms of the number of residuals considered in the LTS method that is genes with N good 1 necessarily have SE 0 The only obvious correlation is that small p values are not compatible with LR 0 as shown by the valley along LR 0 in the contour plots of LR versus p It is however possible to achieve very small p values for tiny fold changes as small as 1 1 The PM and PM MM methods show very similar features overall the biggest difference being that p values tend to be larger for large LRs in the PM MM which reflects the overall smaller number of N good probes usable in that method there are more probes lying below background after the subtraction The difference in the log ratios from the PM and PM MM methods is illustrated in Figure 3 Although there is a branch with LR 0 from the PM method when all p values are considered this branch rapidly disappears when focusing at smaller p values only Cases where the PM and PM MM scores indicate regulation in opposite directions are virtually absent when p 0 05 However one can see a compression effect in the scores from the PM method shown by the edges with slope 1 near the regions indicated by the arrows in the bottom right panel this can also be seen by comparing the upper two contour plots of Figures 1and 2 This compression probably reflects cross hybridization effects that are not corrected for in the PM only method However if one is more interested in finding significant changes than in the LR values themselves the determining quantity is the LR value divided by the width of the local noise Therefore compression in the scale is not dramatic as long as the noise envelope also shrinks see Discussion A comparison of the LR SE signal to noise ratio SN from both methods emphasizes the complementarity of both methods Figure 4 as there is clearly a similar fraction of genes that have poor SN ratios SN 2 in one case but acceptable ratios in the other These are found in the top left and bottom right quadrants defined by the horizontal and vertical blue lines We have shown previously 11 12 using the same Mu11K dataset that our PM only composite ratios lead to a reduction in variance especially at low intensities when compared to the Microarray Analysis Suite 3 2 available at that time Noise structure In Figure 5we show typical scatterplots with increasing levels of overall differential regulation from duplicates to strong regulation going from left to right Although these particular data are from a subset of the Mu11KsubA chips used for Figures 1and 2 our experience is that these are very typical of GeneChip hybridization data from numerous chip series We shall always refer to duplicates as experiments where the enzymatic steps see Protocols in Materials and methods in the target sample preparations have been performed independently In ideal terms the scatter cloud is thought of as consisting of two components one is just noise from the enzymatic and hybridization steps affecting all the genes the other reflects true sample differences To illustrate this we give three prototypical cases showing the data for the individual genes and the local variance regression lines Figure 5 In these the second component increases gradually from zero left most plot duplicates as visible in the quantile quantile QQ plots in Figure 5b The nearly straight left most QQ plot indicates that variable LR closely follows a normal distribution As the amount of true regulation increases longer tails develop that depart from normal behavior The fact that the noise component behaves as local log normal distributions is not dictated by the choice of the variable LR on the contrary it emerges as a rather pleasant feature of GeneChip experiments In Figure 6 we demonstrate that this log normality occurs very systematically we show the two best and two worst judged by the linearity of the QQ plots and the amount of outliers from 40 human HG U95A duplicates collected in a study of rheumatoid arthritis see Materials and methods The majority of the cases look closer to the first two examples and the PM and PM MM methods lead to equally good log normal distributions overall The mean and variation in the local SD for both the PM and PM MM methods are shown in Figure 7and reflect the characteristic contraction of the noise envelope with increasing coordinates along the diagonal It is obvious that the PM noise envelope is thinner than that of the PM MM at low intensity on the other hand both methods lead to comparable local in the flat mid to high intensity domains where over half of the data lies There is approximately 0 15 so that 2 corresponds to a ratio of 2 0 3 1 25 so 95 of repeated measurements would fall within a factor of 1 25 of their mean Barring some artifact affecting large numbers of probes simultaneously we would expect then that approximately 95 of the measurements in the mid to high intensity range are reproducible within a factor of around 1 25 Discussion Our experience is that despite constant improvements current incarnations of the arrays still behave fairly inhomogeneously as far as their PM and MM hybridization properties are concerned This is probably the consequence of various sequence dependent effects first the difference in stacking energies of single stranded snippets between the PM and the MM sequences can easily be in the range of the gain in binding energies second there are certainly kinetic effects as the hybridizations are not carried to complete equilibrium and third there is always the possibility of sequence dependent synthesis efficiencies The wide range of probe set behavior is best seen in the SN ratios in Figure 4 For these reasons we believe that a safe way to proceed is to integrate the results from both PM only and PM MM methods For instance considering the intersection or union of genes predicted by either method would minimize the false positive or false negative rates In addition there seems to be a significant variation in the hybridization properties across different chip series as can be observed from simple statistics on the number of probe pairs with MM hybridizing better than PM see Results The superiority of the yeast chip mentioned above may of course be related to the relative simplicity of the yeast genome compared to that of the higher organisms Another point worth mentioning is that the values of the ratio scores may deviate from the real mRNA concentration ratios in some intensity regimes as the result of various effects such as non linearities in the probes binding affinities Evidence concerning this matter has recently been reported 13 This emphasizes the main point of our work namely the importance of measuring differential expression relative to the local noise only then can we decide whether a given ratio score can be considered as indicating true regulation or not Finally the question of handling significance across replicated experiments is a second step to be built on top of the analysis presented above The most reasonable approach would be to follow 7 namely to consider the t statistics of the expression ratios across the samples However one would also want to weight the average according to the noise content in each of the samples in a manner similar to that discussed in 8 Materials and methods Datasets and protocols Mul IKsubA chips hybridized to adult mouse brain extracts All six brain regions were obtained from adult 2 3 month old CD 1 mice Dissections were carried out in ice cold buffer and tissues were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen Total RNA was isolated Poly A RNA was then isolated with magnetic oligo dT beads For each brain region 1 g poly A RNA was converted to double stranded T7 cDNA Labeled cRNAs were produced from the double stranded cDNA libraries and hybridized to chips according to the Affymetrix protocol including the antibody amplification step All hybridizations were carried out in duplicate HG U95A chips hybridized to human blood extracts The same protocol was used except that no poly A isolation was done before the conversion to cDNA Regression of the log ratios SE To compute expression ratios for genes measured in two separate arrays let x i y i denote the brightness measurements for one probe set the index i ranges from 1 to the number of probe pairs for the particular probe set 14 20 depending on the chip series taken in the two different hybridization arrays X and Y We investigate both cases in which the intensities x i y i are either the intensities of the background subtracted PM cells or the PM MM values which need no background correction Only N good good probe pairs are retained for determining the ratio and associated quantities We discard probes that are saturated in both X and Y or probe pairs such that PM MM 3 or PM 3 in both X or Y Here corresponds to the standard deviation of the fluctuations in the background intensity Not considering such probes prevents contamination of the ratio estimates from noisy low intensity probes After identifying the probe pairs allowed into the analysis the differential expression score LR for the gene in question is obtained from a LTS robust regression of LR i log 2 x i y i to an intercept LR LTS regression corresponds to minimizing the sum of the Ns smallest squared residuals 14 15 We used the default Ns N good 2 1 and this parameter can be adjusted in our scripts however we found no evidence for changing the default An estimate of the standard error SE for is given by SE Composite absolute intensities for the gene in each experiment can be obtained via geometric means of the x i y i probes kept in the LTS regression however these are only indicative measures as the method was designed primarily for expression ratios Wilcoxon statistics number of cells used In addition to the SE which reports a quantitative estimate of the error in the log ratio measurement it is also instructive to report a p value from a paired Wilcoxon rank sign test of the LR i values Casually speaking this value is related to the portion of the probes indicating gene regulation in the same direction the theoretical minimum p value p min is achieved when all probe ratios agree on the same direction of regulation Moreover the test is non parametric as it is operating in rank space and p therefore also incorporates information about the number of probe pairs used N good Namely the Wilcoxon p value has a lower bound that decreases with increasing sample size For instance p min 1 4 for N good 3 and 1 8 for N good 4 so that small p scores can only be reached when enough probes are used However the converse is not true as a gene that is not differentially expressed can have a p value that is close to 1 even if all the probe pairs are good in the above sense Our method does not primarily aim at quantifying the presence or absence of a gene in a particular sample Nevertheless we report the number of probes N above with intensity larger than 3 eff eff for the PM MM case for both samples X and Y Using enough data one could compute a probability of presence depending on N above and it is likely that this calibration would be dependent on the chip series Normalization and noise characterization The measures described above are all single gene properties they can be computed when given just the intensities gathered for a single gene In contrast correcting for systematic trends also called data massage and more important classifying expression ratios according to their significance requires measures that involve the entire gene population on the arrays We stress that these techniques are meaningful only when the number of genes probed is sufficiently large and under the assumption that a large fraction of them does not show differential regulation between the two tested samples These requirements are usually met in GeneChip experiments Normalization aims at correcting for systematic trends that is bias as a result of dye efficiencies and amplification sample concentration photodetector efficiency so as to make a collection of arrays directly comparable One must distinguish global from local normalization in the first the intensities of all the probes on the array are scaled by a constant factor in the second the normalization factor can be intensity dependent Local normalization techniques are mostly discussed in the context of cDNA arrays 16 17 where the intensity dependence can be severe HDONAs suffer less from bent noise structures nevertheless local normalization has also been introduced for them 18 19 Although attractive local normalization should not be applied blindly as it can hide real failures in the data and create its own artifacts Our approach to normalization is based on centering the log ratio distribution either globally or locally as in 16 For the data presented in the Results section local normalization was used however our scripts allow a choice between the local and global schemes see Additional data files for scripts We always normalize an array with respect to another one and we found it more accurate to do so at the gene rather than the probe level we normalize the composite ratio scores a posteriori instead of normalizing the raw probe intensities Turning to the noise structure significance of regulation is quantified from a local robust regression of the variable LR 2versus 77 where LR log I X I Y is the log ratio of the intensities and log I X I Y 2 is half the log product I X and I Y denote the locally normalized intensities of the genes in channels X and Y We should emphasize that estimating the local variance in this manner only makes sense after the arrays have been locally normalized The function then quantifies the local log ratio variance so that the local SD is given by We used the R routine loess for the fitting 15 The justification for using the local SD as a criterion for significance relies upon the empirical fact that the variable LR follows a good normal distribution in the case of replicate pure noise experiments see Figure 6 The significance of a ratio score can therefore be assessed using the value LR SD that is a value LR SD 2 implies that the null hypothesis that the gene is not regulated can be rejected with a 95 confidence level We finally comment on the precise differences between our approach and that in 8 First we found no evidence for the inclusion of an additive term in linear coordinates Judging by the data the noise structure is very well captured by an effective multiplicative model see Results Second the multiplicative noise component is estimated in logarithmic coordinates instead of linear and after a local normalization Finally we estimate the local scale in the noise by an empirical robust fit of the local variance with no a priori model While it would be satisfactory to have a physical model describing the noise our experience is that it is very hard to formulate one that accounts for the observed structure in all cases Additional data files Scripts for converting between file types are available with this article cdf2psc cel2ratios cel2raw raw2pcel see explanatory filefor more details and at
