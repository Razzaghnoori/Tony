 Giving Your All CARE is a noble organization that fights starvation It would like your support The American Cancer Society is a noble organization that fights disease It would like your support too Here s my advice If you re feeling very charitable give generously but don t give to both of them Giving to either agency is a choice attached to a clear moral judgment When you give 100 to CARE you assert that CARE is worthier than the cancer society Having made that judgment you are morally bound to apply it to your next 100 donation Giving 100 to the cancer society tomorrow means admitting that you were wrong to give 100 to CARE today You might protest that you diversify because you don t know enough to make a firm judgment about where your money will do the most good But that argument won t fly Your contribution to CARE says that in your best though possibly flawed judgment and in view of the admittedly incomplete information at your disposal CARE is worthier than the cancer society If that s your best judgment when you shell out your first 100 it should be your best judgment when you shell out your second 100 When it comes to managing your personal portfolio economists will tell you to diversify When it comes to handling the rest of your life we give you exactly the same advice It s a bad idea to spend all your leisure time playing golf you ll probably be happier if you occasionally watch movies or go sailing or talk to your children So why is charity different Here s the reason An investment in Microsoft can make a serious dent in the problem of adding some high tech stocks to your portfolio now it s time to move on to other investment goals Two hours on the golf course makes a serious dent in the problem of getting some exercise maybe it s time to see what else in life is worthy of attention But no matter how much you give to CARE you will never make a serious dent in the problem of starving children The problem is just too big behind every starving child is another equally deserving child That is not to say that charity is futile If you save one starving child you have done a wonderful thing regardless of how many starving children remain It is precisely because charity is so effective that we should think seriously about where to target it and then stay focused once the target is chosen People constantly ignore my good advice by contributing to the American Heart Association the American Cancer Society CARE and public radio all in the same year as if they were thinking OK I think I ve pretty much wrapped up the problem of heart disease now let s see what I can do about cancer But such delusions of grandeur can t be very common So there has to be some other reason why people diversify their giving I think I know what that reason is You give to charity because you care about the recipients or you give to charity because it makes you feel good to give If you care about the recipients you ll pick the worthiest and bullet concentrate your efforts But if you care about your own sense of satisfaction you ll enjoy pointing to 10 different charities and saying I gave to all those Here s a thought experiment for charitable diversifiers Suppose you plan to give 100 to CARE today and 100 to the American Cancer Society tomorrow Suppose I mention that I plan to give 100 to CARE today myself Do you say Oh then I can skip my CARE contribution and go directly on to the American Cancer Society I bet not But if my 100 contribution to CARE does not stop you from making CARE your first priority then why should your 100 contribution to CARE today stop you from making CARE your first priority tomorrow Apparently you believe that your 100 is somehow more effective or more important than my 100 That s either a delusion of grandeur or an elevation of your own desire for satisfaction above the recipients need for food We have been told on reasonably high authority that true charity vaunteth not itself it is not puffed up You can puff yourself up with thank you notes from a dozen organizations or you can be truly charitable by concentrating your efforts where you believe they will do the most good Early in this century the eminent economist Alfred Marshall offered this advice to his colleagues When confronted with an economic problem first translate into mathematics then solve the problem then translate back into English and burn the mathematics I am a devotee of Marshall s and frequently follow his advice But in this instance I want to experiment with a slight deviation Rather than burn the mathematics I will make it available as a link I propose to establish the following proposition If your charitable contributions are small relative to the size of the charities and if you care only about the recipients as opposed to caring say about how many accolades you receive then you will bullet all your contributions on a single charity That s basically a mathematical proposition which I have translated into English in this column If you want to see exactly what was gained or lost in translation and if you remember enough of your freshman calculus to read the original then
