 Happy Birthday Heritage Foundation Next month marks the 25 th anniversary of the Heritage Foundation the biggest and best known of the conservative think tanks The festivities began a few weeks ago with a black tie gala for 1 700 at which Margaret Thatcher spoke on the topic of Courage Ronald Reagan and I refused to accept the decline of the West as our ineluctable destiny Thatcher declared displaying her usual modesty and sense of fun The revelries are to continue for two full years with a traveling lecture series featuring such speakers as William Bennett who will orate in Oklahoma City about Truth and Clarence Thomas who will address the people of Palm Beach on the subject of Character Another vast dinner in Washington will cap the series and Heritage s 85 million fund raising drive To commemorate the occasion the foundation also has sponsored a gushing account of its first quarter century The Power of Ideas by Lee Edwards The book s title is incongruous since the whole point of the Heritage Foundation is that ideas alone have little power without a big push By all measures Heritage has much to celebrate From across the political spectrum opinion appears to be unanimous that the organization has been singularly effective in accomplishing its mission of dragging American politics to the right Since the 1980 release of its Mandate for Leadership a detailed program for the incoming Reagan administration that the Reagan administration actually took seriously Heritage has played a central role in setting not only the broad conservative agenda but also the details of legislation Edwards book delights in quoting envious encomia from the enemy camp Michael Shuman of the left wing Institute for Policy Studies credits Heritage with a bigger influence on American politics and policy than any other conservative institution Will Marshall president of the New Democratic Progressive Policy Institute says Heritage wrote the book on how to market and popularize political ideas The Nation among others keeps up a steady drumbeat on this theme Why doesn t the left have an advocacy organization as influential as Heritage Well why not The most obvious explanation is money A right wing advocacy tank like Heritage is able to raise much more than its liberal counterparts for the same reason that Republican candidates out raise Democratic ones Those who have a lot to give corporations and rich individuals give primarily in their own self interest And unlike political candidates organizations like Heritage can accept donations directly from corporate treasuries Self interested money goes to organizations that promote lower taxes and less regulation two topics on which Heritage is absolutely unflinching To be sure there is disinterested conservative money and self interested liberal money such as the union funds that go to the Economic Policy Institute a think tank that opposes free trade agreements But such exceptions don t change the rule The Brookings Institution often cast as Heritage s liberal counterpart could never dream of raising 85 million in two years In fact Brookings isn t really Heritage s liberal counterpart Though it has historically exhibited a modest liberal slant diminished in recent years Brookings thinks of itself as a scholarly institution devoted to objective research into public policy It would never spend its money in an explicit effort to harm its political foes because it does not conceive of itself as taking a side and does not view politics as ideological warfare This is even more true of the big liberal foundations such as Ford Rockefeller and MacArthur New Right conservatives on the other hand as exemplified by Heritage are quite explicit about viewing politics as combat In the words of Heritage s president Ed Feulner We conduct warfare in the battle of ideas Washington exerts a strong moderating influence and Feulner has been attacked in recent years for going establishment wanting to be prestigious and respected like Brookings instead of being powerful and feared This is the same fault Heritage attacked the American Enterprise Institute for in the 1970s But even if it has settled down a bit Heritage still retains an insurgent mindset It views itself as the center of a radical movement even if it has become part of an entrenched Washington establishment Because of its combat mentality Heritage has never been a place with very high standards Like other conservative outfits it loves the lingo of academic life Its hallways are cluttered with endowed chairs visiting fellows and distinguished scholars The conceit here is that as a PC Dark Age has overcome the universities conservative think tanks have become the refuge of thought and learning At Heritage in particular this is a laugh AEI and the Manhattan Institute frequently produce stimulating books and studies and occasionally arrive at unexpected positions Even the more dogmatic Cato Institute has cultivated a reputation for rigorous research and analysis from a libertarian point of view Heritage however is essentially a propaganda mill There are exceptions Stuart Butler a Brit who runs the domestic policy shop has done solid work on enterprise zones and took pains to develop a conscientious conservative alternative to the Clinton health care plan But on the whole Heritage is focused on selling and promoting its views rather than on developing thoughtful or nuanced ones It spends nearly half its 29 million annual budget on marketing It prides itself on producing reports with concision and speed According to Edwards one recent innovation is the colored index card summarizing a conservative position in short punchy sentences According to Heritage s Vice president for information marketing these cards have been wildly successful with Republicans in Congress Its ethical standards are as lax as its intellectual ones Heritage is a tax exempt 501 c 3 organization which means it is not supposed to lobby Congress Edwards notes that a disclaimer appears at the foot of all its publications Nothing written here is to be construed as an attempt to aid or hinder the passage of any bill before Congress This is an evident absurdity Heritage exists to aid and hinder legislation before Congress and often boasts about doing so Edwards quotes the Heritage disclaimer immediately after he finishes explaining that Feulner and Paul Weyrich founded Heritage because in the early 1970s AEI was taking its tax exempt status too seriously Having been investigated by the Internal Revenue Service AEI didn t focus on getting its reports into the hands of members of Congress before the relevant votes For whatever reason liberal groups tend to be more punctilious about this Many are split between two organizations a 501 c 3 to which contributions are tax deductible and a 501 c 4 which is simply not taxable itself and which has more latitude in lobbying This reduces the amount liberal groups can raise enhancing their natural disadvantage At bottom the big liberal think tanks remain temperamentally different from the likes of Heritage They have their vices to be sure They can be ponderous conventional and gimmicky and miraculously sometimes all three at once But you can t see the Twentieth Century Fund feeding policy popcorn to Democrats in Congress They d be insulted by the idea It s hard to imagine the Progressive Policy Institute naming a Vice president for information marketing You can t conceive of Brookings putting out a volume of self serving bluster like the Edwards book In fact Brookings did commission a history for its 75 th anniversary in 1991 It was serious critical and self questioning in a way that is totally alien to the Heritage Foundation Though Democrats have become better in recent years at suppressing their differences in favor of their common interests they still shy away instinctually from a united front of the kind that Heritage is Liberals say they want to learn from the most successful organization on the right But in reality they re more comfortable and probably better off wishing the Heritage Foundation a happy birthday and admiring it from afar
