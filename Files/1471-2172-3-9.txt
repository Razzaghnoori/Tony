 Background The in vitro culture of human peripheral blood lymphocytes in IL 2 results in the generation of cytotoxic cells that lyse tumor targets Natural Killer NK cells are the main lymphocytic population constitutively expressing p75 chain of the IL 2 receptor and exhibiting up regulation of LFA 1 Lymphocyte Function associated Antigen 1 molecule upon IL 2 stimulation Consequently incubation of peripheral blood lymphocytes with IL 2 induces selective activation of NK cells rapid increase of NK activity followed by generation of LAK activity and proliferation This has been referred to as the LAK phenomenon 1 Similarly IL 12 treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC or pure NK cells within a few hours induces an enhancement of cytotoxic ability It was observed that the maximum enhancement obtained with IL 12 is less than that obtained with IL 2 and comparable to that observed with IFN However IL 12 was found to be effective at concentrations 2 3 order of magnitude lower than IL 2 IFN Maximum enhancement of NK mediated cytotoxicity was observed with a combination of IL 12 and IL 2 the effect of the two cytokines together being additive 2 Another study revealed that cytokine stimulated NK cells use both granzyme Fas ligand pathways of apoptotic induction to mediate cytotoxicity 3 and it was found that IL 2 and IL 12 both increase induction in mRNA coding for perforin granzymes A and B 4 Hence the importance of both these cytokines in enhancing cytotoxicity cannot be overlooked However before this picture about the involvement of NK cells in LAK activity emerged there existed considerable controversy regarding the type of effector cells mediating this activity particularly concerning the relative contributions by the two lymphocyte populations NK Vs cytotoxic T cells 5 6 7 8 9 Experiments in which depletion of Asialo GM a glycolipid present on the surface of NK cells was carried out demonstrated that the generation of LAK cells followed by IL 2 stimulation was considerably reduced thereby confirming that the NK cells are the major contributors of LAK activity 10 Further studies with sorted pure populations of CD3 NK cells also showed that the LAK phenomenon is predominantly mediated by IL 2 activated NK cells Both precursor and effector cells of this activity were typically NK cells 11 Direct evidence that NK cells are the mediators of LAK activity came from Immunotransmission Electron microscopic studies using colloidal gold labeled antibodies in which CD16 positive cells were shown to extend their protrusions deep into the target cells and it was found that the cytoplasmic granules and vacuoles of CD16 positive LAK cells were concentrated in the area of the binding site 12 With the advent of flowcytometry and immunophenotyping we thought we could approach this dilemma in a different but simple and straightforward manner Therefore we generated LAK cells by the method of Anita and Hersh 13 and carried out cytotoxicity experiments with the stimulated cells For our cytotoxicity experiments we used the U 937 cell line which are derived from human histiocytic lymphoma as tumor targets U937 cells share many surface markers and receptors with normal human monocytes and therefore express many monocyte like characteristics 14 15 16 17 Concurrently we also assessed the changes in the phenotypic characteristics by flowcytometry Flowcytometry is a powerful tool that allows one to study not only freshly isolated lymphocytes but also cells that have been cultured in Vitro and allowed to proliferate in the presence of stimulating factors This helps to qualitatively as well as quantitatively assess the phenotypic nature of the proliferating cells in Vitro In the present study our aim was to find out the relative contributions of cells of different phenotypes to spontaneous cytotoxicity and study the effect of long term in vitro stimulation of cytokines on mixed lymphocyte cultures Results A study was undertaken to see the effect of IL 2 and or IL 12 stimulation on a long term basis and correlate the phenotypic changes of the proliferating population corresponding to their cytotoxic abilities after in vitro culture of the peripheral blood lymphocytes LAK cells were generated as described At regular time points the cells were harvested The chromium release cytotoxic assay was performed by the standard procedure and compared with the corresponding phenotypic characteristics of the cells by flowcytometry A dot plot was generated to gate for the cells after stimulation A representative dot plot of unstimulated and stimulated cells is shown in Figure 1 In the Figures 2to 7 the line graph represents percentage 51Cr release values indicating the percentage NK cytotoxicity at different time points in response to different stimuli The bar diagrams indicate the corresponding phenotypic characteristics of the cells as assessed by flowcytometry The total cells were analysed after appropriately applying the gate on the corresponding dot plots It can be seen that IL 2 at 50 U 10 6cells is very effective in inducing proliferation of NK cells simultaneously augmenting cytotoxicity Figure 3 The percentage of NK cells blue bar rises from a basal value of 12 3 of the total lymphocytes on day zero to 50 5 of the total lymphocytes on day 14 Simultaneously percentage cytotoxicity line graph also rises from a basal value of 12 7 4 2 on day zero to 86 7 1 on day 14 concurring with the increase in NK cells When IL 2 at a concentration of 50 U 10 6cells was added along with IL 12 at a concentration of 125 U 10 6cells there was an increase of NK phenotype up to 47 5 2 on day 11 and a corresponding maximum NK activity of 91 6 5 Figure 5 Equally impressive augmentation of NK activity was seen even at lower concentrations of IL 2 and IL 12 in combination At IL 2 concentration of 5 U 10 6cells along with IL 12 concentration of 25 U 10 6cells there was an increase of NK phenotype up to 35 3 1 on day 9 and a corresponding maximum NK activity of 60 9 4 Figure 4 But when IL 2 alone was added at the same low concentration percentage of NK cells is only 9 4 2 2 on day 7 corresponding to maximum NK activity of only 35 3 9 Figure 2 However IL 12 by itself at concentrations of 25 U or 125 U 10 6cells is unable to cause neither an increase in the NK phenotype nor in their cytotoxic ability Figure 6 7 From Figures 2 3 4 5 6 7it is evident that initially on day 2 even though there is a transient increase in the CD56 ve T cells green bars up to 25 45 the corresponding increase in the chromium release values against U937 target cells is negligible even at a high dose of IL 2 In contrast at later time points when the cytotoxicity goes up to 86 91 there are very few CD56 T cells as compared to the NK cell phenotype The proportion of T cells red bars also has no bearing on the NK activity Discussion Following low dose IL 2 treatment in leprosy patients NK cell numbers were found to increase 6 fold and IL 2 therapy of HIV patients resulted in enhanced NK and LAK cell activity in vitro 18 IL 2 subcutaneously given resulted in in vivo expansion of CD16 positive NK cells to very large numbers which showed LAK activity and ADCC Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity in vitro 19 In view of the above mentioned and other reports available in literature a pilot study was undertaken to see the effect of IL 2 and or IL 12 stimulation on a long term basis and study the phenotypic changes corresponding to the cytotoxic changes after in vitro culture of the peripheral blood lymphocytes The results obtained from these long term stimulation studies have thrown up interesting points for debate The phenotypic analysis of the PBMC cultured in the presence of IL 2 and or IL 12 from 0 to 14 days has brought to light that there is a gradual increase in the percentage of NK cells suggesting that these cells constitute the predominant cell population in these cultures This observation is consistent with the results of others where they have shown an increase up to 73 of NK cells on day 9 in response to IL 2 and IL 12 20 Even at low concentrations when IL 2 is added along with IL 12 it is able to cause substantial increase in NK cell proliferation and activity Figure 4 comparable to the effect seen when IL 2 is added alone at higher concentrations Figure 3 Hence the two cytokines together appear to have an additive effect as reported by other workers 21 The most striking observation from our experiments is that it provides clear evidence that the CD56 T cells contribute little to cytotoxic activity against the U937 target cell line It is seen from the figures 2 3 4 5 6 7 that when NK cell number increases the NK activity also increases Initially on day 2 even though there is a transient increase in the CD56 T cell population a corresponding increase in the chromium release values is not observed at a low dose of IL 2 figure 2 and only a very marginal increase is seen at a higher dose of IL 2 figure 3 although the CD56 positive T cells are more than double the basal level In contrast at later time points when the cytotoxicity goes up to 86 91 there are very few CD56 positive T cells as compared to the NK cell phenotype reaffirming that it is the NK phenotype that is mostly responsible for the spontaneous killing of U 937 tumor targets Similar studies have been carried out using other tumor targets such as K562 COLO WILMS MELANOMA and P815 Some researchers have reported the ability of CD56 positive T cells to exhibit spontaneous killing against some of the targets such as K562 or P815 upon stimulation with IL 2 22 23 24 25 However Lanier and Philips who carried out extensive studies on the LAK phenomenon have emphasised that although CD16 T cells exhibit non MHC restricted cytotoxicity to some targets upon IL 2 stimulation their contribution was quantitatively and qualitatively very minimal as compared to the NK subset 7 11 The differences in the ability of lymphocytes of different phenotypes to respond to IL 2 stimulation and carry out spontaneous lysis of different targets could probably be attributed to the differential expression of inhibitory receptors present on the targets such as KIR and CD94 NKG2 26 Another important observation is that IL 12 by itself at concentrations of 25 U or 125 U 10 6cells is unable to cause neither an increase in the Natural Killer phenotype nor in their cytotoxic ability Figure 6 7 This is in agreement with the reported literature where it has been reported that IL 12 can act only on pre stimulated cells and has little or no effect on resting lymphocytes 27 IL 12 is a cytokine produced to some degree by B lymphocytes but mostly by phagocytic cells including monocytes macrophages neutrophils epidermal cells keratinocytes and dendritic cells which are among the first cells to encounter a foreign antigen during infection in response to bacteria bacterial products intracellular parasites etc 2 It was found that IL 12 induced directional migration of highly enriched preparations of NK cells and CD3 activated cells but not resting T cells and monocytes When NK cells were treated overnight with IL 12 they showed augmented binding to epithelial cells EC by the LFA ICAM pathways Thus by inducing migration and interaction with EC IL 12 regulates crucial determinants of NK cell recruitment in tissues 20 It is believed that IL 12 plays an instrumental role in tilting the immune response in favor of T helper type 1 by generation of Th1 cells and consequently initiates CMI 28 Since IL 12 enhances cytotoxicity and augments proliferation by antigen specific T cells and NK cells IL 12 may facilitate antigen specific and nonspecific cytotoxic immune defense against intracellular pathogens such as M tuberculosis An intriguing property of IL 12 is its capacity to induce proliferation by cytolytic T cell only upon co stimulation with antigen IL 12 may thus be a candidate to control the cytolytic arm of initial immune response to pathogens by inducing expansion of cytotoxic T cell only when antigen is encountered 29 The biologic significance of the multiplicity of cytokines which can stimulate the proliferation of T and NK cells is unclear It may be that the various lymphokine growth factors are differentially produced at different time points during the ontogeny of the immune system at different stages in the development of an immune response or at different sites within the body or lymphoid tissues 30 Our studies have confirmed the importance of multiple cytokine stimulation of lymphocytes and how NK cells are crucial to the development of spontaneous cytotoxicity and are the major contributors to LAK activity in vitro when U 937 cells were used as targets The use of flowcytometry to understand the in vitro effects of cytokine stimulation makes one s task easier as studies can be carried out on mixed lymphocyte populations Conclusions The use of flowcytometry as a tool in correlating the functional capacity of various subpopulations of mixed lymphocyte cultures to their phenotype has been demonstrated A study was undertaken to correlate the phenotypic changes corresponding to the cytotoxic potential of human peripheral blood lymphocytes after long term in vitro stimulation with IL 2 and IL 12 cytokines As reported in literature flowcytometric evidence also pointed to the fact that double positive cells constituting the cytotoxic T cells contribute little to Lymphokine Activated Killer activity reaffirming that in a mixed lymphocyte culture it is the NK phenotype that is responsible for the spontaneous killing of tumor targets Thus flowcytometry can be easily applied to situations where one needs to quickly understand the phenotypic changes with respect to their corresponding functional capacity in response to various stimulants or inhibitory agents even on mixed cells populations Materials and Methods Media and reagents RPMI 1640 culture medium was supplemented with 5 heat
