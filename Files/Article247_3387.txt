 Puzzling Over the Internet IPO Glut For the moment the carnage in the Internet and technology sector seems to have ended Although today belonged almost entirely to real technology companies like Cisco which I own shares of and Intel Net stocks didn t really lose ground and a few most notably America Online had strong upward moves So while the days of 15 or 20 point moves up may be gone perhaps forever the days of forced margin calls and panic selling seem to be temporarily behind us as well Even as the Nasdaq and much of the rest of the market has been decimated over the past couple of weeks I haven t written anything about it because I didn t think there was anything interesting to add When you combine rising interest rates concerns about inflation and a market that had priced in a lot of good news you shouldn t be surprised when high priced stocks take a hit As for Net stocks in particular they offer no solace to the scared investor who looks for reassurance when bad things like last week s eBay outage or the rumor about Microsoft offering free Net access happen There are no profits with again the exception of AOL and no long track records and in recent months there s even been talk that Net usage is seasonal slow in the summer The fundamental irony about Net stocks after all is that investing in them is an investment in the future and a future that s really still years away But most of the people investing in them appear to have time horizons that extend no further than the end of the week if they re lucky That s an incredibly unstable combination More substantively the Internet sector and arguably tech stocks in general has been hurt by the sheer number of new companies going public This week 43 IPOs were supposed to be priced which is simply a staggering number Pick up any Monday New York Times from the past month and check out the equity offerings this week column and you ll be astonished at least I always am at how many companies are trying to tap the public markets in a time of relative weakness A lot has been written on the effect of this IPO glut on stock prices But the more interesting question is why a company would want to go public right now After all IPOs are breaking through their offering prices that is closing the first day of trading below where they were initially sold and all the high flyers of the last year iVillage TheStreet com Marketwatch TheGlobe com have been crushed in the past few months On top of that it s August traditionally the worst month to go public and a bad month to do anything in the market since so many traders are on vacation So why rush
