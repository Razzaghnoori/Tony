        kind of options do you have in your work     uh as far as other than salary like the fringe benefits um  we get of course insurance paid  we get our sick leave and and holidays paid   umhum thats nice   uh earn vacation and uh of course the work place is is uh very uh its a very nice area to work in   umhum   um how about you   well we dont get much   you dont   no we dont um we have to pay for our own insurance   umhum   and we you know we do get the vacation but we dont get sick pay until weve been there a year   umhum   and then um i think it starts after four days   umhum   if youve been gone five consecutive days then you get one day of sick pay   umhum   and uh um its real tough   the   for benefits   the sick leave is according according to the status the way youre employed it has something to with the the way you earn your sick leave and uh you dont automatically get it   uhhuh   depends on your status   right   uh but uh really cant complain course the cost of uh living keeps going up salaries remain about the same and your medical benefits go up also   thats the truth uhhuh if you can get some good medical benefits it makes a big difference   it it surely does especially if you have a family   umhum right   i dont but i know when you have children   and you dont umhum   it can get to be quite expensive   yeah i dont have any children but i do have my husband gets um insurance paid through his company   umhum   but its still cheaper for me to pay for mine through my job than it is to get onto his   is that right   umhum   gee i i didnt realize that   so until hes been there a little longer then maybe i can you know get into that   uhhuh   but a little better but um   uhhuh   right now   well do you think then salary is the most important   no i really dont i really think that benefits   okay   um help out a lot   umhum   you know with the positions um uh benefits you know like you said are are almost better you know thats a lot of pay   thats true   if you thought if you think about health because i think my husband and i went to um get health insurance from an outside agency once   umhum   and it would cost just me alone two hundred dollars a month   yes   to get basic health insurance and if you think about that on top of your pay it makes a big difference   i know that my parents recently retired well not recently maybe the last six eight years   umhum   and uh they had to uh buy a policy until something kicked in at a certain age and they were paying an enormous amount of money per month   uhhuh it is unbelievable   in order to maintain it really is   and then my mom and dad have that Blue Blue Cross Blue Shield and i think that goes up every month   umhum oh yeah   that is just something else   umhum   because theyre you know at the retirement age and   right   and thats something too thats just unbelievable   i know some of the companies when you do retire youre able to carry forward your retire your insurance benefits   oh well that would be great   wouldnt that be wonderful   that would be nice  yes it would     but uh i dont know i dont know what else would there be besides your insurance and your holiday paid and   yeah my my husband gets uh life insurance dental insurance and um life and dental and and health   yeah   and then he also gets legal help legal aid   oh uhhuh   and he also gets like hes entered into a credit union and   oh yeah we have that   and and all that that kind of helps out   uh now thats true now weve started the EA where you can um if you have like a mental health problem   uhhuh   a drug problem or what have you uh mentally they they will provide services for that now too and thats wonderful uh   well thats nice umhum my my sister where she works has the HMO   oh yes uhhuh   which is something thats you know its nice but you know its great because you pay five dollars and you go   umhum   and and your medicine is five dollars but if its not an emergency you wait three months   is that right well   to get in umhum that is um trying to think which one that is but im not its a real popular one   hum is it like Cigna or   but um Kaiser Kaiser   Kaiser   yes   well we have that option at at work uh to choose that or to stay with our our company   uhhuh umhum   that uh TI has desired to administer the insurance program   uhhuh   but uh you can either go with the HMO or stay with with Aetna   umhum yeah i im going with Aetna   thats what im im staying with   well im just going to stay with the um you know i can go to my doctor i think i pay two hundred and fifty dollar deductible and thats it   umhum   but yeah because she you know was trying to get into like an eye doctor or something like that and if its not an emergency you wait for quite a while to get in   umhum well see now your eye doctors paid for through the HMO   yes yes   ours isnt well i dont know about the HMO but through Aetna it is not covered no   its not yeah my isnt either but through the HMO it is   oh thats interesting   and i think eyes and and about every doctor you could about
