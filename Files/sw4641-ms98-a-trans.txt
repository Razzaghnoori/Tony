       no you start    okay what are the benefits well i i mean i dont even consider like salary a real benefit it just its kind of a like a side thing im really here for you know working with lots of creative people is what i really like about my job umhum   well i think that im selfemployed and work in radio and uh for me really i dont have to be terribly concerned about uh benefits outside because i own my own company but uh the worst problem that i think uh out here is affecting people and i think would be the most positive job benefit is job security these days   thats true yeah yeah you dont you dont want to have worry about it you know if if youre worried you dont work as well   yeah its well it its a real problem out here because uh you know its hard to imagine that you know ten years ago i can remember where we really you know somebody would work for a local company here like Kodak or Xerox which are based here and uh theyd have that job for life      and you really didnt have to worry too much about that but ever since this Reagan Bush thing   i know   every single time theres you know the the first thing they do is they fire employees whenever theres a problem with the uh uh economy economy and clear out the employees and were losing more and more jobs and uh   and it just gets worse then people dont dont spend any money   yeah its its a real thats probably the biggest thing that i think people are looking for i uh put some things up in the Comp Dcom Telecom thing regularly about uh job security with the uh ATT employees and   right yeah i just i just noticed that yeah   the Communication Workers of America and im watching as that progresses more and more and it seems to me that were seeing a real problem with job security being the number one focus its no longer a question of salary or or perks it its just basic security to have that job   yeah i know i know exactly how you feel but i i also dont know you know how how can we get people to change it i mean it it kind of it kind of requires you know a company taking a risk and they dont want to do that   well i in  well i think maybe some incentives on the part of the government to retain employees uh versus downsizing really why were seeing that kind of downsizing is because of the uh increasing power of shareholders in the corporations of the country   thats true   whenever theres a uh problem with uh the economy or the stock value you know the first thing the stockholders want to see is well decrease costs which means cut employees   i know i mean our CEO is is you know quite frankly stated that you know were were here to make stockholders happy and thats not why im working here   yeah California is really starting to feel the effects i think of the uh downturn   oh definitely   you know you guys have been pretty insulated uh for some of the past ones it it hasnt hit as bad as it has out in the northeast here Rochesters luckily is a technology moving city i mean we have a lot of telecommunications and the like out here but   right   Buffalo and Pittsburgh and cities around here that were into mechanical and engineering and things like that steel mills theyre all gone theyre all in Mexico now    yeah were were just kind of like losing and it it just seems to be a snowball effect i mean  you know we keep losing more   well Cupertino seems to be one of the every single software company ever sees always sees Cupertino you know      so you guys at least dont have those kinds of you know the only problem software seems to be still a US strength versus hardware   right and it   but you know the again in the future were going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where were going to have job security i think being the biggest focus   yeah its things things arent that secure in software right now either i think its its kind of a cutthroat im also a im also a hardware manufacturer im at Apple so its like you know we we notice our product just becoming a commodity and thats really bad   well i heard Apple was remaking themselves into a consumer electronics company   were trying and if it works thats thatd be great for us but what about you know the rest of the industry    yeah well the hardware you know HDTV if we can keep control of that that looks like something that we could have good strengths on and there would be a lot of new jobs created   yeah although although we we go on that subject i i because i looked at HDTV uh but i i dont like standards that are on its still still on a fixed resolution which means itll be eventually outdated also   umhum well we im a home satellite dish owner and we have these arguments all the time about standards because of the video cipher of the scrambling system    umhum   in place and theres two separate arguments over whether we want should have an industry standard which many people can build equipment towards or whether we want to have a uh system where   everybodys separate    yeah its its a real serious serious problem in a situation of
