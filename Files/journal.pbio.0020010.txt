                            JSTOR is successful for reasons its founders did not intend Bill Bowens inspired        vision was of a solution to libraries evervoracious demands for space to house paper        volumes The idea was that libraries could save space by removing volumes available in        electronic format Few libraries have discarded the volumes digitised in JSTOR but many        libraries without the paper volumes have been able to offer their users access to the        important journal runs JSTOR has digitised Paper holdings have not decreased dramatically        but electronic holdings have increased So a spacesaving service became an access        service        As an access service JSTOR is a creation of its time Understandable though the        decision to use page images may have been eight years ago future userfriendly access        requires searching capabilities across fulltext which page images cannot supply        Likewise the decision to digitise the backruns of around now paper journals was a        bold decision at the time but the future for access to journal literature lies in        electronic versions of thousands rather than hundreds of titles both current and        retrospective When we reach that point JSTOR will still have a valued place in the        content on offer but it is difficult to see JSTOR providing thousands rather than a few        hundred titles Its technical solutions and financial models look dated as both        subscriptionbased and openaccess publishers improve their services to authors and to        readers As the number of journal articles accessible over the networks increases JSTOR        will be seen as a smallscale pioneer from which we learned valuable lessons        Roger Schonfeld ends his very detailed description of JSTOR with a chapter on Lessons        Learned many of which are relevant to current access initiatives The need for grant        funding to launch any such initiative has to be accompanied by a sound business plan to        ensure longterm economic viability JSTOR has achieved that transition and its success        provides a model for others Much of the credit must go to JSTORs enterprising president        Kevin Guthrie who found the quickest way through the maze of conflicting advicemuch of        which could have resulted in JSTORs reaching a deadendand convinced the library and        publishing communities to buy into a product that was only a promise Meeting user needs        for easy access to highquality content was the key to the fulfilment of that promise        JSTORs public image is of quality in depthlong runs of core journalsand that image has        to become the hallmark of the new openaccess initiatives as they develop        It is understandable that some mistakes were made on the way The difficulty that JSTOR        financial planning had in coming to terms with consortial purchases delayed its growth as        an access service Although selling to consortia of academic libraries may not have        improved JSTORs financial position in the shortterm consortia are a route to spreading        access and therefore securing longerterm financial stability as the major publishers have        realised through their Big Deals in selling hundreds of journals to hundreds of libraries        in a consortium Some opportunities were also delayednot lostthrough too slow an        adaptation of the JSTOR purchasing model for selling outside the United States the United        Kingdom being the exception The UK deal was with JISC the Joint Information Systems        Committee of the UK Higher Education Funding Councils acting more as a negotiating agent        than a consortium and this model could have been applied in other countries More        countries would have valued access to JSTOR earlier but the approach to nonUS deals had        to be imaginative For all vendors there has to be an understanding of the political        social economic and educational structure of the country into which the product is being        sold an understanding that takes time to acquire but that pays dividends Openaccess        publishers do not have to sell their product to users of their journals but local        knowledge is essential in selling their services to authors The globalisation of        publishing has combined with the globalisation of the networks and with the globalisation        of research to provide opportunities for highquality research conducted outside North        America and Western Europe to be published in peerreviewed openaccess journals more        readily than in the traditional subscriptionbased journals        Roger Schonfelds book draws out many of the significant points about JSTORs place in        the history of electronic publication through a minute examination of the process leading        to JSTOR as it is today There is so much detail in the book that the reader may feel that        its comprehensiveness cannot be questioned but one small omission of which I have personal        knowledge makes me question the value of so much detail The omission concerns the interest        by my institution University College London in joining JSTOR before the JISC deal was        considered Not a detail of worldshattering significance but it does illustrate the fact        that outside the United States as well as within the early interest in JSTOR came from        individual institutions rather than from consortia I sympathise with Roger Schonfeld in        attempting to write such a comprehensive history but what is the point of appearing to be        comprehensive when comprehensiveness is an impossible goal Would a briefer history have        been just as valuable        Leaving aside quibbles and caveats about the book and about JSTOR this remains a        fascinating and instructive history of an important and groundbreaking initiative Bill        Bowens vision may not have developed in quite the way he expected but the bottomline        is that the vision did become a successful reality The problem of everexpanding libraries        has not gone away in the ten years since JSTOR was conceived but the ultimate solutionthe        availability of electronic contenthas become closer and JSTORs success has encouraged        others to develop services that are more in accord with  than  One lesson Roger        Schonfeld does not draw out is the pace of change in electronic publishing and if so much        has been achieved since  what promise is held out by the next ten years
