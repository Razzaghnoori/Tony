 Empty Jocks Sunday afternoon 20 of history s greatest basketball players headlined a Madison Square Garden fund raiser for Bill Bradley Bradley s former New York Knicks teammates Dick Barnett Dave DeBusschere Walt Frazier Jerry Lucas Earl Monroe and Willis Reed sang Bradley s praises as did Kareem Abdul Jabbar Bob Cousy Julius Erving John Havlicek Moses Malone Oscar Robertson Bill Russell and Bill Walton The event complete with cheerleaders movie stars and lights and music reminiscent of an NBA game enthralled the press Bradley Throws Garden Party Scores whooped the Washington Post Bradley has pitched himself as a man of substance in a world corrupted by glitz As Russell put it at the gala In these days of spin control Bill Bradley is one of the most honest people I ve ever met So it s worth asking whether the jocks media blitz for Bradley punctuated by their full court press on Sunday s political talk shows conveyed anything of substance The question posed by NBC s Tim Russert Why do former opponents and teammates support Bill Bradley for president raises a prior question Why should we care On the talk shows the players testified that Bradley is intelligent knowledgeable well rounded compassionate concerned wonderful a great leader a great listener and a good person They applauded his honesty integrity respect and quiet strength They recalled that he played very hard played by the rules and was always interested in the needs of people They asserted that he loves his country and seeks the good of as many people as possible These platitudes are probably true But why did they dominate the three major networks Sunday morning What light do they shed on Bradley s presidential competence or agenda On Meet the Press DeBusschere argued that the ex athletes know Bradley as a man and that voters should listen to what celebrities have to say about a man that they all respect and have known very well That explanation however turns out not to be true of many of Bradley s jocks On Face the Nation Erving conceded that he had never played against Bradley and knew little about him until this year Cousy told the same story My wife and I jumped on board the minute the senator called I didn t have a personal relationship The jocks who knew Bradley as an athlete failed to name anything he had accomplished in politics Nevertheless they praised his political career He s had good leadership qualities as a senator said Lucas DeBusschere agreed He s a leader He was when he first came into the political scene He was going to study and learn and I think he s done that Russell added He s had some experience in national politics And then he got away for a while which is sometimes very helpful Again how do the assertions of former basketball players clarify this question Unable to produce evidence they extrapolated from sports to politics Bradley believed in passing and getting other people involved in the game Reed argued on This Week That s what Bill s about and what he d do in his politics getting everybody involved in the game The jocks were plainly ignorant of the issues Old jocks don t know a lot about the Balkans and the Middle East solutions or campaign finance reform and all confessed Cousy On Face the Nation Bob Schieffer told Erving Well Dr J since you re the doctor here I guess I ought to ask you about health care The question sounded like a joke but it wasn t and Erving answered it I m a proponent of Bill s position he replied citing Bill s health care plan which I got a chance to read last night Bradley s campaign has been long on sentiment and short on solutions The athletes testimonials did nothing to remedy that deficit DeBusschere praised him for caring and going out and saying things and doing things about race relations Reed called for racial enlightenment and predicted Bill will try to make that happen Los Angeles Lakers coach Phil Jackson observed Skin color is an immediate reaction to people and this is something that we have to overcome This is something Bill sees Cousy boasted that Bradley makes human rights a cornerstone really in terms of his priorities All those problems stem obviously from man s inhumanity to man So I m happy to see Bill focusing on you know just getting people to get along together on a domestic and a worldwide level Cousy argued that Bradley s jock advocates should be taken seriously because they re concerned about issues and unencumbered by the baggage of immorality that disqualifies many celebrity athletes Bradley has been very selective in terms of the celebrities that he has asked to jump on board said Cousy If we re all pretty good guys and we ve lived our lives properly then hey why don t you listen to us in this case and vote for Bill Bradley No doubt Cousy has lived his life properly So have my neighbors And they don t get on Meet the Press Stripped of their rationalizations Bradley s jocks fall back on the argument that their opinions are important simply because they re celebrities Look at America and what America is all about Robertson argued Basketball is America s game People come to games to see these stars play Stars have such influence on Americans today And it s just apropos for me to be here to say that Bill Bradley s a person who can generalize all these people together On Late Edition Bradley said of his basketball pals Why wouldn t you reach out to your friends I d be stupid if I didn t do that If the jocks don t know why Bradley should be president why are they endorsing him Because they think their association with him helps their image as well as his Not too many jocks are Rhodes Scholars observed Cousy arguing that Bradley personifies the virtues of team sports Thirty years ago everybody was a dumb jock who played sports sniffed DeBusschere Bill I think has proven that a basketball player baseball player football player are very intelligent people and that type of stigma attached to you is not worthy But are the jocks serving Bradley well At best they re helping him exploit the superficial elitist politics he claims to be campaigning against That s what happened on Meet the Press where Russert after hosting Bradley s jocks for much of the show explained the absence of a Gore representative by reporting We asked the Al Gore campaign to provide celebrities who would support him They declined At worst the jocks are hurting Bradley by failing to comprehend and refute misrepresentations of his agenda That s what happened on Face the Nation where Gore campaign manager Donna Brazile accused Bradley of endangering African Americans and all other minorities and Hispanics by trying to eliminate Medicaid What Bradley needed was a policy expert who could block Brazile s cheap shot Instead the task of defending Bradley fell to Erving who shrugged that it s probably a debatable issue but knowing Sen Bradley he is you know the type of individual who has always been fair With that response Erving negated his layup for Bradley by yielding a three pointer to Brazile That s the problem with basketball stars They can score but they can t play D
