                your turn   oh i i start okay well uh we keep a budget to an extent um and really it it we were really forced into keeping a budget because im im paid once a month which sort of sort of forces some uh uh restrictions and you need to make sure all your bills are paid uh how about yourself   well i have to say i really dont have a budget both my wife and i uh grew up in uh families of rather modest means and uh our family income at this point is comfortable upper middle class i guess you might say and uh were both so uh frugal that um we really dont need a budget you know we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing   yeah well i guess that really is sort of of keeping a budget you know you stay within your uh   well we stay within our means but we dont do it uh by conscious effort it just sort of happens automatically   within your means yeah   although we just moved to California and uh the cost of living here in California is um i would say rather pathological   yes   uh housing prices are you know like from four to ten times more expensive than um um they were where i came from in uh Dallas  yeah so uh   oh you moved from Dallas to San Francisco that is a huge difference   uh that presents um a real shock  actually actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since weve moved to California but   yeah but you have good sour dough and its a beautiful place to live   yeah its Gods country uh and one way you know that is that only God can afford it   yeah     um so budget is not a problem for us uh least it hasnt been it may it may be at this point but uh up until this point it really hasnt been when i uh was in uh undergraduate school a long long time ago i uh noted that the monthly salary starting average monthly saly salary for engineers that  in my discipline was like oh six hundred and ten dollars a month or something like that and uh i noted at that point that i was   umhum   you know if thats what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever so i stopped worrying about money and uh never have worried about money since then   yeah well thats thats a system too   sometimes uh its a bit of a a problem you know because i guess i dont really manage my money the way i should but uh i suppose ive lost money on not taking good advantage of of uh investments but   well then again you know you said you you are able to take trips and you do obviously have enough to live on so i guess youre indirectly budgeting   umhum   uh just by by the fact you said that youre both very frugal uh in spending the money so i mean thats thats a form of budgeting i would think its kind of a kind of a strange topic to to try to for two people who dont really have a budget to talk about budgeting and how they manage their money   well i guess were both lucky in that regard then   yeah   uh how big is your family   uh well were we have one on the way um my wife and then were were having one on the way in uh in uh September   i see so how do you and when once you get ten children though you may have   no i think its just going to be one   oh all right   how about yourself   i have two kids uh one nine and one thirteen and they are beginning to be a budget problem but uh have not been really up until this up to this point   oh do they budget at all i mean do you have them on an allowance or   i give them uh i give them an allowance and they um i basically give my son ten dollars a week and i put half of it in the bank and i give give him the other half in cold cash   yeah   and uh he has a teller card so he can uh do what he wishes do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank but at least it isnt you know burning a hole in his pocket   yeah   if he wants to use it he has to go get it and that usually
