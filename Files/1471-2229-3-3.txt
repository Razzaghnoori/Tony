 Background Microsatellites also known as simple sequence repeats or SSRs are a small array of tandemly arranged bases one to six spread throughout the genomes Microsatellites as DNA markers are advantageous over many other markers as they are highly polymorphic highly abundant co dominant inheritance analytical simple and readily transferable 1 Microsatellites are reported to be more variable than RFLPs or RAPDs and have been widely utilized in plant genomic studies 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 The advantages of microsatellite over other types of genetic markers will become more important and more obvious when they are used to track desirable traits in large scale breeding programs and as anchor points for map based gene cloning strategies 10 There are a number of ways to obtain microsatellite markers Screening genomic libraries by hybridizing with SSR probes and sequencing the hybridized positive clones is traditional but a laborious and costly approach While screening the SSR enriched small insert libraries can significantly reduce time and cost 11 Enrichment can be realized by hybridizing SSR containing fragments with biotin labeled probes that are either captured by magnetic beads coated with streptavidin or fixed on a nitrate filter 12 The eluted portion after removing non hybridized DNA was highly enriched for microsatellites with enrichment efficiency between 50 90 13 Cultivated peanut or groundnut Arachis hypogaea L is an important crop for oil and protein source While China USA and India are the biggest producers it is grown throughout the world Despite the existence of substantial diversity among cultivated peanut genotypes for various morphological physiological and agronomic traits very little DNA variations had been detected by using protein or DNA based markers 15 16 17 18 19 Because of the lack of polymorphism at DNA level this crop has lagged behind in genetic mapping marker assisted selection resistance gene cloning and crop evolutionary study compared with other crops This problem has hindered the improvement of cultivated peanut by molecular techniques Although microsatellites present in peanut 20 21 microsatellites have not been fully identified developed or utilized and detailed information on the abundance of microsatellites still remains blank The objectives of this study were 1 to identify microsatellites from the cultivated peanut genome and 2 to detect the polymorphisms using these novel microsatellites in a collection of peanut accessions with diversified origins Results The microsatellite enriched libraries were constructed using the enrichment procedure with some modification Four hundred one colonies were randomly picked from primary transformation plates and sequenced The length of most inserts was between 100 bp 300 bp About 247 61 of the colonies were found to contain SSR sequences of which most were GA CT repeats Among these SSR containing fragments 83 were unique 33 while the rest were redundant 67 We could design primer pairs for 56 out of 83 unique fragments see Additional File 1 The remaining sequences had too short flanking region to design primers From 56 primer pairs 19 could detect a polymorphism among 24 peanut genotypes see Table 1 The average number of alleles per locus was 4 25 see Table 2 Because the highest number of alleles was found using primer pair PM50 24 more genotypes including one genotype from a wild species A monticola were used to search more alleles at this particular locus Up to 14 alleles were identified at PM50 locus when 48 genotypes were surveyed see Figure 1 This is the first time that such a large number of alleles were identified in cultivated peanut Using five such highly polymorphic markers 24 cultivated genotypes could be differentiated data not showed We believe that microsatellite markers in peanut might be abundant like other legume species such as soybean These primary results suggest that this system is a promising one for isolation and characterization of microsatellites in peanut Additional File 1 List of peanut microsatellite PM markers Click here for file Discussion Peanut is a unique species because very little genetic variation has been detected by molecular markers such as RFLPs isozymes and RAPDs 24 Only a few molecular markers have been identified to link with resistance genes in peanut 25 26 and thus genetic improvement through marker assisted breeding is limited Although a considerable number of AFLP markers have been identified 27 substantially more DNA markers are needed to saturate the existing peanut linkage map and to initiate genetic studies for this plant species Microsatellites have become one of the most widely used molecular markers for genetic studies in recent years Enriching the AFLP or specific adaptor amplified DNA fragments is a simple and efficient approach for SSR isolation and has been successfully applied to a number of plant genomes 12 28 29 30 31 32 By employing the modified procedures from other plant species corresponding isolating protocols were established in peanut for development of microsatellites through this study When the genomic DNA was converted into AFLP fragment assembly the different set of AFLP fragments could be amplified using selective primers and then used for hybridizing with SSR probes By optimizing the hybridization and washing steps most of the AFLP fragments were found to harbor microsatellites after cloning and sequencing In order to enrich SSR containing fragments efficiently several researchers 12 28 33 combined several SSR probes to hybridize with DNA fragments However some types of repeat were lost due to improper temperature during hybridization followed by washing 31 The probes were separately hybridized with fragments to prevent some probes from washing out in this study However the fragments containing GA CT repeats were found most using three probes separately A few GT CA or AT TA repeats were identified in some fragments The results indicated that GA CT repeats are the most abundant microsatellites in peanut genome Compared to the previous report of Hopkins et al on peanut microsatellites 21 in which five polymorphic markers from 26 primer pairs 19 were identified using library screening method our enrichment procedure was more efficient in identifying SSR markers where 19 of 56 primer pairs 34 showed a polymorphism Although the percentage of detection of SSR markers based on total number of clones used was almost same 4 1 5 120 clones from previous report and 4 7 19 401 clones from our results the enrichment procedure is faster and less cost than library screening The rate of redundancy was high in peanut while it was very low in cotton 31 It decreased the efficacy of development of microsatellites in peanut Therefore a bigger library is needed to identify more microsatellite markers Libraries could be constructed by hybridization of SSR probes with different set of AFLP fragments resulted from changing different one base at 3 end of AFLP primers which should have 16 possible primer combinations or with different set of restriction fragments resulted from using different restriction enzyme combinations No correlation was found in cultivated peanut between the number of repeat and the informativeness of the SSR although a positive correlation has been reported for grapevine and tomato 34 The locus PM50 contains only nineteen GA motifs but is highly polymorphic Other loci e g PM244 GA 74 and PM209 GA 53 harbor much more uniform repeat units but showed no DNA variations among diversified peanut genotypes studied No polymorphism was detected with the repeat number over 30 With high throughput technologies and facilities such as robotic imaging and computational sequencing and genotyping facilities more reliable polymorphic markers will be used to construct a high resolution genetic map and marker assisted selection or even map based cloning will be realized before long in cultivated peanut Conclusions The results provided by the present study highlight a simple and reliable way in obtaining polymorphic microsatellite markers from the cultivated peanut A significance of the results is that development of microsatellite markers is important not only for peanut researchers but also for peanut industry as the paucity of DNA markers in cultivated peanut has so far precluded detailed genetic research on this crop Methods Peanut plant genomic DNA was extracted using MasterPure Plant Leaf DNA Purification kit Epicentre Madison WI and digested by two restriction enzymes Hind III and Mse I Digested fragments were ligated with corresponding adapters and then amplified using one base selective primers Hind III A and Mse I T according to standard AFLP protocol 22 Three biotinylated SSR probes AT 15 GT 15 GA 15 which were reported being rich in other plant species were separately hybridized with amplified AFLPs Approximately 200 ng of the pre amplified AFLP fragments length range from 100 bp 600 bp were added to a single reaction mixture containing 4 2 SSC Saline Sodium Citrate pH 7 0 0

the melting temperature of each probe for one hour to perform annealing for probe GT 15 at 60 C AT 15 at 37 C and GA 15 at 57 C Meanwhile Dynabeads M 280 Streptavidin 10 g l was prepared by gently shaking the vial to obtain homogenous slurry About 20 l of the beads slurry was transferred to a 1 5 ml tube then washed 4 times with 300 l bead washing buffer 1 TE 100 mM NaCl The beads were re suspended with 50 l of the same buffer and added into the fragment probe mix and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes with constant gentle agitation After immobilization the supernatant was removed by applying a magnetic field to precipitate the beads which attached the SSR containing fragments that hybridized to biotinylated probe The bead probe fragment complex was washed three times each for 5 minutes with 400 l non stringency washing buffer 1 TE 1 M NaCl at room temperature The complex was further washed with 400 l stringency buffer 0 2 SSC 0 1 SDS for three times each for 5 minutes at room temperature After the final wash the washing buffer was completely removed 40 l of sterile water added taped gently and incubated at 95 C for 5 minutes The eluted solution containing
