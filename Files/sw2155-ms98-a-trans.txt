            okay   okay   so what do you think about it should   um i like the idea of nursing homes as a as a growing choice the choices you have in nursing homes now whereas used to you used to have only you put you know when when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldnt take care of themselves and there was no other choice you couldnt take them in your own home then they went into a nursing home you know maybe you lived   uhhuh   too far away to care for them or your daily job or whatever prevented it   right   but um i like the choices you have now where they can go into an apartment type setting and have some basically have a independent lifestyle but assisted care   yeah   and then if things deteriorate they can go to a second level which is you know like where they prepare their meals for them and and they still live somewhat independently but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level which is full care   uhhuh uhhuh   you know where some people cant where theyre in a wheelchair or where theyre in a bed and they cant get around but then they have full care but i really like those those options now and and i think about it more often because my husbands parents   uhhuh   are theyre very active right now but theyre seventy five and and seventy two so that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things because of their age   uhhuh yes um its its funny because um i know people at that are in all three and people that work you know i know someone that works works in all three different stages like you said   uhhuh   and i have known you know people close to me that have been in all three and i have seen them like go from where theyre in an apartment building they we call it um well we have high rises and its just for elderly people you know or most of most of one of their spouses has already passed away   uhhuh   and its really nice for them because then theyre with people their own age and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through   uhhuh   and its its really nice to go and see them you know where they can still get around and everything and they still you know do their own thing but its its really nice to see them because i mean sometimes like i had a great aunt she lived with us for um three months and because shes starting to get Alzheimers disease   uhhuh uhhuh   and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to to actually sit down because she doesnt like doing things that the younger kids like doing   right   and to actually sit so its really nice to see that   yeah thats some of the things i would find important before i i would look into that for a person is is is like youre saying a good mix of people who have the same interests and uh and the programs here they have different   uhhuh   uh besides just different levels within the same program they have different types of programs they have several areas they have one area in town where the people i guess a lot of it comes with money it this this one area is a bit more expensive and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life but but things that people where they have similar interests   uhhuh   like youre saying and the programs that they have where where some of them will have dances once a week and some of them sponsor different crafts and they go to the arboretum to see things and they make sure that if they want to go to church theres a bus there   yeah uhhuh   and itll or you know or someone will transport them to a specific church even though its you know maybe its thirty minutes away because its a big you know Dallas area is a big metropolitan area but a lot of these places have have churches or have have individual transportation thats thats something id look for something that would make me happy   yeah   personally if i had to live there because i dont think a lot of people really even in the nice ones and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently they really dont necessarily like it because theyre not in their own home   uhhuh yeah uhhuh   so i think those kinds of things to make it more home like and to make it more um enjoyable for them thatd thatd be one thing id look for along with the uh health care aspects to make sure they had you know that it was clean and that they had good doctors and nurses   uhhuh yeah um im in college and im im only twenty one but we had a speech i had a speech class last semester and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly   uhhuh   and i was so surprised to hear how many people like whenever theyre in you know the older people theyre like um fastened to their beds so they cant get out just because they you know they wander the halls   uhhuh   and they get the wrong medicine just because you know the the aides or whoever just give them the wrong medicine and so many of them you know are   yeah are overmedicated too   yes and it was it was awful to hear what you know what some of these people really went through And i forget the percentage of people that you know that she had said and this was i mean she did research on it and everything   uhhuh yeah thats one of the things that that we dont think about as we get older and the the money that it now requires to uh be in one of these places because some of these people that are just on social security and if they dont have any living relatives perhaps they never had children or if their children you know passed away before they did they can be in some places that are   uhhuh   you know that that are not good where they they have very minimum minimal care and the the care that they are getting the people who are giving it   yeah   are probably are paid at a minimum wage and they just do they dont care as much and and like you said theyre trying to make it the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves   yeah   to the point where theyre putting people in bed or overmedicating them so theyll stay in one spot and not do anything that certainly would be something to to watch for because youve got with some of them being some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in fee   uhhuh i know and some and sometimes they share a room and its just a little cubbyhole and they share it with another person and theyre still paying that much it it it just sometimes it just seems ridiculous   yeah oh yeah so youve yeah youve got to really strike a balance in what kind of care what kind of level of care you need and then what you can unfortunately what you can afford at the same time   uhhuh uhhuh yeah um ive been lucky well my moms um parents theyre both in their in their uh eighties and i was just home for spring break and my grandma said something to me about she goes well maybe well just sell the house she said its getting too big for us to take care of and i was like no no no stay in the house as long as you can     well like there are other communities too that arent necessarily a nursing home i had an aunt who lived in a small town in Texas that um was in a it was a it was a housing division each person had their own little bitty house that they had built and it was um   uhhuh   supplemented their they were most of them were on social security and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government but it was this little bitty one bedroom house but it was a separate house and they had a living room and a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom   oh   so they still had they had and they had people who came in who um supervised them all these houses were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block and they had a a supervisory um   uhhuh   wasnt a house really it was it was more like a   it sounds like uh an apartment or some   a headquarters or something anyway where they they staffed it three shifts a day so that someone if they needed someone they could ri ng and and someone could come to their house   oh yeah   and that and they always cooked then they had they had the choice you know they lived in their own little house they had their own possessions still in there to some extent you know some of them   uhhuh uhhuh   and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to and their own dinner and they always had somebody come in for lunch but they had people who did you know they didnt have to mess with the yard they had people who did the yard and they had a maid that uh uh service that came in and cleaned everybodys house so they didnt have to worry about that and it was really a nice   uhhuh oh yeah   it was really a nice compromise especially because she felt like she was still living in her own house and she still had her own couch and her own bed and it it really helped a lot and she was a lot more comfortable and she didnt   uhhuh       oh really   yeah   see now weve run into a lot of problems where our relatives were well ive lived here for thirty years and weve built this and this is our home and we have nothing else to show for our lives and we dont want to leave uh weve run into a lot of that   yeah oh yeah yeah it would be hard to thats thats why this she was she felt that way too but when it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff   um yeah   and i guess that that it was a pilot program i think where she lived so its probably not widely available   uhhuh yeah thats what like well um now i know we have an old we call it an old folks home but its basically a nursing home too but everyone has basically their own room   yeah   and theyre allow you know they none of them have cars because they cant drive   uhhuh   but if someone would come to get them you know theyre allowed to leave with them and theres a staff there that makes supper for them and each person has a chore like maybe Wednesday night its Georges turn to set all the tables   huh   and its really nice because that keeps them going too rather than just sitting around and i know um our youth group goes over and we play bingo with them and you know like stuff like that   yeah well thats good everybody needs some sense of responsibility   uhhuh yeah just to keep them going   an even even if its just a little bit yeah   uhhuh   so its its more like living with a big in a big house where its your turn to to set the table like youre saying or whatever instead of being waited on hand and foot all the time yeah that would be nice   yeah uhhuh but i think before i like you i dont think you i dont think its right to just put someone in it i think they would have to agree to go in it   yes unless theyre at a point where theyre mentally incapacitated   well yeah   say like youre saying with Alzheimers and going to be   the people who have to be there   uhhuh     thats when its important to really check out the medical aspects of it when youre when youre in something like that that theyll get the kind of medical care they want without or   uhhuh     overdoing it   uhhuh       yeah   so   uhhuh
