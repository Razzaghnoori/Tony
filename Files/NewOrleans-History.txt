A Brief HistoryIt seems like a rather strange site for a colonial city The Mississippi was untamed when the location was found by the French and changed course regularly through the vast flat delta its power had created The site is below sea level even below river level hot and sticky in the long summer surrounded by pestilential swamps vulnerable to every flood and hurricane and more than  miles  km from the Gulf of Mexicoor anywhere else How did it hope to compete with the great coastal settlements in other parts of the New WorldThe Native Americans Choctaws and other tribes who settled here thousands of years before the arrival of the French colonists lived a simple life Although they needed to avoid water snakes alligators and diseasecarrying mosquitoes they enjoyed a cornucopia of seafood and game flavoring it with a hot sauce the Creoles would later adopt They used the waterways of the Mississippi delta as highways navigating their dugout canoes through the impenetrable and everchanging maze of bayousThe first European to see the Mississippi was the Spanish Conquistador Hernando de Soto brotherinlaw of Balboa and the discoverer of the Pacific The French connection was to begin in  when Ren Robert Cavelier Sieur de La Salle claimed for France a huge swath of territory radiating from the Mississippi In honor of his king Louis XIV he gave it the name LouisianeSeventeen years later France sent a further expedition led by Pierre le Moyne Sieur dIberville Along with his younger brother JeanBaptiste Sieur de Bienville he established several tentative settlements along the Mississippi In  Bienville marked the spot for New Orleans The brothers are remembered today as the true founders of both the state and the cityBienville later served as the first governor of Louisiana Interestingly they were Creole Frenchoffspring of French nationals born in MontrealHankyPanky by LawMeanwhile a European with an eye for chance had ingratiated his way into the French court at Versailles John Law a Scotsman financier and highrolling gambler on the run from England after a fatal duel saw the possibility of promoting this distant marshland as a paradise Luckily for New Orleans his scheme was a remarkable successLaw brokered a deal with the French government giving him a year charter to develop the Louisiana Territory All he needed were investors and settlers whom he lured with a campaign of propaganda On posters Law distributed in France New Orleans was pictured as a prosperous seaport When Laws clients arrived after months at sea the truth of the Mississippi Bubble was plain The only housing available was huts or tents and the roads were generally quagmires But there was nowhere else to go so the pioneers were forced to pitch in and try to surviveJohn Laws promotional activities werent confined to the French He signed up some  Germans mostly Rhinelanders to share the golden future in Louisiana Today west of New Orleans along what is called the German Coast you can see towns with names like Hahnville Kraemer and Des Allemands Most descendants of the German pioneers however Frenchified their names thus Delmaire was originally Edelmeyer and Fauquel was VogelBlack slaves from Africa also arrived in the earliest years of the colony In  the Bienville enacted the Code Noir Black Code which regulated the conditions of slavery and the rights of free blacks The code more liberal than the laws elsewhere in the South remained in force in Louisiana for a century As for the Mississippi Bubble it burst in  France came out of the deal bankrupt and with huge pieces of land considered to be worthless John Law died in  dispossessed in VeniceHigh SocietyBy the middle of the th century New Orleans had grown into a townnot exactly selfsufficient but beyond the survival stage To carry this a step farther the Marquis de Vaudreuil Governor Bienvilles successor in  attempted to transform New Orleans into an overseas Versailles A bon vivant who held extravagant parties Vaudreuil and his elegant wife presided over a sort of Golden Age of social grace when the colonial elite were invited to plays musicales and balls His serious business included organizing the first system of manmade levees to protect the city from the Mississippi At the same time the governor and his cronies were busily pocketing bribes as was the custom in the selffinancing French colonial service He can therefore be considered as the founder of a grand old Louisiana traditionpolitical corruptionCarambaThe Treaty of Fontainebleau in  brought a shattering blow to the population of Louisiana Overnight it appeared they had been handed over to King Charles III of Spainthough the treaty was not announced until  It all made perfect sense to King Louis XV cousin of Charles both were Bourbons for the French and Indian War known in Europe as the Seven Years War had been disastrous for French interests abroad Britain won Canada and everything east of the Mississippi including Spanish Florida To Louis Louisiana was now isolated in a Britishruled part of the world a moneylosing outpost that seemed to have no futureIt must have come as an almost unbearable shock to the patriotic Frenchmen of New Orleans to be told that they were Spanish citizens Waiting for the first Spanish governor to arrive put a huge strain on the disillusioned society When Governor Antonio de Ulloa finally sailed up the Mississippi in  four years after the treaty was signed a crashing storm erupted as if an omen for the climate ahead The governor a scholarly retired naval officer with good intentions was accompanied by a contingent of  Spanish soldiers most of retirement ageThe highsociety frolics of the Vaudreuil era were over the Spanish governors wife froze out the Creole ladies of New Orleans from official invitation lists Frenchspeaking citizens protested the snub with a petition and a demonstration that got out of control and turned into violence Spain called it treason The harassed Ulloa could take no more and sailed into exileThe second governor sent from Spain Lieutenant General Don Alejandro OReilly cracked down on the rebels OReilly created the Cabildo or town council and led New Orleans toward prosperity But he is remembered with bitterness To assert Spains authority and extinguish dissent he ordered the execution of five Creole rebels They stood before the firing squad on the Esplanade near where it crosses Frenchmen Street named in their memoryThe AcadiansDuring the troubled Spanish era thousands of French exiles from eastern CanadaAcadians shortened to Cajuns migrated to Louisiana For years their territory had been the target of a struggle between the British and French and the emphatic British victory in the French and Indian War forced them to leave when they refused to swear allegiance to the British CrownThe hubbub of New Orleans was too much for them and they settled into the surrounding countryside Unlike the other colonists who eventually melted into the culture the Cajuns kept to themselves in the bayou retaining their thcentury language and customs Only in the th century did they start to communicate in English as well The present Cajun population in Louisiana numbering in the hundreds of thousands is still largely parochial But one aspect of their culture their spicy cuisine has become fashionable across the United States and more recently the worldThe French QuarterIn  a Spanish official lighting a devotional candle in the private chapel in his home on Chartres Street started a fire which spread fanned by the wind to devour nearly half the town In  another blaze swept through the streets New Orleans looked on the positive side of these disasters Taking note of the obvious vulnerability of the old wooden houses the government set up new building standards Tile roofs became the rule and structures with more than a single floor had to be built of brick Spanishcolonial touches such as garden patios shaded balconies and adornments of wrought iron gave the area its almost Caribbean air This new town became known ironically as the French Quarter or Vieux CarrRevolutionary AnticsDuring the American Revolution New Orleans plunged in on the revolutionist side It wasnt only enthusiasm for the Yankees Spain declared war on England in  The governor of New Orleans yearold Don Bernardo de Glvez seized the chance to help the colonists in their struggle against George III and led raiding parties that kept the British outposts along the Mississippi on the defensiveAfter the American Revolution came the French Revolution and a new world order The ambitions of Napolon Bonaparte stretched as far as the Western Hemisphere and an influx of French aristocrats buoyed French sentiments By the secret Treaty of Ildefonso in  France regained Louisiana from Spain after  yearsBut in  only three years after retaking it France sold Louisiana to the United States for  million It was a controversial amount at the timemore than the US Treasury ownedbut the Louisiana Purchase as it became known covered land from Canada to the Rockies to the Gulf of Mexico and almost doubled the area of the United States The deal turned out to be the bargain of all timesomething like four cents an acre for what became Iowa Arkansas Missouri Nebraska South Dakota and most of Kansas Louisiana and OklahomaAs usual New Orleans was among the last to learn this thanks to the secrecy of diplomatic negotiations and the slow communications of the age In the event within one month three different flags flew over the Place dArmes now Jackson Square The Stars and Stripes replaced the French flag on  December  only three weeks after the Spanish gave way to the French Once again the stunned citizens felt abandoned and betrayedThe Yanks Are ComingPresident Jeffersons choice of governor for the Territory of Orleans seemed to say the least inauspicious William Charles Cole Claiborne was a Protestant from Virginia who needed interpreters to communicate in both French and Spanish He judged the Creoles honest but lazy and illeducated their town ugly and filthythough his horror at the citys sanitation was understandable he would lose two wives to yellow fever in New Orleans In return the local Creoles considered themselves more worldly than the rustic Americans Claiborne persevered however learned French changed the laws and brought his carping constituents into the American fold as citizens of the new State of Louisiana even though it was very much unlike any other US stateWar on the MississippiLess than two months after Louisiana won its statehood the United States went to war with Britainfor the second and last time To everyones surprise New Orleans became the stage for the most glorious indeed the only American victory of the whole conflictThe War of  was fostered by accumulated American grievances There were dramatic naval battles and a final ghastly defeat for the United States when the British burned down the city of Washington Finally the warring parties focused on New Orleans A British flotilla diverted from the Caribbean sailed up the Mississippi with some  firstclass troops The Americans rushed Major General Andrew Jackson to New Orleans to command the citys defense Outmanned and outgunned Jackson mobilized a force of somewhat irregular members an unlikely coalition of militiamen local Creoles free blacks Choctaws and associates of the privateers Jean and Pierre Lafitte see page  The pirates may well have been the key to the outcome for they alone knew the ins and outs of the bayou country from where the British attack would comeIn the Battle of Orleansfought in Chalmette down the riverGeneral Sir Edward Packenham and his redcoats marched in proper formation across the battlefield like toy soldiersstraight into the American artillery In less than half an hour it was all over General Packenham the brotherinlaw of the Duke of Wellington famous for his war successes had been shot thousands of his troops had been killed and the tattered survivors withdrew in disarray Ironically the war was already over A peace treaty had been signed in Belgium two weeks before but news traveled no faster than a ship in those daysBetween WarsBy the s New Orleans had reached its heyday The sound of postwar prosperity was the blast of steam whistles on the river With the development of powerful steamboats navigation on the Mississippi became a practical economical matter Freighters moved cotton tobacco and sugar downriver and worldwide Passenger ships like the Natchez and the Belle of Memphis were palaces with food drink music and romance at a time when even short journeys could take many daysThousands of steamboats docked along the quays every year By  New Orleans was the worlds largest cotton port second only to New York as a general port and the fourth biggest city in the United States with a population of  American families who came south looking for a place to settle found themselves unwelcome in the French Quarter Instead they created a second city uprivernow the Garden District using the plentiful land that once constituted sugar plantationsIt was also the era of benefactors both in social and cultural fields One was John McDonogh who elevated conditions for the ordinary people of the city A plantation owner of Scottish extraction he educated and freed many slaves Most of City Park is land he willed to the children of New Orleans When he died a millionaire in  back when a million dollars really meant something he left his money to the city to build schools for the poor Dozens are still named after McDonogh who in effect founded the citys public school systemAt this time less than half of the black population were slaves and those that were led a less onerous life than in most other parts of the South Free people of color ran their own businesses and owned property Free women of color were included among the concubines of white aristocrats their lives organized according to arcane social codesCulture thrived in this climate Carnival parades began in  although other aspects of Mardi Gras festivities had taken hold much earlier The French Opera House at the corner of Bourbon and Toulouse streets opened in  and supported the nations first resident opera company On quite another cultural plane a  law against gambling was ignored in New Orleans where the card game of poker is said to have originated The merchant seaman plantation owners and businessmen who thronged the city streets also looked for the distraction of other pleasures and prostitution was rife in the less salubrious parts of townThe War between the StatesIn January  Louisiana joined other cotton states in seceding from Lincolns Union After two months as an independent entity the state entered the new Confederacy but because of its strategic significance New Orleans became a highpriority target for the northern military forcesIn April  a Union naval force led by David G Farragut capitalized on Confederate unpreparedness and penetrated the defenses of New Orleans Despite localized opposition within a week the Union flag was raised over the city It announced a military occupation destined to endure beyond the Civil War or War between the States as it is known in the south into the Reconstruction periodfor a total of  bitter years The reconstruction of New Orleans began in  when the jetties were built to speed the flow of the Mississippi near its mouth This improved navigation and returned the port to a position of strength New railway lines linked the city with the rest of the United StatesIn  the city attempted to demonstrate its postwar recovery by staging an international fairthe Worlds Industrial and Cotton Centennial Expositionon the site of what is now Audubon Park The moraleboosting exercise lost money but the rest of the United States had started to hear about the industrious but amusing city on the Mississippi as a place worth visitingThe Storyville StoryIn  in an attempt to curb the worst excesses of the Big Easy Alderman Sidney Story created a city ordinance outlawing prostitution everywhere in the city except for a small specific area just beyond the French Quarter where it could be contained and controlled This area known as Storyville became a legend in its own time where the mixture of glamour depravity and color in the local brothels attracted almost every visiting celebrity and where saloon drinkers gamblers and rakes waiting their turn could tap their feet to a developing style of music jazz Louis Armstrong started playing his bent nickelplated cornet in the dives of Storyville He improvised from evening to daybreak for  cents a nightStoryville lasted exactly  years In World War I the US Navy Department ordered the creation of a vicefree zone for five miles around every naval base That included Storyville and the place closed downThe Long SagaIn Louisiana politics and politicians have always been a fascinating businessand business is the wordbut none of the bosses could compare with largerthanlife Huey P Long  Long was cagey ambitious poor and so bright he graduated from Tulane Law School less than a year after he entered At the age of  he was elected to the state public service commission as governor he built roads and bridges that were desperately needed and supplied all the states school children with free textbooks His slogans were Every Man a King and A Chicken in Every PotElected to the US Senate he still controlled Louisiana from Washington having installed a puppet in the governors office Long was starting to attract a national following when he was assassinated in the state capitol in Baton Rouge on  September During the latter years of Longs reign the French Quarter had reached a nadir with many fine buildings in a state of near collapsesome were even demolished to make parking lots In  the state set up the Vieux Carr Commission with powers to protect buildings of architectural value It still operates to control development in the areaMeanwhile oil had been discovered in Louisiana in  The land was transformed by hundreds of small wells sunk to extract the precious liquid In  the first offshore rig was opened and the Mississippi valley became a hub of oil and gas production and storage After the Second World War new highways led to broader horizons and suburbs began to sprawl Following the construction of the impressive causeway across Lake Pontchartrain in  commuters even began to move to the far side of the lake and NASA assembled thousands of technicians at suburban Michoud to produce its booster rocketsDesegregation in schools which hit many southern cities hard in the s passed off in New Orleans with a minimum of trouble Whites and blacks had always mixed more freely here than in most places in Dixie and the drive for racial equality reached an historic high in  when Judge Ernest Dutch Morial was elected the first AfricanAmerican mayorToday Dutchs son Marc carries on the family tradition as Mayor But if the city seems to be moving in a positive direction the state has other problems As the third millennium begins Louisiana is again suffering the problem that has plagued it throughout its history Federal racketeering charges have been brought against Edwin Edwards Louisiana State Governor until his retirement in  and the huge trial in Baton Rouge is keeping the state on the edge of its seat It seems that little has changed since the times of John LawNew Orleans seems to move from strength to strength In recent years new cultural and recreational facilities have multiplied the citys tourist potential These include greatly expanded riverfront parks a stateoftheart aquarium and a revived warehouse district
