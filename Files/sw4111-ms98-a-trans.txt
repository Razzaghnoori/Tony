        live in New York and capital punishment is illegal in this state and uh       its just coincidental that thats the way it is but my feelings happen to be that im against capital punishment uh and i feel that its barbaric actually it seems out of date with civilization as   really even if the the crime is extremely extremely serious   i think so because i think what were talking about is is uh life making and life taking decisions and i i dont think any one human being has the right to take away the life of any other human being not that its a a religious feeling or anything like that but it seems hypocritical to me that wed say in the case of murder for instance that uh because you took away somebody elses life and because that is so very wrong we are going to take away your life i dont see that that makes any sense really   well its not necessarily someone has the right but we do have the responsibility to punish criminals so if some person just blatantly slaughtered painfully killed ten people does he really have the right to  continue living and be a burden on society   i dont think its a matter of the of the murderers rights i think its a matter of our uh penal peoples rights and i dont think they have the right to take away a life no i think definitely there should be uh severe punishment uh to deter other people from doing such heinous crimes uh for instance i think life imprisonment should be necessary for anybody who commits any murder of any sort and i also think that uh other things that are currently not legal in the country should be made legal such as putting prisoners to work and making them earn their their pay   yeah i agree with that part yeah definitely   but i think life imprisonment is a much better alternative to uh people that perform crimes i think also people that are prone to commit a murder are not going to be deterred by the thought of being put to death i think that if theyre uh the sort of mentality that they could do such a thing that it doesnt matter what threat you pose to them that that wouldnt change things as far as what they were capable of doing so i dont see it as much of a deterrent either   well some criminals would see it as a life in jail doesnt particularly sound too harsh to someone whos been living on the street you know for all his life and then uh jail jail time would seem like uh you know a break or a a paid paid sustenance for the rest of his life   yeah and i think thats unfortunate that is probably the way it is today and i think that ought to be changed uh i think like i said i think people ought to be made to pay for their stay and not make it pleasant for them i think hard labor should be required even among people that are are are not able   yeah make it make it harsh as possible   to perform hard labor you know if they if they died naturally from working then i guess that would be okay because that wouldnt be uh putting anybody to death forcibly   yeah   but uh i i cant see i cant see executing people it just seems so barbarous barbaric in these times   uh well i live in California im not really up on it i i think we dont have capital punishment either huhuh   in California i i thought there was but i could be wrong   yeah   what amazes me is how many people speak out in favor of capital punishment even here in New York people really want to see it uh be put into effect it seems more so than those of us who feel the way i feel uh uh at least are vocal   well   saying that no they want things to stay the way they are lot of people want to see capital punishment made legal   yeah im one of those guys   okay um i guess uh i guess we did what we have to do and i dont see any instructions as far as doing anything else so i uh its nice talking with you   okay you too you too bye bye   okay take care bye
