        okay Bill um as you think over the plans and so forth that the company youre working with now who do you work with this time     well i own a company   you own the company alright   im the president and CEO of the company   my goodness   so uh i guess uh i determine what the benefits are     yeah i guess you do hum   but uh you so what are you asking me what  what benefits i think are most important   well what what do you think of the lets put it this way what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you other than other than their present salary   um id say in todays economy uh besides basic benefits uh such as um health insurance and life insurance and the uh some type of retirement plan   umhum   id say that uh most of the employees uh um that we have really like a a profit sharing plan   a profit sharing plan thats interesting umhum   they like to participate in the profits of the company like theyre part like you know because they feel like well were contributing to it so wed like to participate in it and so that means i make a little bit less but the thing is that really you make a little more because everybody has a interest in in it working     yes because they  they have a specific reason to do so because they themselves benefit from doing a better job   right i think most people uh dont want money um its been my experience most people want uh to feel like theyre participating in something that uh that is not a drudgery you know that they can enjoy and that they can get some benefits out of   umhum   and its a contribution   right   well Bill uh that idea fits me exactly i just retired from uh the university here and thats been the goal of my life was to contribute and um to the work that i was doing in my research and thats what made me happy and uh thats the type of goal i think most people ought to look for and im sure a lot of them dont you cant stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that youre contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth   yeah well uh our people get a lot of satisfaction um were a financial planning firm     youre a financial planning firm how many uh   uh yes so you said you retired i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning but anyway uh   uhhuh   uh we do we deal with a lot of people that are uh retired or trying to retire   umhum oh   and uh its real important uh that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work that where they were that uh um that it take care of them they dont none of them really want to be rich but they like to have enough to be comfortable   well what what changes would you have have you considered uh in in doing it to your to your company that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better   well um we considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to a a salary is uh is tie um uh a percentage um of business that uh that a person would participate and bring into the company uh pay them uh based on the percentage of business they bring instead of based on their salary and the result   when you say bring in do you mean that they negotiated with people to to come in and uh ask for your support   no not necessarily um it can be in house people who help you handle X amount of dollars   oh okay umhum even though they didnt bring it in they help it once its there   right well see we have different we have marketing people and then we have uh financial planners   yeah   and uh then we have uh staff secretaries and administrative assistants and these secretaries and administrative assistants um you know that if we dont have their cooperation and theyre not participating in the profit of the company they they can get very dissatisfied very quickly   umhum   and so uh were thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business and uh   yes but it it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job but it might be whether the locality locality there those people want that kind of support   well and and and but to see the thing is that they give support to the financial planner that theyre the assistant to or that they usually have several people they report to that you know that they work together with   umhum umhum   uh it encourages them not to uh complain when they realize that they get a part of the of the action based on their efforts not based on being sitting back saying well make me do it   umhum   see we dont want anybody around here that says make me do it i dont think anybody any i think most people want to be   yeah   lack a better terminology terminology they want to be self employed but they dont want to take the risk in other words they like to control their own future but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please   thats true   without some real strict adherence which thats what we have   umhum
