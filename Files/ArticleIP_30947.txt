 Asynchronic I d been doing that going out just after sunset the sky a bowl of blue green light a basin filled with cold still seawater Shops in the advancing dusk looked like fish tanks flooded with neutral overhead lighting that fell on personnel about to close up for the day When I tugged back a sleeve the wrist was naked forgot my watch again and both hands chapped and rough Why do our hands have five fingers no more and no less Zoologists would know Meanwhile one of the routine strictly business clocks glimpsed through windows during the rounds of my unofficial beat could substitute for a watch The first said 6 25 the second several storefronts down 6 22 a third 6 29 Time didn t agree with itself Tonight it didn t agree with me either but then it never entirely had and never will A white haired man with olive skin and tattered clothes limped into Met Food and panhandled the clerk one I recognized her face mild and familiar as bread For half a second strange it felt permanent indestructible as the tiny gleam that pearled in the dark pupil of her eye 6 33 And now a go getter poised at 6 45 Evening star in a sky by then blue black ink and I roughly fifteen minutes older arms dangling at my sides But no wiser only a bit farther into the walk with a sudden hunger pang the gut s alarm bell sounding dinner hour All I d seen the streets the clock faces menagerie of the populous city were saying so to speak Feast your eyes on this If the banquet had agreed with me and if I d had a shelter to return to Time had moved in back there a silent dimension unconcerned that it would turn us out on the street first you and after you d gone then me according to some ironclad schedule followed or policed at glacial speed by supervising hands Or worse when my door swung open by spidery digitals that glared across the darkened room with their 6 58 numbers reflected counter greener flame like detail the lost and found of deity in the crystal of the watch I left there on the table
