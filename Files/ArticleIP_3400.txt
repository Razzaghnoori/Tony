 Lavender Disaster By David St John posted Wednesday Nov 12 To hear the poet read Lavender Disaster click It was in the old days in Atlantic City as the icy rain began to clear the boardwalk Of even the most desolate stragglers I pulled my ultra cool thrift store fedoraDown low over my eyes just kept on walking as I passed an old storefront painted up Like a fortune teller s bazaar its ancient bricksCovered in narrow stripes of orange and lavender As if it were a gypsy s rippling tent The old woman inside said softly to me the words Come try nothing else but after a few steps I turned went back stepped out of the rain To face her across the small round tableWhere she sat shuffling a bent pack of Tarot cards Sit down she said of course I did just that as she laid the cards out slowly before herShe quietly rocked a little in her chair Then she told me the story of the future I might hold as she spoke the room filled with a lightAs thick as the mist outside softly lavender As softly lavender as an electric summer sunset Down at the beach with maybe Stella or even Renata the gypsy s eyes closed my own eyes too As she said You will sit in the throne of Heaven die into the open arms of your Lord Well that s really nice I thought All this death shit not a word about sex or money But I couldn t open my eyelids for a second when I did the mist had cleared although a faint Scent remained of my grandmother s lavender sachet the gypsy s hand was out so I slapped down a fiveThen got out before she told me something else I didn t want to know but I was worse than chilly now A little bent out of shape leery of the wayThe night was coming down so black along the streets I just knew I couldn t go on to work that night So I turned back started heading home thinkingHow Stella would be pissed I d spent that five spot On the gypsy not to mention I d be back Early with no money from the shift I couldn t doBut maybe we d go out to the movies We hadn t done that since I d been made a night clerk That would make her happy I thought the movies then a drink at Jake s to make up for the fact We d be broke again next week for sure as I opened the door to our apartmentI swear I could smell the scent of lavender that same mist began rolling through the living room I could hear them then in the back bedroomMaking those little fucking sounds so fucking softly So fucking tenderly it made me want to scream But I just walked through the kitchen grabbedThe ice pick off the counter where Stella d Left it after chipping ice flakes for their drinks as I came to the open bedroom doorI stood there for a second but They didn t notice me her legs fiercely bicycling The air he was jack hammering away at herSo I just stepped up beside the bed punctuated This happy dream with a few decisive holes To let the lavender air out of the moment I m not kidding as I watched the two of them Stretched out silently across the damp mattress I could actually see the mist clearing again again I could finally breathe a little So none of the rest of this really matters you reading this matter least of allBecause I am the one man who knows my simple Future all of the rest of you must live in the pain Of not knowing of not believing what comesWill be finally not so different from my own Wild glory as I come to sit at last upon My own Lordly throne so carefully hewnOf precious woods polished by the sweat of men Who before me have mistakenly believed only They were worthy of this journey I welcomeAs I am fitted with those perfect leather straps A helmet wired to the future charged by the grace Of God the Governor to carry me into that HeavenI was promised one distant lavender Night
