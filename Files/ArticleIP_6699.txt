 Election Night Excuses 1 We did better than Newt Gingrich said we would Gingrich with typical chutzpah has predicted the GOP could pick up 40 or more House seats Democrats with equal chutzpah will portray anything less as a Democratic victory 2 We did better than the pundits said we would The conventional wisdom on likely Republican gains has ranged from six to 20 House seats and from three to five Senate seats If Democrats hold the GOP below the upper end of this range they ll claim victory If Republicans beat the lower end they ll claim victory 3 We did well considering how heavily we were outspent Democrats will use this alibi in nearly every close race Republicans will claim that many of their candidates were outspent if you count the additional union money 4 We did well considering the president s difficulties Democrats will offer this excuse without acknowledging that it implies the public is still upset with the president s behavior Simultaneously they will assert that the election is a mandate for ending the investigation of the president s behavior 5 We did well considering the backlash against the investigation Republicans will offer this excuse without acknowledging that the backlash is mainstream Instead they ll portray it as a surge of turnout among diehard Clinton supporters 6 We did well considering the six year itch Democrats will point out that the president s party usually loses dozens of congressional seats in his sixth year What they won t mention is that the reason Clinton didn t lose those seats in his sixth year is that he lost them in his second 7 Americans re elected the Republican majority This is the ultimate Republican fallback Even if the GOP somehow loses seats in both houses it can ignore its relative setbacks and reassert its absolute supremacy 8 The Republicans failed to win a filibuster proof majority This is the ultimate Democratic fallback If Democrats lose fewer than five Senate seats they ll say they weathered the tide because voters decided not to entrust Republicans with complete control 9 We won the close races Both sides will use this line Close races are the ones your side won If a race looked close but you ended up losing it then it wasn t really close so you needn t mention it 10 Their candidate won on local issues A good spinner never admits that his party s candidate lost because of the national party s positions If an anti health maintenance organization pro public education Democrat wins Democrats will say it s because voters liked her positions on HMOs and education If she loses they ll say its because voters disliked her position on building a local freeway 11 Their candidate won with vicious negative ads If their candidate wins it s because his negative ads distracted voters from the issues If your candidate wins it s because voters agreed that the other candidate was wrong on the issues as your candidate pointed out in his negative ads 12 Our candidate lost because of vicious media attacks If your candidate ran negative ads and their candidate didn t and your candidate still managed to lose you can always accuse the media of attacking your candidate This argument comes in particularly handy when the media have criticized your candidate precisely for running negative ads 13 Our candidate lost because he screwed up If an anti tax family values Republican wins it s because voters liked his positions on taxes and family values If he loses it s because he was unfairly savaged by the local press for calling his opponent a putzhead 14 Our candidate did well in a tough district The Democratic Party recruits each candidate by telling her that her district opposes the Republican candidate on the issues The Democratic candidate spends a year on the campaign trail repeating this line Then on election night the candidate and the party claim that she lost because the district was Republican 15 Our candidate did well considering he was up against an entrenched incumbent This is the least bogus spin Generally incumbents do have enormous advantages in clout money and name recognition But when a challenger has these advantages and still manages to lose his party will invoke the entrenched incumbent excuse anyway 16 Our candidate did well to make the race close This is the corollary to spin No 9 If your candidate was blown out you brush it off by saying it was never really a race If your candidate wasn t blown out you call this an achievement 17 Their candidate won thanks to a vocal minority This will be the trademark spin of this year s elections Everyone knows turnout will be low So if you lose you can always claim that the silent nonvoting majority supported your candidate 18 Their candidate won on our issues The GOP s 1996 treatment of Clinton is an excellent example Throughout the campaign Republicans call the Democratic candidate a liberal After he wins they say he won by running as a conservative 19 Our candidate lost on their issues If Republican Matt Fong loses the California Senate race conservatives will say he blew it because he s a squish i e a moderate If Democrat Glenn Poshard loses the Illinois governor s race liberals will say he blew it because he s anti abortion 20 The polls show voters support us If your party gets creamed you can always find comfort in the exit polls Somewhere in the blizzard of questions a couple of findings will suggest that voters sort of agreed with your party s position on something or other even if they voted against all your candidates And after all
