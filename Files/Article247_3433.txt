 Worries of the Corporate Elite Received last night 11 p m Russ I m pretty much written out but a couple of things To say that corporations rather than the government are driving economic policy isn t to say that they have absolute power After all even dictators have to worry about justifying their policies hence the centrality of propaganda to fascist and Communist regimes and can t do everything they want there is always the danger of provoking a rebellion Of course in the United States and other Western countries the corporate elite has to worry about public sentiment expressed not only in elections but in organized opposition however weak there still is some from the labor movement the environmental movement etc It has taken 25 years since the first big push toward austerity and deregulation in the 70s to seriously erode the liberal welfare state and there is still major resistance to the privatization of Social Security significant erosion of Medicare and so on But corporate economic and political pressure has steadily pushed public policy in this direction regardless of whether Republicans or Democrats are in office The term hate crime doesn t get at what I think is the real issue that certain kinds of crimes are not just aimed at a particular victim but are meant to intimidate or send a message to a whole class of people whether to stay out of certain neighborhoods hide their sexuality stop performing abortions or whatever In other words such crimes are a form of political terrorism They are often committed by groups the classic example is lynching It seems clear to me that this kind of intimidation should be recognized for what it is and specifically punished The question is how best to do it The problem with the idea of hate crime aside from the fact that violent crime is inherently hateful as you say is that it doesn t distinguish between deliberate terrorism and acts that may be motivated in whole or in part by bigotry but don t have a purposeful agenda behind them Rather I would define the crime as intimidating citizens from exercising their civil rights which refers to behavior rather than thought or emotion and require evidence of intent and premeditation I would make it a distinct crime that would have to be charged and proved separately from charges of murder assault etc Till tomorrow Ellen
