                    Background        This paper is the first in a twopaper series It        addresses whether there are statistically significant        clusters of cancer on Long Island The second paper           examines whether the patterns in cancer are spatially        associated with patterns in the environment specifically        air toxics This set of two studies were prompted by        ongoing concern over cancer patterns on Long Island        Citizens and public health workers are concerned about two        things  whether cancer clusters exist and if so what may        explain the clusters The possibility of breast cancer        clusters on Long Island has been in the news and the focus        of recent research     New York state had the         thhighest death rate from breast cancer in  though        it was  thin colorectal cancer and  thin lung cancer            While breast cancer rates are higher in the        Northeastern US than in other parts of the country        Kulldorff et al    established that the entire New        YorkPhiladelphia metropolitan area has higher breast        cancer mortality rates than the remainder of the Northeast        The analysis performed by the New York State Department of        Health which used the average cancer incidencepopulation        for New York as a whole as a reference located significant        elevations in breast cancer on Long Island in particular        Even when compared to New York state as a whole the cancer        rates on Long Island seem to be elevated Given the concern        and the apparent elevation of cancer rates on Long Island        we focused our study on Nassau Queens and Suffolk        counties the easternmost three counties on Long        Island                    Methods                  Data          The New York State Department of Health NYSDOH          published the cancer incidence data online as part of          their Cancer Surveillance Improvement Initiative          httpwwwhealthstatenyusnysdohcancercsiinyscsiihtm          These data represent newly diagnosed cancer cases in the          period  assigned to the patients residence at          diagnosis and they are calculated as the number of          cancers for each  people in the population When          we began this study August  the NYSDOH had          released data on three cancers breast female only          colorectal female and male and lung female and male          cancers Since then they released data on prostate          cancer for the years  which we did not include in          this study Data has not yet been added for years other          than  for the three cancers we analyzed          To protect patient privacy the NYSDOH data provided          case counts referenced to ZIP codes rather than          individual residences ZIP codes are regions developed          for mail delivery by the US Postal Service In the study          area the population in ZIP codes ranges between           individuals with a mean of about           using  US Census numbers          httpfactfindercensusgov They are not uniform in          population nor ethnicity nor age While ZIP codes are          somewhat arbitrary spatial units of analysis with respect          to potential health and environmental factors they          provided NYSDOH a convenient way to group the population          to protect patient confidentiality Data at a better          spatial resolution were not made available to us We          combined the cancer diagnosis data with ZIP code boundary          files reflecting the geography in November  We          purchased the boundary files from Claritas Corporation          httpwwwclaritascom While the NYSDOH provides          information on the entire state we focus on the  ZIP          codes within Nassau Queens and Suffolk County on Long          Island          People move between ZIP codes and cancer latency the          time between causative exposures and cancer onset is          estimated to be between  years for these cancers so          the ZIP code where the patient was diagnosed may not be          the location where the cancer developed nor where          causative exposures occurred We do not include any          adjustments for migration or changes in any demographic          patterns within the study area          While the observed cancer diagnosis data did adjust          for different populationsatrisk in the different ZIP          codes we also used New York States adjustment for          different age patterns as well Because cancer incidence          is related to age NYSDOH calculated the expected cancer          incidence for each ZIP code using the ZIP codes age          structure and the average incidence by age class for New          York state We calculated a standardized morbidity ratio          SMR by dividing the observed value by the ageadjusted          expected incidence An SMR value of  indicates that          the observed incidence is the same as expected lower          than  indicates that fewer than expected cases of          cancer occurred and greater than  indicates that more          than expected occurred                          Local Cluster Analysis          We identified significant clustering and spatial          outliers in SMR using Anselins local Moran test    in          the ClusterSeer software          httpwwwterraseercomclusterseerhtml The local          Moran test evaluates local clustering or spatial          autocorrelation by evaluating the contribution of each          location to the Morans I statistic for the whole study          area Its null hypothesis is that there is no association          between SMR values in neighboring ZIP codes no spatial          autocorrelation The working alternative hypothesis is          that spatial clustering exists The statistic is                    where I           i is the statistic for ZIP code i z           i is the difference between the SMR at          i and the mean SMR for Long Island z           j is the difference between the SMR at          j and the mean for Long Island w           ij is a weight so that the statistic          only considers neighbors that share a common border w           ij is n if the two ZIP codes are          neighbors using the rook contiguity relationship where n          is the number of rook neighbors and w           ij is zero otherwise We evaluated          the test statistic using Monte Carlo Pvalues              obtained from  conditional randomizations of the          dataset Because it is possible for local clusters to          overlap because of shared neighbors we therefore used an          adjusted significance level Bonferroni adjustment to          evaluate Pvalues             The local Moran test as we used it evaluates ratio          data in this case the SMR It does not however          consider whether that ratio is based on many or few          cases A ratio based on few observed or expected cases          small ZIP code population is more unstable than one          based on more cases To evaluate the stability of the SMR          for significant clusters we calculated its confidence          interval     The confidence intervals increase as the          observed number of cases decreases Confidence intervals          that overlap  indicate no statistically significant          difference from the expected ratio                            Results                  Colorectal CancerLocal Cluster Analysis                      Females            The local Moran test identified two local clusters            with SMRs about  higher than the New York            average centered on Bayport ZIP  and            Southampton  Table  Figure  Wainscott             is a significant spatial outlier with an SMR             of New York states average Wainscotts SMR            however has wide confidence intervals due to the small            number of observed cases there Thus while            statistically distinct from its neighbors it does not            have significantly reduced risk                                Males            For colorectal cancer in males the local Moran test            identified five local clusters with SMR values over             higher than the New York average Table  Figure             These clusters share some ZIP codes in common they            form two large rather than five small clusters The            western cluster is comprised of two significant local            clusters centered on Shirley  and Mastic             The eastern cluster has three significant            local clusters centered on Southampton  Water            Mill  and Sagaponak  Wading River             is a significant spatial outlier with an SMR            about  of the New York state average While Wading            River is a significant outlier under the local Moran            test its SMR has a wide confidence interval due to the            small number of observed cases there Thus while            statistically distinct from its neighbors it does not            have significantly reduced risk                                    Breast Cancer  Local Cluster Analysis          We identified two local clusters with SMRs  of          the New York average These significant local clusters of          low cancer overlap to form one larger cluster centered          on Floral Park ZIP  and Woodside in Flushing           Table  Figure  The local Moran test also          detected two local clusters with SMR  higher than          the New York average These significant local clusters          also overlap and are centered on Southampton  and          Wainscott  Shelter Island  is a          significant spatial outlier though its confidence          intervals are wide and overlap  due to the small          number of observed cases there Thus while statistically          distinct from its neighbors it does not have          significantly reduced risk                          Lung Cancer  Local Cluster Analysis                      Females            The local Moran test identified three clusters with            SMR about  of the New York average Figure  Table             These three local clusters are contiguous share            ZIP codes and together comprise a single large            cluster extending through portions of Flushing in the            north and Jamaica in the south This cluster is            centered on Flushing ZIPs  and  and Saint            Albans in Jamaica  Sayville  is a            significant spatial outlier with low SMR  of the            New York average though its SMR has a wide confidence            interval resulting from the small number of observed            cases there Thus while statistically distinct from            its neighbors it does not have significantly reduced            risk            Seven local clusters of high SMR values occurred in            the more central portions of Long Island Table             Figure  There is a cluster in northmid Long Island            made up of two significant local clusters centered on            Bayville  and Mill Neck  This cluster            has about  higher SMR than the New York state            average A large cluster in south central Long Island            is composed of four local clusters centered on            Ronkonkama  Central Islip  Islip            Terrace  and East Islip  This cluster            has an SMR about  higher than the New York state            average Further east is a third cluster of high female            lung cancer incidence centered on Mastic  and            including several adjacent ZIP codes Its SMR is about             higher than the New York state average                                Males            Three local clusters of low SMR values were            identified centering on Great Neck ZIP  Roslyn             and Huntington  all in the northwest            portion of Long Island Figure  Table  These            clusters are typified by lung cancer SMR values that            are  of the New York State average The two            clusters centered on  and  are adjacent to            one another forming a single large cluster of low lung            cancer SMR for males In addition Far Rockaway             and Moriches  are significant spatial outliers            with  and  of the New York SMR respectively            though the SMR confidence intervals are wide because            the number of observed cases is small in each location            Thus while statistically distinct from its neighbors            it does not have significantly reduced risk            A large cluster of lung cancer SMR  higher            than the New York average was identified in central            Long Island This larger cluster is composed of             significant local clusters centered on Farmingville             Coram  Miller Place  Middle            Island  Mastic  Mastic Beach             Shirley  Medford  and Sayville                                                  Discussion                  Comparison to Prior Studies                      Qualitative differences in clusters            Some differences are immediately apparent when one            compares for breast cancer the scan statistic            clusters            httpwwwhealthstatenyusnysdohcancercsiinyscsiihtmto            the local Moran clusters Figure  Under the scan            statistic all of eastern and most of western Suffolk            are declared a cluster as are substantial portions of            Nassau and the western portions of Long Island In            contrast the local Moran statistic finds significant            clustering only in the southern fork towards Montauk            and identifies a significant clustering of low breast            cancer morbidity on western Long Island Boundaries in            breast cancer morbidity occur throughout Long Island            and identify adjacent ZIP codes that differ            substantially in cancer morbidity     Hence the            local Moran and boundary approaches identify clusters            on a finer spatial scale while the scan approach is            identifying larger clusters            In addition the scan statistic clusters include            groups of ZIP codes that in fact have cancer            morbidity             below the New York State average            For example the North Fork is deemed part of a            significant cluster of elevated incidence even though            the contiguous ZIP codes  SMR   and             SMR   are below the expected value Why might            this be First the scan statistic evaluates geographic            relationships using centroids and a circular scan            window Hence relevant geographies such as Peconic            bay are not taken into account In effect the cancer            morbidities on the North Fork are lumped with the            cancer morbidities on the south fork The local Moran            approach by evaluating geographic relationships using            common borders doesnt connect ZIP codes on the North            Fork to ZIP codes on the South Fork It is indeed a            local statistic hence its name and is sensitive            only to local clusters of cancer morbidity Second the            scale of the study is different for the scan statistic            and for the local Moran and boundary analyses The NYS            Department of Health applied the scan method to New            York as a whole while the local Moran and boundary            analyses used only the ZIP codes in Long Island Each            of these techniques employs randomization methods to            evaluate statistical significance and the results            therefore may vary when one includes more areas in the            analysis            To summarize the local Moran clusters and the            boundaries in breast cancer incidence quantify spatial            pattern on a finer spatial scale than scan statistic            clusters This arises because the local Moran and            boundary analysis techniques use ZIP code zone            adjacency sharing of a common border rather than            distance between centroids to evaluate geographic            relationships and because the scale of the study            differs                                The scale of the process            This general result  the local Moran results and            the boundary analysis results identify finer scale            variation while the scan approach picks up larger            scale clusters  holds for all cancers considered and            is to be expected given the differences in the methods            An understanding of how results vary as a function of            the scale of the study and as a function of the spatial            sensitivity of the method is important for us to            evaluate geographic variation in cancer morbidity We            should expect potential exposures as well as cancer            correlates and covariates to have local as well as            largescale components At the local scale            neighborhoods can change dramatically from one location            to another and many putative exposures involve point            sources that have local impacts for example fuel            leaks from underground storage tanks are often limited            to a few hundred cubic yards of contaminated soil But            we also know that windborne pollutants can impact much            larger areas as can agricultural pesticides and            contaminants carried in ground water Hence the            techniques we employ should be sensitive to multiscale            geographic heterogeneity and thus able to identify the            fine local scale variation that may be underlying            exposures andor genetic differences at the local            level as well as regional and subregional            patterns                                The scale of the study            While both the local Moran and scan statistics            assess statistical significance of a cluster relative            to the morbidity for New York state as a whole we            consider only Long Island ZIP codes in the local Moran            analysis while the NYS scan analysis considers ZIP            codes for all of New York state Both statistics local            Moran and scan use randomization techniques that            sprinkle morbidity values over the study area in            order to construct reference distributions under the            null hypothesis Thus the null hypothesis for the local            Moran analysis is no spatial structure in breast cancer            incidence in Long Island whereas the null hypothesis            for the scan statistic is no spatial structure in            breast cancer incidence in all of New York State Our            randomization approach resampled the data under the            null hypothesis that a cancer incidence observed in a            Long Island ZIP code is equally likely to occur in any            other Long Island ZIP code This means cancer risk on            was assumed to be equal across Long Island By            randomizing across all of New York State the NYSDOH            study assumed cancer risk to be equal across New York            State and that for example risk on Long Island is the            same as risk in the Adirondacks According to the            NYSDOH study much of Long Island is included in            clusters defined by higher incidence of breast cancer            male and female colorectal cancer and female lung            cancer            This illustrates the spatial scale of the study is            closely related to the questions being addressed For            the local Moran analysis we are asking questions            specific to Long Island against a null hypothesis that            states that cancer risk is uniform across Long Island            In their analysis using the scan statistic the NYSDOH            is addressing questions regarding cancer incidence in            all of New York State against the implicit assumption            that risk is uniform across the entire state However            the standardized morbidity ratio SMR is the ratio of            the diagnoses in Long Island ZIP codes divided by the            expected value calculated from New York State averages            Thus it is still meaningful to compare our results to            the statelevel scan results We identified clusters on            Long Island that are exceptional compared to the state            averages that went into the expected value            calculation                                The evaluation of geographic relationships            The techniques employed by the local Moran and            boundary techniques evaluate geographic relationships            using the ZIP code and census geography of Long Island            In contrast the scan technique employed by New York            State uses ZIP code centroids and circles drawn around            those centroids to represent Long Islands geography            Because of its long and forked appearance the            geography of Long Island is poorly represented by            centroids and circles How geographic relationships are            evaluated is intimately linked to the description of            geographic variation patterns and to cluster            detection                                The Meaning of Geographic Variation            The term clustering by and of itself is so generic            as to be almost meaningless for describing spatial            variation in cancer morbidity First the differences            between cluster detection methods already used to            analyze Long Island data illustrate the notion of a            cluster is meaningless without a precise description of            the statistical test and its expectations And second            an analysis approach that employs just one kind of            cluster test is inappropriate Obviously a given            technique will only detect the kinds of clusters it was            designed to detect In fact experience has            demonstrated that cancer morbidity evinces rich            geographic variation and we therefore should employ a            variety of techniques to more fully describe relevant            aspects of spatial pattern                                All Methods are Subjective            Because they are founded on assumptions and are more            or less sensitive to different aspects of spatial            pattern all techniques for statistical pattern            recognition are subjective because they are founded on            assumptions and are more or less sensitive to different            aspects of spatial pattern The spatial scan is based            on a likelihood statistic it uses centroids of areas            to define spatial relationships employs circular scan            areas and is univariate Clearly clusters can be            multivariate and not just univariate they can be            other shapes than circular there are techniques other            than centroids for evaluating spatial relationships            and likelihood is just one of several statistical            approaches for identifying departures from a background            morbidity The point is not that the scan statistic is            somehow flawed  in fact it is one of the most            powerful statistical techniques for identifying            univariate clusters with the abovedefined            characteristics Rather the point is that there are            many different aspects to spatial pattern In order to            explore these different aspects researchers need to            employ a variety of methods to more fully elucidate            characterize and quantify the geography of cancer            morbidity The scan statistic is but one tool we can            bring to bear on the study of geographic variation in            cancer morbidity                                      Conclusion        This is a methodological and comparative study to        evaluate whether there is substantial benefit added by        using a variety of techniques for geographic pattern        detection at different spatial scales        This paper demonstrates that there is significant        spatial pattern of cancer in Nassau Queens and Suffolk        counties on Long Island New York The general pattern that        there are clusters of higher than expected cancer incidence        on Long Island is consistent with other studies of the same        area though the exact locations and shapes of the clusters        vary with the methods used by different researchers        Several authors have observed that neither pvalues nor        confidence limits provide enough information to assess        whether or not there is a true disease cluster caused by an        environmental exposure We advocate that the best approach        would be to analyze the data using several cluster        detection techniques and if the area still sticks out like        a sore thumb there may be something there As different        tests identify different aspects of cluster morphology the        best characterization comes from an understanding of        cluster shape size length magnitude of excess        probability of occurrence location of boundaries or        gradients relative locations of clusters and boundaries to        each other and finally correspondence of geographic        patterns in health outcomes to potential exposures        The differences in our results and that of the NYSDOH        underscore the need for an exploratory integrative and        multiscalar approach to assessing geographic patterns of        disease as different methods identify different patterns        A concordance of the results from several different        approaches increases the analysts confidence that the        suspected cluster indeed is unusual By using several        different methods  scan statistic boundary analysis        local Moran  one is able to derive a more complete        understanding of geographic variation in cancer morbidity        on Long Island One benefit is that researchers can now        focus etiologic investigations at the finer spatial scales        where local excesses in cancer morbidity are found on Long        Island Specifically using a battery of approaches allows        us to quantify different aspects of clusters to explore        different scales of clustering and to evaluate how        sensitive the results are to different definitions of        clustering        We recommend that future studies of geographic patterns        use a concordance of evidence from a multiscalar        integrative geographic approach to assure that  different        aspects of spatial pattern are fully identified and  the        results from the suite of analyses are logically        consistent        The obvious question after finding significant clusters        of elevated and lower cancer incidence is  why Could this        pattern be explained by environmental exposures by        differences in social factors such as socioeconomic        status or ethnicity or another factor that varies over        this study region We cannot exclude any particular        explanation as this study did not consider any economic        ethnic or environmental exposure data We do however        consider one possible factor in the second paper in this        set airborne carcinogens     But as this is a study        of encountered data and data that are aggregated to a        coarse spatial scale it would be impossible to establish        causation from these data on their own                    Authors contributions        Authors GMJ and DAG
