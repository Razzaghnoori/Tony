 The Return of the L Word Dear Brent Well I know Bradley s formal announcement is hardly news he s been running for president for years now hasn t he but I was struck by the stories this morning Never mind the aw shucks stuff We expected that Also the now de rigueur claims that he ll restore the dignity of the Oval Office won t be driven by polls etc etc What interested me was his unabashed old fashioned capital L liberal pitch He s really running on the idea of helping poor people strengthening the weak and challenging the strong and spreading the new stock market prosperity to the least among us I m not complaining more power to him if he can pull it off But it sort of amazes me that he thinks it will work in late 1990s America Just a few years ago the very word liberal was taboo And the ever astute Clinton would no more claim to be a liberal than he would try a tell a story about himself without spin Remember all that stuff about triangulating and the Democrats as the party of the suburban middle class I didn t think I d see another declared liberal Democrat in my lifetime outside of New York City of course And what I really wonder is Could Bradley be on to something politically Is the me too generation finally growing up and looking beyond itself Is the comfortable middle class so comfortable now that people feel they can afford to be liberal again Arthur Schlesinger Jr always told us this would happen that American politics run in cycles of conservative constraint and liberal largesse and I suppose in his own way Bush too has signaled that he sees a new mood dawning With compassionate conservatism he too is banking on a sense that the public wants to think of itself as generous again now generous caring altruistic and yes let s face it liberal The question remains of course how What can we as a nation really do to help the poor and the left out And Bush s ostensibly conservative ideas could turn out to be more effectively liberal than Bradley s more conventionally liberal ones But I must say I m struck by the shift in rhetoric and what it says about both men s readings of the national mood Which brings us back to where we were yesterday Are there other means of achieving equal opportunity than with preferences It sounds as if you and I agree completely on that The answer is education and what I call development Narrow the gap in black white school achievement and you won t need to put your thumb on the scale of college admissions or hiring or promotions or anything else And yes I agree Ward Connerly took a principled stand for just that long term solution when he endorsed the ACLU suit pressing for better schools in poor areas of California But the question here too it seems to me is precisely how do you do it How do we make the schools really work for poor kids What do we do about the parenting that doesn t prepare them for school How do we counteract the peer pressure that tells them not to bother in class because it s acting white And who exactly should be doing all this the government or the charitable private sector or some combination of the two I m sorry if I sound like a broken record but I always come back to the same question the means I m thrilled that the public may be feeling more compassionate now But that s only the beginning of the conversation not the end of it The devil and answer is in the details We may all be liberals again now but what exactly are we going to do about it All best Tamar
