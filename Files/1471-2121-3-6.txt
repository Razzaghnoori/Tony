 Background Differentiation is commonly associated with intermingled changes in gene expression and cellular proliferation In some differentiating cell types changes in both gene transcription and proliferation are regulated by the same transcription factor 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 CCAAT Enhancer Binding Protein alpha C EBP is a transcription factor that is required for the differentiation of a number of tissues 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Mice homozygous for C EBP null alleles have severe defects in tissues involved in metabolic homeostasis 19 20 21 Cellular proliferation is elevated in the liver of these knockout mice 22 suggesting that C EBP blocks proliferation in vivo In cultured cells C EBP expression leads to decreased colony formation upon antibiotic selection 23 24 25 decreased DNA synthesis 22 24 25 26 27 and an enhanced proportion of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle 26 Thus C EBP regulates cellular proliferation as well as gene transcription C EBP contains a bZIP domain conserved at the carboxy terminus of a number of transcription factors 12 28 The bZIP domain consists of a basic region that binds directly to DNA followed immediately by a leucine zipper C EBP dimerizes via the leucine zipper This dimerization is required for DNA binding 28 29 At least three transcription activation functions have been described in the more amino terminal regions of C EBP 30 31 32 C EBP domains and activities associated with proliferation arrest also have been identified but vary considerably between studies 23 25 33 34 35 36 C EBP binds to and activates transcription of the gene promoter for the p21 inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinase CDK 37 This led to speculation that p21 gene activation may contribute to cell cycle arrest by C EBP 37 Similarly suppression of mitotic growth during adipocyte differentiation was associated with C EBP activation of the promoters of gadd45 growth arrest and DNA damage inducible gene 45 gas2 and gas3 growth arrest associated genes 2 and 3 5 6 38 39 However C EBP mutants defective in DNA binding still blocked proliferation 25 33 This suggested that direct promoter activation was unnecessary or redundant for C EBP proliferation arrest 18 Possible mechanisms of transcription independent proliferation arrest by C EBP have been suggested by a number of studies Decreased proliferation was associated with C EBP stabilization of the p21 protein 22 24 p21 interacted directly with a large internal segment of C EBP that included transcription activation domain 3 25 see Fig 1A CDK2 and CDK4 also interacted with segments of C EBP close to and within transcription activation domain 3 36 CDK2 also interacted with the basic region of the C EBP 25 p21 also has a second interaction site within the leucine zipper of C EBP 25 in vitro C EBP enhanced p21 inhibition of CDK2 activity C EBP inhibition of CDK2 activity correlated with p21 binding to C EBP transcription activation domain 3 25 However proliferation arrest by C EBP still occurred in cell lines not containing p21 genes 40 This indicated that proliferation arrest by C EBP did not rely solely upon C EBP enhancement of CDK inhibition by p21 Another mechanism reported for proliferation blockage by C EBP involves the E2F DP1 transcription complexes E2F complexes activate genes required for entry into S phase C EBP binds to and inhibits transcriptional activation by E2F 26 33 The complex of E2F with the retinoblastoma related p107 protein is prevalent in cycling cells Transcription activation domain 2 of C EBP was observed to interact specifically with p107 to disrupt p107 E2F complex formation 34 35 Disruption of E2F activity also was associated the basic domain of C EBP 33 34 Thus a variety of interactions and mechanisms are potentially involved in proliferation arrest by C EBP This variability may indicate divergent mechanisms for the block of proliferation by C EBP in different study conditions and or cell types In pituitary cells C EBP is part of a multi subunit complex 41 42 that activates the growth hormone 42 and prolactin 43 44 promoters Full length C EBP is absent from the pituitary progenitor GHFT1 5 cell line 42 45 in which ectopically expressed C EBP activates co transfected growth hormone and prolactin promoters 42 44 45 We show here that ectopically expressed C EBP prolongs GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle in a transcription independent fashion Different C EBP domains were required for G1 and S phase arrest C EBP domains previously described for the interaction with p21 were not required for arrest in GHFT1 5 cells Rather domains previously implicated in the regulation of the E2F and CDK2 pathways by C EBP were required for arrest of these progenitor cells Results Transcriptionally active and inactive GFP fusions with C EBP The domains of C EBP and their known interactions with cell cycle proteins are summarized in figure 1A We conducted studies to determine which if any of those activities affect the proliferation of GHFT1 5 pituitary progenitor cells In prior studies we noticed that fewer cells were present in GHFT1 5 cell cultures transfected with the C EBP expression vector than in cultures transfected with control vectors X Wang F S unpublished data The decreased cell number might be due to impaired proliferation of GHFT1 5 cells expressing C EBP To examine if C EBP affected the progression of GHFT1 5 cells through the cell cycle we needed to distinguish transfected cells that expressed C EBP from those that did not We fused the cDNA for the green fluorescence protein GFP to either the 5 GFP C EBP or the 3 C EBP GFP end of the coding sequence of the C EBP cDNA The cDNAs for the GFP C EBP and C EBP GFP fusion proteins were inserted into an expression vector and transfected into GHFT1 5 cells Flow cytometry was used to specifically identify green fluorescent C EBP expressing cells We initially characterized the abilities of the C EBP GFP and GFP C EBP fusion proteins to bind DNA and activate transcription in GHFT1 5 cells Fig 2 The C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP expression vectors were transfected into GHFT1 5 cells with a promoter consisting of a single C EBP binding site upstream of the growth hormone TATA box This minimal promoter was specifically responsive to C EBP expression in GHFT1 5 cells 45 46 Cells transfected with the C EBP GFP expression vector showed a statistically significant p 0 05 n 5 9 66 6 08 fold higher promoter activity than did cells sham transfected with the same expression vector deleted of the C EBP cDNA Fig 2A In contrast activation by GFP C EBP was a statistically insignificant 1 88 1 48 fold Fig 2A Promoter activation by C EBP GFP was reproducibly less than promoter activation by unfused C EBP Western blots of nuclear extracts from the transfected cells showed that unfused C EBP was expressed at marginally higher levels Fig 2B C EBP GFP and GFP C EBP both were expressed as intact full length proteins of the appropriate molecular weight 45 Fig 2B arrow In addition both C EBP GFP and GFP C EBP bound similarly to DNA Fig 2C Extracts of cells expressing either C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP shifted the electrophoretic mobility of a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a C EBP binding site Fig 2C No shift was observed with sham transfected cells not shown The shifted bands were specifically competed by a 100 fold molar excess of the cold oligonucleotide and were supershifted with an antibody directed against C EBP GFP C EBP truncated of its leucine zipper Fig 1B was ineffective at shifting the binding site Fig 2C LZ Flow cytometry discussed later showed that comparable levels of green fluorescence were emitted from cells expressing C EBP GFP GFP C EBP and LZ Thus C EBP GFP and GFP C EBP were expressed and could bind to C EBP binding sites in DNA but differed in their ability to activate gene transcription Cell cycle distribution of GHFT1 5 cells Transcriptionally active C EBP GFP and transcriptionally inactive GFP C EBP were compared for their effects on proliferation of GHFT1 5 cells We first determined the distribution of untransfected GHFT1 5 cells in each phase of the cell cycle GHFT1 5 cells were grown to subconfluence collected and the DNA within the cells was stained with propidium iodide The DNA content within each cell was quantified by flow cytometry as the amount of orange fluorescence from the propidium iodide stained DNA see Materials and Methods for details The fluorescence intensity measured from each cell falls into one of three populations cells centered around the lowest level of orange fluorescence cells centered around the highest level of orange fluorescence which is twice that of the lowest and cells with intermediate levels of orange fluorescence This corresponds respectively to cells containing a 2n DNA complement prior to duplication of the genome in G1 phase cells containing a 4n DNA complement following genome duplication in growth phase 2 or in mitosis G2 M and cells containing a partially replicated genome intermediate between 2n and 4n in S phase As averaged from nine independent experiments the proportion of growing GHFT1 5 cells in G1 S and G2 M corresponded to 42 38 and 20 respectively Fig 3 white bars We next synchronized GHFT1 5 cells in particular stages of the cell cycle GHFT1 5 cells were treated for 20 hours with nocodazole which prevents microtubule polymerization depolymerization and exit from M phase 47 The delivery vehicle DMSO was added to parallel cell cultures Cells also were treated with mimosine in DMSO which blocks cells in late G1 immediately before entry into S phase 48 Mimosine also prolongs some cell types in the S phase itself 48 GHFT1 5 cells grow with an average doubling time of approximately 18 to 24 hours 20 hours of treatment allowed most cells to pass through one cell cycle and to accumulate as 4n cells upon nocodazole treatment Fig 3 light gray bars or as 2n cells at the G1 S boundary upon mimosine treatment Fig 3 stippled gray bars Thus GHFT1 5 cells can be synchronized at particular stages of the cell cycle Synchronization facilitated characterization of the cell cycle stages blocked or prolonged by C EBP expression Transcriptionally active and inactive C EBP both retain GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle We determined if either C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP altered the distribution of GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 S or G2 M phases of the cell cycle GHFT1 5 cells were transfected with the expression vectors for C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP or with the sham expression vector not containing the C EBP cDNA The cells were incubated for one day to allow time for C EBP expression Cells were then synchronized in M phase or in G1 S by 20 hour incubations with nocodazole Fig 4A or mimosine Fig 4B Cells were collected and stained with propidium iodide Flow cytometry was used to measure DNA content in 1 cells transfected with the sham expression vector Fig 4 Sham 2 green fluorescent cells expressing GFP tagged C EBP Fig 4 C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP or 3 the subpopulation of cells from the C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP transfections that did not express measurable amounts of green fluorescent C EBP Fig 4 No C EBP The No C EBP cells represent an internal control for cells not expressing C EBP collected simultaneously with cells expressing C EBP The No C EBP controls also indicated the extent to which green fluorescent C EBP expressing cells were distinguished from non expressing cells by flow cytometry For all our experiments the distribution of cells in the G1 S and G2 M phases was similar for the No C EBP and sham transfected cells The expression of C EBP GFP or GFP C EBP resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the amount of cells blocked in G2 M upon nocodazole treatment compared to sham transfected cells Fig 4A p 0 01 n 6 This indicated that C EBP expression prevented a significant proportion of GHFT1 5 cells from reaching G2 M to be blocked by nocodazole When cells were blocked in G1 by mimosine treatment C EBP expression caused no decrease in the proportion of cells in G2 M Fig 4B This demonstrated that C EBP expression did not actively decrease the proportion of cells in G2 M The C EBP induced reduction in cells blocked in G2 M was associated with a highly statistically significant increase in the proportion of GHFT1 5 pituitary progenitor cells in G1 p 0 001 and a statistically significant increase in the proportion of cells in S phase p 0 03 Fig 4A This retention of GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle occurred for both the transcriptionally active C EBP GFP and inactive GFP C EBP fusions The independence of C EBP induced proliferation arrest from C EBP regulated transcriptional activation also has been observed in other studies 25 26 Thus simple transcription activation mechanisms do not account for the effect of C EBP on the cell cycle Targeting of C EBP to the presumed centromeric G1 S checkpoint is insufficient for prolongation of G1 Our prior fluorescence microscopy studies showed that C EBP GFP GFP C EBP and antibody stained C EBP 45 46 concentrated at specific intranuclear domains in GHFT1 5 cells see Fig 5A GFP C EBP These domains coincide with regions that stain with the blue fluorescent DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 Fig 5A Hoechst 33342 Hoechst 33342 stains AT rich DNA that concentrates around the centromeres 45 49 Given the role of the centromere as a checkpoint for regulation of the mitotic phase of the cell cycle 50 51 it was hypothesized that C EBP localization around the centromere could play a role in C EBP regulation of the cell cycle 49 To investigate if targeting of C EBP to the peri centromeric chromatin is necessary or sufficient to cause G1 and S phase prolongation in GHFT1 5 cells we first determined the domain of C EBP required to target C EBP to the peri centromeric chromatin It was previously suggested that the peri centromeric targeting of C EBP was a function of DNA binding C EBP binding sites are concentrated within the repeated DNA sequences that comprise the bulk of peri centromeric chromatin 49 Indeed C EBP truncated to contain little more than the DNA binding bZIP domain still concentrated at peri centromeric chromatin 45 By contrast C EBP deleted of amino acids 310 to 358 Fig 1B LZ no longer targeted to the peri centromeric DNA Fig 5B This deletion disrupts DNA binding Fig 2C by eliminating the leucine zipper required for DNA binding by all members of the bZIP family of transcription factors 52 Thus as predicted 49 the bZIP domain is necessary and sufficient for C EBP targeting to peri centromeric chromatin When expressed in GHFT1 5 cells LZ was as effective as full length GFP C EBP in prolonging both G1 and S Fig 6A Thus leucine zipper dimerization site specific DNA binding and targeting of C EBP to peri centromeric were not required for C EBP prolongation in G1 and S In contrast the isolated C EBP bZIP DNA binding domain Fig 1B DBD which still targeted to peri centromeric chromatin did not prolong G1 Fig 6B S phase remained prolonged upon DBD expression The different effects of the isolated DBD on G1 and S blockage indicated that C EBP regulation of G1 and S phase arrest was mechanistically distinct Thus C EBP regulates proliferation by two distinct pathways Both pathways do not depend upon site specific DNA binding which is commonly considered a prerequisite for gene specific transcription Prolongation in G1 requires the amino terminal domain of C EBP The C EBP DBD therefore was insufficient for prolongation of G1 Fig 6B We next determined which additional domains of C EBP were required for G1 prolongation C EBP amino acids 1 154 or 154 257 were appended to the DBD see Fig 1B The addition of amino acids 1 154 Fig 7 DBD 1 154 caused a statistically significant increase relative to sham transfected cells in the proportion of cells in G1 p 0 01 n 6 The proportion of cells in G1 was not statistically different in cells expressing DBD 1 154 from that in cells expressing full length C EBP GFP Adding amino acids 1 125 instead of amino acids 1 154 caused a similar prolongation in G1 Fig 7 DBD 1 125 Thus an element in the amino terminal domain of C EBP was required for G1 prolongation In contrast addition of amino acids 154 257 to C EBP DBD did not rescue G1 prolongation Fig 7 DBD 154 257 Again appending amino acids 1 125 to this mutant restored G1 prolongation A126 153 as did amino acids 1 97 A 98 153 All of the mutants contained the DBD and prolonged the cell cycle in S phase Fig 7 Thus the DNA binding bZIP domain was sufficient to direct S phase regulation by C EBP whereas amino acids 1 97 contained a domain required for G1 regulation Discussion C EBP prolongs GHFT1 5 cells in G1 and S The differentiative and anti mitotic actions of C EBP have been observed in a variety of cell culture models 23 24 26 40 53 To date studies of the C EBP block of proliferation have relied on comparing the growth 23 24 25 40 or DNA synthetic 22 24 25 26 27 rates of C EBP expressing and non expressing cells These studies suggest that multiple possibly independent mechanisms may contribute to C EBP arrest in a variety of cells 18 23 24 25 26 33 34 35 36 37 40 54 55 56 Studies that distinguish the anti proliferative actions of C EBP at different phases of the cell cycle and in specific cell types may clarify these discrepancies Our studies showed that C EBP expression prolonged the proliferation of GHFT1 5 pituitary progenitor cells at two different phases of the cell cycle G1 and S Fig 4 A G1 block has been reported previously in C EBP expressing mouse L cells 26 However those studies did not define the activities within C EBP required for that blockage Here we observed that prolongation in G1 required the amino terminal 97 amino acids of C EBP Fig 7 In contrast amino acids 1 to 97 were not required for S phase arrest Figs 6 7 This showed that C EBP prolongation of GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 and S phases occurred through molecularly distinct pathways Such distinct effects on G1 and S may contribute to the wide variations in mechanisms reported to date to participate in proliferation arrest by C EBP Cell Cycle Proteins and C EBP Inhibition of Proliferation Candidate mechanisms for the block of proliferation by C EBP include 1 activation of the gene promoters of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor p21 37 gadd45 5 6 gas2 and gas3 38 39 2 post transcriptional stabilization of p21 22 or 3 interactions of C EBP with cell cycle proteins including p21 22 24 25 55 CDK2 25 36 CDK4 36 retinoblastoma 54 the retinoblastoma related protein p107 34 and the G1 S regulating E2F transcription complex 26 33 Fig 1A We found that transcriptional activation domain 3 and the leucine zipper were not required for prolongation of either G1 or S Fig 7 These domains interact with p21 CDK2 and CDK4 22 24 25 36 55 Thus C EBP interactions with at least p21 and CDK4 were not required for the anti proliferative actions of C EBP in GHFT1 5 cells CDK2 and other proteins also interact with another domain of C EBP 25 required for proliferation arrest discussed below Arrest in S phase was associated with amino acids 259 to 310 Fig 6 which include the basic amino acid rich DNA binding region of C EBP C EBP deleted of the leucine zipper dimerization domain also required for DNA binding 25 Fig 2C was as effective as full length GFP C EBP in prolonging both S and G1 Fig 6A Thus DNA binding per se was not required for proliferation arrest The basic region of C EBP blocks the transcriptional activity of E2F by unknown mechanisms 33 and contains another known CDK2 interaction site 25 Either of these activities may contribute to basic region dependent S phase arrest of GHFT1 5 cell proliferation G1 block in GHFT1 5 cells required C EBP amino acids 1 97 Fig 7 comprising activation domains 1 and 2 31 Amino acids 1 to 97 have been implicated in C EBP growth arrest via the E2F pl07 complexes 34 35 C EBP interaction with p107 is believed to prevent the formation of an S phase promoting complex containing p107 and E2F 26 34 35 Thus G1 block in GHFT1 5 cells may be related to the ability of C EBP to interact with p107 However the amino terminus of C EBP also functionally interacts with a number of other factors 31 45 46 any of which might contribute to proliferation arrest Subnuclear Architecture and C EBP Inhibition of Proliferation Tang and Lane 49 showed that C EBP becomes associated with peri centromeric chromatin upon expression during adipocyte differentiation We observed that C EBP expressed in mouse pituitary progenitor GHFT1 5 cells also localized to peri centromeric chromatin 45 Here we show that targeting of C EBP to peri centromeric chromatin in GHFT1 5 cells required the DNA binding domain of C EBP Fig 5 However C EBP deleted of the DNA binding domain was as effective as full length C EBP in prolonging GHFT1 5 cells in the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle Fig 6A Thus the specific association of C EBP with peri centromeric chromatin speculated to contribute to C EBP growth arrest 49 was not necessary for disruption of the cell cycle by C EBP The independence of C EBP regulation of proliferation from its intranuclear localization may even be necessary since we have recently determined that pituitary cell differentiation is associated with the dispersal of C EBP from peri centromeric heterochromatin by the pituitary specific transcription factor Pit 1 J F E M A Kawecki F S R N D submitted Transcription Independent Inhibition of Proliferation Transcription factors like C EBP may regulate cell proliferation by directly controlling the expression of proteins required for cell cycle progression Indeed C EBP activates transcription of the p21 37 gadd45 5 6 gas2 and gas3 38 39 genes However similar levels of p21 mRNA in the livers of wild type and homozygous C EBP knock out mice 22 argue against a physiologically significant contribution of C EBP to p21 gene transcription in the liver We also observed that transcriptionally inactive and DNA binding defective forms of C EBP still blocked GHFT1 5 cell proliferation in both the G1 and S phases of the cell cycle Figs 2 4 6 DNA binding defective mutants of C EBP have also been observed to block proliferation in other cell lines 25 33 Together this suggests that C EBP regulation of transcription in general might not contribute to the regulation of cell proliferation It remains possible that C EBP activation of the transcription of some cell cycle regulatory genes does control proliferation in some cell types or under certain conditions 8 37 38 39 56 The absence of a dependence of GHFT1 5 cell proliferation on transcription factor activities that are more classically associated with transcription regulation strongly suggests that C EBP and perhaps other transcription factors control proliferation and transcription through completely separable pathways The effects of human papilloma virus E7 proteins on C EBP induced differentiation and growth arrest also suggest that the effects of C EBP on proliferation are mechanistically divergent 40 Having distinct mechanisms for regulation of gene transcription and proliferation allows a transcription factor to regulate these two critical processes completely independently of one another This may be particularly important in differentiated non proliferating cells in which events that regulate a transcription factor s contribution to gene expression must be disconnected from that transcription factor s continuing blockage of proliferation Conclusions C EBP is a transcription factor that controls both proliferation and gene expression C EBP uses molecularly distinct mechanisms to prolong the G1 and S phases of pituitary progenitor GHFT1 5 cells The anti proliferative effects of C EBP do not require activities in C EBP commonly required for gene specific transcription Proliferation arrest instead corresponds with C EBP domains previously implicated in post transcriptional effects on E2F and or CDK2 activity Materials and Methods Plasmid construction The GFP C EBP vector was constructed by inserting the cDNA encoding the S65T derivative of GFP 57 at the start codon of the cDNA encoding rat C EBP The fused cDNA was cloned into a previously described expression vector 58 The GFP and C EBP portions of the fusion were separated by a 16 amino acid long linker including the epitope for the FLAG antibody The C EBP GFP vector was constructed by inserting the S65T GFP into the NcoI site present near the carboxy terminus of rat C EBP also tagged at the amino terminus with the FLAG epitope in our previously described C EBP expression vector 42 This resulted in a deletion of the last four amino acids of C EBP The DBD and DBD 154 257 derivatives of C EBP were constructed by replacing respectively the amino terminal 257 amino acids of C EBP GFP to the SgrAI site of C EBP and the amino terminal 153 amino acids of C EBP GFP to the NotI site of C EBP with oligonucleotides containing a strong Kozak sequence DBD 1 154 was constructed by replacing amino acids 155 to 257 from the NotI to SgrAI sites with an oligonucleotide The remaining constructs Fig 7 were generated by appending C EBP fragments to the NotI site of DBD 1 154 or to the SgrAI site of DBD LZ was constructed by deleting amino acids from amino acid 310 Tth111II site at the junction of the basic region and leucine zipper of C EBP to the carboxy terminus of the GFP C EBP fusion The C EBP TATA reporter used to determine the transcriptional activity of the two GFP fusion proteins was previously described 45 Transfection GHFT1 5 cells were propagated at 37 C and 5 CO 2 in Dulbecco s modified Eagle DME H21 medium supplemented with 10 fetal calf serum Approximately 1 10 7cells were transfected by electroporation as previously described 42 with 5 g of either the C EBP GFP GFP C EBP or control expression vectors Following transfection cells were propagated at 33 C Incubation at 33 C results in significantly higher levels of green fluorescence unpublished data presumably because of better folding of the jellyfish GFP Transfected cells were maintained in the dark throughout the experiment to minimize fluorescence activation of GFP prior to flow cytometry DNA Binding and Promoter Activation Electrophoretic mobility shifts assays were done by mixing a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing a consensus high affinity C EBP binding site GATCGAGCCCCATTGCGCAATCATAGATC together with extracts prepared from transfected cells as previously described 58 59 Competition with the same unlabeled oligonucleotide in 1 10 or 100 molar excess of the radiolabeled probed indicated specific binding The protein DNA complex was supershifted with an antibody directed against C EBP Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc 61 For studies of the transcriptional activation properties of the fusion proteins 1 g of the C EBP TATA vector 45 was co transfected and transcriptional activity was assessed by measuring the amount of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter expressed with and without C EBP expression 45 Fluorescence Microscopy Following transfection most cells were plated into 14 cm dishes and allowed to grow for 24 hours This ensured that the cells were not confluent by the time of collection for cell cycle analysis A small portion of the transfected cells were cultivated on a 22 22 mm No 1 borosilicate glass cover slip in a separate 6 well dish and treated with nocodazole mimosine or vehicle alone as described below The coverslips were removed for fluorescence microscopic observation immediately before collecting cells for flow cytometric analysis of DNA content and GFP expression Cells were stained 10 20 minutes with 5 g ml of the cell permeable DNA binding dye Hoechst 33342 The green fluorescence emitted from C EBP tagged with GFP and the blue fluorescence emitted from Hoechst 33342 stained DNA were readily distinguished by selectively exciting each fluorophore and capturing fluorescence emissions specific for each fluorophore using appropriate excitation and emission filter sets Chroma Technology Corporation Brattelboro VT 45 The images shown in Fig 5were acquired using an Olympus 40X PlanApochromat 0 95 numerical aperture objective on an Olympus IX 70 microscope Metamorph acquisition software Universal Imaging Corporation Downingtown PA on an Orca cooled interline camera Hamamatsu Bridgewater NJ were used to collect the images Post transfection Cell Synchronization The C EBP fusion proteins were expressed for one day following transfection after which we added to the cell culture media 100 ng ml nocodazole Sigma in dimethylsulphoxide DMSO 0 5 mM mimosine Sigma in DMSO or DMSO vehicle In some experiments cells were also grown for 48 and 72 hours post transfection before applying nocodazole data not shown The distributions of cells in G1 S and G2 M in the presence or absence of C EBP expression were similar for cells grown for 24 reported here 48 or 72 hours data not shown prior to nocodazole addition Following nocodazole mimosine or DMSO addition the transfected GHFT1 5 cells continued to be cultivated at 33 C Flow Cytometry 24 hours after drug or vehicle treatment transfected cells were trypsinized collected in DME H21 media containing 10 fetal calf serum and washed twice with PBS The harvested cells typically 5 10 6to 1 10 7cells were resuspended in 300 l of 8 g ml propidium iodide Molecular Probes in PBS containing 0 1 NP 40 and 10 g ml RNAse A then incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 minutes The cell suspension was then analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer Becton Dickinson at a flow rate of 12 l min Fluorescence of the GFP and propidium iodide bound DNA was excited with a 488 nm argon ion laser Green GFP fluorescence was collected using a 530 30 nm band pass filter and orange emission from propidium iodide bound DNA was detected using a 585 42 nm band pass filter Photomultiplier tube voltage and spectral compensation were initially set using single stained cells cells expressing GFP fusions with C EBP but not stained with propidium iodide and cells transfected with the control vector containing no GFP cDNA but stained with propidium iodide Electronic compensation was adjusted among the fluorescence channels to remove residual spectral overlap The area and width of each event were measured to discriminate intact single cells from debris and from doublet or multiple cells stuck together GFP fluorescence and propidium iodide stained DNA fluorescence was thus collected from single cells A minimum of 10 000 cellular events was collected for each sample Data was analyzed using CELLQuest software Becton Dickenson and cell cycle subset analyses of DNA histograms were performed using ModFitLT software Verity Software House Topsham ME Statistical Analysis One way analysis of variance was used to compare data from multiple independent experiments Statistically significant differences p 0 01 p 0 05 compared to the Sham transfected cells and experiment number are
