                            Lassa fever a viral hemorrhagic fever caused by the Lassa virus and commonly        transmitted by its rodent host is endemic in certain areas of West Africa where several        hundred thousand people are estimated to be infected each year The disease is asymptomatic        or mild in approximately  of infected patients but the remaining  have severe        multisystem disease Estimated overall mortality is         Death rates are particularly high for women in the third trimester of pregnancy and for        fetuses about  of which die in the uterus of infected pregnant mothers The most common        complication of Lassa fever is deafness Various degrees of deafness occur in approximately        onethird of cases and in many cases hearing loss is permanent Disease severity does not        seem to affect this complication deafness may develop in mild as well as in severe        cases        Lassa fever remains a serious challenge to public health in West Africa threatening        both local residents in rural areas and those who serve them particularly medical care        providers Ribavirin an antiviral drug has been used successfully in Lassa fever        patients but it needs to be given early and is not readily available in the infected        areas Given the ecology of the rodent host and conditions in the endemic area a vaccine        is mandatory for control Lassa vaccine initiatives have suffered from a lack of funding in        the past but bioterrorism and recent importation of the disease to the United States and        Europe have brought new resources to Lassa virus science        Early attempts to develop a Lassa fever vaccine in the s focused on killed        pathogens which caused a strong humoral response but failed to protect nonhuman primate        test animals Subsequently recombinant vaccines used vaccinia vectors carrying different        combinations of structural Lassa proteins Some of these protected  of nonhuman primates        from a lethal challenge in the absence of a strong humoral response suggesting that        cellular responses are important for protection        Use of vaccinia vectors in humans is problematic especially in areas where HIV        infection is commonimmunesuppressed individuals can develop serious skin lesionsand        several alternative vaccines based on other vectors as well as harmless vaccinia ones are        under development Thomas Geisbert and colleagues now report promising results with a        replicationcompetent vaccine based on attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus        vectors expressing the Lassa viral glycoprotein A single intramuscular vaccination        protected all four vaccinated cynomolgus macaques against a lethal challenge of a        particular Lassa strain while two control monkeys that had received empty vector died        after injection with the same dose of virus        These are encouraging results but future larger studies will need to assess the        duration of protection and demonstrate the safety of this replicationcompetent vaccine        Another crucial question is how quickly vaccinated individuals acquire protection and thus        whether the vaccine would be suitable for creating a ring of vaccination around an outbreak        zone the most likely early application of a promising candidate vaccine In addition        there are at least four different strains of the Lassa virus and an ideal vaccine should        provide protection across all strains Finally conducting trials in endemic areas many of        which lack political stability remains a serious challenge
