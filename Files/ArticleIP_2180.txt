 Hope for the Best At this juncture we all should hope for the best So concludes an especially muddled editorial Feb 25 in the Wall Street Journal The muddle was understandable given that the topic was on again off again on again Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr The Journal s editorial page spent the 1980s vilifying the whole idea of independent counsels as a scandalous waste of money and an unconstitutional infringement upon executive power But that was when Lawrence Walsh was investigating President Reagan Now that it s a Democratic president under investigation the Journal is naturally conflicted Its former thundering constitutional anathemas are now repositioned as genteel doubts about the extra legal character of an institution still evolving Still At this juncture we all should hope for the best is remarkably unhelpful advice Is there any editorial ever written to which this last sentence could not be attached Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus At this juncture we all should hope for the best Have we missed some other juncture in the course of human events at which the Journal would not have recommended that we all hope for the best Will the Journal inform its loyal readers when we may abandon the strain of hoping for the best and return to the less exhausting task of fearing the worst Do we really need the distinguished Wall Street Journal editorial page to tell us to hope for the best One might as well turn to the Journal s news pages to be told to buy low sell high When contemplating a high risk course of action such as hoping for the best it is always advisable to get a second opinion At this juncture we consulted Bill Gates Would he recommend hoping for the best At this particular juncture My dear fellow he said Don t hope for the best Demand the best And he added Buy low sell high Contest A decade ago the editor of this publication staged a contest in another publication to name the then burgeoning Iran Contra scandal The premise was that scandal handles ending in gate had become too tiresome and that Iran Contra was too clumsy This turned out to be wrong on both counts as that scandal came to be called Irangate by some and Iran Contra by most The winning name in that contest Iranamok was delightful witty and euphonious but never took off Undaunted let s try again Anybody got a good name for the now burgeoning Democratic Asian Connection Lincoln Bedroom Fund Raising Scandal Nothing racist please and nothing once again ending in gate unless it s really good Post your suggestions to The Fray our reader discussion forum or send e mail to slate msn com First prize will be a free year s subscription to Slate online a 19 95 value Oh and maybe we ll throw in a Slate baseball cap Reels on Wheels Slate readers who recall John Cassidy s article a few weeks back about a lavish Hollywood Party he attended at the home of Hollywood mogul Mike Medavoy might have enjoyed a New York Times feature about Medavoy Feb 25 The party described in the Slate piece was intended to signify Medavoy s triumph over adversity new wife new job and so on In the Times piece Medavoy touchingly describes the kindness and generosity he discovered during his adversity period Even the courier who used to bring films to me at home said he d be happy to bring them to me for nothing What a heartwarming story Calling Frank Capra Imagine a fallen mogul almost reduced to seeing movies in a movie theater saved from this humiliation by a big hearted courier If more couriers took a moment to show a bit of human compassion for the film producers in their midst this old world would be a heckuva better place Michael Kinsley
