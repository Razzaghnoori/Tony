 The Schumacher Hypothesis I staggered out of a showing of Batman Robin into Times Square The world looked evil and sad The sun was sinking out of sight at the end of 43 rd Street where signs no longer read 43 rd Street but instead 43 rd Street Adolph S Ochs Street in tongue twisting homage to the patriarch of the New York Times Five or six neon striped storefronts seem to have sprouted in the past five or six days The Disney Complex now has a Hercules Store not to mention a Hercules complex Billboards high above 42 nd Street advertise Amsterdam Beer fake movie marquees draw attention to them with chortling messages like Don t Look Up Those fake marquees first appeared during the filming of the Arnold Schwarzenegger bomb Last Action Hero Afterward they bore pseudo provocative art slogan messages of the Jenny Holzer variety So we re looking at fake ads parodying fake slogans parodying fake movie titles I wish Schwarzenegger would come back now and blow everything up again I went into McDonald s hoping to find solace in an order of Super Size Fries They were stale Where can you go these days for decent trash When I say that Batman Robin is a punishing ordeal I want you to know where I m coming from I have an appetite for Hollywood blockbusters of the sort that some literate people consider big and dumb I thought the first Warner Bros Batman Tim Burton s pulp opera had genius in it It invented a huge movie world in which the eyes could go dreaming It also had the wit to set a menacing hero against a merrymaking villain the line between good and evil grew scribbly The last Batman Joel Schumacher s Batman Forever was nowhere near as cool but it was clean campy fun from beginning to end and it rode high on a maliciously daft Jim Carrey performance I was also lucky to see Batman Forever in more pleasant surroundings than the New Times Square in a high modern movie palace in Helsinki with an audience of hip Finns who giggled at subtitles that seemed to go their own way from the script At one point the Finnish text made some kind of joke about Chevy Chase No one was saying Chevy Chase on screen or possibly could have been Now Schumacher is not a talentless filmmaker Indeed a sophistical argument could be made that his films while meretricious are always at least mildly entertaining If your next dinner party threatens to turn dull you might try antagonizing sophisticates with a Revisionist Schumacher Hypothesis St Elmo s Fire An unflinching descent into the shallowness of the Brat Pack notable for the discovery of the brooding dramatic craft of Demi Moore The Lost Boys An innocently homoerotic vampire spoof notable for the discovery of the brooding dramatic craft of Jason Patric Flatliners and Dying Young Best passed over in silence Julia Roberts is found not to be a tragedian Dying Young was really notable as the first big whoosh of air out of the balloon of Roberts megastardom Falling Down A descent into white male white collar vigilante fantasies The Grisham diptych The Client and A Time to Kill Bad movies done in style Schumacher is once again the maestro of the 8 by10s unveiling the teen idol Brad Renfro and twentysomething dreamboat Matthew McConaughey But this Schumacher is a pompous idiot your dinner guests sputter He once said on The Charlie Rose Show that he made commercial pictures like Batman so he could afford idea pictures like A Time to Kill All too true But let s at least admit his flair for trash At his best he offers an empty but internally consistent flamboyance He is skilled at evoking places Falling Down captured with precision what Los Angeles looks like on a vicious summer day He is also good with faces particularly male faces This is not to make assumptions about the man s sexuality he might just happen to be as gifted a director of slow witted male models as say George Cukor was of fast witted female actors I enjoy this aspect of Schumacher s work although I wonder in the case of A Time to Kill whether he worried about McConaughey s inability to enunciate or to assume different facial expressions The acting is not always an embarrassment in Falling Down the one Schumacher film that threatened to be decent Michael Douglas delivered one of the creepiest slow burns of the decade Batman Robin quashes the Schumacher Hypothesis for the time being I will have to return to my old contrarian standby the Unsung Greatness of Oliver Stone It has none of the minor virtues of Schumacher s other films It looks bad cluttered surfaces production design reminiscent of overblown Broadway musicals editing too fast for the eye to catch up poor staging of fast action The first few minutes are particularly trying direction seems to have been handed over to a fractious committee of prepubescent speed freaks And while this kind of movie doesn t cry out for a coherent plot it does need surprises Most of Batman Robin s clich s were parodied in advance by Austin Powers When Commissioner Gordon shows up on a TV monitor warning that Mr Freeze has taken over Gotham Museum Austin fans will think fondly of the plot spewing monologues of Basil Exposition The smirky George Clooney has no screen charisma Chris O Donnell s strutting crew cut Robin is a superfluous second superhero indistinct from the first Uma Thurman tries to interject some vampish style as Poison Ivy but the inanity of her character environmentalist turned plant woman has the audience snickering against her Alicia Silverstone as a computer whiz turned Batgirl purses her lips uncertainly With so much wrong on every front it s hard to single out a basic flaw But Schwarzenegger has to take the blame for providing no immoral center to the Batman world Each of the previous Batman films had a sly spry villainous turn with Jack Nicholson Danny DeVito and Jim Carrey dancing through their roles Schwarzenegger slowly and methodically munches his way through reams of cardboard zingers Winter has come Everyone chill The Iceman cometh etc He s Mr Freeze see Arnold has regressed to his ultraprimitive Conan the Barbarian manner except that in this case not even his big frame adds much to a waddling icicle role One of the movie s few redeeming features is partially wiped out by one of its worst excesses Elliot Goldenthal the best film composer now working has written typically imaginative music rich in jagged harmony and deft scoring That eerie wailing at the end of the title theme is a team of trilling horns Schumacher s regard for this composer he used him also in A Time to Kill is one sign of latent tastefulness In movies like Interview With the Vampire and Heat Goldenthal returned the obsolescent Hollywood orchestra to some of its old glory But in the new Batman the score was apparently deemed insufficient It s repeatedly blotted out by the sound effects that erupt in tandem with every move or twitch on screen One whip of a cape sounds like a rocket blasting off An actual rocket blasting off yes at one point Mr Freeze escapes in a rocket just like Dr Evil in Austin Powers sounds like a dentist going to work on your ear This indiscriminate racket more than anything sent me out into Times Square with the feeling of having been roughed up The area hasn t changed so much after all Chill out Mr Freeze Schwarzenegger and Robin O Donnell 15 seconds Batspat Batgirl Silverstone vs Poison Ivy Thurman 24 seconds
