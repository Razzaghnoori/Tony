                     Female Voice TAPE  SIDE A                     This interview is Darlene Maurer interviewing Christopher Werth         Chris can you tell us what stories or book you remember reading as a child                     Probably the most uh wellknown books would be the uh uh a series of books called uh Meet and then it would give a name         For example Meet Andrew Jackson or Meet Daniel Boone or George Washington uh things like that                     Why were they special                     Well I was always interested in biography as a kid um so I guess because they told me about things people personalities         Ive always had had an interest in history so it was a chance to learn more about people                     So its uh its the history historical part and learning about the historical people that interested you the most                     Probably the biography you know the people and the times they lived in                     And what age of child what age of child were you                     Umm I dont know         I would probably say sometime between maybe uh five and eight                     Wow that young of an age you were interested in other people huh                     Oh yeah         Ive always been interested         Its a it was a good way to find out what was going on outside the world that I was living in                     So do you remember any particular ones that you really liked or anyone                     No         I think they were just all interesting books uh you know I had a whole collection them and I only got rid of them when I was in high school         Now I hear theyre pretty valuable books                  As usually the case                     Yeah         That happens yes                     But um you know they were interesting and they talked about the not just the famous persons but they also talked about um you know the times they lived in and things like that         Pretty nicely illustrated                     Uhhuh         OK          Did you have                      easy to read                              special feelings when you read them or                     Just tried to imagine what life was like in those times                     Oh I see so you would like                                                               go into the imagination go into the imagination of                     Yeah                     this is what it must have been like being this person or living at that time or                     Yeah or knowing some things                     something like that                     Yeah                     So OK         Um anything else you can remember about that                     No         Just just generally                     OK         So where uh was this         Was this                     Um between well home was NJ and Raleigh         New Jersey and Raleigh NC                     OK                  So um          anything else you can think of for us                     No         I just think they were just fairly wellillustrated you know         Simple to read compared to some of the other stuff I was reading         But they were pretty simple to read                     Oh OK         Can you remember some uh any other stories that you might have read or stories your family someone maybe in your family told you                     Um                                                   Hi                     Hi                  Do you need the room                     YeahBREAK                     Can you think of any stories that um that you remember from growing up or anyone in the family telling you         Anyone in your family telling stories                     The only story I might remember would be um as I got older um you know asking folks what it was like uh living in France during the Nazi occupation what it was like growing up before that and that type of thing                     So your parents came over here                     My father did in                      OK                     After the Second World War                     Your mom was born here then                     My mom was born here         So maybe asking her what it was like growing up in New York City before WW II or during the War or that type of thing                     Oh I see                     But as rule storytelling was not something that I grew up with like some traditions and some cultures and some places there were                     Right                     you tell stories about things you have to ask for those that information                     Right                     Maybe because the memories were so pitifully painful                     Right         Was it difficult         Do they do they uh share about what their homeland was like         What France was like                     Dad doesnt talk too much about what life was like other than talking about how good times were before the War         But during the War he doesnt hes got a lot of stuff has been blocked out                     Um                     Because I imagine that life was pretty tough         Mom remembers a lot of stuff but uh you know details of everyday life but uh she also remembers a lot about the Great Depression and then the rationing during the Second World War and things like that but she doesnt go into much detail either                     Uhhuh                     It must of have been pretty hard         Thats all I can think                     Yeah                     since it wasnt talked about                     Yeah                     Or still isnt talked about unless you pry it out of them                     Uhhuh                     And even then you dont get a full story                     Uhhuh         Do they ever talk about good memories they had back then                     Uh they have some good memories but its just not talked about period                     Um                     Just I I didnt not grow up in a tradition where storytelling about life you know or heroics uh were talked about or it just you have to pry peoples information I guess pull from their information                     Um just dont go there huh                     Yeah                     Yeah yeah I understand                     I know some people freely talked about their about exploits you know         Thats just thats just not part of the family tradition I guess                     Uhhuh         OK         Um OK all right         Is there anything else youd like to say                     No         Um just that um you know that as far as you know stories you know most of the stories I you know if I remember anything its about the books I read and stuff         But oral storytelling is not part of you know as I say the family tradition                     Your family didnt talk much around the dinner table about stories                     Well we talked about what happened during your day and you know what happened at school what happened at work but as a rule um and maybe thats because for you know from the time I was  um you know I didnt have any cousins living nearby and aunts and uncles and grandparents                     Oh OK                     So                     So that really made a difference                     Yeah         My mothers parents were both dead by that time well before I was born and so I never knew my mothers parents and there would have been stories maybe there                     Right                     Uh when I was  I moved away from my grandfather who already uh I think he was already dead by that time and my grandmother was definitely you know way away and we didnt talk to her         Un o my father may have talked to her once a week on the phone                     Where did she live                     In NY but we were in NC by this time so                     OK OK                     So maybe you know it was just you know you know when I would physically see her for a while it was like once a year         But there was never any storytelling going on                     Uhhuh                     Until she got maybe much older and then I started prying into the family history                     Yeah                     But that was only because I was doing a research project in which you talk about things                     OK         So do you have brothers and sisters                     I have one brother younger                     Uhhuh OK                     No sisters                     OK good         Well thank you for sharing your story with us                     All right thank you         Good luck on your project                     Thanks
