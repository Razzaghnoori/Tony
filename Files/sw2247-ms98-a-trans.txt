             okay um now the term personal computer uh i dont happen to have one at home um but i do have a personal computer on my desk here   a type of work station   yeah uh yeah just kind of its kind of a kluge that was pieced together to to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process and uh it it works just fine it says its a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer uh no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do   is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine   no its not even that   its eighty eighty eight   uh i think thats about where it is   okay uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously   uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM uh nothing extremely complex   okay uh i use them both here at work and at home   uhhuh   and i have IBM clones in both cases   yep   here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine machine   oh yeah i bet thats a pretty nice setup   yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it   yep   uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend thats a third of a meg in beta size   wow   and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to its knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to its knees   yep wow   just in the ability to handle and then i have uh a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine   uhhuh   at home and im really pleased with it   uhhuh   it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches   sure uhhuh   uh what ive gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you   yeah yeah   to try to make them more effective and useful   right   have you been uh struggling along those lines   well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybodys going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that   well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it its uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it   uhhuh   the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that   oh   of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error   huh   not a fun thing to try to recover from very frustrating   i can believe i can believe that   uh but again ive been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise uh that was a engineering spec on B you come here with the B level of specs   no not really im not that up on that sort of thing   well its just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what youre trying to build   oh okay   uh to one level down from assistant description   oh okay okay oh well it sounds like youre pretty much into computers   well i sure need them uh theres no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them   i can believe that well its its been interesting   yes uh maybe youll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things i think thats when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have when you start seeing what all they can do for you   yeah of course needs and wants arent necessarily the same thing   well i understand that  you know if needs and wants were the same id have a four eighty six machine at home   oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six   right   that that must be a fairly recent release   uh thats came out around the first of the year   okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but i didnt know they had a four eighty six just yet   it does a few more things uh   uhhuh   than had been available before   yeah   but im not sure that its such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation   sure   because you no longer can think that fast anyway   yeah   well okay i enjoyed our discussion   i did too and you have a good day   you do the same   byebye   bye
