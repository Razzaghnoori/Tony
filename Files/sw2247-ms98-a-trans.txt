 okay um now the term personal computer uh i don t happen to have one at home um but i do have a personal computer on my desk here a type of work station yeah uh yeah just kind of it s kind of a kluge that was pieced together to to uh shall we say bypass the formal procurement process and uh it it works just fine it says it s a monochrome monitor Panasonic printer uh no big deal it it does the things i need for it to do is it a two eighty six or three eighty six base machine no it s not even that it s eighty eighty eight uh i think that s about where it is okay uh what type of uh utilizations do you make of it word processing obviously uh yeah i do that i i do uh some Lotus on it uh do some uh Samna some uh PFM uh nothing extremely complex okay uh i use them both here at work and at home uh huh and i have IBM clones in both cases yep here at work i have the TI one thousand which is a three eighty six base machine machine oh yeah i bet that s a pretty nice setup yes it is uh unfortunately i need all of it yep uh for example i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that s a third of a meg in beta size wow and that i know that uh brings an eighty eighty eight machine to it s knees because i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it and he had a two eighty six machine and it brought it to it s knees yep wow just in the ability to handle and then i have uh a three eighty six FX a sixteen bit machine uh huh at home and i m really pleased with it uh huh it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and uh databases database searches sure uh huh uh what i ve gotten into more recently are the tools to use them have you yeah yeah to try to make them more effective and useful right have you been uh struggling along those lines well um i seem to always be in the the next to the last generation of word processing software when everyone was in Samna i was still in PFM and now that i finally become proficient in Samna everybody s going to WordPerfect so i can never quite stay current with that well i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it it s uh i used it on uh some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it it was a real memory hog when you started making large block changes to it uh huh the at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that oh of what you were changing and deleting off in memory until all of all of a sudden you got a disc full error huh not a fun thing to try to recover from very frustrating i can believe i can believe that uh but again i ve been dealing with large files both data and and otherwise uh that was a engineering spec on B2 you come here with the B level of specs no not really i m not that up on that sort of thing well it s just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you re trying to build oh okay uh to one level down from assistant description oh okay okay oh well it sounds like you re pretty much into computers well i sure need them uh there s no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to to try to do my job without them i can believe that well it s it s been interesting yes uh maybe you ll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things i think that s when you you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have when you start seeing what all they can do for you yeah of course needs and wants aren t necessarily the same thing well i understand that you know if needs and wants were the same i d have a four eighty six machine at home oh it is is that the newest thing now the four eighty six right that that must be a fairly recent release uh that s came out around the first of the year okay okay because i i had done capital packages for two eighty sixes and three eighty sixes but i didn t know they had a four eighty six just yet it does a few more things uh uh huh than had been available before yeah but i m not sure that it s such a massive improvement uh you know once you get passed thirty three megahertz all help is kind of lost in the in the translation sure because you no longer can think that fast anyway yeah well okay i enjoyed our discussion i did too and you have a good day you do the same bye bye bye
