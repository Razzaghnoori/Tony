 The Inscrutable Value of AOL Time Warner One of the more telling things about the complexity of AOL s acquisition of Time Warner is the simple fact that no one seemed able to agree on just how much the deal was worth Consider According to AOL com yesterday it was a 166 billion deal I wrote yesterday that it was 184 billion And TheStreet com first said the deal was worth 125 billion go figure then came around and by the end of the day said it was worth 180 billion According to the New York Post today it was 173 billion But today s Wall Street Journal said no it was 156 14 billion You have to love the 14 part of that Today s New York Times thought it was 165 billion Part of the confusion stems from the fact that it s an all stock plus debt assumption deal so that as AOL s stock price fluctuates so does the size of the deal But the confusion also stems from uncertainty about how many shares Time Warner has outstanding the lack of a collar and a general vagueness about how AOL and Time Warner decided on how big the new company would be The right way to calculate the deal s value by the way is to multiply the price of AOL s stock by 1 5 multiply that by the number of Time Warner shares and add 17 billion I think The confusion isn t overwhelmingly important of course But the idea that somehow it doesn t really make a difference whether AOL is paying 156 or 165 billion for Time Warner is wrong and seems emblematic of the fawning embrace of this deal by the press Though not by Wall Street Just because it s in stock doesn t make it less real Eleven billion dollars in shareholder value is 11 billion
