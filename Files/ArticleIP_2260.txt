 The Vapid Center By Jacob Weisberg It s deep thoughts time at the White House Gearing up for his second Inaugural Address Bill Clinton has been trying on themes and buzz phrases like an advertising copywriter cum pope Last month at the annual meeting of the Democratic Leadership Council the president spoke of occupying the vital dynamic center of American politics More recently at a White House prayer breakfast Clinton said he wanted to foster a spirit of reconciliation and quoted the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin to the effect that time is precious and should not be wasted on acrimony and division The truth is all of us just have a little bit of time left Clinton told the breakfasting clergymen One doesn t wish to deny anyone his rightful share of grandiloquence but there is a hazard here It s that Clinton who has been showily contemplating his presidency for the past two months will misconceive his second term If he thinks it s about moral leadership or about standing above the hurly burly of politics he s kidding himself What is portentously called Clinton s place in history will probably depend less on his sounding like V clav Havel than on a bunch of quotidian issues what he referred to dismissively in his prayer breakfast speech as balancing the budget and all that This is partly a judgment on Clinton s own strengths and weaknesses The president has yet to utter a truly memorable line if you don t count I didn t inhale No one looks to him for moral example He does however understand the fine points of public policy as well as any president we ve had and is capable of putting the public welfare ahead of narrow political considerations when it really matters A few such painful choices rescued what might otherwise have been a disastrous first term The most significant of these was his decision to press for deficit reduction instead of new spending programs in his first budget But there were others too His decision to support NAFTA and his belated intervention in Bosnia These were not the areas where he thought he would stake his claim to greatness Yet by making the right decisions on big issues he couldn t avoid Clinton salvaged a record of accomplishment and earned his re election This time the decisions are equally momentous and probably more difficult The amount of courage Clinton displays in acting to reform Medicare and Social Security will determine whether these successful and popular programs survive into the next century in anything resembling their present forms But the stakes are even greater than that Absent significant reform the escalating costs of these programs will in decades to come crowd out what remains of the federal discretionary budget the FBI NASA Yosemite and all the rest As discretionary programs are trimmed back to pay for mounting entitlement costs the possibility of Clinton or any other president deploying new programs to address national problems will become more and more remote Not acting to reform entitlements will mean Clinton leaving a dysfunctional federal government behind him when he goes The most urgent part of the entitlement problem is Medicare Perhaps more than any other single issue this won Clinton the 1996 election And it was not pure Medi goguery that did it The Republican push for Medical Savings Accounts threatened to undermine Medicare by removing the healthiest and wealthiest beneficiaries from the common insurance pool But at the same time that he resisted this irresponsible conservative position Clinton saddled himself with one of his own support for Medicare without higher payments by beneficiaries or structural reforms to ensure long term solvency Republicans badly burned by the issue say the ball is now in Clinton s court Leadership on this issue will consist of calling the GOP s bluff by proposing both short term cuts and long term structural reform Unfortunately Clinton shows little sign of doing either He intends to make only minor adjustments in his February budget proposal fixes that will purport to keep the system solvent for 10 years The administration is developing a plan that is likely to combine reduced payments to doctors and hospitals with a proposal to shift the costs for home health care out of the Medicare trust fund account This is an accounting gimmick which would keep the trust fund technically solvent for a time without reducing costs overall Clinton might still address the long range problem later But as elections get closer for congressional Democrats in 1998 and for Al Gore in 2000 the attraction of defending Medicare will reassert itself Social Security by contrast is a long range emergency This program isn t going broke now but unless we do something about it soon the long term problem will become insoluble Conservatives many of whom do not believe in Social Security in the first place are hard at work devising plans to undermine it by shifting to a system of individual accounts As more moderate solutions are deferred that kind of transformation becomes increasingly likely If however Clinton forces difficult changes now we can avoid catastrophe later Among the most sensible options are a slight increase in the retirement age in keeping with growing life expectancy a mild means test in keeping with principles of fairness and an adjustment in the Consumer Price Index in keeping with economic reality Among these reforms adjusting the CPI is the most important Because it would reduce mandated benefits of various kinds in a reasonable way it would go a long way not just toward fixing Social Security but also toward bringing the federal budget into structural balance It s also a politically safe way to raise taxes since tax exemptions are like many benefit programs indexed for inflation Clinton probably shouldn t appear to politicize the issue of how the CPI is calculated by publicly supporting Sen Pat Moynihan s bill to cut it in half to 1 1 percent But he can surely finesse the result some other way Rob Shapiro of the Progressive Policy Institute suggests creating an entirely new index a Cost of Living Index to replace the CPI which would be one solution The problem falls to Clinton partly because Social Security is his party s greatest achievement and partly because Republicans are rightly terrified about raising the subject on their own If only Nixon could go to China only Clinton can reform Social Security Entitlements are not the only thing that matters In addition to all the things we can t foresee the historical verdict on Clinton will also hinge on such issues as whether he manages to steer welfare reform back in the right direction whether he avoids being drawn into a counterproductive tax cut and whether he overcomes his own recent history to lead campaign finance reform But on all these the basic principle is the same The president needs to spurn the vital center defy the spirit of reconciliation and recognize he has only a little time left to tell the public what it doesn t want to hear
