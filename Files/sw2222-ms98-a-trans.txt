 so what s your favorite team or do you have a favorite team or well i uh i d have to say my favorite team would be Cincinnati Bengals Bengals um hum yeah uh i was uh i was pulling for the Bengals when they uh lost the Super Bowl oh that was sad wasn t it two years ago was it yeah yeah yeah that was just a couple of years ago yeah i i pulled for them for the sole reason because i didn t want 49ers to win anybody who plays the 49ers really yeah well uh it s kind of hard to uh to know what to do with some of these teams and they re either extremely strong or very very weak and uh nothing much in between yeah yeah that s true uh my favorite team is are is are the Raiders oh you like the Raiders yeah i mean i ve liked them ever since the season that they won the Super Bowl last i think it was eighty four i think it was um hum uh huh and uh i pretty much like them ever since that and they haven t they haven t produced since then but no but least i ve stuck with them i m loyal uh huh well that that and that s the important thing i mean whether they win or lose why the fun is is in the supporting them yeah and staying with it and hoping that uh you know the next time is a better time around yeah what other teams uh do you like up there well um or do you not watch much football oh i love football oh really oh watch it uh every every game that s on i watch every Sunday and Monday yeah and Thursday nights oh that s right no there uh well let s see i never use thought about football too much yet yeah me either it s kind of like they they gave me the topic and i m like football jeez it s been a long time yeah right uh uh did you know that they re playing a game today yeah that s the World League yeah yeah what time is that supposed to be they re playing it right now oh are they yeah i think it s uh ABC that s carrying it it s either ABC or NBC one or the other i think i m not too sure one of the major stations it s uh Barcelona versus New York oh hum well uh i haven t for some reason have never really gotten enthused about football in the summer from from the the World League yeah the temperature s just not right yeah yeah and uh it just seems like it should only be done in cold weather yeah rather than just be played at anytime anytime during the year we usually don t uh we usually don t have very cold weather down here you know during uh during football season it it gets colder later on in the season um hum but it takes a good while for it to get cold huh but couple couple Christmases ago we had a a freak storm and i live near the coast actually i live like right on the coast of North Carolina ooh and uh what they they called it like a winter hurricane and so instead of bringing high winds and destruction and rain it just brought a lot of snow and basically it rain it it snowed only on the coast but not inland uh huh so the coast was completely we had like ten foot snow drifts which in the coast we barely get an inch of snow a year oh is that right yeah and so we you know because being near the water we get less snow than anybody else yeah and this time we had a bunch of snow we we i had fun playing in in the snow playing football in the snow and so i mean i i had never done that before and it s it s so much fun because you can hit harder and land harder and it doesn t matter because it s snow and yeah is that right huh i would think uh that if you were real cold and you hit uh hit the ground that it would seem to hurt more yeah well we had like layers of clothing to keep away the snow well that helps doesn t it yeah but the snow also helps you know and it it we had like one foot deep snow in this in this open field and so it was a little hard to run but when you got hit and you fell you didn t really feel it oh yeah you just felt the hit of the person but when you hit the ground it was you know just snow it was it was pretty fun but it s it s a lot better to play it in the cold weather that s true um hum yeah right right what kind of weather you having right now well right now we re having nice weather i i probably say in in the upper sixties maybe lower seventies right now oh my well our weather s suddenly turned cold again uh our weather is so unstable you never know yeah especially at this time yes and uh this morning why it was raining and it was quite cold and then it seemed to warm up somewhat and then before uh before i got out of church it cooled off again so much so that i uh stopped at home to change coats because i had to go down to the hospital and uh the coat i had on was just too light in weight yeah is it very windy up there now yes very strong winds yeah we had some pretty strong winds pick up this morning and they ve been up been with us all day well well been awfully nice talking with you yeah this is the first time i ve talked with someone up north really mostly i ve been talking with people in Texas yeah right right most people seem to be there out there seems like they have ninety percent of the people calling from Texas right okay well good talking to you yeah nice talking to you too bye uh huh bye bye
