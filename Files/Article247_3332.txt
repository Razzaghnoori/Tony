 News We Disapprove Of Good morning Jodi I love evergreen headlines those perpetually blooming stories that could run in any newspaper any year an example New Jersey Official Indicted Mob Ties Alleged Well the front page of today s New York Times provides an all time classic of the genre Pediatricians Urge Limiting TV Watching Stop the presses No on second thought didn t I read that same story in the Times in 1979 Or was it 1959 Back in the old days like 1979 or 1959 the Times editorial page was the repository of the conventional wisdom written in a uniquely ponderous style that combined voice of God self confidence and the bromides of a foundation backed task force report All that has mercifully changed as the edit page has been transformed under the editorship of Howell Raines But every so often the Times goes completely retro with a return to yes but on the other hand prose Today the edit page finally weighed in on Hillary s Talk interview devoting infinitely more space to the Intimate Hillary than was deemed appropriate by the news section I have long thought that the Times should handle hot potato stories like this with a special daily page called News We Disapprove Of But the Times editorial concluded with a sentence so pompous and so non committal that it should be immediately be added to the syllabus in journalism schools Jodi parse this one if you dare In a contest involving two personalities as distinctive as Mrs Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Guiliani the potential Republican nominee every citizen will have to reach a decision that balances all aspects of a candidate s abilities issue positions and personal qualities This morning I was overjoyed to snag the last copy of the New York Post at my little Washington newsstand That s where I learned of the latest circulation boosting gambit by Modern Maturity that up with aging monthly published by the AARP The big story this month on the senior circuit is an exclusive listing of the 50 sexiest celebrities who are over 50 years old The winners include Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon steam heat Julie Christie and Tom Selleck anytime sexy Donna Karan and Louis Rukeyser sexy in suits and Lauren Bacall and Paul Newman vintage sexy I m 52 years old balding well rounded and doomed to always misplace my reading glasses But I m also old enough to know that sexual allure does not necessarily dim with age At last year s Time magazine anniversary gala I found myself positively tongue tied embarrassingly adolescent in my awkwardness on being introduced to Lauren Bacall So why does the Modern Maturity spread leave me so uncomfortable Would I feel different if this sexy plus 50 cavalcade appeared in People magazine My guess and let s not delve too deeply into my psyche is that I m offended by the AARP s role in sponsoring this silliness There s something about this middle aged spread the magazine s not mine that suggests a desperate need to join the self esteem movement It all seems well Viagra esque Jodi any reaction from a younger and fitter generation
