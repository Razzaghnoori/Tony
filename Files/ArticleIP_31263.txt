 J D Salinger Failed Recluse J D Salinger is inevitably described as the most private man in America Esquire or the most private of literary figures the New York Times In the introduction to his just published Salinger biography Paul Alexander calls the Bard of Cornish the one figure in the twentieth century who didn t want his biography written Yet Salinger has already been the subject of two biographies If Salinger really wants to be left alone he is going about it in a very strange way He doesn t live in a gated community He summons perfect strangers into his hideaway He sues people and then phones the media to spread the story Maybe Salinger should take a page from Thomas Pynchon American letters other famous recluse who really wants to be left alone Two years ago a London Sunday Times hireling bearded Pynchon on the streets of Manhattan and nearly got his head bitten off Get your fucking hand out of my face Pynchon bellowed Here s the Tale of the Tape in the Battle of the Hermit Divas 1 Location Salinger Salinger has lived on the same Cornish N H property for over 30 years Other than a No Trespassing sign there is no particular barrier to entry from the fictional Ray Kinsella of Shoeless Joe to the notorious stalkerazzi photographer Paul Adao of the New York Post no one has ever had much trouble finding the place Up until recently Salinger used to chat casually with his doorsteppers unless they were journalists The next generation of visitors won t even have to interrogate the locals as Alexander provides directions in his new book On the one hand it s churlish to suggest that Salinger should move just to protect himself from his public On the other hand people have moved for less Pynchon Until recently no one was really sure where Pynchon lived Seattle Mexico Northern California Probably all of the above Much ink has been shed in proving that Pynchon spent several years in California s Mendocino County researching his novel Vineland and writing letters to the local newspaper under the name Wanda Tinasky But that may have been a hoax 2 Litigation Salinger In 1974 Salinger sued the editor of an unauthorized collection of his stories and 17 bookstores that stocked the book Lest his filing go unnoticed he phoned New York Times reporter Lacey Fosburgh to alert her to the case He made Page One In 1986 he sued to block publication of Ian Hamilton s biography In Search of J D Salinger and forced the biographer to remove many quotations from the published work This kept his name in the papers for months and forced him to give a six hour long deposition to Hamilton s lawyer a portion of which appears for the first time in Alexander s book In 1996 Salinger s agent forbade a nonprofit Catcher in the Rye Web site from using quotations from the novel garnering the usual rash of publicity 3 Lady Friends Salinger In 1972 the 53 year old Salinger wrote the notorious fan letter to the 18 year old Joyce Maynard who had just written a New York Times Magazine cover story about herself The rest is herstory Salinger wrote similar letters to other young female writers He also had a fascination with actresses At age 62 he wrote a fan letter to the 36 year old actress Elaine Joyce whom he had seen in the TV show Mr Merlin That resulted in a long running affair A few years later he developed a fascination with the comely Catherine Oxenberg then starring in the TV show Dynasty Salinger traveled to California and had shown up on the set according to biographer Hamilton He had to be escorted off Pynchon As befits a man guarding as opposed to flaunting his privacy Pynchon has kept his private life private Past girlfriends have spoken with journalists mainly to report that Pynchon was charming and a tad eccentric In the early 70s Jules Siegel a college friend wrote an article for Playboy titled Who Is Thomas Pynchon and Why Did He Take Off With My Wife The story praised Pynchon as a wonderful lover sensitive and quick with the ability to project a mood that turned the most ordinary surroundings into a scene out of a masterful film For almost a decade now Pynchon has been married to his literary agent and keeping to himself Cunningly Pynchon is hiding in plain view He lives in Manhattan and escorts his son to and from school many days of the week A friend of mine says he s active in children s activities and has even been written up in the school newspaper The mothers love him he says Local literati know where he lives and they leave him alone Why Why is Pynchon left alone and Salinger harassed Theories abound Some people feel that Pynchon is a cerebral writer and his fans are mature in age and temperament Salinger s great classic The Catcher in the Rye is about an adolescent and has visceral appeal to adolescents of all ages John Lennon s assassin Mark David Chapman and Ronald Reagan s would be killer John Hinckley were both major Catcher fans Another major difference is that Pynchon has continued to publish Unlike Salinger people have been able to access Pynchon and his evolution as a writer explains Ron Rosenbaum who has followed both writers careers closely In 1997 Rosenbaum published an Esquire cover story lauding Salinger s self imposed Wall of Silence as his most powerful his most eloquent perhaps his most lasting work of art But I wonder Is the wall really art or is it an act And has the act now supplanted the art Two years ago Salinger announced plans to publish a 32 year old story Hapworth 16 1924 as a book After some negative publicity he changed his plans The way Salinger handled the publicity he said he did not want was a bit too contrived to get attention itself Paul Alexander concludes at the end of his new biography He continues Salinger became the Greta Garbo of literature and then periodically when it may have seemed he was about to be forgotten he resurfaced briefly just to remind the public that he wanted to be left alone The whole act could have been cute or whimsical only it felt as if it were being put on by a master showman a genius spin doctor a public relations wizard hawking a story the public couldn t get enough of
