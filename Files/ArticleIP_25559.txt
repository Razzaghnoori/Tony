spin We re trying to kill him 3 Russia conveyed a proposal from Milosevic to allow an international presence in Kosovo under U N auspices if NATO halts its bombing and withdraws its troops from Yugoslavia s borders Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair rejected the proposal but portrayed it as a sign that Milosevic s will is breaking 4 NATO leaders reopened the question of sending in ground troops Clinton says it s just a contingency plan The half cynical spin They intend to launch a ground war and are just using the contingency plan shtick as cover The completely cynical spin It really is just a contingency plan showing once again how gutless and unrealistic they are 4 23 99 Update on the Colorado high school massacre Based on the discovery of a large propane bomb and other explosives planted by the two killers investigators think they had accomplices Meanwhile several bomb threats and trench coat pranks at schools in Colorado and elsewhere over the last two days are being treated as copycat incidents Editorialists and politicians continued to debate whether to blame the massacre on 1 guns 2 violence in the media 3 secularism and cultural decline or 4 inadequate monitoring and counseling of troubled students The assailants were allegedly devotees of shock rocker Marilyn Manson Click for the Slate Assessment of Manson and here for an analysis of the wave of PR opportunism that followed a similar slaughter in Oregon last year 4 23 99 President Clinton postponed the destruction of the U S government s last samples of smallpox The U S and Russian governments have the only known samples of the virus which was eradicated in the 1970s after it had killed 500 million people this century The previous world consensus was that the samples would be destroyed this year to make sure smallpox never comes back The new thinking is that rogue states may already have obtained samples of the virus for developing a biological weapon and that the United States should work with Russia to develop a new vaccine and to test drugs against the virus The political question is what happens if the rest of the world wants the virus destroyed but the Americans and Russians don t 4 23 99 The theory that male homosexuality is genetic suffered a setback A previous study had found a specific genetic pattern among gay men but a new study does not find the same pattern The most interesting version of the theory is that the gene passed along on the X chromosome makes the bearer attracted to men and that this trait is supposed to be passed on to daughters but is sometimes passed on to sons The author of the old study says the new study is flawed and reporters agreed that the new study raises doubts but doesn t necessarily refute the old one The conservative spin This proves homosexuality is a choice not a natural condition so it s OK to stigmatize it The gay spins 1 Homosexuality is genetic and therefore natural 2 If it turns out to be genetic conservatives will just try to eradicate it with gene therapy 3 Forget the genetics debate and just treat us equally 4 23 99 Scientists found a new candidate for the missing link between apes and humans The 2 5 million year old creature dubbed Australopithecus garhi evidently used stone tools to carve up the animals it killed and had much bigger teeth than its apelike ancestors The theory is that the creature s tools enabled it to augment its diet with meat and marrow which gave it the nutrition and energy that eventually allowed it to develop a larger more human brain and to spread throughout the world 4 23 99 A government study concluded that some New Jersey state troopers pulled over drivers and searched their cars because they were black or Hispanic At least 77 percent of drivers who were asked by troopers for permission to search their cars were minorities The ostensible reason for this racial profiling is that New Jersey highways are a conduit for drugs and that the troopers think blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be culprits One consequence of the study could be to help black and Hispanic defendants get the results of their car searches thrown out of court as a violation of the Fourth Amendment The spins from Gov Christine Todd Whitman R N J 1 I m surprised 2 This is awful 3 The vast majority of troopers are not racist and I m issuing orders that will stop this practice right away The reactions from blacks and Hispanics 1 Duh 2 This is the way the world is 3 Right 4 21 99 India s government collapsed The ruling Hindu nationalist coalition lost a no confidence vote because a small party pulled out of the coalition Now the opposition Congress Party led by Sonia Gandhi former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi s widow is trying to form a parliamentary coalition large enough to support a new government The early betting is that this will prove impossible and that new elections will have to be called The key questions at stake are 1 whether Gandhi will become a candidate for prime minister 2 whether the new government will sign the nuclear test ban treaty and 3 whether India will seek to cool tensions with Pakistan 4 19 99 CNN is dumping Peter Arnett Having kept Arnett on its payroll but off the air for months the network will reportedly use an escape clause in his contract to get rid of him in July Everyone assumes the reason is Arnett s role as correspondent in last year s CNN Newsstand report that alleged use of lethal nerve gas by the U S military in Vietnam CNN had retracted and apologized for the report but let Arnett stay on the job after he argued that he had played no substantive role in the report and had simply performed as an on air mouthpiece The pro Arnett spin It s unfair to treat a reporter this way after 18 years of loyal service The anti Arnett spin His reputation has been dead for months and it s about time CNN mercifully pulled the plug 4 19 99 Kenyan runner Joseph Chebet won the Boston Marathon The heartwarming spin He finally won the race after finishing second in his last three marathons The cranky spin Now that nine consecutive Kenyans have won the Boston Marathon and four of them finished among this year s top 10 how about giving some other country a chance Ethiopian runner Fatuma Roba reinforced the theme of dominance by a single country winning the women s marathon for the third straight year 4 19 99
