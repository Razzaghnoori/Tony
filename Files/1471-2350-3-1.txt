                    Background        Stroke is the third leading cause of death in adults        The  basic types of stroke are ischemic stroke and        hemorrhagic stroke In ischemic stroke the most common        type a profound disturbance of focal cerebral blood flow        leads to irreversible parenchymal injury The Siblings With        Ischemic Stroke Study SWISS is a multicenter affected        sibling pair study with the aim of identifying chromosomal        regions linked to ischemic stroke by using genomewide        scanning Family history and twins studies support the        existence of genetic susceptibility to stroke               Mendelian disorders known to be associated with an        increased risk of stroke include hemoglobinopathies        dyslipoproteinemias and cardioembolic disorders            Most known Mendelian stroke disorders present in infancy        childhood or young adulthood and collectively represent        only a small proportion of all stroke cases Several of        these Mendelian disorders were recognized as unique genetic        diseases because of striking phenotypic features such as        corneal opacities and angiokeratomas of the skin in Fabry        disease        Defining the genetic basis for stroke syndromes that        lack striking phenotypic features is a more difficult task        Modeldependent linkage analysis has been used in large        pedigrees with diseases such as cerebral autosomal dominant        arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and        leukoencephalopathy CADASIL        However        traditional linkage analysis is unlikely to be the most        expedient method of finding novel strokesusceptibility        genes when carrier status cannot be defined on the basis of        distinctive clinical radiographic or laboratory        features        One popular method of identifying genetic risk factors        has been the candidate gene association study in which        investigators compare rates of one or more variant        polymorphisms of a candidate gene among stroke cases and        strokefree controls Identifying risk factors depends on        selecting the right candidate genes a daunting task        because the human genome harbors about  genes A        candidate gene is usually selected because the gene product        might relate to pathogenesis of disease        Numerous studies have used a candidate gene approach to        define genetic risk factors for stroke but so far results        for several categories of candidate genes have been        negative or conflicting For example because about  of        strokes are caused by thrombotic occlusion of a blood        vessel genes related to the coagulation system would seem        logical candidates for susceptibility to stroke However        despite association of the factor V GA factor V        Leiden and prothrombin factor II GA mutations with        venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction             neither mutation is strongly associated with risk of        stroke           Although a study of        British adults found elevated levels of serum homocysteine        to be associated with an increased risk of stroke            a casecontrol study of a common polymorphism        methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase MTHFR TC that        results in increased serum homocysteine concentrations        found no difference between patients with stroke and        controls in either genotype or allele frequency            Because antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of        action can bring about significant reductions in stroke        risk several platelet receptor genes have been tested as        candidate stroke susceptibility genes      To date        however no compelling evidence for an association between        any platelet receptor gene polymorphism and risk of stroke        has been found        Conflicting results have been reported from studies on        the stroke risk factor status of genes related to        myocardial infarction or arterial disease such as specific        genotypes of the genes for angiotensin converting enzyme                 ACE        or        apolipoprotein            Potential        confounding factors include the effects of comorbidity and        differential mortality rates      Although the        degree of stenosis of the cervical internal carotid        arteries in symptomatic patients correlates with risk of        ipsilateral stroke     no clear conclusions can be        drawn from attempts to relate carotid artery disease to        specific genotypes for example of the paraoxonase gene         PON which is thought to protect        lowdensity lipoprotein against oxidative modification            or of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene                   Thus results of the candidate gene approach have so far        failed to define genetic risk factors for stroke        Furthermore if important functional mutations should arise        in noncoding regions without significant disequilibrium        with the site of a screened polymorphism the association        analysis may exclude the true disease susceptibility        locus        A genomewide scanning approach in sibling pairs may        expedite discovery of novel risk factor genes The basic        goal of the genomewide scan with microsatellite markers is        to identify chromosomal regions linked to a disease        phenotype by determining whether polymorphisms in the        microsatellite markers segregate with disease within a        cohort of pedigrees Microsatellites are not functional        they are noncoding regions of DNA that allow identification        of chromosomal regions held in common by members of a        pedigree        The collection of sibling pairs and analysis of mean        proportion of alleles shared that are identical by descent        or state by use of a highly polymorphic panel of genetic        markers has come to be a standard protocol for detecting        linkage of a disease susceptibility locus to a chromosomal        region The technique has been applied to a broad range of        other disorders including multiple sclerosis               Alzheimer disease       type  diabetes            type  diabetes     asthma     and systemic        lupus erythematosus     The use of such        linkagemapping strategies offers the advantage of        modelindependence computational speed and systematic        identification of novel loci            Thus linkage analysis using a genomewide scan may        yield positive results more efficiently than testing        candidate genes a few at a time However we do not        consider these approaches to be mutually exclusive        Genomewide linkage analysis may guide selective candidate        gene evaluations within regions of importance The goal of        SWISS is to help to identify the chromosomal regions that        should be searched for candidate genes        The paucity of genomewide scanning studies in the        stroke literature to date is mainly due to theoretical and        logistical factors that make such studies difficult to        design Ischemic stroke itself represents a heterogeneous        phenotype Various systems have been used to classify        subtypes of ischemic stroke     For example the Trial        of ORG in Acute Stroke Treatment TOAST investigators        classified stroke into largeartery atherosclerosis        cardioembolism smallvessel occlusion stroke of other        etiology and stroke of undetermined etiology            Uncertainty exists as to whether the clinical heterogeneity        of the ischemic stroke phenotype relates to heterogeneity        in genetic risk factors        Logistically the collection of a large number of        sibling pairs concordant for stroke is a daunting task        Stroke affects an elderly population and carries a modest        case fatality rate Patients may be rendered incompetent to        consent to a genetics study by the stroke itself Often        members of a sibship are separated by large geographical        distances In a preliminary study we found that whereas         in  patients with stroke report having a living affected        sibling only  in  had an affected sibling living in the        same city as the proband            SWISS is designed to overcome these hurdles as far as        possible The purpose of this paper is to describe the        SWISS protocol in detail                    Research Design and Methods                  Aim          The aim of SWISS is to test the hypothesis that the          human genome contains chromosomal regions associated with          ischemic stroke by means of genomewide scanning in DNA          samples collected from  sibling pairs concordant for          ischemic stroke and from  discordant siblings                          Definition of ischemic stroke and its          subtypes          Stroke is defined according to World Health          Organization criteria    as rapidly developing signs          of a focal or global disturbance of cerebral function          with symptoms lasting  hours or longer or leading to          death with no apparent cause other than vascular origin          Patients are classified as having an ischemic stroke if          they had computed tomographic or magnetic resonance          imaging of the brain done within  days of onset of          symptoms that either identified the symptomatic cerebral          infarct or failed to identify an alternative cause of the          symptoms Classification of strokes into subtypes is done          according to the validated TOAST diagnostic criteria              Subtype diagnosis is made on the basis of available          and relevant information obtained up to  months after          the stroke because initial subtype diagnosis varies from          final diagnosis in approximately onethird of cases                                       Study population                      Probands            Probands are adult men and women who  have a            diagnosis of at least  ischemic stroke confirmed by            the study neurologist  report having at least             living full sibling with a history of stroke and             have attained their th birthday at the time of            enrollment in the study If probands have had more than            one ischemic stroke the most recent is the proband            index stroke Probands are not excluded from the study            for radiographic evidence of hemorrhagic transformation            of an ischemic stroke            Probands are not enrolled if any of the following            conditions apply  The index stroke is presumed to be            iatrogenic  that is onset of symptoms occurred within             hours after an invasive cerebrovascular or            cardiovascular procedure such as coronary artery            bypass grafting a catheterbased procedure on carotid            or coronary arteries carotid endarterectomy heart            valve surgery or thoracic or thoracoabdominal aortic            aneurysm repair  The index stroke is presumed due to            vasospasm after nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage             that is the onset of symptoms occurred within  days            after the onset of a nontraumatic subarachnoid            hemorrhage Virtually all delayed cerebral ischemia            occurs  to  days after subarachnoid hemorrhage                  The index stroke is presumed due to an            autoimmune condition  that is the patient has a            history of brainbiopsyproven central nervous system            vasculitis  The patient is known to have any of the            following singlegene or mitochondrial disorders            recognized by a distinctive phenotype CADASIL Fabry            disease homocystinuria mitochondrial encephalopathy            with lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes MELAS            or sickle cell anemia We excluded probands with these            disorders because their enrollment might confound the            genome scan for novel risk factors  The patient had            a mechanical aortic valve or a mechanical mitral valve            at the time of index stroke onset We chose this            criterion because of the high likelihood that ischemic            stroke is iatrogenic in such patients  The patient            had untreated or actively treated bacterial            endocarditis at the time of index stroke onset                                Concordant Siblings            To be enrolled as a concordant sibling the subject            must have a full sibling enrolled as a proband in            SWISS Other eligibility criteria for concordant            siblings are identical to those of probands Both            proband and concordant sibling must be at least             years old at the time of enrollment and both must meet            the same definition of ischemic stroke For concordant            siblings the diagnosis of ischemic stroke is verified            retrospectively by the Stroke Verification Committee            SVC This is a central genotypeblinded committee of            studyappointed neurologists Appendix which            adjudicates the diagnosis and subtype of ischemic            stroke for concordant siblings using standardized            prespecified criteria Although the subtype of the            siblings index ischemic stroke is determined            enrollment is not restricted to siblings with the same            ischemic stroke subtype as probands                                Discordant Siblings            Inclusion criteria for discordant siblings are as            follows  The subject has attained his or her th            birthday at the time of enrollment  The subject has             or more full siblings who each have had an ischemic            stroke and who are participating in the study  The            subject reports having no medical history of stroke or            transient ischemic attack TIA and denies ever having            had symptoms of stroke Because a SWISS proband might            erroneously believe that a sibling never had a stroke            discordance is considered verified only if the sibling            can be contacted for a structured telephone interview            and gives negative answers to all  items on the            Questionnaire for Verifying StrokeFree Status QVSFS            Table       Discordant siblings are excluded            if they are deemed unreliable historians in the opinion            of the interviewer administering the QVSFS on the basis            of global impression of moderate or severe impairment            of speech language hearing or memory                                    Recruitment goals          We aim to enroll at least  concordant sibling pairs           probands plus  concordant siblings and           discordant siblings  total study subjects Because          it is likely that not all concordant siblings will          actually participate more than  probands will be          enrolled to obtain DNA from  concordant sibling          pairs                          Study procedures                      Phase I Enrolling Probands and Recruiting            Siblings            Screening and enrollment will take place at             participating centers in the United States and Canada            Appendix At each center a study neurologist screens            all patients with a possible diagnosis of ischemic            stroke to identify potential SWISS probands orders or            reviews medical tests pertinent to the diagnosis and            subtyping of ischemic stroke as part of routine            clinical practice and makes a new diagnosis or            confirms a previous diagnosis of ischemic stroke in a            potential proband A certified study neurologist            classifies the final subtype of the index stroke            according to TOAST criteria     To obtain            certification the neurologist reads the original            manuscript describing the TOAST classification system            and scores various patients presented in a series of            stanardized clinical vignettes according to TOAST            criteria The scores are compared with reference values            generated by a consensus of the SVC The investigator            receives feedback on any deviations from reference            values and is required to review the TOAST            classification system and retake the test            The local coordinator or study neurologist conducts            a facetoface interview with patients who meet            enrollment criteria to obtain their medical history and            to explain the study If patients agree to participate            in the study they sign and date  copies of the            informed consent form retaining  copy for themselves            The local coordinator completes the proband case report            forms CRFs assigns a SWISS study number to the            proband forwards the proband CRFs to the Clinical            Coordinating Center and gives the proband or            surrogate a set of study invitation letters to be sent            to all of his or her living full siblings In the            letter siblings are asked to indicate whether they are            interested in participating in SWISS by completing the            contact information section and sending it to the            Clinical Coordinating Center The Center assigns SWISS            numbers to all siblings who provide contact            information                                Phase II Verifying Concordance and            Discordance            The goal of Phase II is to confirm that phenotyping            of siblings is accurate            Discordance is confirmed in Phase IIA The Clinical            Coordinating Center contacts potentially discordant            siblings who provide contact information obtains            verbal consent for a brief telephone interview            administers the QVSFS Table  and obtains a            standardized medical history in a structured telephone            interview Siblings who give negative answers to the            QVSFS medical history items but who give a positive            response to  or more of the reviewofsymptoms items            are advised to inform their primary care physician of            their symptoms so that they can be evaluated            accordingly Siblings who respond positively to QVSFS            item  advance to Phase IIB If all of the QVSFS items            are negative the patient is considered a verified            discordant sibling The discordant sibling CRFs are            completed during the telephone interview and the            Clinical Coordinating Center sends  copies of the            Informed Consent Form ICF to the verified discordant            sibling who returns  signed copy to the Center and            retains  copy Verified discordant siblings advance to            Phase III of the study            Concordance is confirmed in Phase IIB The Clinical            Coordinating Center sends potentially concordant            siblings a Request for Medical Records Form RMRF and             copies of the informed consent form to sign date            and return The RMRF is a slightly modified            studyspecific version of the official form used by            Mayo Clinic for routine patient care Subjects return             copy of the signed form in a preaddressed            postagepaid envelope provided with the original form            and retain the second copy The Clinical Coordinating            Center uses the signed form to request medical records            pertaining to the sibling index stroke The Center            constructs a file of medical records in a standardized            subdivided sequence hospital admission notes and            discharge summaries neurologic consultation notes            reports of computed tomographic and magnetic resonance            imaging of the head reports of imaging of the heart by            transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography            copies of electrocardiograms reports of imaging of            cervicocephalic vasculature by angiography using            conventional computed tomographic or magnetic            resonance techniques or by ultrasonography and reports            of blood work            The Clinical Coordinating Center submits completed            files on potentially concordant siblings to the SVC on            a weekly basis A neurologist member of the SVC reviews            the files and attempts to confirm the diagnosis of            ischemic stroke using a standard stroke workup            checklist to assist with and document a systematic            review of the medical records The SVC may instruct the            Clinical Coordinating Center to secure additional            medical records if the initial set fails to provide            sufficient evidence to confirm the diagnosis of            ischemic stroke If the SVC neurologist cannot confirm            the diagnosis of stroke the potentially concordant            sibling does not advance in the study If concordance            is confirmed the SVC neurologist classifies the TOAST            stroke subtype completes the CRFs for the concordant            sibling and forwards the forms to the Clinical            Coordinating Center            Although as many as  of the concordant siblings            in SWISS may have a history of  or more strokes the            SVC confirms the diagnosis and classifies the subtype            of ischemic stroke only for the most recent stroke for            which there are records sufficient to confirm the            diagnosis the sibling index stroke The verified            concordant sibling then advances to Phase III                                Phase III Acquiring Blood for Genetic            Analysis            Blood samples are taken only when a study pedigree            is complete ie clinical data and ICF are available            from  proband and at least  verified concordant            sibling with or without  verified discordant sibling            If the diagnosis of ischemic stroke cannot be verified            for any sibling of a proband the clinical data from            that proband are saved but no blood samples are            collected When a pedigree is complete the Clinical            Coordinating Center instructs the home health agency to            collect blood samples from all pedigree members A            phlebotomist from the home health agency visits the            subjects at their homes obtains a blood sample and            ships it to the DNA Bank                                Phase IV Genomewide Scan            The DNA Bank creates cell lines and notifies the            Genetics Laboratory when  concordant sibling pair            specimens are ready for analysis The Genetics            Laboratory then performs the genomewide scan                                    Measures of outcome          The primary outcome is the degree of linkage between          the stroke phenotype and genetic markers as measured by          the proportion of alleles shared by concordant sibling          pairs accumulated over all pairs at each marker                          Clinical database          For each proband we collect name date of birth          gender race home address home phone number email          address and alternative contact information We record          the enrolling investigators study number and the study          center number to assure accurate attribution of efforts          and to make it possible to verify entries in CRFs with          source documents Data are collected on stroke risk          factors and medical history date of onset of stroke          symptoms TOAST stroke subtype and the total number of          living full siblings          The following information is collected on all living          full siblings who return sibling response letters name          date of birth gender name of the proband they are          related to twin status home address home phone number          email address alternative contact information and          standardized risk factor and medical history          In addition for each concordant sibling

  Vacutainer for blood by mail at the start of SWISS and          the Clinical Coordinating Center will restock the supply          on a continuing basis Used kits are shipped overnight to          the DNA Bank for processing Lymphoblastoid cell lines          will be generated from peripheral blood leukocytes and          DNA extracted using routine methods DNA analysis will          begin after the th concordant sibling pair is          enrolled which we anticipate to be at the end of year           At that time the DNA Bank will ship at least  g of          DNA to the Genetics Laboratory          At the Genetics Laboratory the DNA will be plated          onto well plates for marker genotyping The ABI          GenescanGenotyper system will be employed in          semiautomated fluorescent genotyping comparing fragment          sizes to an internal standard of CEPH DNA An ABI with           wells generates the marker data All genotypes will be          scored blind to phenotype Two hundred thirtyseven          microsatellite markers obtained from Genethon CHLC and          GDB  di  tri and  tetranucleotides will be          typed in all sibling pairs These  markers have been          sorted into  panels We will run  samples per gel          with  lanes for controls estimating  samples at           panels  gels will be needed Allowing for reruns          and data loss we estimate that  gels will be required          to complete this task and extract greater than  of the          genetic data The average distance between adjacent          markers in this panel series is  cM  cM          Average heterozygosity will be calculated The CRIMAP          program will determine intermarker distances and will          also be used to form the studyspecific genetic map A          genotype database Megabase will be used to check the          binning of alleles convert allele sizes to whole          numbers and where possible to test for nonMendelian          inheritance Megabase will store all relevant          genotypicphenotypic data and produce all files needed          for statistical analysis                          Cell lines          We regard banking of samples to be a key element of          this study Collection of clinical samples is expensive          and time consuming and it is probable that progress in          identifying genes involved in stroke will be incremental          For genes of smaller effect very large sample sizes are          likely to be needed Having these resources available          will ensure that future work can build effectively on the          work we present here EpsteinBarr virustransformed          lymphoblastoid cell lines will be used                          Statistical methods          For the concordant sibling pair design the proportion          of alleles shared by the concordant sibling pairs          accumulated over all pairs at that marker is the          statistic that determines evidence for linkage between          the stroke phenotype and the genetic marker If only          concordant sibling pairs are collected a maximum of only           alleles can be identified The third discordant          sibling is collected for purposes of determining          potential nonpaternities in a sibship more than           alleles and for better estimating the proportion of          alleles shared that are identical by state in the          absence of parents          Traditional applications of gene mapping have used          families in which the trait disease is transmitted in a          clearly Mendelian fashion For more complex traits the          inheritance pattern does not fit a singlegene model and          methods that assume a genetic model may provide erroneous          results     Ischemic stroke clearly demonstrates          familial aggregation yet no singlegene model of          transmission is consistent with the family data In this          project we propose to use modelindependent relative          pair analysis a method that is designed to detect          linkage without the specification of an underlying          genetic model and that is robust to contributions by          environmental variation The methods of analysis for          determination of risk factor loci will mainly use the          SPLINK and MAPMAKERSIBS programs                               Estimates of power to detect linkage          For concordant sibling pair studies Risch              demonstrated that the fraction K           r K           p  defined as the risk ratio            r for a typeR relative can be used          to model the probable modes of transmission for a complex          disease Thus under a given model the value of            r should decrease in a modelspecific          manner for each decreasing degree of unilineal          relationship and this expected value can then be          contrasted with recurrence risks obtained from a set of          relatives monozygotic twins dizygotic twins siblings          offspring seconddegree relatives etc For a          singlelocus model therefore the value of            r  should decrease by a factor of           and a multiplicative model predicts risk on the basis          of the product of the individual factors          Risch    extended the approach of Suarez et al             to include any relative pair On the basis of this          formulation the power to detect linkage can be obtained          for relative sibling pairs For concordant sibling          pairs assuming that the candidate locus is near a stroke          susceptibility locus    power depends upon            s sibling recurrence risk and            o offspring recurrence risk If          there is little dominance effect then            s             o  and hence the power can be          computed on the basis of sibling recurrence risk For          other pairs of relatives Risch    has shown that the          single parameter            o is sufficient to specify power and           if    The recurrence risk data in relatives          are sparse for stroke Data from Framingham suggest that          a reasonable estimate of            s for stroke may range from  to                    We assume that the genetic markers used have          polymorphic information content PIC equivalent to that          of an equiprobable allele system yielding a PIC of          about  The sample size required to determine a given          power is inversely proportional to the PIC of the          markers thus a sample of  concordant sibling pairs          genotyped at a marker with PIC of  would be equivalent          to a fully informative marker typed on  concordant          pairs In our consideration of power therefore we          consider a marker with incomplete information and the          initial analyses will comprise pairwise analyses          Application of multipoint interval mapping methods will          further increase power     Formal analyses with          MAPMAKERSIBS or GeneHunter will add further power by          means of the multipoint method Using this approach we          have estimated power for a set of  sibling pairs          concordant for stroke equivalent to  pairs with fully          informative markers but without parents With these          estimates we should have ample power to detect linkage          between a marker and a moderately strong susceptibility          locus especially for locusspecific sib risks greater          than           For a homogeneous single disease susceptibility locus          the power to detect linkage with our expected           concordant sibling pairs generally approaches  Table           If stroke susceptibility is attributable to several          loci the risk becomes dependent upon the nature of the          contributions additive or epistatic and the loci are          more difficult to identify Recent efforts utilizing          analysis of genome scan data conditional on the evidence          for linkage of a major susceptibility factor show promise              With  concordant sibling pairs we have over           power to detect linkage with a genomewide          significance of           P   and locusspecific risk          of            s   As was demonstrated in the          discordant siblingpair analyses we may have substantial          power to detect linkage using a complementary analytic          approach so that the addition of even  discordant          siblings to the concordant sibling pairs may provide          additional insight on linkage                            Discussion        It is clearly of importance to define genetic risk        factor loci for stroke Defining such loci should        eventually enable us to determine prospectively those who        are at high risk for the disease and to counsel and treat        them based on this knowledge in addition these risk        factor loci may help in the identification of new drug        targets for effective treatment of this prevalent disease        However special safeguards must be in place to protect the        rights of subjects involved in genetic research If genetic        information is improperly safeguarded misuse could        adversely influence insurability    and employability           of subjects and could stigmatize individuals or groups            For this study we have adopted many of the        practical suggestions of Merz and colleagues           regarding the ethical use of human tissue For linking        purposes we use special studyspecific codes rather than        medical record numbers Social Security numbers or an        easily decoded combination of initials and birth dates        Access to linking files is restricted to an asneeded basis        only and the files are deleted when they are no longer        needed The study mandates a strictly unidirectional flow        of information This means that clinical data are used for        research purposes but research data are not used for        clinical purposes This restriction on the use of the SWISS        data set is based on our recognition that unique clinical        obligations accompany the provision of predictive genetic        test results to individual patients            Recently there has been intense debate in the United        States at the federal level over the privacy rights of        pedigree members with respect to genetic research For this        study we have adopted the position that every member of a        pedigree has the right to refuse to have personal        information such as name address and medical history        recorded in a research database This right cannot be        waived by other members of the pedigree     Therefore        probands or their noninvestigator surrogates invite other        family members to participate Siblings who are interested        in participating voluntarily provide investigators with        their name address and telephone number        Identifying the genetic basis of diseases with complex        modes of inheritance is a daunting task and it is likely        that a variety of approaches will be necessary to elucidate        the genetic basis of human stroke Genomics has been        applied to animal models of stroke and yielded discoveries        about loci that correlate with stroke risk For example        Rubattu and colleagues    identified  major        quantitative trait loci in the F cross of strokeprone and        spontaneously hypertensive rats Conducting adequately        powered genomics studies of stroke in humans is        considerably more challenging        The central approach this study takes is to identify        areas of the genome that siblings affected by stroke share        more often than one would expect by chance The strength of        this approach is its theoretical robustness because the        methods make relatively few assumptions about either the        genetic architecture of the population in which the disease        is studied or about the disease risk The weaknesses of the        approach are its relative lack of power and the low        resolution of the linkage peaks identified In addition        the logistical problem of obtaining DNA samples from        clinically wellcharacterized members of a cohort of stroke        pedigrees can be a daunting task        Although our primary analytic methods will focus on the        concordant pair design we will also use a complementary        and related approach the discordant sibling pair method        This method essentially searches for areas of the genome        that are shared less often than one would expect by chance        Discordant siblings are generally easier to collect because        they are more frequent than concordant siblings in a        disease such as stroke As demonstrated in the case of        diabetic nephropathy     the discordant sibling pair        approach can have greater power than the concordant sibling        pair approach in certain situations However the        discordant sibling pair approach is often less efficient        than the concordant sibling method because of the        uncertainty of the final diagnostic status of the        unaffected sibling Discordant siblings might have        subclinical radiographic stroke or be discordant only        because of their relative youth Furthermore resource        limitations in this study prevent the collection of blood        from more than  discordant sibling for each concordant        pair        An alternative design to one using affected relative        pairs is that of genomewide association in subjects with        ischemic stroke cases ascertained without respect to        family history compared with nonstroke controls for        frequency of numerous densely spaced genetic markers        single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs Although the        cases and controls are collected more easily than        concordant sibling pairs this approach also has        limitations First the casecontrol approach is not robust        to differential environmental contribution so that        heterogeneity between case and control exposure could        result in spurious association Second unlike the        concordant sibling pair approach controls are unaffected        only at time of collection The control sample actually        represents a mixture of subjects who will never have an        ischemic stroke and those who will eventually have an        ischemic stroke Thus true associations can be missed due        to misclassiflcation Third the number of subjects to be        collected to provide genomewide significance for an        association study remains large given the number of SNPs        to be genotyped across the genome to provide  kb to  kb        spacing To address the multiple comparisons concern with        thousands of SNPs  to  cases and controls        would need to be studied        Association studies in a casecontrol framework have a        long history in stroke etiology research However these        studies have been problematic because until now they have        only allowed testing for the known candidates and they        have been plagued by false positives With the completion        of the First Draft of the Human Genome and the        identification of haplotype maps it may be that this        approach can be adapted to a whole genome association        strategy using prudently positioned SNPs and DNA samples        banked in SWISS        Much of the theoretical challenge of finding genetic        risk factors comes from the heterogeneity of the stroke        phenotype In SWISS we are studying the ultimate phenotype        of ischemic stroke An alternative approach would be to        study an intermediate phenotype such as carotid        atherosclerosis with the hope that alleles underlying this        phenotype play a role in the etiology of the stroke itself        Shifting the object of investigation from ischemic stroke        to carotid atherosclerosis would decrease the numbers of        subjects needed Another advantage is that carotid        atherosclerosis can be treated as a quantitative trait        However using carotid atherosclerosis as an intermediate        phenotype for ischemic stroke also has limitations Perhaps        the most important difficulty is that highgrade carotid        atherosclerosis is not a prerequisite intermediate        phenotype in most patients with ischemic stroke The        largeartery atherosclerotic subtype of ischemic stroke        accounted for only  of all ischemic strokes in a recent        populationbased study in Bavaria Germany            Similarly the largeartery atherosclerotic subtype        accounted for only  of all ischemic strokes in a        populationbased study in Rochester Minnesota     In        addition to not being a mandatory intermediate phenotype in        the biological process leading to ischemic stroke carotid        atherosclerosis is itself a complex phenotype Degree of        stenosis is not the only factor affecting symptomatology of        an atherosclerotic carotid artery     and important        differences between intracranial and cervical arteries in        the genetics of atherosclerosis may go unrecognized if the        object of study is cervical carotid atherosclerosis                   Our study directly addresses the heterogeneity of the        ischemic stroke phenotype through the studywide use of a        standardized validated and widely accepted system of        classifying ischemic strokes based on presumed etiology        The process of certification minimizes variation among        local center physician investigators in assigning TOAST        stroke subtype to probands The process of central        adjudication minimizes the variation in assigning TOAST        subtype to concordant siblings Although we recognize that        it may be of value for future studies to define concordance        for phenotype by ischemic stroke subtype we have chosen to        regard that approach as exploratory at this stage        One way of dealing with the logistic challenges inherent        in genetic studies is to collect cases from an isolated        population such as Iceland     However this approach        requires an integrated health care database not easily        applicable within the US health care model and the        required community consent is probably not possible within        the US legalethical framework      Logistic        difficulties have been mitigated by the steady evolution in        multicentered clinical trials that has occurred in the        field of stroke research     SWISS is designed as a        multicenter clinical trial and the use of a nationwide        home health agency for phlebotomy service enables us to        obtain blood from siblings living far away from one        another Whereas a requirement that study subjects travel        to a local study center could result in failure to enroll        patients for logistic reasons a home health agency can        obtain blood from study subjects rendered homebound by        stroke or other ailments Thus it is hoped that this study        design will efficiently assemble a cohort of ischemic        stroke pedigrees without invoking community consent or        using coldcalling of pedigree members        In conclusion we believe that the DNA samples collected        in this study will not only be of use in defining regions        of the genome in which stroke genes reside They may also        be of use in testing for allelic association of candidate        genes and regions by SNPs because alleles that predispose        to disease should have a higher allele frequency in        siblings who share chromosomal regions than in siblings who        do not Because the cell lines are banked we hope to        facilitate the identification of stroke risk factor genes        both directly by ourselves and by others                    List
