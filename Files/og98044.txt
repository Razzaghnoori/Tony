iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HEALTH CARE FINANCING ADMINISTRATION ENTITLED MEDICARE PROGRAM SCHEDULE OF PER BENEFICIARY LIMITATIONS ON HOME HEALTH AGENCY COSTS FOR COST REPORTING PERIODS RIN 0938 AI84 i Cost benefit analysis HCFA has assessed the impact of the final rule and finds that it will decrease payments to home health agencies by approximately 1 06 billion in fiscal year 1998 and 2 14 billion in fiscal year 1999 ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 In the preamble to the final rule HCFA discusses in the form of a combined Regulatory Impact Analysis and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis the effect of the final rule on small entities The small entities include most providers physicians and health care suppliers either by virtue of their non profit status or by having revenues of 5 million or less annually HCFA states that it is clear that the rule will have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities since the aggregate per beneficiary limitation will reduce payments by approximately 9 percent While HCFA states that it has examined the options for lessening the burden on small entities since the statute does not allow for any exceptions to the aggregate per beneficiary limitation based on the size of the entity no regulatory relief can be provided for small entities iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 HCFA states that the final rule will not impose a federal intergovernmental or private sector mandate of 100 million or more as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Act of 1995 GAO OGC 98 44 iv Other relevant information or requirements under acts and executive orders Administrative Procedure Act 5 U S C 551 et seq This rule was issued as a final rule with comment period because the Secretary of Health and Human Services found good cause that notice and comment were impracticable 5 U S C 553 b B The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 enacted August 5 1997 required the per beneficiary limitations be established by April 1 1998 HCFA among other calculations had to perform a special data collection from its fiscal intermediaries to obtain cost report data and generate an unduplicated census count from the National Claims History Standard Analytical File For the same reason regarding the statutorily mandated effective date the 30 day delay in the effective date of a rule required by 5 U S C 553 d was also waived Since there was neither a proposed rule nor the receipt of public comments HCFA has properly invoked the exception found at 5 U S C 808 2 to the 60 day delay in the effective date of a major rule normally required under the Congressional Review Act subtitle of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 Paperwork Reduction Act 44 U S C 3501 3520 HCFA notes in the preamble that the final rule does not have any collections of information that would be subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act Statutory authorization for the rule The final rule was promulgated pursuant to the authority in section 1861 v 1 L of the Social Security Act 42 U S C 1395x v 1 L and section 4207 of Pub L 101508 42 U S C 1395x note Executive Order No 12866 The final rule was determined to be an
