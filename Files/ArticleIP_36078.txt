 The World Wine Web Subject Illegal Internet Wine From Paula Re Date Sun Oct 3 As a liquor store owner I m not so concerned about my fair state losing out on millions of tax dollars through Internet sales What does concern me greatly however is the fact that I pay 2 000 annually to my local selectmen for the privilege of selling wines in my town Why should someone from across the country having paid no licensing fees whatsoever be able to take potential business away from me Granted some locations are state regulated but for those of us who are privately operated the idea of someone being allowed to compete with us for free is insulting I have no problem with competition just make sure that it s a level playing field To reply click here Subject The Spanish Inquisition From The Grand Inquisitor Re Date Fri Oct 1 This whole unsavory episode brings back memories of skits with Monty Python One of my favorite lines was You are guilty of six no seven charges of heresy Of course the limits of television broadcasting prevent me from presenting a shred of evidence to support them To reply click here Subject Bauer and the Press Sharks From pdbrophy Re Date Thu Sept 30 If the behavior of the reporters was so indefensible in your mind why aren t they identified by name Professional courtesy To reply click here Subject Buchanan and Anti Semitism From Jewish in Spirit Re Date Thu Sept 30 Nowhere does Slate prove that the following definition from the Anti Semitism has anything to do with the examples cited in Mr Buchanan s book Anti Semitism is an ideology an interlocked set of principles and prejudices in which certain nefarious traits or practices are ascribed to Jews as a people even when few Jews exhibit those traits or when other people engage in those practices Slate proceeds to name very specific individuals presumably Jews whose policies Mr Buchanan takes to task Where is the generalization to Jews as a people Where does he impugn that only Jews subscribe to such policies Which of his examples involve traits or practices The examples simply do not support his premise that Mr Buchanan is prejudiced To reply click here Subject For Artists Diversity Doesn t Mean Catholic From Frederick Fittin Re Date Thu Sept 30 The uproar by the liberals is understandable Catholic bashing is OK since it is a priori art Doing the same thing to let s say blacks or Jews is hateful and mean spirited I do not want my tax money to support trash art or any art for that matter If I want to enjoy art I go to the Met or MoMA in NYC I pay my admission for the privilege We have no more business supporting art precisely because one person s art is another person s trash To reply click here Subject Art Does Not Equal Beauty From Frederick Bartlett Re Date Fri Oct 1 While the Madonna and dung are certainly and certainly intentionally inflammatory I think there s a bigger and older issue still unresolved Namely that the art world thinks that the purpose of art is to expand the boundaries of human perception and to confront our cultural limitations while hoi polloi would be far more likely to define it as to render beauty with skill Until curators and critics manage to convince the great unwashed that beauty and skill are irrelevant or even antagonistic to art we will have these contretemps every year or two To reply click here Subject Intrusive Literary Devices From Jon Ihle Re Date Thu Sept 30 So a literary device fails if it is intrusive destroys the illusion of transparency and calls attention to itself as a construct Like the final scene of A Winter s Tale or the last speech of The Tempest This standard for literary achievement would also discredit any work in the modernist tradition for example Brecht s and Beckett s plays You might also have to dump a few classics on the order of Paradise Lost or Tristram Shandy It is only a very narrow and very recent tradition in literature that demands we prop up the notion that art should resemble life as closely as possible and in all its probabilities This doctrine of expressive realism is a nineteenth century notion that most historically aware writers have moved beyond At least Morris isn t pretending like most traditional biographers that he is in command of some untainted objectivity beyond authorial presence or beyond fiction The subjectivity of the author is indelible at least Morris has the guts to expose it To reply click here Subject Normal Weather From Bill McKibben Re Date Mon Sept 27 I thought Mr Plotz s article was very funny But I think he is factually incorrect on the question of whether severe storms are increasing Across this hemisphere according to the scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration severe storms meaning more than 2 inches of rainfall in a 24 hour period are up about 20 percent compared with the century average That s an enormous increase in a baseline physical phenomenon it s as if you woke up and everyone was suddenly seven feet tall It begs for explanation and the most plausible explanation according to the climatologists is global warming Warm air holds more water than cold air Hence a warmed environment and we ve seen the ten warmest years on record since 1980 will see both more aridity due to increased evaporation and precipitation when those clouds finally let loose This may make me a Greeniac but I think it actually makes me more like a physicist If you add more heat energy to a confined space the atmosphere that energy is going to express itself and one way it will do so is with increased rainfall and storminess To reply click here
