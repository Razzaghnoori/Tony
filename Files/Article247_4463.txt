 Pre Teen Follies Dear Christine All right all right so maybe I exaggerated a little when I said you were a Republican operative plotting Al Gore s demise when you ran into him outside that Washington movie theater way back when So I took a little literary license Trust me sister The story works great when you re not around to correct it with trifles like the facts I do remember the laughable panic that Washington plunges into every time the city gets so much as a dusting of snow But here in New York City as you know the mindset is a little different Here it takes the equivalent of a percussion bomb to get anyone s attention Here we don t chitchat much about the weather or foreign policy or world peace Every day is a Seinfeld episode and even when it s not the tabloid headline writers try to turn it into one We re the hard to please connoisseurs of a unique local art form The Truly Weird Story Take today Rather than waking up and remarking about the four inches of snow we received here overnight the big story here is about the two office workers who were stuck in an skyscraper elevator that went on a 40 story free fall only to screech to a stop near the fourth floor when the emergency brake kicked in Apparently some rescue workers took an adjacent elevator to the place where the man and woman were stuck took out the side panels that separated the two elevator cars then asked them to make a tightrope walk across a narrow beam that spanned the shaft between the two elevators as if these two poor knee knocking souls were suddenly the second coming of Karl Wallenda They did it But can you say intensive therapy Another headline here today said Mia Farrow s son Seamus wants to enroll at Columbia next year Even though he s 12 Apparently he s already taking courses at a small college at Massachusetts I read that and thought I can t even remember what I was doing at 12 Can you I faintly recall jamming a full pack of bubblegum into my mouth before every softball game I played And falling asleep to baseball games that I listened to on a transistor radio I smuggled to bed And getting so dusty from playing outside all day that I could wet my finger and write my name on my dirt covered legs Back then my parents had just bought us a homicidal pony named Yankee and while I was trying to ride him one day he bucked me right over a three rail fence I landed in some tall grass with a thud Perhaps not surprisingly years later I had to go to the doctor because of a back problem I had a slightly cracked disk and the doctor asked me how it might ve happened And I thought about being launched off the horse and all the other stuff that happened that same year the time I fell out of a tree in my neighbor s yard the time I fell 20 feet from a hay loft and landed unhurt on a barn floor covered with straw the time I wrecked a minibike or fell into a ravine after trying to swing one handed on a tree vine like I d just seen Johnny Weismuller do in a Tarzan movie I also fell smack on my head in gym class when a classmate forgot to hold my legs onto the uneven bars as I practicing a gymnastics maneuver called a Flying Eagle I couldn t turn my head for a week So just as I m about to tell my doctor Leopold all this she s staring at the X ray and absently says You know 90 percent of these back problems are hereditary So that s what I was doing at age 12 I didn t even know the word matriculation Gotta run now because the TV news has just started a story about the police apprehending Soccer Guy this sidewalk bandit who distracted tourists by breaking into a soccer ball handling routine then circling and bumping them until he d pickpocketed their wallets As local lore goes it doesn t match the all time classic Headless Body Found in Topless Bar Nor does Soccer Guy seem like an appellation that s likely to go down in the annals of crime alongside Sammy the Bull or even Paulie Walnuts that hit man on the Sopranos But as in Washington on snowy days like this you take what you can get Stay warm Johnette
