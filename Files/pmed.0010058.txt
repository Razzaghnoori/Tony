                    Diabetes Epidemiology and Complications        Treatment for and the prognosis of type diabetes mellitus TDM has progressed        dramatically during the last century but the disease remains a major cause of morbidity        and mortality Although precise figures are not available over  million United States        citizens currently live with the disease with approximately  new cases diagnosed in        the US each year The total number of people with diabetes worldwide is expected to rise to         million in  up from  million in          The exact etiology of the disease remains uncertain but extensive research suggests an        interaction between genetic predisposition and environment In fact for unknown reasons        the incidence of TDM is increasing  Diabetes continues to have a tremendous societal        impact it is both difficult and expensive to treat and is associated with a number of        longterm complications including kidney failure blindness nerve damage and premature        mortality predominately due to cardiovascular problems                    Insulins Impact        Banting and Bests discovery of insulin in the early s revolutionized diabetes        treatment and greatly improved the prognosis for what had previously been a rapidly fatal        disease As shown by the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and the more recent        Epidemiology of Diabetes Interventions and Complications trial insulin therapy has made        such considerable advances with better insulin formulations and delivery systems that        many patients can maintain their blood sugar levels within a tight range and thereby reduce        their risk for the diseases longterm complications  In addition improved        treatment of other associated conditions such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia have        helped reduce or at least delay many of the longterm sequelae of diabetes  However        problems with insulinbased treatment regimens persist For the patient treatment is        expensive and difficult requiring strict attention to blood glucose monitoring insulin        dosing diet and exercise Further good glycemia control is not easily achieved by all        patients and even for those able to achieve this goal the treatment is not always        completely effective                    Promising Directions        Just as financial investors balance a portfolio with some risky investments and others        that are more secure researchers will undoubtedly continue to further refine secure        insulinbased regimens to help patients achieve even better glycemia control At the same        time scientists are pursuing more highrisk highpayoff approaches to revolutionize        diabetes care One such approach is the closedloop insulin pump ie a pump that        continuously monitors blood glucose and concurrently converts that data into appropriate        insulin dosing which offers the potential to serve as a mechanical pancreas However        such a mechanical system would need be failsafe in order to avoid devastating effects        eg if the monitor were to register a falsely elevated blood glucose and thereby trigger        an inappropriately high insulin dose In other similar scenarios with no tolerance for        error NASA for instance sets up systems in which two independent monitoring systems must        come up with similar measurements before an action is taken Perhaps the engineering        obstacles that currently limit the closedloop insulin pump can be overcome        Other research groups are investigating whether the insulinproducing cells within the        pancreas socalled  cells might be promoted to regenerate in vitro or in vivo to        replace the pool of insulinproducing cells reduced by autoimmune destruction Another        promising approach for creating cells capable of physiologically regulated insulin        secretion is to coax stem cellsundifferentiated cells with selfregenerative capacityto        differentiate into like cells Gene therapy approaches may overcome present obstacles and        result in cells capable of physiologically regulated insulin secretion  Lastly the        recent completion of the Human Genome Project suggests that the genetics of diabetes may        eventually become clearer and may direct appropriate preventative approaches        While such potential therapies remain experimental pancreas transplantation is        currently performed in patients with complicated diabetes However a recent report that        shows benefit for patients with both diabetes and kidney failure who receive a combined        pancreas and kidney transplant also found that an isolated pancreas transplant for        patients with preserved kidney function actually worsened survival  The main point is        that as we develop new therapies we must maintain humility and recognize that newer        approaches may have great promise but they also have the potential for harm                    History of Islet Transplantation        Islet transplantation has recently received considerable interest as a potentially        definitive treatment for diabetes The concept of islet transplantation is not        newinvestigators as early as the English surgeon Charles Pybus  attempted to        graft pancreatic tissue to cure diabetes Most however credit the recent era of islet        transplantation research to Paul Lacys studies dating back more than three decades In         Lacys group described a novel collagenasebased method later modified by Dr        Camillo Ricordi then working with Dr Lacy to isolate islets paving the way for future        in vitro and in vivo islet experiments  Subsequent studies showed that transplanted        islets could reverse diabetes in both rodents and nonhuman primates  Figure  In        a summary of the  Workshop on Pancreatic Islet Cell Transplantation in Diabetes Lacy        commented on the feasibility of islet cell transplantation as a therapeutic approach for        the possible prevention of the complications of diabetes in man  Improvements in        isolation techniques and immunosuppressive regimens ushered in the first human islet        transplantation clinical trails in the mids Yet despite continued procedural        improvements only about  of islet recipients in the late s achieved euglycemia        normal blood glucose In  Dr James Shapiro and colleagues published a report        describing seven consecutive patients who achieved euglycemia following islet        transplantation using a steroidfree protocol and large numbers of donor islets since        referred to as the Edmonton protocol  This protocol has been adapted by islet        transplant centers around the world and has greatly increased islet transplant success                    Current Limitations of Islet Transplantation        While significant progress has been made in the islet transplantation field  many        obstacles remain that currently preclude its widespread application Two of the most        important limitations are the currently inadequate means for preventing islet rejection        and the limited supply of islets for transplantation Current immunosuppressive regimens        are capable of preventing islet failure for months to years but the agents used in these        treatments are expensive and may increase the risk for specific malignancies and        opportunistic infections In addition and somewhat ironically the most commonly used        agents like steroids calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin are also known to impair        normal islet function andor insulin action Further like all medications the agents have        other associated toxicities with side effects such as oral ulcers peripheral edema        anemia weight loss hypertension hyperlipidemia diarrhea and fatigue  Perhaps of        greatest concern to the patient and physician is the harmful effect of certain widely        employed immunosuppressive agents on renal function For the patient with diabetes renal        function is a crucial factor in determining longterm outcome and calcineurin inhibitors        tacrolimus and cyclosporin are significantly nephrotoxic Thus while some patients with        a pancreas transplant tolerate the immunosuppressive agents well and for such patients        diabetic nephropathy can gradually improve in other patients the net effect decreased        risk due to the improved blood glucose control increased risk from the immunosuppressive        agents may worsen kidney function Indeed Ojo et al have published an analysis        indicating that among patients receiving otherthankidney allografts  end up with        renal failure as a result of the transplant andor subsequent immunosuppression         Looked at another way patients with heart liver lung or kidney failure have a dismal        prognosis for survival so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted the        benefits of graft survival outweigh the risks associated with the medications But for the        subset of patients with diabetes and preserved kidney function even those with        longstanding and difficulttocontrol disease the prognosis for survival is comparatively        much better In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities other risks are associated        with the islet transplant procedure itself including intraabdominal hemorrhage following        the transplant and portal vein thromboses The fact that there is already a good        alternative to islet transplantation ie the modern intensive insulin regimen forces us        to regard any newer riskier interventions with a critical eye        Like all transplantation therapies islet transplantation is also handicapped by the        limited donor pool The numbers are striking at least  million Americans have TDM and        only a few thousand donor pancreata are available each year To circumvent this organ        shortage problem researchers continue to look for ways to grow isletsor at least cells        capable of physiologically regulated insulin secretionin vitro but currently only islets        from cadaveric donors can be used to restore euglycemia Further exacerbating the problem        and unlike kidney liver and heart transplants where only one donor is needed for each        recipient most islet transplant patients require islets from two or more donors to achieve        euglycemia Lastly the current methods for islet isolation need improvement since only        about half of attempted isolations produce transplantready islets        While islet transplantation research has made important progress and the success stories        are encouraging the longterm safety and efficacy of the procedure remain unclear Other        concerns relating to the field include questions about the impact of having        insulinproducing foreign cells within the hepatic parenchyma the longterm consequences        of elevated portal pressures resulting from the islet infusion and the fact that islet        recipients can be sensitized against donor tissue types making it more difficult to find a        suitable donor should another lifesaving transplant be required in the future Also very        few islet transplant recipients have remained euglycemic without the use of any exogenous        insulin beyond four years posttransplant Thus while most islet recipients achieve better        glycemia control and suffer less serious hypoglycemia islet transplantation continues to        fall short of the definitive diabetes cure                    Is Islet Transplantation Ready for Widespread Use        While no one suggests that the therapy is ready for widespread clinical application        another way of highlighting current problems is to focus on cost Assuming present hurdles        were cleared islet transplantation costs approximately  per patient per        transplant With over  million Americans dealing with TDM it would cost over         billion to give each patient a single islet transplant with little assurance as yet of any        longterm benefit In contrast the annual direct cost of a proven therapy like intensive        insulin treatment is about  per patient         The limitations of islet transplantation force us to recognize that the therapy remains        experimental and that many questions must be answered before it is incorporated into        general clinical practice At the present time we urge a focus on the selection of only        those patients for whom this procedure offers the greatest likelihood of benefit Most        people with diabetes can with diligence and perseverance implement an insulin regimen        that maintains tight glucose control while avoiding dangerous hypoglycemia However there        are some patients who continue to have tremendous difficulty managing their disease despite        optimal care and effort Even the statement despite optimal care and effort is difficult        to define and we advocate that all patients being considered for an islet transplant first        be referred for several months to specialty teams that are committed to diabetes care        Since such patients whose diabetes is the most difficult to control have a poor quality of        life islet transplantation offers potential benefit Even a low baseline level of insulin        production by the transplanted islets may lower the amount of insulin required while        reducing the number and severity of hypoglycemic events We also believe the islet        transplant riskbenefit ratio is favorable for those with both TDM and kidney failure who        are listed for a lifepreserving kidney transplant such patients will have to take        immunosuppressive agents after transplant to preserve the kidney allograft function so the        islets can be added without too much additional risk        Where do we go from here Just as early studies showed islet transplantations promise        research must now overcome the hurdles revealed by the recent islet transplant experience        New immunomodulatory agents offer the greatest hope of revolutionizing the field New drug        regimens capable of inducing tolerance to the transplanted islets would allow recipients to        maintain their grafts without general immunosuppression and its associated toxicities        While many targets are currently under investigation none are ready for clinical use We        advocate that such immunomodulatory approaches be tested first in controlled models where        the results can be appropriately attributed to the agent itself                    Conclusion        Less than a century ago TDM was invariably a fatal disease With the advent of        insulin the prognosis changed overnight and we have continued to witness improvements in        diabetes care and outcomes Pancreatic islet transplant has offered renewed hope to many        patients with diabetes who envision a life free of glucose checks and insulin injections        Some transplanted patients have enjoyed success and are pleased with their decisions        unfortunately these results are not universal Researchers must continue to look for ways        to improve the procedure while protecting the welfare of each individual patient The field        has come a long way but we must remain cautious as we are treating a nonfatal disease        for which there is a very effective standard therapy
