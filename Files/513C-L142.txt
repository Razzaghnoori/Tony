 November 23 1994 Dear Colleague Over the last fifteen years members of the Indiana Dental Association have built the Pursuit of Excellence Endowment at the IU School of Dentistry with contributions in excess of 600 000 We have funded significant research endeavors and rewarded outstanding faculty for work that is at the leading edge of oral health care In addition to funding these projects the School has invested the money well and the market value of the endowment has grown to over 750 000 Last year the Trustees of the Indiana Dental Association approved a resolution to raise funds to build the endowment to 1 million to fund a distinguished chair at IUSD The Indiana Dental Association Distinguished Chair will represent the first state dental association in the country to complete such a commitment to its dental school In the rapidly changing health care arena this chair will serve as an important symbol of the shared commitment of the school and profession in Indiana An endowed chair will greatly benefit the IU School of Dentistry From its inception the IDA Pursuit of Excellence Fund has supported and rewarded faculty for unique and outstanding effort on behalf of dentistry Income from the endowment will enable IUSD to attract and retain an eminently qualified faculty member for the school We will be able to fund the position with important incentives for excellence which would not be available from any other source Our entire profession will benefit greatly from this endowment It is important and we hope that you will make a significant contribution to the Pursuit of Excellence fund this year Five year pledges are essential and will be recognized at the IDA Annual Session and in school and professional publications Your contribution made through Indiana University Foundation is tax deductible to the fullest extent of the law Thank you for your consideration of this important request Sincerely H William Gilmore DDS Dean IU School of Dentistry Lloyd J Phillips DDS Chair IDA Endowment Committee
