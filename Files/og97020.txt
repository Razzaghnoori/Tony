U S C 801 a 1 B i iv OF A MAJOR RULE ISSUED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ENTITLED DISCLOSURE OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS RIN 3235 AG42 RIN 3235 AG77 i Cost benefit analysis The Commission stated in its report to us that there is no statutory mandate for it to prepare a cost benefit analysis of a rule However section 23 a 2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 directs the Commission to consider the impact that any rule will have on competition The Commission states that it is adopting these amendments and disclosure items in response to requests from investors and others to provide more meaningful information about various financial and commodity instruments According to the Commission the expected benefits of these amendments are to provide more complete information about market risk sensitive instruments to investors and others This more complete disclosure is expected to result in the markets operating more efficiently The Commission believes that the benefits from the more complete disclosure and increased market efficiency are expected to outweigh the related costs The Commission also believes that the rule will not impose any unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition ii Agency actions relevant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act 5 U S C 603 605 607 and 609 Section 603 Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The proposed rulemaking 61 Fed Reg 578 January 8 1996 incorporated an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the expected impact on small entities The analysis provides the information required by paragraphs 603 b 1 through b 3 It describes the reasons for the proposed action and its objectives and legal basis It describes the small entities small business issuers to which the rule will apply It states that the proposed rule does not conflict or overlap with existing requirements but rather tailors them for specific purposes The analysis further points out that it has reduced the impact of the proposed amendments on small businesses by determining not to amend Regulation S B to incorporate an item similar to proposed Item 305 of Regulation S K GAO OGC 97 20 Section 604 Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis The preamble to the final rule contains a summary of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 62 Fed Reg 6062 February 10 1997 The agency submitted the entire analysis to us for our review when it submitted its report on the rule As required by section 604 a 1 the Commission provided a succinct statement of the need for and the objectives of the rule Although no comments were filed that addressed the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis comments were received from 97 entities The analysis discusses the changes made to the proposed rule as a result of the comments including 1 extending the safe harbor to any Item 305 disclosure that is voluntarily provided by a small business issuer and 2 several changes that the Commission believes should reduce the cost for all registrants preparing the disclosures of quantitative information about market risk The Commission also describes how excluding small business issuers from all but the accounting policy disclosures required by the rule limits substantially the application of the amendments to small entities It also states that the accounting policies required by the new rule are clarifications of existing requirements and should not require any additional recordkeeping or bookkeeping iii Agency actions relevant to sections 202 205 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 2 U S C 1532 1535 As an independent regulatory agency the Commission is not subject to title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 iv Other relevant
