 Background There are three general mechanisms whereby vascular smooth muscle force is regulated 1 Activation mechanisms involve contractile pathways that increase ser 19 myosin regulatory light chain MRLC phosphorylation either by increases in myoplasmic calcium Ca 2 i 1 or by decreases in myosin light chain phosphatase activity 2 The increased ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation activates the myosin s ATPase producing crossbridge cycling and contraction 2 Deactivation mechanisms are the reversal of activation mechanisms relaxation results from lower ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation induced by either reductions in Ca 2 3 4 or increases in myosin light chain phosphatase activity 5 Since dephosphoylated myosin does not cycle force is reduced 3 Force suppression occurs when force is reduced despite persistent elevation in ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation levels This is an exception to the above MRLC phosphorylation paradigm since phosphorylated myosin should cycle and produce force Force suppression has been observed with elevations in cGMP 6 7 cAMP 8 extracellular Mg 2 9 and with some pharmacologic treatments Cyclic nucleotide induced relaxation is associated with phosphorylation of heat shock protein 20 also known as HSP20 or P20 on serine 16 10 11 12 More recently ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation was shown to specifically and temporally correlate with force suppression rather than the deactivation form of relaxation 8 10 A region of HSP20 residues 110 121 has sequence homology with troponin I peptides from this region bound thin filaments reduced actin activated myosin S1 ATPase activity and relaxed skinned swine carotid artery 10 We hypothesized that binding of ser 16 phosphorylated HSP20 to the thin filament may turn off thin filaments so that phosphorylated myosin does not interact with the thin filament i e a model similar to skeletal muscle troponin I This would explain low force with elevated MRLC phosphorylation HSP20 has a second phosphorylation site presumptively phosphorylated by PKC 12 of unclear significance HSP20 is a member of the heat shock protein superfamily and is known to provide resistance to heat treatment in cells 13 Recently we found that heat pretreatment 4 hours at 44 5 C of swine carotid artery increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and suppressed force 14 In this study we addressed three questions 1 What is the temperature threshold for increases in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force suppression 2 Does the heat pretreatment response diminish by prolonged recovery at 37 C after heat treatment i e is the heat pretreatment reversible And 3 Are increases in cAMP or cGMP responsible for the heat induced increases in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation Results Experimental protocol Tissues were first equilibrated at 37 C 15 This involved a warm up 109 mM K contraction approximately 30 min after mounting repeated stretching to 1 10 5N m 2 20 g for a 20 mg tissue a release to 0 2 10 5N m 2 4 g and a second 109 mM K contraction approximately 120 min after mounting This protocol sets the muscle to the optimal length for force generation The latter K contraction was used for force normalization Tissues were then exposed to various temperatures for various times solutions were replaced if evaporation was observed Temperature was changed by adjusting the water bath set point This procedure increased temperature within 5 min Reducing temperature would have been slower but was accelerated by adding ice to the water bath After the exposure to different temperatures tissues were returned to 37 C for various times contracted with 10 M histamine for 10 min and then frozen for analysis Threshold for temperature dependent increase in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force suppression Equilibrated swine carotid medial rings were exposed to various temperatures for 4 hours returned to 37 C for 1 hour contracted with 10 M histamine for 10 min and then frozen Significant reduction in force and increases in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation were observed with heat treatments between 43 C and 46 C Fig 1 Ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation levels did not significantly differ in tissues treated at 44 5 C or 37 C suggesting that the decreased force observed at 44 5 C was force suppression Histamine did not induce any contraction after pretreatment at 47 5 C and histamine also did not significantly increase ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation levels MRLC phosphorylation was significantly less than that observed at 37 C This result suggests that the decreased force observed at 47 5 C was caused by reduced ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation Ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation at 47 5 C was significantly lower than that observed at 44 5 C but higher than that observed at 37 C These data suggest a biphasic response with ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation associated force suppression with heat pretreatment between 43 and 46 C and deactivation by inhibition of ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation after heat pretreatment at 47 5 C Pretreatment at 2 C induced a small insignificant increase in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation without significant effects on force Putative PKC HSP20 phosphorylation 12 was not significantly altered at any tested temperature Recovery after heat treatment Swine carotid medial rings were exposed to 44 5 C for 4 hours followed by 37 C for various times before stimulation with 10 M histamine for 10 min and freezing Fig 2 A set of control tissues were not exposed to 44 5 C and had low ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation labeled before Ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation levels were high both in tissues that were histamine stimulated at 44 5 C 0 time i e no recovery at 37 C and in tissues that were returned to 37 C for 15 min to 16 hours Force was suppressed in all heat treated tissues regardless of recovery time There appeared to be a modest rebound in histamine induced contraction 1 to 8 hours after return to 37 C Dependence of histamine induced force on ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation The relation between mean ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and mean force from all the tissues that were stimulated with histamine is shown in the upper panel of Fig 3 There is a clear relation between reduced histamine induced force and increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation with all treatments except the 47 5 C heat pretreatment protocol The lack of correlation at 47 5 C is expected given the lower ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation i e deactivation observed after 47 5 C pretreatment There was no correlation between putative PKC HSP20 phosphorylation and force lower panel of Fig 3 Cyclic nucleotide levels did not correlate with heat induced ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation levels Swine carotid medial rings were stimulated with 10 M histamine for 10 min either before control or at the end of a 4 hour 44 5 C treatment Heat pretreatment did not significantly alter cAMP and cGMP levels despite significantly increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and suppressed force These data suggest that the increases in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation cannot be explained by elevated cAMP and cGMP levels after 4 hours of heat pretreatment Discussion Our prior study 14 found that 1 44 5 C heat pretreatment of swine carotid artery increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and suppressed force i e a reduction in force without a significant reduction in MRLC phosphorylation 2 The effects of heat pretreatment and nitroglycerin were additive both on increasing ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and suppressing force 14 And 3 the relation between ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force was similar with heat pretreatment and nitroglycerin suggesting a similar mechanism of action to suppress force 14 The goal of this study was to extend our observations on heat treatment We found that temperatures between 43 and 46 C increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and suppressed force i e reduced force without reductions in ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation Fig 1 Excepting the 47 5 C response the relation between mean ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and mean force was similar with all treatments in these histamine stimulated tissues top panel Fig 3 consistent with the hypothesis that ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation was mediating force suppression No contraction was observed after pretreatment at 47 5 C however this was not force suppression since MRLC phosphorylation was significantly reduced to near basal levels for the swine carotid This may explain why the response observed after 47 5 C was not on the ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation force relation shown in Fig 3 This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that different temperatures reduce force by different mechanisms For example whole body hyperthermia at 41 5 C induced apoptosis in rats 16 while exposure to 48 C reportedly induces necrosis in cultured cells 17 The similar temperature sensitivity of apoptosis and ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation suggests the possibility of a role for HSP20 in the promotion of or protection from apoptosis It is possible that HSP20 induced force suppression may be part of a protective response to moderate heat exposure In contrast the absence of a contractile and MRLC phosphorylation response after more extreme heat exposure 47 5 C may represent tissue necrosis There was no significant change in putative PKC HSP20 phosphorylation 12 with any protocol As a result there was no correlation between putative PKC HSP20 phosphorylation and force lower panel of Fig 3 We also investigated whether the heat pretreatment response was reversible Ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation levels remained elevated and overall force remained low up to 16 hours after return of heat treated tissues to 37 C This suggests that the process that increases ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation is not reversible at least in vitro This may indicate substantial tissue damage during the 4 hour exposure at 44 5 C Finally we found that the increases in ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation were not explained by increases in cAMP or cGMP at the end of heat treatment Fig 4 This suggests that some other mechanism keeps ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation at high levels Considering that the increased ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation remains elevated for 16 hours after return to 37 C it is possible that heat treatment is reducing HSP20 phosphatase activity Our experiments suggest that temperatures of 43 C and above can alter arterial contractility Such temperatures can occur physiologically Brooks et al 18 exhaustively exercised rats for 90 min on treadmills Immediately after exercise not during thermocouples were inserted into thigh skeletal muscles and the rectum They found an initial mean temperature of 44 1 C in skeletal muscle and 42 1 C rectally Both temperatures fell exponentially with rest after exercise It is likely that muscle temperature exceeded 44 1 C for at least part of the 90 min exercise This suggests that profound exercise can increase regional temperature to levels that could potentially induce ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force suppression Thermal stress may bring about a resistance to contractile agonists which could have clinical significance in conditions such as hyperthermia and or sepsis with vasodilatory shock Heat treatment may have effects on smooth muscle beyond contractility Orihara et al 19 reported that exposure of vascular smooth muscle cells to 43 C for 2 hours inhibited cell proliferation Further work is required to assess whether HSP20 is involved in this response These results also demonstrate that multiple mechanisms can induce force suppression that is correlated with ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation Our prior studies showed that increases in cGMP by nitrovasodilators and cAMP by forskolin increase ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and induce force suppression 8 Such results suggest that the correlation between ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force suppression is robust in the swine carotid stimulated with 10 M histamine However it must be stressed that different contractile conditions may be associated with different relationships between ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation and force given the multiple mechanisms whereby agents can cause relaxation 3 4 5 For example smooth muscle relaxation can occur by agents that reduce myoplasmic Ca 2 by inducing hyperpolarization reducing Ca 2 influx without changes in membrane potential increasing Ca 2 efflux or by reducing Ca 2 release from the internal store The response can depend on the form of contractile activation e g nitroglycerin reduces Ca 2 better after agonist activation compared with K depolarization 20 Comparison of ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation force relationships require careful analysis in comparison with ser 19 MRLC phosphorylation levels to clearly show that the change in force is force suppression rather than deactivation Methods Tissues Swine common carotid arteries were obtained from a slaughterhouse and transported at 0 C in physiological salt solution PSS PSS contained mM NaCl 140 KCl 4 7 3 N morpholino propane sulfonic acid MOPS 5 Na 2 HPO 4 1 2 CaCl 2 1 6 MgSO 4 1 2 D glucose 5 6 pH adjusted to 7 4 at 37 C Dissection of medial rings mounting and determination of the optimum length for stress development at 37 C was performed as described 21 The carotid ring preparation differs in the method of mounting from our prior heat study which employed carotid strips 14 The mounting procedure rings vs strips does not alter the behavior of the carotid media in tissue baths The intimal surface was mechanically rubbed to remove the endothelium Antibodies Rabbit anti HSP20 antibody was made commercially via repeated injection of gel purified recombinant HSP20 sequence confirmed by mass spectroscopy After confirmation of an antigenic response serum was collected and frozen for future use Specificity was verified as described 8 Measurement of HSP20 and MRLC phosphorylation Swine carotid arteries were first thermally and histamine stimulated followed by freezing in an acetone dry ice slurry 15 After air drying the tissues were homogenized in a buffer 20 mg wet weight tissue ml buffer containing 1 SDS 10 glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol Full strength half strength and quarter strength dilutions of samples were then separated on one dimensional isoelectric focusing gels ampholytes were a 50 50 mixture of pI 4 6 5 and pI 5 8 for HSP20 and a 50 50 mixture of pI 4 6 5 and pI 4 5 5 4 for MRLC blotted to PVDF or nitrocellulose membranes immunostained with our rabbit polyclonal anti HSP20 antibody 1 5000 or rabbit polyclonal anti MRLC antibody 1 4000 in 1 bovine serum albumin and 0 01 sodium azide and detected with enhanced chemifluorescence ECF for HSP20 and enhanced chemiluminescence ECL for MRLC 22 A representative blot is shown in Fig 5 The dilutions ensured that the detection system was in the linear range Immunoblots were scanned on a Molecular Dynamics fluorimager Phosphorylation was determined by change in the isoelectric point pI for each phosphorylation species There are two HSP20 phosphorylation sites in the swine carotid therefore there are four immunoreactive species unphosphorylated at pI 6 3 top band in Fig 5 monophosphorylated on a putative protein kinase C PKC site at pI 6 0 second from the top band in Fig 5 monophosphorylated on ser 16at pI 5 9 second from the bottom band in Fig 5 and diphosphorylated on both ser 16 and the putative PKC site at pI 5 7 bottom band in Fig 5 Phosphorylation at ser 16was confirmed by mass spectroscopy sequencing of the pI 5 7 isoform in our laboratory Ser 16 HSP20 phosphorylation was reported as the percent of ser 16monophosphorylated pI 5 9 plus diphosphorylated HSP20 pI 5 7 in relation to the sum of all four species Identification of the PKC site is putative and is best described by Beall et al 12 They found that phorbol dibutyrate induced phosphorylation in the C terminal region of HSP20 based on tryptic digest analysis We calculated putative PKC HSP20 phosphorylation as the percent of putative PKC monophosphorylated HSP20 pI 6 0 plus diphosphorylated HSP20 pI 5 7 in relation to the sum of all species For MRLC phosphorylation was determined as the percent of phosphorylated smooth muscle MRLC in relation to total smooth muscle MRLC i e non muscle MRLC were ignored Cyclic nucleotide assays cAMP and cAMP were determined by
