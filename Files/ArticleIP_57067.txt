 Seattle Under Siege The riots at the World Trade Organization summit in Seattle were the world s top story Wednesday Seattle Under Siege was the most popular headline in the English language press Some British newspapers also fronted parallel demonstrations in London in which about 1 000 anti capitalist protesters battled police at Euston railway station leaving one police officer seriously injured Regarding Seattle the Times of India began its report It rains here almost every day The day it does not it is overcast But weather alone wasn t causing gloom on Monday The Guardian of London s John Vidal gave one of the better accounts of the scene Strains of Beethoven s fifth and Tina Turner drift in with the tear gas as gangs of black masked protestors overturn newspaper stands he wrote They try to smash a Starbucks coffee house door but give up quickly A McDonald s window is broken then one in Gap They race through three streets followed by TV cameras Vidal quoted a Chinese government observer I cannot see how America will not be politically embarrassed The world is watching What do they see A major city in disorder It looks bad A South American delegate told Vidal We have come thousands of miles for these talks America is supposed to lead the world what has happened In the Evening Standard of London Wednesday business editor Anthony Hilton said of the demonstrators in an op ed piece Most could not explain why they were there or what any of the others were protesting about But they were most certainly there in huge numbers and upset about something That rather than anything specific they said was the message He described them in their Nike trainers excitedly loading their Fuji film to take pictures with their Canons chatting on their Nokia mobiles and dancing at the intersections to music from their Sonys as walking advertisements for the global economy But he argued that what they were really doing was protesting against the unchallenged consensus in favor of free market economics that has dominated the whole world for the past 10 years P eople and circumstances being what they are any monopoly of political thought however valid it may seem becomes unsustainable Hilton wrote Perhaps the real message of Seattle is that people are beginning however uncertainly and inarticulately to look for an alternative The Times of India had a scoop Wednesday It discovered that the plane carrying Pakistan s military leader Gen Pervaiz Musharraf on his coup mission in October had refueled twice on its way to Karachi This

of fuel In fact claimed the paper it had plenty of fuel and the case against Sharif may not finally hold ground In Israel Ha aretz reported Wednesday that an important Chinese visitor secretly visited

the World Health Organization Nigeria has entered the stage where the epidemic is likely to increase at an exponential rate if adequate national response is not mounted to stem its spread While there is a window of opportunity this window is closing rapidly The FT also ran an op ed feature saying that AIDS is now the biggest killer of young adults in Africa The future of the next generation rests on whether governments and companies can join forces to control the disease it said While Reuters reported from Moscow that 10 percent of Russians may be infected with AIDS within the next five years

Brown predicted that Hillary Clinton will lose the senatorial contest in New York The editor of Talk who launched her magazine this year with Mrs Clinton on the cover said Rudolph Giuliani will undoubtedly win because women didn t like Hillary They consider her a hypercareerist perfectionist who always makes them feel inadequate inferior and ill at ease The media are also against Hillary Brown said They hate her in a much more visceral manner than Giuliani who terrorizes them Brown also forecast that Vice President Al Gore will beat Texas Gov George W Bush to the White House Gore is top of the class very cultivated and well up on everything while Bush s total lack of political culture is obvious and is frightening she said America s honeymoon with Bush will begin to turn sour at the end of next spring she predicted Questioned about the furor over Naomi Wolf s role as a Gore adviser Brown said The savage fury against Wolf is the most sinister example of the anti feminist sexism that will dominate the coming elections I think it is only a foretaste of the pseudo political perfidy that awaits us in the next few months Corriere questioned Ron Galotti president of Talk Media Inc about reports that Talk is in crisis and is about to be redesigned by Oliviero Toscani the Italian behind the Benetton advertising campaign All balls was his reply
