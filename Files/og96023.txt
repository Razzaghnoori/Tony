Young Chairman The Honorable George Miller Ranking Minority Member Committee on Resources House of Representatives Subject Contracts Under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act Pursuant to section 801 a 2 A of title 5 United States Code this is our report on a major rule promulgated by the Department of the Interior Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of Health and Human Services Indian Health Services entitled Contracts Under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act RINs 1076 AD21 and 0905 AC98 We received the rule on June 21 1996 It was published in the Federal Register as a final rule on June 24 1996 61 Fed Reg 32481 The joint rule is issued to permit the Departments to award contracts and grants to Indian tribes without the confusion associated with having two sets of rules for a single program This is the second attempt by the Departments to issue such a rule In 1988 Congress directed the two Departments to develop regulations to implement amendments to the Indian Self Determination Act Pub L 93 638 contained in the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act Amendments of 1988 GAO OGC 96 23 Pub L 100 472 Those amendments were intended to increase tribal participation in the management of Federal Indian Programs and to help ensure long term financial stability for tribal run programs When the proposed regulation was published for public comment 59 Fed Reg 3166 reaction was critical over the lack of tribal participation in the latter stages of the drafting process and the overall length of the proposed regulation A Congressional reexamination of the regulation drafting process led to the passage of the Indian Self Determination Act Amendments of 1994 Pub L 103 413 This Act removed Congress prior delegation of the Departments general legislative rulemaking authority under the Act and limited it to certain subject matter areas enumerated in the Act Moreover the Act required the Departments in issuing any new rules in those areas to utilize the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990 as a guide with the direct participation of tribal representatives in the rulemaking The Departments chartered a negotiated rulemaking committee under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to develop this rule The Committee had 63 members including 48 members representing Indian tribes The Committee met between April 1995 and May 1996 The rule is the result of consensus by the Committee except in four areas internal agency procedures contract renewal procedures conflicts of interest and construction management services A delegation of tribal representatives met with the Chiefs of Staff of the two Departments to present the tribal views of the unresolved areas and the rule incorporates the decisions made based on that meeting Enclosed is our assessment of the Department of the Interior and the Department of Health and Human Services compliance with the procedural steps required by section 801 a 1 B i through iv of title 5 with respect to the rule Our review indicates that the Departments complied with the applicable requirements If you have any questions about this

significant number of small entities Therefore they were not required to prepare an initial or final regulatory flexibility analysis under sections 603 or 604 of the Act For the same reason section
