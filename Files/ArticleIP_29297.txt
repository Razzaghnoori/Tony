 Missoula Winter the Thaw the Ice Floes and the Boy BR Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be brought low In the middle of its long white sleep our world begins to thaw Streets flood The ice around the house goes to water which finds its own level in my basement lodging I lug wet rugs up stairs that lead to the world of air up and down the steps I go dragging sodden things to light Tonight on the news they show ice floes moving like dreamships up the Clark Fork silent and serene knocking out bridges destroying homes along the verge A boy from the university track star goofing with his girl at river s edge slips he falls in and she watches him carried away in silence arms outstretched like wings not a word or sound or sign of struggle Neither could I move or scream the cold was everything it owned us only our eyes were free once the rapids had him and we locked gazes then as if seeing could save us as if it were believing In days our world has turned to ice again and the search for the boy is called off Everything hardens At night underground I imagine him nearby somewhere long limbs caught quickfrozen in a runner s pose fingers reaching hard as marble I am poured out O Lord poured out like water all night I dream him in that posture of longing held and stilled beneath the motion and the industry the unimaginable weight of our living world
