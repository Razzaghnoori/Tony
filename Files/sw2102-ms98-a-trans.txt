 okay well my favorite probably all time TV show is Star Trek and i would like that i i like the adventure of it uh huh and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space uh huh and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which it s an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and right finding out about different people and i ve i ve always liked that show probably the very best uh huh i think i ve actually seen a number of Star Treks one way or another over the years uh although i never watched it regularly i m certainly acquainted with the character the characters and then i ve seen some of the Star Trek movies uh huh yeah those the movies are good too and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because they re all adventures uh huh when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver because it s it s only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but he s always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and uh huh and a few tires and all of a sudden he s got a hang glider and i don t think i i ve even heard of that show it s called McGyver and what is what is he you haven t uh huh he s like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly uh huh and uh his his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder uh huh so he he does all kinds of strange things like that oh great Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a 747 out of it yeah see what we can come up with do you like the uh news shows Twenty Twenty and Sixty Minutes those kind of things well uh i used to watch Sixty Minutes as a matter of fact and uh and i used to like the show very much uh huh but unfortunately i find getting rid of your TV set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water some of the little things yeah and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didn t get the booze out of the house i was going to drink uh oh so i guess i haven t ever had any trouble with that i have more or less i have my favorite shows and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those yeah but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when they re up yeah yeah because they re i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids i like that real well right well when my kids were little i did have a TV set and i did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company as well uh huh i don t think they have that on anymore oh that would be a shame i haven t seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i don t think they show it must be in maybe it s in if it was in repeats but they re not making new ones huh i haven t seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good yeah how about Mister Rogers is he still around yes yeah they still show Mister Rogers i don t think he s making new ones but they repeat all the old ones i see i see so that s still a real good show too i that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the TV on uh huh Sesame Street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so it s the timing of of it is good besides the amount what s on right i figure your children are preschool yes i have two little ones yeah so they like that yeah i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon they come on both they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six uh huh okay they just repeat okay over again which is also that s another thing that s good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour i feel can feel like i can let them sit in front of the TV and watch and they re watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot yeah yeah little with little kids the TV set really is a i mean i used it as a pacifier i m not sure it was that great for my children but they turned out okay so yeah uh it didn t hurt them any yeah some shows are good for i think some shows some Star Trek i for the imagination of it all the idea i i think that s one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i don t let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do uh huh you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible yeah that kind of thing yeah okay well i think we ve covered most of my favorite TV shows well i m trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh let s see how about uh Man From Uncle i do seem to remember is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that self destructed that s Mission Impossible uh Mission that s right Mission Impossible yeah i used to watch that in fact i can still remember a couple of those they were i thought those were very good yeah they always have i ve i ve seen some of them on repeats yeah that uh they always had a good plot huh it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next right right you how they re going get out of their latest scrape yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i guess i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene oh yeah every Saturday night uh that portraying portraying The Doors appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show huh they even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan and it was very very funny i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie um well i don t know was there any i remember the Milton Berle Show even i was yeah i m not old enough to recall that one i was well i guess i have to admit that i am my TV viewing started sort of mid sixties so i see my folks didn t my folks i m not even sure if we had one when i was really little that may be why but they probably didn t have a TV until i got to be you know grade school or so yeah and the shows that i like now they wouldn t let me watch i had to catch them all on repeats like Star Trek they thought that was much too violent for small children so huh i i i i ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something yeah that s that s interesting uh i think it s interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV people were just as violent before TV was invented maybe even more so yeah but i guess that s that s a different topic isn t it probably so well i think that s about uh that s about covered it for me so i think i ll say good bye and we ll yeah well it was nice talking to you tell me tell me where you re calling from talk another time perhaps i m calling from Garland Texas Garland Texas all right i m in North i m in Raleigh North Carolina uh huh where were you from oh my goodness i didn t know they did it long distance yeah i think they re doing it trying to do it or i hope they re trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different yes different dialects well it was nice talking to you same here bye bye bye bye
