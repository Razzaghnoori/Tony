        okay well my favorite probably all time TV show is Star Trek and i would  like that i i like the adventure of it   uhhuh   and the idea that that we would survive long enough to get to that point and be able to do these fantastic things in space     uhhuh   and then i like the they have a new one now the Star Trek the Next Generation which its an all new cast but kind of the same idea going out to new places and and doing new things and   right     finding out about different people and ive ive always liked that show probably the very best   uhhuh i think ive actually seen a number of Star Treks one way or another over the years uh although i never watched it regularly im certainly acquainted with the character the characters and then ive seen some of the Star Trek movies   uhhuh yeah those the movies are good too       and i i guess all the most the shows i like are are kind of along the same line because theyre all adventures   uhhuh   when i when i started thinking about this that those are some of my favorite shows McGyver because its its only one person there more than uh you know instead of a cast of people but hes always going out and inventing new things out of scrap and grabbing what he can and you know pieces of baling wire and   uhhuh   and a few tires and all of a sudden hes got a hang glider and   i dont think i ive even heard of that show its called McGyver and what is what is he   you havent uhhuh hes like a semi government type agent who goes out then to uh works for the Phoenix Foundation supposedly   uhhuh   and uh his his big thing is that he can take pieces of little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder     uhhuh   so he  he does all kinds of strange things like that   oh great Boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard and see if he could build a  out of it   yeah see what we can come up with do you like the uh news shows Twenty Twenty and Sixty Minutes those kind of things     well uh i used to watch Sixty Minutes as a matter of fact and uh and i used to like the show very much   uhhuh   but unfortunately i find getting rid of your TV set you do throw out some some of the baby with the bath water   some of the little things yeah   and uh i just decided i had to do that i think in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a TV set for hours and i just realized i was sort of like an alcoholic if i didnt get the booze out of the house i was going to drink     uh oh   so   i guess i havent ever had any trouble with that i have more or less i have my favorite shows and i usually make time in my day or my week you know to watch those   yeah   but for the most part i try i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time really when theyre up   yeah yeah   because theyre i guess that that that falls in and one of my other favorite shows is Sesame Street because of the kids i like that real well   right well when my kids were little i did have a TV set and i did watch a lot of Sesame Street and a lot of Electric Company as well   uhhuh i dont think they have that on anymore   oh that would be a shame   i havent seen the Electric Company in a long time i i remember it when i was younger of you know catching it on PBS but uh i dont think they show it must be in maybe its in if it was in repeats but theyre not making new ones   huh   i havent seen it in a long time but Sesame Street is still really good   yeah how about Mister Rogers is he still around   yes yeah they still show Mister Rogers i dont think hes making new ones but they repeat all the old ones   i see i see   so thats still a real good show too i that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the TV on   uhhuh   Sesame Street comes on from like nine to ten which is a good time and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go so its the timing of of it is good besides the amount whats on   right i figure your children are preschool   yes i have two little ones   yeah   so they like that   yeah i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon   they come on both they come on like from nine to ten and then from uh five to six   uhhuh okay   they just repeat   okay   over again which is also thats another thing thats  good about it when it comes on right in the dinner hour i feel can feel like i can let them sit in front of the TV and watch and theyre watching something worthwhile while i can make dinner and do things i need to do without them under foot   yeah yeah little with little kids the TV set really is a i mean i used it as a pacifier im not sure it was that great for my children but they turned out okay so   yeah uh it didnt hurt them any   yeah   some shows are good for i think some shows some Star Trek i for the imagination of it all the idea i i think thats one of the things i like about Star Trek and is is the even in for kids watching it some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff i dont let my little ones watch it but the imagination of look what we can do   uhhuh   you know in the future this is perhaps this will be possible   yeah   that kind of thing   yeah   okay well i think weve covered most of my favorite TV shows   well im trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time uh     lets see how about uh Man From Uncle   i do seem to remember is that the one where they uh he always got this this tape recording that selfdestructed   thats Mission Impossible   uh Mission thats right Mission Impossible yeah i used to watch that in fact i can still remember a couple of those they were i thought those were very good   yeah they always have ive ive seen some of them on repeats   yeah   that uh they always had a good plot   huh   it kind of kept you guessing on on uh what was going to happen next   right right you   how theyre going get out of their latest scrape   yeah i do remember that and uh i remember as a kid my parents watching the Ed Sullivan Show that was really the big deal in our household was the Ed Sullivan Show yeah i guess i guess it was a Saturday night and i went to see the movie The Doors a couple of days ago and they had this scene   oh yeah every Saturday night   uh that portraying portraying The Doors appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show   huh   they even had somebody portraying Ed Sullivan and it was very very funny i think it was the funniest part of the of that movie     um   well i dont know was there any i remember the Milton Berle Show even i was   yeah im not old enough to recall that one   i was well i guess i have to admit that i am   my TV viewing started sort of mid sixties so   i see   my folks didnt my folks im not even sure if we had one when i was really little that may be why but they probably didnt have a TV until i got to be you know grade school or so   yeah   and the shows that i like now they wouldnt let me watch i had to catch them all on repeats like Star Trek they thought that was much too violent for small children so   huh   i i i i ended up watching a lot of these things on you know repeats in the afternoons or something   yeah thats thats interesting uh i think its interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from TV people were just as violent before TV was invented maybe even more so   yeah   but i guess thats thats a different topic isnt it   probably so       well i think thats about uh thats about covered it for me so i think ill say goodbye and well   yeah well it was nice talking to you tell me tell me where youre calling from   talk another time perhaps im calling from Garland Texas   Garland Texas all right im in North im in Raleigh North Carolina   uhhuh where were you from oh my goodness i didnt know they did it long distance   yeah i think theyre doing it trying to do it or i hope theyre trying to do it all over the country because they need to collect all kinds of different   yes   different dialects   well it was nice talking to you   same here byebye   byebye
