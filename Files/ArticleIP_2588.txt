 Surfing Through China Day One Day Two Day Three Day Four Nobody invited me to tag along on the 1 000 person entourage I didn t spend my Friday afternoon ogling ancient terra cotta warriors or my Sunday gallivanting around Beijing s Forbidden City But inspired by the grand tradition of foreign correspondent hackery I won t be stopped from reporting on Clinton s trip to China Here s the first of a series of Internet dispatches on Internet coverage of the China story Day One The weekend s attention was fixed on Clinton s controversial official welcome in Tiananmen Square While the Web address www tiananmensquare com has not yet been claimed other sites chronicle the massacre with bloody photos and interactive tours Coverage of the event by the People s Daily the Chinese Communist Party s voice stresses bilateral cooperation without delving into Tiananmen s human rights issues To accelerate their move toward the goal of establishing a constructive strategic partnership between the two countries they Clinton and Jiang decided that they would refrain from targeting their strategic nuclear weapons against each other Whew Clinton roused Peking University with a speech advocating human rights and did a Q A with its students The university s Web site is a bit of a disappointment being more obsessed with the school s 1998 centennial than with the real world Who s ever heard of human rights Well the Chinese Embassy has there s a whole page of links to government propaganda on the subject including a diatribe titled A Look at the U S Human Rights Record Anumber of human rights organizations paint the real less rosy picture Human Rights in China a New York based group started by Chinese academics offers a comprehensive site with links to a site for Wang Dan the Tiananmen Square activist who was released from a long stint in prison only this spring The site links to his speeches and the petition that helped set him free as well as to his June 4 statement on the ninth anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre For a daily critique of China s media coverage turn to the independent media watchdog section of Inside China Today The Washington Post wins big

Tour links to China s music and a reader forum The New York Times catalogs its articles and requires that you register and hosts a discussion USA Today posts top China stories many of them from the Associated Press More as the president continues surfing China Day Two As the president does Shanghai on the second day of the Clinton Surfwatch we plow into a huge rice paddy of local propaganda An overview of Shanghai skims all the city s tourist sites including the classical pavilions at the Yuyuan Garden a stop on the Clinton itinerary Another brief summary emphasizes that Shanghai a k a the New York of China is the country s biggest manufacturing base responsible for one eighth of China s total annual industrial output The Shanghai Daily gloats that China is the second largest trade partner of the United States whereas the US is only China s fourth largest partner Excerpts from Clinton s entertaining radio talk show include not only policy pronouncements but also the Chinese view of Clinton s figure Y ou seem to have a very nice figure Mr President And Clinton makes his unofficial call for the World Cup Brazil Another of the president s Tuesday mileposts was the Shanghai Library which he hopes will cooperate more closely with U S libraries Progress won t be immediate The digital branch is all in Chinese And though we can t hack our way into the Shanghai stock market

the 156 tantalizing possibilities include mostly pork chicken and seafood Randomly we settle on Jin Jiang Roast Duct sic Kill and depilate sic the duck the instructions begin No thanks we ll order the

Day Three As Hong Kong is treated to a first anniversary of hand over bash Wednesday another independence issue still rankles in the halls of China Tibet For a quick Tibet refresher check the Washington Post Despite a conciliatory exchange between Presidents Clinton and Jiang in Beijing last Saturday no easy resolutions are in the offing A May article in the China Daily revealingly titled Dalai Lama s motives unmasked takes the combative stance that has been wrapped up in appeasement during the Clinton tour For the West Tibet is unquestionably a trendy cause Several international organizations lobby through their extensive Web sites Which one you choose to visit depends on whether you want to Free Tibet or Save Tibet We recommend the latter since its site has an up to date news database on Clinton s trip a Clinton itinerary and a Tibet event schedule Most important the Dalai Lama sticks up for himself from his exile in Dharamsala in North India Good surfing there the well organized official site comprehensively explains the government in exile s situation What s so great about Tibet Well take a spin through the spectacular photo gallery courtesy Inside China Today

Kong government sports a surprisingly fun Web site which mingles facts and stats with blinking visuals Two chunky pie graphs evaluate how the Hong Kong officialdom is handling the Year 2000 problem Is a 37 non compliance rate good news or bad High on Clinton s Hong Kong agenda is a meeting with Tung Chee Hwa Hong Kong s chief executive Here s his pre hand over prognosis which includes a pledge to maintain Hong Kong s accustomed freedoms and to operate under a one country two systems scenario But the Hong Kong Journalists Association disputes his success its campaign for open government notes that 69 percent of surveyed HKJA members believe the pre hand over government was more open than the current one Corroborating evidence is offered by a new Washington Post article which reports that an important documentary by a Hong Kong journalist about fighting in northern China has been kept off the airwaves OK OK surf s up and over Craving some real fireworks not to mention independence we
