 Art Picasso The Early Years 1892 1906 National Gallery of Art Washington D C The artist s Wonder Bread years age 11 to 25 ending in his cubist period The question is whether the world needs another Picasso show less than a year after the Museum of Modern Art s grand exhibition of his portraiture Most critics are happy to reconsider the maligned blue period which is now deemed Picasso at his most accessible by the Wall Street Journal s Deborah Solomon you don t need to know the first thing about line or form to be deeply moved by them The New York Times Michael Kimmelman on the other hand says the curators confuse precociousness with originality and quantity with quality These endless shows numb people to Picasso s art making obeisance routine like genuflecting in church The National Gallery plugs the show at its site Movies Anaconda Sony Pictures A classic example of the high low two step Anaconda is both No 1 at the box office and earning a qualified critical approbation for its self referentially campy chic Playing an obsessive dedicated to trapping a 40 foot long snake in the middle of the Amazon Jon Voight leads a group of unsuspecting documentary filmmakers Jennifer Lopez Eric Stoltz and Ice Cube to their deaths The movie has like the killing machine beast itself the brutal efficiency of single mindedness Terrence Rafferty The New Yorker Voight s overwrought performance has a kitschy glory Joe Morgenstern the Wall Street Journal It all harks back to the kind of retro eek eek production that studios don t often make anymore now that movies about tornadoes and invasions by aliens have become too expensive to be taken humorously Lisa Schwarzbaum Entertainment Weekly The Anaconda site serves up stills and clips Grosse Pointe Blank Buena Vista Pictures Heaps of praise for the movie s preposterous premise An introspective hit man returns home for a high school reunion The film itself doesn t always make a whole lot of sense says the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan but seeing a vehicle this outlandish is reward enough by itself Credit goes to co writer star John Cusack who brings his droll intelligence to bear on a worthy comic invention turning every dialogue scene into a colloquy for ardent obsessives Morgenstern the Wall Street Journal But Cusack can t sustain the freshness of the original idea The film isn t nearly as clever as it thinks it is Rafferty The New Yorker Theater An American Daughter Cort Theatre Mixed reviews for Wendy Wasserstein s comedy based on the Zoe Baird and Kimba Wood incidents with recognizable caricatures of Hillary Clinton Naomi Wolf and Andrew Sullivan Newsday s Linda Winer says Wasserstein has matured into her own bright eloquent and great hearted version of George Bernard Shaw The New York Times Ben Brantley says Wasserstein may be saying something about a world that reduces people to sound bites but is also working principally in bite size slices of sound sentiment and humor The Washington Post s Lloyd Rose says that t he play is antic as all get out but it doesn t go anywhere it just hops frantically up and down in one place Books Naked by David Sedaris Little Brown and Co Commercial and critical success for the gay housecleaner turned humorist s collection of essays seventh on this week s New York Times best seller list Critics applaud Sedaris tendency to mock both himself the title essay is about his stint at a nudist camp and others he titles a piece about people who picked him up hitchhiking Planet of the Apes The book is a wedding of funny and mean and Mr Sedaris does have a way with venom Craig Seligman the New York Times Book Review The Blue Flower by Penelope Fitzgerald Houghton Mifflin Adulation for the Booker Prize winning British author s historical novel about the romantic life of the German Romantic poet Novalis 1772 1801 It is quite an astonishing book a masterpiece says the New York Times Book Review s Michael Hofmann I can think of no better introduction to the Romantic era She is the finest British writer alive says the Los Angeles Times Richard Eder Praise also goes to Fitzgerald s command of dialogue The conversations are many voiced sharp witted and finely tuned enough to allow the reader to hear plangent undernotes and to feel the intoxicating buzz that good talk emits Lucy Hughes Hallett the Sunday Times Gut Symmetries by Jeanette Winterson Knopf Critics previously considered Winterson Written on the Body Sexing the Cherry the rising superstar of British fiction but her latest novel prompts a re evaluation Reviewers call it pretentious and filled with inaccurate references to theoretical physics Walt Whitman and the Kabbalah There is too much flexing of stylistic muscle says the New Republic s Robert Alter It is a notable example of what happens when writers discount the centrality of narrative to fiction says Newsday s Dan Cryer Inventions of the March Hare Poems 1909 1917 by T S Eliot edited by Christopher Ricks Harcourt Brace Last year the British publication of these never published 39 poems occasioned accusations of misogyny sordidness and racism one of the poems is titled King Bolo and his Big Black Kween Reviewers predict that the collection s American publication will kick off a wave of Eliot bashing In the New York Times Book Review Nicholas Jenkins says the poetry articulates with dreamlike clarity not the perfections of European and American culture but its chronic anguish of fascinations and sicknesses widely shared In the New Republic Richard Poirier attacks Ricks annotations to the poems as adventurism The notes says Poirer are unnecessarily complicated and obscure Ricks ignores or distorts the plain evidence Such annotative energies are generated not out of Eliot s need to be explained but from Ricks s need to dazzle Television Gun ABC Saturday 10 p m EST PST Praise for the idea behind director Robert Altman s six episode dramatic series Each installment has a different premise a

first wave did This is an intelligent and absorbing romantic drama beautifully mounted emotionally saturated says New York s David Denby The New Republic s Stanley Kauffmann says performances by Joaquin Phoenix and Liv Tyler make the movie All the actors caught me up so warmly that I stopped feeling guilty about liking this corny picture New York s John Simon objects to raves about the latest A Doll s House revival especially those that praise Janet McTeer s Nora She lets her hands flutter like Tibetan prayer wheels in a gale outcoos a turtledove in heat and flings herself about as if playing racquetball with her own six foot plus body This is what is known nowadays as rethinking the classics The Kiss controversy continues The Washington Post s Jonathan Yardley defends his attack on Kathryn Harrison s incest memoir against novelist Tobias Wolff s claims that he was motivated by his animus toward memoir as a genre The truth as opposed to Wolff s self serving fantasy is that my objections to The Kiss have absolutely nothing to do with its being a memoir per se or even with its being one of those personal writings that have recently found favor with readers My objections are based entirely and exclusively in the simple inescapable reality that The Kiss is an irredeemably rotten book Per se Yardley adds that when he said eight years ago that Tobias Wolff s memoir was not as good as his brother Geoffrey s that was also a purely literary judgment Recent Summary Judgment columns April 9 Theater A Doll s House Movie The Saint Movie Paradise Road Movie Inventing the
