 On With the Show One of the pleasures of working in theater or film is hanging out with actors and sundry showbiz exhibitionists True they tend to have the emotional autonomy of 8 year olds but they re less of a labor to read than ordinary mortals It s their business you might say their existential orientation to communicate their thoughts and feelings in an engaging fashion every millisecond I mention this because the first thing that struck me about the much hyped satirical comedy EdTV which purports to show the effect of TV cameras brought into the homes of real people is that almost no one on screen seems ever to have met a real i e nonshowbiz person let alone to be able to embody one The director Ron Howard and his screenwriters and actors have spent much of their lives in the business and I d trust them to depict the anxieties of TV executives and the madness of network board meetings I d trust them to skewer the vanity of models and actors and directors What I don t trust is their ability to convey what it s like simply to have a meal with a loved one or to walk across a street or to wake up from a sound sleep without the self consciousness that comes from a constant proximity to media When they project their particular self consciousness onto society as a whole the upshot is a sour self congratulatory muddle EdTV is based on a 1994 French Canadian film that no one I know has seen called Louis XIX King of the Airwaves The mock imperial title alone suggests more wit than the whole of its Hollywood counterpart EdTV takes off from the increasingly less outlandish idea that a cable network might in the face of declining ratings decide to have its cameras traipse around after an ordinary person 24 hours a day a scenario somewhat different from last year s The Truman Show in which the cameras were hidden the universe manufactured and the TV protagonist unwitting There is already something like EdTV albeit with one camera on the Internet and the number of auditioners for MTV s Real World and for a spot on various trash talk shows suggests that the United States has no shortage of exhibitionists who d love to be validated by TV cameras On these terms Monica Lewinsky is the most valid human being on the planet Under the leadership of a gung ho producer Cynthia Topping Ellen DeGeneres the network holds auditions in public places around the country and comes up with Ed Pekurny Matthew McConaughey a 31 year old San Francisco video store clerk who is cute and unthreatening and unformed I have a dream I just don t know what it is yet The problem with EdTV is that Ed s life looks and sounds like a tedious sitcom before the TV cameras ever show up McConaughey s manner is TV talk show bashful Is this supposed to be the point That he s deformed by television before he s ever on television I don t think so Ed s rambunctious brother Ray is played by Woody Harrelson a Cheers veteran and his mother by Sally Kirkland who could never be anything but an actress His wheelchair bound stepdad is Martin Landau who makes sitcom style raunchy old guy wisecracks His brother s squeeze and later his own is Jenna Elfman of television s Dharma and Greg At one point the door swings open and there stands Dennis Hopper What an inspired touch I thought A lazy ham actor shows up to explain to poor Ed the secrets of Lee Strasberg s Method how to be private in public just like on Bravo s Inside the Actors Studio It turned out that this wasn t Dennis Hopper however but Dennis Hopper in the role of Ed s long lost father and few things can dispel the illusion of watching real people than a hack actor feigning naturalness via mannerisms recycled from James Dean and Montgomery Clift Before the movie even gets going it doesn t seem to begin for half an hour it s clear that Howard and his frequent collaborators Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel are too deep inside the mentality that they re trying to satirize to come up with anything fresh EdTV has none of the edge of such mockumentaries as Albert Brooks Real Life 1980 or This Is Spinal Tap 1984 or even HBO s The Larry Sanders Show all of which exploit in hilarious fashion the tension between just being and performing for a camera Where the filmmakers are most comfortable is back in the studio so they throw in Jay Leno RuPaul and a panel of repugnant pundits Harry Shearer Michael Moore George Plimpton and Arianna Huffington to discuss the Ed phenomenon Howard and his writers are so in love with their own hip self consciousness that it s a wonder they don t feature film critics discussing their movie As it turns out EdTV isn t really about the impact of television on ordinary people It s about the problems of being famous like how you can never get any privacy In common with The Truman Show the film eventually evolves into a melodramatic revolt against a repressive corporate patriarch here an executive Rob Reiner who doesn t want to turn off the cameras and leave Ed alone when Ed s life is in a shambles but his ratings are high The Truman Show took a higher more metaphorical route in EdTV liberation comes down to exposing the fact that Dad has a penile implant Reiner has the fatted self centered TV exec s demeanor down pat but the movie degrades him while holding the same attitude toward human beings that he has As Ed s unconvincing life runs its increasingly public course Howard cuts to the folks at home a Black Couple a Gay Couple an Old Couple a bunch of Single Guys who wince at him cutting his toenails or cheer on his conquests When USA Today polls show that The People overwhelmingly prefer a flagrantly insincere model Elizabeth Hurley to the sweet and awkward UPS girl Elfman with whom Ed has found love you have to ask Are The People supposed to be shallow boobs Or is this just how the world looks from certain Beverly Hills ZIP codes A more true to life alas version of EdTV is 20 Dates a microbudget documentary directed by and starring Myles Berkowitz At the beginning of the film now in wide release Berkowitz thirtyish and divorced and unable to get his directing career off the ground explains that he has received a sum of money from a private investor heard cursing the director via a hidden tape recorder to go on 20 dates with 20 attractive women and thereby capture something unglimpsed in commercial movies about the single life the nature of love etc etc ad nauseam All that is captured of course is Berkowitz s ambition to put himself in your face He comes out of 20 Dates with a trophy fiancee and a feature film in major release but absolutely no insight into dating love or human chemistry The audience meanwhile ends up cringing and squirming on behalf of his dates some of whom are appalled to the point of violence and litigation by the revelation of a hidden camera Only two of the 20 had the camera concealed from them both sued The masochistic fascination of 20 Dates is something that the makers of EdTV can only dream about but I wouldn t exactly call it entertainment I found myself wanting to apologize on behalf of obnoxious heterosexual Jewish men the world over I also wondered What about those women some of them pretty bright and articulate who admirably recoiled from this clown when they discovered they were fodder for his Hollywood ambitions When they saw Berkowitz on the big screen with a 20 th Century Fox logo behind him did they think Wow I really missed the boat on this one I should never have let him get away The best reason for seeing Forces of Nature a sporadically funny but uneasily revisionist screwball comedy in which straight arrow Ben Affleck is tempted from his imminent nuptials by free spirit Sandra Bullock and assorted natural disasters is a scene in which the heartsick jock ex boyfriend David Strickland of Affleck s fiancee Maura Tierney sings an a cappella version of Phil Collins Against All Odds Take a Look At Me Now into her ear in the middle of a party The gesture is as embarrassing for the character as anything in EdTV or 20 Dates but Strickland sings with such quavering soulfulness that the bit lifts up and floats out of the movie like a weird but beautiful balloon I was going to mention this scene anyway as the picture s highlight I dwell on it because word comes that the 28 year old Strickland a regular on the sitcom Suddenly Susan has been found dead in Las Vegas apparently having hanged himself It s no consolation but he has left behind an exquisite moment in film
