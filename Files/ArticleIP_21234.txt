 Monica Unclothed At the outset of her interview with Barbara Walters Monica Lewinsky complains that she s been misportrayed Behind the name Monica Lewinsky there s a person she sobs For two hours Lewinsky bares her soul to Walters and the world Beneath a flimsy undergarment of professed remorse she exposes a psyche built on blame shifting self interest and moral indifference 1 It s not my fault Lewinsky delivers her canned message in the interview s opening seconds I waited a long time to be able to express to the country how very sorry I am for my part in this past year s ordeal I wouldn t dream of asking Chelsea and Mrs Clinton to forgive me But I would ask them to know that I am very sorry for what happened and for what they ve been through As the interview progresses however Lewinsky defines her part in the fiasco narrowly leaving others to account for what happened When Walters asks whether she takes responsibility for the affair Lewinsky answers Not complete responsibility Later Lewinsky speculates that Clinton came to her for a sense of normalcy Walters reasonably inquires Can t you get that from your wife Lewinsky bats the question aside That s something for him to answer not me she says 2 It s just a disease Lewinsky calls the affair a mistake but frames the mistake in terms of technical error and emotional imbalance rather than moral failure She refers constantly to self esteem and anti depressant medication When asked why she has had affairs with married men she explains I didn t have enough feelings of self worth What lesson does she draw from her mistakes I have a lot of healing to do she concludes Blaming her excesses on a chemical defect allows her to feel good about her seductive inclinations When asked whether her behavior with Clinton was out of control she concedes I needed help I needed to be on some sort of anti depressant But she rephrases the question in flattering terms For someone like me who s a very passionate loving woman I think you often get close to that line 3 It s all about me Walters asks Lewinsky about the May 1997 conversation in which Clinton told her they had to end their affair because it was not right in the eyes of God Lewinsky conveys no interest in this moral appraisal Instead she reflects on her own needs I was heartbroken she recalls It hurts Later Walters asks about Clinton s refusal to have intercourse with her I felt it was unfair to me Lewinsky pleads that I would never know what it was like to be that intimate with him As for the episode in which Lewinsky exploded in jealousy over Clinton s meeting with journalist Eleanor Mondale Lewinsky explains I don t know that people can understand how confusing it would be for me to on the one hand have someone saying things to you I promise this I promise that I care about you I don t want to hurt you I want to take care of you and then the actions are something different It s pretty tough emotionally She delivers this speech without a trace of irony 4 It s about loyalty Lewinsky emphasizes at the outset that she s very loyal She says she trusted her friends to keep silent about her affair and feels violated and betrayed by Linda Tripp Why did she give Kenneth Starr the stained dress that was in her mother s apartment Because to do otherwise would have violated her immunity agreement she explains and I needed to take care of myself and my family Toward the end of the interview Walters asks Have you learned anything from this experience I ve learned how important family is Lewinsky replies I have learned the true meaning of friendship 5 It s none of your business From the time I was 2 years old Lewinsky recalls with a smile one of my first phrases was You are not the boss of me And I ve been that way ever since When Walters suggests that White House aides were right to keep Lewinsky away from Clinton Lewinsky defiantly retorts I don t think so I don t think that my relationship hurt the job he was doing It didn t hurt the work I was doing It was between us And I don t think it was their business 6 It s OK if you don t get caught Walters asks Lewinsky about her phone sex with Clinton It s fun the younger woman giggles Did you ever think about Hillary Clinton Walters inquires I did says Lewinsky But I never thought she d find out In the interview s final seconds Walters asks If you had it to do all over again would you have the relationship with Bill Clinton Lewinsky reflects on what she has learned There are some days that I regret that the relationship ever started she says still grinning And there are some days that I just regret that I ever confided in Linda Tripp ABC s pre interview hype depicted Lewinsky as a smitten deluded romantic She thought Clinton was her soul mate went this spin whereas he was actually a reckless ruthless narcissist What the interview actually suggests however is that both perceptions are true The man Lewinsky seduced was scheming shameless and incapable of accepting responsibility for his conduct And in her he met his match
