 Background Serial analysis of gene expression SAGE has been used to profile mRNA levels in a variety of organisms and systems 1 2 3 4 5 Recently several modifications have been made to the protocol to create a protocol referred to as microSAGE 6 7 8 9 10 which allows the generation of SAGE libraries from small quantities of starting material as little as 100 000 cells or 1 g total RNA These modifications include the direct binding of mRNA to magnetic oligo dT beads before the reverse transcription step and a great reduction in the quantity of linkers used to generate ditags While it has been shown that conventional SAGE is representative and accurate 2 the same has not been clearly shown for microSAGE Moreover the extent to which data generated by either SAGE or microSAGE are reproducible in the sense of giving identical tag representation from duplicate samples has not been thoroughly addressed Given the time and expense involved in constructing and sequencing SAGE libraries concerns about how reproducible SAGE data are in general as well as how representive and accurate microSAGE data are in particular may deter potential users from pursuing this approach We have addressed these questions by constructing and analyzing a series of microSAGE libraries We made libraries from the same mRNA samples to examine the variability due to library construction and made sublibraries from identical pools of ditags to examine the variability due to the last steps in SAGE library construction as well as due to sampling We have also made and analyzed libraries from tissue obtained from both age matched and non age matched individuals to examine the variability due to tissue preparation as well as individual differences in gene expression We found that microSAGE data as previously shown for conventional SAGE data 2 are highly accurate in the sense that they reflect known tissue and developmental gene expression profiles We found that tag distribution is virtually identical in samples constructed from either identical mRNA samples or ditag ligation reactions However we found large variations in tag distributions between both age matched and non age matched human peripheral retinal libraries We even saw a relatively large variation in tag distributions between libraries made from tissue pooled from small numbers of individual neonatal mice a fact that may reflect developmental asynchrony as well as baseline individual variation in gene expression This fact has implications for any expression profiling approach and suggests that in order to average out individual variations in gene expression many different samples of a tissue of interest will have to be examined Results MicroSAGE data are representative and accurate To determine whether microSAGE data are representative we conducted a virtual Rot analysis A virtual Rot analysis much like a Rot analysis generated by measurement of mRNA reassociation kinetics examines the relative fraction of total mRNA made up of transcripts of high medium or low abundance It is constructed from SAGE data by cumulatively plotting the total fraction of all tags represented by tags of a given abundance level Virtual Rot analyses of adult mouse whole retina and adult hypothalamus showed a distribution that closely reflects an actual Rot analysis of mouse brain RNA Figure 1a 1b 1c 11 To determine whether microSAGE data can provide an accurate measure of mRNA abundance that is give tag levels that match levels of mRNAs for which abundance levels have previously been measured we examined our adult mouse retinal library for tags corresponding to several such mRNAs Although no absolute quantification of mRNAs in mouse retina has been made measurement of rhodopsin beta tubulin and interphotoreceptor retinol binding protein IRBP mRNAs in adult rat retina indicate that these represent 1 25 2 5 0 2 and 0 1 0 2 of total RNA respectively 12 These figures are based on the observation that mRNA consists of roughly 2 of total RNA in both rat and mouse retina S B and C L C unpublished work In the mouse we found that rhodopsin represented 2 1 beta tubulin 0 08 and IRBP 0 13 of total SAGE tags values that on the whole approximate levels reported for rat The slight discrepancy in beta tubulin levels between rat and mouse may reflect species variability in gene expression levels or the failure to identify all alternative 3 ends of the beta tubulin message by microSAGE Additional analyses to determine the accuracy of microSAGE data were carried out by examining a series of libraries from mouse retina and hypothalamus We have constructed SAGE libraries from mouse hypothalamus total wild type mouse retina at 2 day intervals from embryonic day E 12 5 through to postnatal day P 6 5 P10 5 wild type mice along with littermates mutant for the crx gene which encodes a Paired type homeodomain transcription factor that directly regulates transcription of many photoreceptor enriched genes adult mouse retina and microdissected outer nuclear layer which consists entirely of rod and cone photoreceptors 11 We examined this very large dataset for expression of genes known to be photoreceptor specific Figure 2 We found that photoreceptor specific genes typically showing high retina specific expression that began around one week after birth coinciding exactly with the previously reported increase in expression of rhodopsin and other rod specific genes 13 14 15 We typically saw higher expression of photoreceptor specific genes in microSAGE libraries made from microdissected outer nuclear layer 97 rods versus 70 rods for whole retina and in many cases higher expression in P10 5 crx samples relative to P10 5 crx samples These observations accurately reflect the known expression pattern of rod specific genes 15 Examining the temporal dataset for genes that are known to be selectively expressed in retinal progenitor cells Figure 3 we found that high expression persisted until P2 followed by a rapid drop with expression barely detectable in the adult These data correlate well with the time course of mitosis within the developing retina 16 17 Cumulative distributions of p values indicate the differences among microSAGE libraries One way to measure the significance of the differences between libraries is to see the cumulative distribution function of the p values If the difference between two libraries is large we would see a large number of SAGE tags with small p values for that pair compared to a pair in which the only source of variation is experimental variability in microSAGE library construction The p values we compute are the probability of observing the different tag counts for each gene when there is no differential expression Although comparing the cumulative distributions does not match the libraries on a gene by gene basis it gives an overall picture of the qualitative differences Cumulative p value distributions for all libraries considered in this study are plotted in Figure 4 We investigated a variety of statistical methods of calculating p values for differences in SAGE tag distribution in addition to the Monte Carlo analysis program included in the SAGE analysis software These included a test for equality of proportions equivalent to the chi square test modeling the sampling of tags using the Poisson distribution Fisher s exact test and a Bayesian model We found that all methods gave similar results for the range of p values considered here see Materials and methods for a more complete discussion of these comparisons Visualization of the data in rotated coordinates reveals the relationship between average count and fold changes We find it convenient to view the data in a log scale in rotated coordinates going from the original coordinates x y to the new coordinate system log 2 xy log 2 y x This transformation corresponds to a 45 degree rotation and a linear stretching of the log scaled data log 2 x log 2 y This type of plot has been popular for microarray data with the x and y axes corresponding to the mean intensity of the signals and their fold ratio respectively up to scaling constants 18 19 For tag counts the axes become the sum of the log counts and the fold change respectively with no rescaling necessary This makes it easier to visualize the data with horizontal lines rather than diagonal lines corresponding to fold changes We can easily identify those genes with large fold changes and see the relationship between the average count and the fold change We note that although it is advantageous to work in a log scale for the fold change interpretation it means that those genes with tag count of zero in either library are deleted from the picture Another way of viewing the data is to plot differences in the two counts rather than their fold ratios as a function of the mean log count Both ways contain the same information and one can be derived from the other To gauge the baseline variability arising from library construction in the microSAGE process we consider the two libraries made from the same mRNA sample crxA versus crxB In Figure 5c we plot the data along with a confidence band corresponding to two standard deviations away from the center at each average log count This band was computed using a locally weighted smoothing technique based on the standard deviations in the neighborhood of each point As we expect 20 the fold changes due to noise are higher at lower tag counts This confidence band can serve as a rough measure of the variability in the system due to experimental procedures The same confidence band from this comparison is superimposed on Figure 5a b c d e f g h ito see how the variability present in comparisons of different libraries compares to variation seen in libraries made from the same starting material See the additional data files for a full list of tag counts in each of the SAGE library comparisons in the Results section MicroSAGE data are highly reproducible To examine microSAGE data for reproducibility several analyses were carried out As a baseline gauge of variability in tag sampling we compared the collection of tags comprising the first 26 000 tags obtained from the microdissected outer nuclear layer library to the collection of tags comprising the second 26 000 tags obtained from this library A scatter plot of tag abundance showed a correlation coefficient of 0 976 when all tags were considered or 0 819 when only tags present less than 100 times in total in both libraries were examined Table 1 A plot of cumulative observed p values of tag differences in the samples normalized to total tag number showed no increase of observed variance over expected variance Figure 4 and no high abundance tags fell outside the confidence band of two standard deviations plotted for comparisons of libraries made from identical starting material Figure 5a P2 5 retinal libraries made from the same ditag ligation but different large scale PCR preparations showed a correlation coefficient of 0 938 when all tags were considered little difference between observed and expected p values of variance Figure 4 and showed relatively little difference between abundant tags Figure 5b Two libraries made from the same posnatal day 10 5 crx mRNA samples that is the RNA sample was divided into two tubes at the onset of the reverse transcription step showed a correlation coefficient of 0 939 showed very little difference between observed and chance cumulative p values of variance Figure 4 and showed little difference between abundant tags Figure 5c These data show that microSAGE data are highly reproducible when identical starting material is used to generate libraries see Table 2for a full list of libraries and comparisons Although the amount of starting material used to generate each of the libraries varied somewhat we did not find any substantial changes in the fraction of duplicate ditags found in each library which we have found to be more or less constant approximately 5 when more than 1 g total RNA is used S B and C L C data not shown The correlation coefficients particularly for the self self comparison ONL1 versus ONL2 when only tags present less than 100 times in total were considered may seem somewhat low compared to correlation coefficients computed for microarray data 21 22 23 However any digital gene expression dataset shows a certain amount of noise due simply to sampling variability particularly for lower abundance transcripts 20 Even if two tags are actually found at identical levels in two libraries the observed values of those tags will show a Poisson distribution about the actual values thus resulting in a lower observed correlation coefficient This is particularly true for lower abundance transcripts and is clearly seen in the substantially lower correlation coefficients that are observed when very high abundant transcripts are excluded from analysis see Table 1 Multiple replicate experiments which are typically carried out in microarray studies might filter out some of this noise but such replicates are not feasible given the expense and time required to generate microSAGE data In any case the absolute r values are not as important as the relative changes in the correlation coefficients observed as a result of experimental or sample variability when considering the data presented here MicroSAGE data show pronounced differences in gene expression between age and sex matched samples As the above data indicate that the microSAGE protocol does not introduce differences in libraries made from identical starting material it is possible to interpret the gene expression differences that might be found among individuals To begin to probe such individual variations we analyzed libraries from individual human retinal samples and from genotypically identical mice from the same litter and genotypically identical mice raised in different animal facilities MicroSAGE libraries generated from freshly dissected peripheral retina from similarly aged adult male humans gave a correlation coefficient of 0 673 when all tags were considered a substantial difference between observed and chance p values of variance between the samples Figure 4 and many tags lie outside the confidence band plotted for comparisons of libraries made from identical starting material Figure 5d These differences were substantially similar to differences in expression seen between peripheral retinal libraries obtained from a 44 year old and an 88 year old individual which showed a correlation coefficient of 0 760 when all tags were considered a large difference between observed and expected p values of variance Figure 4 and large number of differences in high abundance tags Figure 5e Retinas from one P6 5 mouse litter were used to generate two SAGE libraries with retinas from three P6 5 littermates combined to generate one library P6 5A and three different P6 5 littermates combined to make another P6 5B Many differences in gene expression were observed and an overall correlation coefficient of 0 661 was seen when all tags were considered Figures 4 5f Some of these differences appear to be in known rod specific genes and may reflect developmental asynchrony as this is the time at which high level expression of rod specific genes is first observed although most of the observed differences do not appear to be found in genes that show dramatic variation in expression through development We also examined two hypothalamus libraries each constructed from age matched male mice of the same strain obtained from animals raised in different facilities These samples showed a correlation coefficient of 0 782 when all tags were considered or 0 500 when highly abundant tags were excluded a high value for cumulative p value differences Figure 4 and large numbers of tag differences Figure 5g suggesting that pronounced variation in gene expression is found even in genetically identical age and sex matched individuals housed in similar laboratory environments To understand the significance of these individual differences we also compared disparate tissues We compared two CNS tissues the adult retina and hypothalamus which showed a correlation coefficient of 0 763 when all tags were considered or 0 349 when highly abundant tags were excluded Figure 5h We also compared a CNS tissue and a non CNS tissue adult retina and 3T3 fibroblasts which showed a correlation coefficient of 0 479 when all tags were considered or 0 182 when highly abundant tags were excluded Figure 5i Examination of the p value plots Figure 4 reveals many more tags that differ at low p values in the CNS and non CNS tissue comparison than in the comparison of the two CNS tissues Likewise plots of p value differences versus tag abundance Figure 5h 5i show substantially more variability in the CNS versus peripheral tissue comparison See additional data files for a full list of tag counts in each of the SAGE library comparisons discussed here Discussion MicroSAGE is highly representative reproducible and accurate We found that tag abundance data measured by microSAGE reliably reflect mRNA abundance profiles despite the fact that nearly 1 000 fold less starting mRNA was used here than is used to construct libraries in conventional SAGE Tag distribution as determined by microSAGE closely mirrors profiles seen by Rot analysis of brain tissue Likewise tag abundance levels in libraries made from identical mRNA samples and ditag ligations showed very high similarity The fact that the tag abundance levels differ slightly more in the libraries made from the same ditag ligation than in those made from the same mRNA sample may reflect a small amount of denaturation of AT rich ditags during storage of the ligation reaction as has been previously reported 24 Overall microSAGE passes all the tests for representativity reproducibility and accuracy used previously for conventional SAGE 2 Differences in gene expression were observed among samples of the same tissues from different individuals The high reliability of microSAGE data revealed in these analyses allows us to report the first comprehensive profiles of levels of difference in gene expression observed among tissues obtained from age and sex matched individuals The variability among the samples observed does not appear to be due to experimental variability in library construction Thus it is due either to differences in the processing of the tissues used to generate the libraries in variations in mRNA stability between tissue collection and mRNA purification or in heterogeneous tissue dissection or to real variations in gene expression among individuals Although no studies to our knowledge have addressed the question directly the limited body of data on expression profiling of age and sex matched humans generally reports significant variation in gene expression among individuals 25 26 27 although little of these data are publicly available On the other hand the literature on inter individual variation in gene expression in inbred mice is both limited and somewhat inconsistent While many studies have examined expression in inbred mice the extent of variation in gene expression in age and sex matched individuals is rarely addressed Published microarray experiments using inbred mice have been typically conducted using pooled samples from anywhere from 6 28 to 17 29 individuals Likewise for other methods of gene expression profiling such as differential display and its variations 30 or SAGE 31 most previously published work has either been focused on samples from large numbers of pooled individuals or has considered individual mice that were not strain age or sex matched Our results agree quite well with several recent reports in which inter individual variation in gene expression is explicitly examined A recent study reported a high degree of variation in RNA levels in rat hippocampus taken from different animals A large fraction of candidate genes tested by quantitative reverse transcription PCR RT PCR were found to vary significantly even among individuals from inbred strains 32 Another study reported analysis of inter individual variations in gene expression in liver testis and kidney of male C57B 6 mice using a 5000 spot microarray This study found that 0 8 liver 1 9 testes and 3 3 kidney of all genes differed between individuals at p 0 05 33 The data from kidney compare fairly well with our data in Figure 4for littermate littermate variation 5 5 of SAGE tags different at p 0 05 after subtracting the 1 5 of tags different at p 0 05 in the ONL1 versus ONL2 sampling control or even human human variation 7 8 of SAGE tags different at p 0 05 following subtraction of sampling variation Because our libraries are all derived from neural tissue our roughly twofold higher variability may reflect greater experience dependent plasticity in the CNS Several other microarray studies of inbred mice while not specifically reporting inter individual changes in expression nonetheless reported considerable differences in both brain and peripheral tissues among different individuals 34 35 There are however several published microarray experiments in which although individual variation in gene expression was not explicitly addressed variation in gene expression in age and sex matched individual mice or pooled samples of three or fewer mice was measured and found to be relatively small 36 37 38 39 These include data from both peripheral tissue and brain that reported r values for individual mice at around 0 98 37 38 and one publicly available dataset of inter individual comparisons of CNS tissues 38 We analyzed this dataset and found it to have correlation coefficients in the 0 97 0 98 range S B W P K and C L C data not shown On the face of it this seems at odds with our and other groups data demonstrating considerable variation in gene expression our r values being in the 0 65 0 8 range for the developing retina and hypothalamus comparisons None of these published data was from the hypothalamus or developing retina so it is possible that the samples we analyzed show greater inter individual variability However this sort of direct comparison between expression profiling methods may not be appropriate Expression changes observed in microarray experiments can in principle and in the hands of some investigators accurately reflect expression level changes observed by northern or quantitative RT PCR data 40 However other investigators including ourselves have found that both oligonucleotide and cDNA microarray consistently underestimate true fold changes in mRNA levels as measured by northern or RT PCR 23 41 This is most probably due to background hybridization to the array and signal normalization and is not an issue for digital expression profiling approaches such as SAGE Underestimating differences in mRNA levels will give rise to higher observed r values While we cannot be sure that this was the case for the studies mentioned above given the variation in microarray hybridization and scanning protocols among different investigators it remains a distinct possibility This concern together with other recent studies that raise questions about the ability to accurately perform cross platform comparisons of gene expression datasets 42 43 prevents us from drawing firm conclusions about the true extent of inter individual differences from the published microarray data It will require SAGE and microarray analysis of identical starting material coupled with northern or RT PCR verification of genes that show inter individual variation by either or both methods to gauge exactly how accurately either method estimates inter individual differences in gene expression This however is beyond the scope of the current study Heterogeneous dissection cannot account for most of the inter individual differences observed The observed differences among microSAGE libraries made from identical tissue from different individuals could have resulted from heterogeneous tissue dissection We addressed this question for our retinal samples Because our P6 5 mouse retina libraries were made from total retina stripped of surrounding tissues such as lens and retinal pigment epithelium we determined whether tags corresponding to genes highly expressed in those tissues such as crystallins RPE65 RGR like opsin were found in these libraries and determined that they were not expressed in either library except occasionally at the single tag level S B and C L C data not shown Moreover inter individual variation in cell type composition among murine retinas appears to be minimal 44 and thus variable ratios of cell types in dissected retinas does not appear to account for the observed variation Rods represent a greater fraction of cells in the periphery of the human retina while cones and ganglion cells represent a greater fraction of cells near the center Observed differences in tag levels between the human peripheral retina libraries could be reflecting small differences in the radial distance from the fovea of the dissected region We found however that although a number of the tags that differ by p 0 005 between the 44 year old and 41 year old individuals corresponded to known rod enriched genes the direction of change was not consistent between the two samples Although more tags corresponding to known rod enriched genes were at a higher level in the library from the 44 year old individual many other rod enriched genes were more highly represented in the library from the 41 year old individual One of the tags that was higher in the 44 year old individual corresponded to a known ganglion cell specific gene whereas none of the tags that were more highly expressed in the 41 year old individual corresponded to ganglion cell specific genes see Table 3for a summary of this data Moreover when compared to data from our previously published work analyzing genes that show either peripheral or foveal enrichment in libraries taken from the same individual at p 0 005 45 we likewise found no consistent pattern in the tags that differed between the 44 year old and 41 year old peripheral retinas Table 3 It is more difficult to rule out heterogeneous dissection as a variable in the differences seen in the hypothalamus libraries particularly as tissue dissections were carried out by different investigators Unlike in the retina we lack good markers that are both highly expressed in adjacent tissues and excluded from the hypothalamus and are thus unable to directly evaluate our hypothalamic libraries for contamination The great majority of differences observed however seem to represent differences in very broadly expressed proteins particularly ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins S B and C L C data not shown suggesting that heterogeneous dissection is unlikely to account for most of the differences observed However we cannot rule out the possibility that some smaller fraction of the differences is due to heterogeneous dissection of the starting material for the two libraries RNA instability following tissue dissection does not account for most of the inter individual differences observed While major differences in gene expression were observed in libraries generated from different individuals some of the samples used to generate these libraries differ in their storage conditions before processing The interval between enucleation and freezing was 45 minutes for the 44 year old and 88 year old retinas whereas the 41 year old retina was kept at room temperature for 4 hours and then processed for RNA extraction The tissue used to make the two P6 5 mouse libraries was harvested and frozen 5 minutes later but the periods over which the two samples were stored at 80 C were different 1 week and 6 months respectively It is thus possible that differences in tag distribution among the libraries might represent differential mRNA stability following tissue collection Several reports have indicated a high level of RNA stability for up to 48 hours postmortem in tissue kept at room temperature 46 47 48 49 and no reports to our knowledge have indicated instability of mRNA in tissue stored long term at 80 C However as SAGE comprehensively profiles cellular mRNA expression while previous studies examined only a handful of candidate transcripts 46 47 48 49 it could be that SAGE identifies unstable transcripts that are missed by a candidate gene approach The correlation coefficient between tag abundance levels in the 44 year old and 88 year old retinal samples which were both processed 45 minutes after enucleation is substantially higher than the correlation coefficient between the retinal libraries from the 44 year old and 41 year old individuals This is so despite the fact that the 44 year old and 88 year old individuals differ not only in age but also in sex This could mean that a major portion of the observed variance might result from differential processing and or storage of the tissue before mRNA preparation However comparison of expression of genes that differ by p 0 005 in the SAGE libraries from the peripheral retinas from the 44 year old and the 41 year old individuals indicates a roughly equal magnitude and direction of change of overall expression levels between the samples Figure 6 Were the differences between the samples largely due to differential mRNA stability one would expect to see a subset of mRNAs that were much reduced in expression in the 41 year old sample as that one spent a longer period of time between enucleation and RNA extraction One might also expect to see a fraction of more stable transcripts showing a small compensatory increase in relative frequency but this is not the case The most likely explanation then for the differences between the 41 year old and 44 year old samples is variation in gene expression The observed variation between the two P6 5 mouse libraries was more surprising As 3 8 of the tags that differ at p 0 005 represent known rod specific genes S B and C L C data not shown a small subset of these results probably partially reflect minor differences in developmental timing and some of the other differences in tag abundance may also reflect variation in genes expressed in a dynamic manner during development Other differences may reflect differences in mRNA stability during long term frozen storage However as with the human samples the direction of a roughly equal magnitude and direction of change of expression levels is seen in tags that differ at p 0 005 between the samples Figure 7 suggesting that differential mRNA stability is not the cause of observed variation This also suggests that for both the human human and littermate littermate comparisons no major selective mRNA degradation occurs between tissue harvesting and binding of the mRNA to the magnetic oligo dT coupled beads The source of most of the variation between the samples thus remains unclear One animal that was a developmental outlier is a possible explanation For example litters of inbred mice sometimes have a runt suggesting a difference in rate of development and or other factors However much of our data collected and analyzed for other purposes would suggest that such outliers are rare at least with respect to eye development 13 23 Inter individual differences in gene expression are most likely to account for the observed differences in tag distribution A final source of the observed variability between individual samples probably reflects real individual differences in gene expression It may partially reflect genetic polymorphisms that give rise to different Nla III sites and hence different SAGE tags although this is unlikely to explain observed differences in gene expression between the inbred mice The fact that the 41 year old and 44 year old human samples as well as the murine hypothalamus samples were both obtained from males implies that differential expression of X inactivated polymorphic alleles cannot explain the observed differences A fraction of the variation is likely to represent either differential environmentally induced patterns of gene expression or stochastic variation in gene expression that persists in the adult In tissues such as the hypothalamus where we see large differences in gene expression in age and sex matched mice of the same strain this variability may reflect high levels of variability in behavior that are seen in inbred mice raised and tested under seemingly identical laboratory conditions 50 Moreover the high variability that is seen in both the development and gene expression profiles of cloned mice 34 51 and the relatively low heritability of many quantitative traits such as lifespan or psychiatric illness that is observed in monozygotic twins 52 53 implies that there is substantial variability in gene expression even in genetically identical individuals particularly in tissues of the CNS Conclusions We have shown that the microSAGE method like conventional SAGE analysis is highly accurate and representative Furthermore we have shown that it is highly reproducible when different libraries are made from the same starting mRNA samples However we find that considerable differences in gene expression are observed between samples of the same tissue taken from different individuals These may reflect minor differences in the processing or storage of the samples or may represent real differences in gene expression Further experiments are required to resolve this issue In any case these data show that a measure of caution is required when comparing tag abundance levels in different SAGE libraries that were not processed identically or obtained from the same individual Materials and methods Isolation of mouse brain and retinal tissue C57 B6 mice were used to obtain tissue from hypothalamus adult retina and outer nuclear layer The crx and crx littermates represent hybrids of C57B6 and Sv129 strains Mice were killed between 2 p m and 4 p m and were housed on a 12 12 light dark cycle Microdissected outer nuclear layer tissue was obtained by flat mounting freshly dissected retinas flattened by radial cuts onto nitrocellulose filters The filters were then frozen at 80 C in OCT mounting medium photoreceptor side down Orthogonal cryostat sections of 20 m were cut onto Superfrost slides Fisher and the edge of the section containing the outer nuclear layer was hand dissected using a microscalpel and immediately frozen Only sections containing retinas with excellent morphology were used for sample preparation All libraries with the exception of the P10 5 crx and crx littermates were made immediately directly from tissue stored at 80 C The P10 5 crx and crx littermate libraries were made directly from Trizol purified total RNA and were the same starting material used in two previous studies from this lab 14 27 Human tissue was obtained from patients with periocular malignancies removal of which required enucleation of a healthy eye The donors were an 88 year old Caucasian female and 44 year old Caucasian male surgery conducted at Massachusetts Eye and Ear Hospital Boston MA and a 41 year old Japanese male surgery conducted in Osaka Japan Human tissue was dissected and snap frozen 45 min post enucleation and processed shortly afterwards Deviations from this general schema are as follows 41 year old human peripheral retina tissue spent 5 h at room temperature before RNA extraction hypothalamus B mice were housed in animal facilities at the Howard Florey Institute University of Melbourne Melbourne Australia Generation of SAGE libraries A modification of the microSAGE method 10 was used to generate all SAGE libraries In brief 20 25 mg of tissue containing 5 10 million cells was used to generate each of the libraries with the exception of the P10 5 crx and crx littermate libraries for which 5 g total RNA was used and the microdissected outer nuclear layer library for which retinas from two different individuals were used Six nanograms of each linker was used to generate the ditags and 28 cycles of amplification were used to obtain ditags from each of the samples with the exception of the E12 5 library which was amplified for 30 cycles and the ONL library which was amplified for 32 cycles In the case of the P2 5B SAGE library ditag amplification took place after the initial ditag ligation had been stored at 20 C for 3 months DNA sequencing was conducted on an ABI 3700 SAGE tag counts for each of the libraries Figure 1 hypothalamus 55 212 adult retina 54 009 Figures 2 3 3T3 28531 obtained from 54

52 207 Data analysis Testing for equality of proportions In this method we want to see if the difference between the proportions p 1 x A and p 2 y B is significant 4 Each tag here is viewed as a random variable following a binomial distribution which can be approximated by a normal distribution in this case because the total count is large The statistic of interest is We can compute the p value or the confidence interval from this statistic This test is conceptually simple and easy to implement There is no need to perform Monte Carlo simulations as done in the software by SAGE 3 0 1 as they seem to give similar results Poisson model We can use Poisson distribution to model the sampling of tags as the selection of a particular tag can be regarded as a random event with a small probability Considering the probability of observing y occurrences of a clone already observed x times we have the formula 20 p values can be computed by summing up the appropriate tail of the distribution Fisher s exact test When we think of the data as the 2 2 table the most common way to compute the p value is the chi square test which can be shown to be equivalent to the equality of proportion test described above For a small number of tag counts Fisher s exact test may be used which computes the exact probability of the observed 2 2 table containing x y A x B y based on a hypergeometric distribution assuming that the marginals are fixed Bayesian Model We can also use a Bayesian model with a prior distribution for the likely fold changes 56 The prior distribution is often specified using a beta function for mathematical convenience and the parameter is chosen to reflect the distribution of changes in expression levels between experimental conditions This approach allows one to estimate the probability that the proportions differ by a given factor The first three of these methods are closely related For example the binomial distribution related to the equality of proportions method and which serves as the basis for the Monte Carlo analysis conducted by the SAGE 3 0 1 data analysis software with small probability and large sample size converges to the Poisson distribution Fisher s exact test should replace the chi square test when the number of counts in the 2 2 contingency table becomes very small 5 roughly speaking For our data we have found that all these methods give very similar results and the difference in the p values is noticeable only for the very small p values that is 10 10 Additional data files All comparisons of SAGE libraries
