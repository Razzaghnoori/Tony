 Labor s Diversionary Tactics A friend of mine recently took a job organizing with the Service Employees International Union The SEIU you ll recall is the union that nurtured AFL CIO President John Sweeney who won office a year and a half ago on pledges to revitalize or at least resuscitate American labor There is good reason to take those pledges seriously Between 1980 and 1995 a period when most of the labor movement was submoribund Sweeney s SEIU launched a series of clever and dogged organizing campaigns and nearly doubled its membership But to reverse its four decade decline the AFL CIO will need to do more than adopt the SEIU s organizing wizardry It must convince the nation at large that organized labor is not simply a lobby a New Deal relic or a clubhouse full of gray suited men Just after she was hired my friend attended a retreat of SEIU organizers and rank and filers They spent the weekend chewing over the tactical innovations that have made the union s reputation card check campaigns that bypass the National Labor Relations Board s sclerotic certification process aggressive scrutiny of employers financial profiles blitzkrieg drives that take on entire sectors at once And every evening she reports with a smile we all stood in a circle and sang The Internationale Now the sight in 1997 of self respecting American trade unionists singing a socialist anthem in however jokey a spirit would doubtless set off alarm bells It s easy to imagine Dick Armey and Trent Lott nudging each other with told you so glee or Gore and Gephardt averting their eyes with a shudder But you ll hear no complaints from me Like my friend I m somewhere to the left of paleoliberal I believe that human civilization peaked in Sweden circa 1972 I hope my friend and her colleagues have long and honorable careers tightening labor markets and kicking the shit out of corporations that bully or cheat their workers But I have to confess Something about that SEIU retreat sounds depressing Imagine it In the daytime Jesuitical preparations for long uphill organizing drives And then for uplift and inspiration a chance to sing Solidarity Forever and other anthems that no normal person under the age of 60 has ever heard This is bear in mind one of the most vigorous and progressive corners of the labor movement and yet it somehow carries the odor of a fading religious sect This is John Sweeney s burden The American labor movement is alone like no other in the advanced industrial world It operates in a crippling legal environment The Taft Hartley Act of 1947 and its ensuing case law have erected absurd barriers to workers freedom of association For the price of a lawyer and a few gnat size fines nonunion employers can comfortably fire workers simply because they seek to organize In Canada the country whose economy is most similar to ours organizing workers are better protected from dismissal and per capita union membership is more than twice the U S level And where West European labor movements are well embedded within a broader left the American left is populated by romantic individualists whose pulses are not set racing by the letters AFL CIO Elaine Bernard the Canadian scholar who directs Harvard University s Trade Union Program quips I sometimes think that American radicals will march in solidarity with any country s working class except their own The tactical savvy that Sweeney brings might help stanch the AFL CIO s bleeding it s been losing more than 200 000 members a year But tactics alone won t rescue labor from its peculiar weakness and insularity To break through that barrier the AFL CIO will need to convince a majority of Americans or at least a muscular plurality that solidarity is good for what ails us They need to sell the case that our colossal wage inequality is not a fact of nature that a progressive labor movement can make our workplaces more decent and more productive and that strong unions can leverage gains not only for their members but for the broader society Making this case won t be easy but it s unavoidable Without such a framework even the cleverest organizing tactics will come to seem hollow As Bernard says The labor movement is eternally in danger of becoming a Contracts R Us operation that only services its existing members You ve got to look in the mirror every morning and ask yourself What am I organizing for If labor were less defensive and insular and better embedded in a larger reform movement it might be more motivated to address its own shortcomings First ahem there is the matter of housekeeping God bless the day when no one s Uncle Ed will be able to lean across the Thanksgiving table and say So I hear you re working for the labor movement Isn t that America s last bastion of mobsters racists and hacks Second a humbler labor movement might be less likely to cut shortsighted political deals that undercut its larger purpose There was a pathetic scene a few weeks ago in Los Angeles home to several respected labor community initiatives These alliances have sweated blood in fights with Republican Mayor Richard Riordan over public transportation housing and health care But in February the Los Angeles Central Labor Council voted to endorse Riordan s re election bid after he dangled promises of an immense hotel development project The endorsement vote which was narrow to begin with was later rescinded after an outcry Riordan won anyway And there s also a risk that tactical innovations like the SEIU s will come at the expense of movement building Several weeks ago I spoke with a New York City organizer about the disastrous newspaper strike in Detroit This organizer is an alumnus of the AFL CIO s much praised Organizing Institute which trains both rank and file workers and zealous college students in the latest tactics He was full of scorn for labor s plans for a national march on Detroit this June That s the lamest idea imaginable he said Even if 20 000 people show up who s going to pay attention If they want to win a decent contract in Detroit what they need is a squad of 50 people who will target the boards of directors of Gannett and Knight Ridder Find out where they live Jam their fax machines Harass them when they go shopping That s how you defeat corporate power This sort of strategy is very much in the Organizing Institute s spirit Its training materials stress finding the person who can give you what you want and making his or her life hell The ghost of Max Weber might denounce these frat boy tactics with a long sermon about means and ends but I m a bit more tolerant After all employers routinely do things just as nasty Did you catch the story a few weeks ago about the Coca Cola truck driver who was bribed thousands of dollars as part of an effort to subvert an organizing drive But I m still uncomfortable Isn t there something amiss when a movement based on solidarity and cooperation trains its organizers to behave as if they were in a Hobbesian world of all against all The New York organizer is probably correct The march on Detroit won t do much to help win a contract But without a steady drumbeat of public engagement through marches debates C SPAN the works the labor movement will continue to smell of anachronism So kudos to Sweeney for toning labor s muscles Now let s work on the heart and the voice
