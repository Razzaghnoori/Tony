 Internet Envy The fact that the Internet will make life better for all humankind has long been noted even on the East Coast What seems to have struck the East Coast only recently is that the Internet is making a smaller subset of all humankind people who start Internet related companies or join them before they go public incredibly wealthy The New York Times reported as much on its front page recently so you know it s probably true Out here in cyberland people have been aware of this fact for several years Indeed we have talked of little else since about September 1996 which is the last time anyone mentioned a book except in the context of Amazon com The basic anecdote variations on When I knew him in college he was stoned all the time two years ago he was living in a corrugated box on his ex wife s compost pile we all actually pitched in to buy him a new futon then last week they had their IPO and now he s worth 350 million declined long ago from fresh conversational gambit through staple to clich So what s new Money has always been a fraught topic A New York writer who regularly mines his sex life and longings for material begged off an invitation to write about the Internet IPO phenomenon for Slate on the grounds that his feelings about money are too personal and complex And envy didn t just become a deadly sin when its existence was acknowledged by the New York Times Nevertheless the arrival of Internet Envy on the Washington New York buzz axis is new in several ways Washington types used to be surprisingly immune to envy of other people simply for being richer A theory long propounded by Walter Shapiro USA Today political columnist and Slate contributor is that the financial heights of Washington are occupied by high salaried lawyers and lobbyists not by real accumulated or inherited wealth as in New York The lifestyle gap between the middle and upper class does not yawn in front of say a Washington Post editor every day Journalists even print journalists and high level civil servants live in the nicest neighborhoods More important of course Washington has or had a social status ranking independent of money It s a place where puzzled gazillionaires can find themselves snubbed at dinner parties by deputy assistant Cabinet secretaries and patronized by minor TV talking heads Even in New York where money matters more there are unlike in Washington strong independent subcultures in which a journalist or college professor or unemployed actor can take comfort in an independent value system They could have been bankers or management consultants but chose not to be And the people at the top of those heaps earning plenty to live comfortably honestly wouldn t trade being say curator of dinosaurs at the Museum of Natural History for being just another multimillionaire investment banker On most days So what has changed One element obviously is the size of these Internet fortunes Hundreds of millions As syndicated columnist Matt Miller recently pointed out with numbers like this surging across the Times business section even investment bankers feel like wage slaves at 10 million a year And poor souls these investment bankers generally cannot find comfort in an independent value system Meanwhile in Washington where even New York style fortunes are rare it seems that America Online alone located in D C s Virginia suburbs has created a vast new social stratum of megamillionaires one has never heard of Gives one pause Second there s the speed It s one thing to console yourself that at least you didn t have to spend 30 years doing a job you would hate That trick is a bit harder when you read that someone inevitably someone with the same name as that bozo down the hall sophomore year but it can t be look here s his picture oh hell joined some nothing of a company sat there through the IPO and cashed out all in a couple of years How awful can a job be Answer maybe not so awful at all In fact maybe it s remarkably similar to the job you re doing now A third startling difference about Internet IPO wealth is that some of it is raining down on journalists Writing journalists no less at places like Amazon and TheStreet and iVillage dot com dot com dot com This is something truly new in the history of the known universe Slate s former Keeping Tabs columnist Emily Yoffe observes You no longer can say Sure I could have made a lot of money if I d decided to be a Wall Street money grubber And it s not just a famous TV hack spending every weekend speaking to the Aluminum Manufacturers for 50 000 We re talking about journalists getting seriously rich just by being journalists Thus journalists have joined software engineers and business executives in peddling the other basic Internet Envy anecdote variations on Oh yeah they offered me the top job at Somedamnedsite com begged me to take it offered me 75 percent of the equity plus options for another 75 but I turned it down Even during the first few years of Internet frenzy Internet Envy was not widespread in N Y D C buzzworld because the whole thing seemed to be happening on another planet to people one not only didn t know but could scarcely imagine Only very recently have lottery winners started popping up in one s own neighborhood Internet Envy exists in cyberland itself too but it is much more straightforward Everybody is trying to do the same thing some succeed and those who don t are envious You don t have to pretend that you re not And there s no queasy feeling that you must have misplaced that notice explaining how the rules were about to change In Paragraph 19 Line 106 replace the words Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction with the words seven hundred fifty million dollars Also unlike back East there s no vertiginous obsession with how young these IPO heads are because almost everybody is scandalously young The rules have indeed changed But they re always changing in a couple of ways Some changes in personal values are simply part of growing older Then there are shifts in the values of the general culture To oversimplify In high school the jocks are on top unless of course armed losers storm the cafeteria one day and mow them down But the smart kids tend to win in adult life The glow of that happy discovery can last for years as Nathan Myrhvold explained and simultaneously demonstrated in a recent Slate These are folks lucky enough to be able to choose their careers and to have a good shot at success at whatever they choose At the crucial moment when they make their choices many of these people honestly believe that money beyond the cost of upper middle class comfort is not all that important to them and most of them may turn out to be right But some are responding to the fleeting hormonal surges of youthful idealism or to the special status hierarchy of the academic subculture where they temporarily reside In the most tragic examples a charismatic professor will entice them into a lifetime of French medieval history about which their curiosity is exhausted before they get their Ph D s In less extreme cases they become writers Then they discover in their 30s or 40s that money is important to them after all This is the moment when reading about some 28 year old who s suddenly worth 300 million can have an effect that requires medical attention Sometimes this personal process of maturity or decay take your pick is reinforced by what s happening in the culture Money is never unimportant but there are moments when it is more important than others This is one of them Actually a graph of the changing value of money in the status market would look a lot like a graph of the Dow Jones industrial average It rose steadily starting about 1982 the year a star New York Times reporter shocked his journalist colleagues by quitting the Times to become an investment banker crested and sank briefly in the late 1980s quickly recovered and has been hitting new heights ever since In these days when even the most softhearted and public spirited people become venture capitalists younger readers may find it hard to believe there was ever a time when even an extremely ambitious person motivated entirely by a desire to do well rather than to do good or to do anything in particular might well decide to be a journalist But it s true Of course it s possible that the stock market and the status market have peaked together again Price earnings ratios are perilously high in both A 400 million fortune gets you about as much status as a mere 50 million got you a decade ago Speculators in status futures are rumored to be pulling out of money and getting into undervalued properties including kindness musical talent and short term memory The decline of money is also expected to benefit blue chips such as physical beauty according to some analysts So maybe this is the wrong moment to cash in your reputation as a saint based on two and a half decades spent bathing patients in a South American leprosy clinic for a job with 50 percent equity stake as CEO of Leper com soon to be LPRC on the NASDAQ In this market as in others timing is everything
