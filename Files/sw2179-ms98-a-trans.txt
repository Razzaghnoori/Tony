 okeydoke okay down here it s been it s everybody s got colds and everything because it s cold one day and hot the next day really oh that s the way it is up here like today it was fifty and raining and two days ago it was snowing a blizzard up here so it just it just likes kind of crazy all over the country i guess it s just yep yeah well it is it s about yeah it s about seventy five here today it s seventy five down there yeah that s not too hard to take yeah no but uh couple of days ago it was in uh mid uh thirties at night and only warmed up to about forty five in the daytime yeah uh huh well it does that up here well we get a lot of weather that s that s uh controlled by the ocean we re so we re so close to the ocean here in Rhode Island are you familiar with with Attleboro at all or in Massachusetts yeah yeah not not uh no not the uh the area you know i am the TI plant as far as you know what they make and everything but the weather no okay okay well New England is kind of kind of like uh pretty close sits right on the Atlantic Ocean and we get you know a lot of a lot of the weather is driven by the winds coming in off the ocean the northeast winds bring in yeah yeah all kind of weather from the Atlantic Ocean you know and that drives our weather nutsy sometimes we ll get the clouds and the wind coming the right way and the storms will just pour in moisture and pump anything from snow to rain depending on the temperature you know yeah yeah well down here they re normally Dallas normally has pretty good weather but uh but yeah it it s not bad uh i i was i was in Abilene for ten years i worked in Abilene for ten years so yeah i m kind of familiar with the weather out that way in west Texas but not in not in Lewisville yeah but uh also the pollen down here has been terrible if if you ve got sinuses if you re bothered with ragweed and mountain cedar and all that other stuff that gets in the air boy it s just been driving everybody crazy is that right everybody everybody s sick down there yeah uh either sinus problems or like i say colds or flu or whatever of course i don t know that that s really really weather related i think you know we just have have every once in a while have epidemics of uh huh of viruses going around i know i had strep throat here about a week ago week and a half ago well i did too about a month ago i had a a real severe cold but nothing that required you know um a doctor s visit or anything like that i was just able to take some aspirin and rest for a couple of days but it just seemed like it yeah yeah you re absolutely right you don t know how to dress you go out in the morning with real heavy clothes on because it s real cold and by noontime you re taking everything off you know to to go walk around the site and stuff yeah yeah and and it s unreal that uh uh you know by evening you can drop back twenty thirty degrees it s just the weather changes so quick you know yeah yeah and if you don t have coats and sweaters with you of course by then you re all sweated up and warm and that s how i think a lot folks carry yeah well i m a hot weather person i m i can take the heat but i don t like the cold yeah my the older i get the less i like the cold up here i ll tell you i think that i think that uh you know it just takes it s toll and uh and uh yeah that yeah when you get when you re young you kind of can tolerate a lot of a lot of cold weather and stuff yeah that snow is pretty to look at but i i don t like to drive in it or or you re right you re sure right it s it s nice to look at but the last couple of storms we ve had the last couple of snowstorms we ve had have really been good because they snowed and and like within a day it s warmed right back up and melted the roads and stuff so huh we re able to get around pretty good and it didn t stay too long on the sides of the roads but i spent uh i spent a year up in Colorado Springs at TI up in Colorado Springs uh oh i ve uh huh i guess you ve seen some pretty weather up there too it was beautiful weather and it it was real strange it could snow yep and be sun shining or right after it got through snowing you could go out in short sleeved shirt and it wasn t that uncomfortable yeah uh huh that s the way i found that s the way i found Abilene in the winter because of the yeah it s a it s a dry snow it s not a wet slushy snow it s packed yeah there s no see the humidity up here too is really bad in the summertime it s really bad it can be seventy five eighty outside but the humidity runs up ninety ninety five percent and boy your just like you re in an oven roasting i ll tell you yeah yeah yeah but West Texas now was a hundred and ten and i didn t mind that at all you know because it was so dry no yeah and i also spent uh eight years with TI out in uh Ridgecrest California uh huh out in the middle of the Mohave Desert yeah that s nice out through there i ve got a and i loved that i ve got a son lives in Riverside and i drove across the Mohave Desert went to Las Vegas i went from route five to Las Vegas by car and that was a pretty nice trip yeah yeah yeah but uh that was also a dry hot it wasn t a it wasn t a humidity hot and uh i enjoyed it i was surprised that last year was my first trip out there i d never been to California and i went through out to Death Valley and yeah it was like a hundred and twenty five or something and it it didn t feel that hot yeah no huh uh especially it it like strange that it you re right in the middle of the mountains and it s so brown and dry but boy you just didn t feel right yeah it didn t feel that hot especially if you can get find some shade uh huh yeah that s the hard thing out that way but uh i liked Riverside though the weather in Riverside was pretty good in California was it was i have a son lives in Riverside and one lives in Corona so yeah yeah that was pretty good but the weather here in New England like like they say if you don t like it too well well just stick around a little bit and and it it will change up and give you something that you may like worse or like more it all depends on on Mother Nature s kind of fickle up this way i guess it will change yeah they had a they had a interesting show in uh public channel down here yesterday on uh the uh ice flows and the ice age and how the weather effected the ice ages and everything and it s real interesting uh huh that sounds like it yeah that sounds yeah i imagine it would that this that s what we get real cold weather where the wind blows down out of Canada is called that uh Canadian ex press and boy that winds comes down and it and it seems to make a big dip yeah yeah sometimes it dips all the way down to you folks down in Texas and then it roars back up the east coast here by the time we get it it is hauling some cold weather yeah yeah in fact i think they showed on the they showed the United States map a shores of course Canada or North America map and showed uh how far the ice had come down and during the last ice ice age yeah and i think you all were about a mile and a half deep in ice boy that s unreal when you think about it you know that s that must be something uh to yeah well they say these big icebergs that you see floating out here in the north Atlantic then you see the tip of them they look like small mountains and that s only like one third of the iceberg the rest of it submerged under the water yeah right right and that s been uh uh a problem you know to to the merchant people that that fish and stuff up here they run into that ice stuff in the winter and it breaks away how long have you been up there in uh Attleboro Attleboro i ve lived here all my life and i worked uh i ve been with uh TI fifteen years ten of it in in Texas five years up here yeah but i ve lived up here all my life and i m fifty eight years old so i i could well my wife spent some time up in Connecticut yeah that s right next door to us Connecticut s not that far away did she like it up here in Connecticut yeah yeah yeah she liked it and she wants to go back up there and and uh look around you know just sight see it s nice the best time to come up here is like in in the fall in the late fall and look at the leaves turn colors because that s that s something that you just can t paint a picture of or yeah yeah and the cold weather is starting to come in when the leaves start turning colors yeah and uh that that s really nice to look at uh the summers are hot pardon me what do you all have aspen you all have mostly aspen or no we have a lot of maple up here and oak mostly oak and maple is is a and and pine of course evergreens up as you get up north into the northern part of the maple the eastern corner here it s all pine trees and yeah but uh i guess the hardwoods are probably the biggest thing we have are our hard maple and hard oak and and the the evergreens yeah well but that s scattered with birch trees and stuff and uh it s real pretty when the leaves all turn colors because you get a multiple array of colors and people come from all over the world come through New England only like that week or two when the colors are the brightest you know yeah a lot of our trees and things now are are starting to bud out i sure hope we i sure hope we don t get a hard freeze to to kill everything now oh sure because it s so warm yeah uh huh but well uh yeah the it it s kind of one more week here i guess and we ll be into uh into the springtime i guess we got another week of winter here just about right we ll be out of the out of the winter and into the springtime and yeah uh huh yeah we might get one more little snowstorm in April but i don t think it will amount to much yeah usually down here our worst our worst month our coldest month is usually February but we didn t have have that much of a winter this year this that s what i noticed when i was there was the ice storms you got around February one time i flew into DFW and it was iced over we had to go into Love Field because we just couldn t get into DFW yeah yeah usually yeah i m i m kind of sorry that we haven t had a real good hard a long hard freeze we ve had a you know we ve had a freeze but just maybe one or two days yeah i think that that kills a lot of germs and stuff it it kills a lot of the bugs and the yep you re absolutely right i think it does it kills germs and bugs and the same thing up here if we get a hard hard freeze in the ground we get a lot of a lot of bugs and stuff in the lawns that are no longer there in the spring but if we don t boy they just seem to jump right out yeah yeah and i m afraid this summer is going to be bad as far as and bugs as fleas ticks and stuff like that yeah but uh how long have you been with TI uh uh thirty two years thirty two years boy that s a long time yeah yeah uh you working in the in the military equipment equipment uh DSEG yeah D S defense systems equipment group yeah yeah i was in that yeah uh huh
