 Background The arterial wall remodels in response to hemodynamic forces imposed on it by blood pressure and blood flow The processes of arterial remodeling involve regulation of vascular cell dynamics and control of matrix synthesis and degradation 1 Endothelial cell EC proliferation is observed in flow induced arterial dilation 2 and in vessel luminal expansion in mesenteric arterial collaterals in the rat 3 Smooth muscle cells SMC have also been shown to proliferate in the vessel dilatation remodeling 3 In the meantime extracellular matrix ECM is involved in a variety of remodeling processes 4 5 6 7 8 9 including flow induced arterial dilation 10 These observations indicate that cell proliferation and ECM accumulation are critically involved in vessel remodeling Furthermore degenerative or destructive changes in both cellular and extracellular components of the vessel wall are also evidenced in many situations involving vessel dilatation changes The internal elastic lamella of arteries is shown to form gaps prior to vessel dilatation in an experimental arteriovenous model in rabbit carotid artery 2 Collagenase and matrix metalloproteinases MMPs have been observed to be upregulated during vessel dilation either in flow induced model 10 or in a post stenotic dilatation 11 Several growth factors in particular TGF have been shown to be involved in vessel wall remodeling with respect to both cellular proliferation and ECM accumulation 12 13 14 15 Cell apoptosis has been shown to play a role in various remodeling processes 1 including hypertension induced remodeling 6 and subnormal shear stress induced endothelial cell apoptosis 16 Interestingly TGF super family has been related to apoptosis in vascular cells 17 However whether flow induced arterial dilatation may also associated with apoptosis and how it might be coordinated with cell proliferation in a large elastic artery remain unclear The present study was aimed to assess gene expression of both TGF and apoptosis related molecules in early response of the artery to an increase in blood flow in rat abdominal aorta Methods Animal model of aortocaval fistula The aortocaval fistula ACF 18 19 was created between the infrarenal abdominal aorta and the adjacent vena cava in male Sprague Dawley rats weighing 250 300 g All procedures were carried out following the guidelines set forth in the Resource Manual for the Care and Use of Animals in Research and Teaching at Stanford University Surgical procedures were carried out with sterile technique under a surgical microscope Rats were under general anesthesia with an intraperitoneal injection of sodium pentobarbital 50 mg kg Through a midline abdominal incision the infra renal abdominal aorta and the inferior vena cava were visualized The aortic blood flow was stopped by a microvascular clamp placed 5 mm above the iliac bifurcation A side to side ACF was constructed by a needle puncture method using a 19 guage needle The outer wall of the aorta distal to the clamp was pierced with the needle which was then advanced into the vena cava The needle was subsequently retrieved and the arteriotomy was closed with 8 0 silk suture The clamp was then removed and the vena cava was evaluated for bright red color an indication of a successful ACF The abdominal wall was closed with silk suture The skin was then closed with microsurgical clips Sham operated rats underwent the same surgical procedure except that only the aortic wall was pierced and subsequently closed without ACF construction Time course of study Animals were sacrificed 1 and 3 days 1 2 4 and 8 weeks after surgery n 3 for each time point Equal number of sham operated and age matched animals served as controls Two sets of animals were used One was for extraction of total tissue RNA and protein and one for perfusion fixation for histology Blood flow measurement and wall shear stress calculations Blood flow rate mL min in the infra renal aorta was measured by micro Doppler velocimetry before and immediately after ACF construction and again at the end of the experiment Wall shear stress WSS was calculated using the Hagen Poiseuille formula W 0 1 4 Q r 3 where W is WSS in newtons per square meter Pa is the blood viscosity 0 03 poise Q is blood flow rate mL s and r is arterial lumen radius centimeter 2 Sampling and perfusion fixation The infra renal aorta of 5 mm long starting 2 mm proximal to the fistula was harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for extraction of total RNA and protein by using Trizol Reagent Life Technologies Inc Rockville MD For histological study the animals were perfusion fixed through a catheter in the left ventricle of the heart with 4 paraformaldehyde at room temperature and at a pressure of 100 mmHg for 30 minutes This was performed in an attempt to preserve the physiological architecture of the vessel wall and to prevent the vessel from collapsing as described previously 6 The aorta was then taken and further fixed in 4 paraformaldehyde for two more hours The standard site for sectioning was at 4 mm proximal to the fistula orifice which is equivalent to the middle portion of the samples for total RNA extraction Paraffin embedded and frozen sections were prepared as needed Ribonuclease protection assay Relative mRNA levels were assessed using ribonuclease protection assay RPA to determine gene expression of growth factors and apoptosis related molecules Non radioactive RNA probes were transcribed from multi probe template set for rat cytokines rCK 3 and a set for rat apoptosis factors rAPO 1 Pharmingen San Diego CA 6 An in vitro RNA transcription kit Promega Madison WS was applied with the addition of biotin 16 UTP for labeling the probes Roche Indianapolis IN The sensitivity and specificity of the probes were carefully tested before starting the experiment Five micrograms of total RNA from each animal were hybridized with the probes and an RPA III kit Ambion Austin TX was used for RPA following the manufacturer s protocols The protected fragments of the probes were resolved in 5 denaturing polyacrylamide gel followed by blotting to a positively charged nylon membrane The resolved probes were detected using BrightStar kit Ambion and exposed to films The resulted films were scanned and densitometry was performed with NIH Image program version 1 62 National Institutes of Health Bethesda MD The relative values of protected probe fragments were expressed as a ratio of their densitometry values over those of GAPDH glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase in the same lane The mean and SD were calculated for each time point Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry Western blotting analysis was performed for analyses of TGF 1 and 3 as well as Bcl xS All procedures were published previously 6 20 In brief protein samples of 25 g in 2 sodium dodecylsulfate loading buffer were fractionated by 10 sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at 100 V The proteins were transferred onto 0 45 m pore nitrocellulose membrane Schleicher Schuell Keene NH at 40 V for 45 to 60 minutes The membranes were blocked with 5 nonfat milk and incubated at room temperature for 1 hour with anti TGF 1 polyclonal antibody at a 1 200 dilution anti TGF 3 polyclonal antibody at a 1 1000 dilution and anti Bcl xS polyclonal antibody at 1 500 dilution After extensive washes with phosphate buffered saline the blots were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies 1 1000 conjugated with horseradish peroxidase for 1 hour at room temperature The blots were washed three times in phosphate buffered saline and the protein complexes were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents according to the manufacturer s protocol Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Inc Piscataway NJ The presented data are the results from three animals in each of the time points Protein samples from each animal were fractionated on more than one gel in duplicate or triplicate Immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin sections 4 micron in thickness following previous protocols 5 The same antibodies used for western blotting were used for detection of TGF 1 and TGF 3 with optimized dilutions Sections were de paraffinized and rehydrated in PBS followed by incubation in 3 H 2 O 2 in PBS for 10 minutes After washes in PBS for 5 minutes the sections were incubated in 1 100 diluted horse serum for 30 minutes Sections were incubated with primary antibody at 1 50 dilution in PBS for 1 hour at room temperature After 3 washes in PBS the sections were incubated with the corresponding biotinylated secondary antibody Vector Laboratories Inc CA at 1 200 dilutions for 1 hour at room temperature followed by ABC DAB method Vector Laboratories Inc according to the manufacturer s protocol The detection was brown precipitates as a result of the reaction of DAB with horse radish peroxidase The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and coverslipped Cell proliferation evaluation and apoptosis detection Incorporation and detection technique 6 of 5 bromo 2 deoxy uridine BrdU was used to assess DNA synthesis during cell proliferation Three injections of BrdU Sigma St Louis Mo 50 mg kg body weight were administered intraperitoneally to the animals 20 6 and 1 hours before they were humanely killed Immunodetection of BrdU incorporation was performed on frozen sections with a detection kit Roche The cell type of BrdU incorporated cells was assessed histologically In addition an antibody against actin Enzo Diagnostics Inc Farmingdale NY was used to confirm SMCs in the media The number of BrdU labeled nuclei was counted from each whole cross section The mean and SD were obtained from three animals for each time interval and the cell proliferation rate was expressed as a number of labeled nuclei per section Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling TUNEL method was used to demonstrate apoptosis in SMCs and endothelial cells 6 The TUNEL was performed on frozen sections An in situ cell death detection kit Roche was used for TUNEL with modifications Nuclei of apoptotic cells were thus labeled with fluorescein and the sections were counterstained with propidium iodide and observed under laser scanning confocal microscope Bio Rad MRC 1024 Hercules CA Negative controls were included by omitting the labeling buffer Positive controls were obtained by digestion of the sections with deoxyribonuclease I for 10 minutes at room temperature before the detection procedure Labeled nuclei were counted per section The mean and SD of each time point were obtained from three animals for statistical analysis Histology and morphometry Cross sections from the perfusion fixed specimens were stained with H E and Mason s trichrome staining The sections were digitized by tracing the contours of the lumen the internal elastic lamella and the external elastic lamella The lumen diameter was calculated from the circumference of the lumen The external diameter was calculated from the circumference of the external elastic lamella The average wall thickness was the difference of the two diameters divided by 2 Mean and SD were calculated from 3 sections of each time point Statistical analysis Data were presented as mean SD Single factor analysis of variance ANOVA and Bonferroni s test were used for multiple comparisons StatView software version 5 0 SAS Institute Inc San Francisco CA was used for the statistical analysis The difference was considered significant if P 0 05 Results Blood flow wall shear stress lumen diameter and wall thickness The ACF produced an increase in blood flow and therefore WSS in the infrarenal aorta by more than 5 folds after surgery Table 1 Morphometry revealed an increase in lumen diameters The lumen diameter started to increase at 1 week after ACF although this change did not reach statistical significance At 2 weeks and thereafter the lumen diameters were significantly larger than those of controls which were accompanied with decreased wall thickness Figure 1and table 1 Expression of cell growth related cytokines RPA using the multiple probes of rCK 3 revealed an upregulation of both TGF 1 and TGF 3 gene expression The relative mRNA levels of them increased with a peak at 3 days The levels declined after 3 days and returned to control levels Figure 2 left panels Western blot analysis showed an increase in the protein levels with a similar trend to mRNA levels for both TGF 1 and 3 Figure 2 right panels Moreover TGF 3 protein levels remained high at 1 week These changes preceded the aortic enlargement which happened at 2 weeks Immunohistochemistry revealed detection of both TGF 1 and 3 after flow increased The increased expression peaked at 1 and 3 days compared to controls The expression of these growth factors was closely associated with immunohistochemical staining Figure 3 The SMC in the inner and outer zones of the media seemed to be more involved in the expression of these growth factors Expression of apoptosis related molecules RPA with the multiple probe of rAPO 1 showed that relative mRNA levels of Bcl x short isoform Bcl xS known as pro apoptotic factors initially decreased at 1 day 3 days and 1 week followed by returning to base line level after 2W Figure 4 There was an increase in caspase 3 and Bax mRNA levels at 4W Other factors did not show significant changes Western blotting analysis showed a similar trend of mRNA level for Bcl xS Figure 4 but statistical outcome did not reach significance Immunohistochemistry did not show any apparent detection of these molecules Cell proliferation Cell proliferation was remarkable for both EC and SMC with EC more significant than SMC Figure 5 BrdU incorporated nuclei were observed in the media along the endothelial line and in the adventitia The incorporation rate for endothelial cells increased at 1 week and thereafter P 0 05 vs controls and the incorporation rate of SMC increased at 4 weeks P 0 05 vs controls Table 1 Cell apoptosis Apoptosis of vascular cells was assessed by TUNEL method in all animals There was no remarkable difference in apoptosis rate after ACF creation data not shown Discussion Vascular wall remodeling in response to hemodynamic alterations has been known closely related to lesion development in the arterial wall 21 22 23 Arterial wall shear stress is proven to be a critical factor in regulation of vessel diameter Increase in blood flow or shear stress induces enlargement of the artery 2 24 25 26 and decrease in shear stress results in reduction of lumen diameter of the artery 26 27 28 The present study once again demonstrated that increased blood flow rate induced arterial enlargement in an aortocaval fistula model in rats More significantly this model subjects the abdominal aortic aorta to a condition of an acute increase in blood flow So far most of vessel remodeling studies are based on peripheral arteries such as carotid and iliac arteries There are very few models using larger and elastic arteries like aorta for study of flow induced response 19 The current model provides a direct access to the investigation of abdominal aorta with blood flow induced hemodynamic alteration The study showed that the adaptive enlargement was associated with increased gene expression of TGF 1 and 3 known as tissue remodeling mediators 12 17 29 Gene expression of TGF 1 and 3 was upregulated at 1 and 3 days and 1 week upon increase in blood flow while the flow induced aortic enlargement occurred 2 weeks after ACF creation Furthermore the expression of these growth factors mainly associated with endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the inner media These results suggest that the function of TGF superfamily may be a prerequisite for the arterial dilatation and that endothelial cells and the smooth muscle cells may be responsible for the forth going vessel enlargement TGF expression is closely associated with an increase in wall shear stress 30 31 and with different forms of fluid shear stress 32 and its function is modulated by variety of factors 14 For example TGF 1 is secreted in an inactive precursor and requires furin mediated maturation 33 TGF 1 in turn induces expression of furin It has been demonstrated that both furin and TGF gene expression was upregulated by fluid shear stress in vascular endothelial cells Thus the positive feedback may enhance the effect of TGF 1 on endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells as demonstrated by Negishi et al 15 The present study demonstrated that fluid shear stress induced regulation of TGF expression in the larger elastic artery Furthermore TGF upregulation was associated with cell proliferation which was significant at almost all time points with EC more remarkable than SMC TGF superfamily of growth factors is powerful and subtle regulation of its expression may exert a remarkable action TGF is a potent regulator of the cell cycle in many cell types including vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells and as a result this growth factor has been postulated to play an important though largely undefined role in vascular proliferative processes 14 So far little is known about the modulation role of TGF 3 in vessel remodeling It is known that TGF 3 plays a role in cardiac morphogenesis mammary gland development and wound healing and that TGF 3 is involved in fine tuned interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells and their products 34 The exact role of TGF 3 in vascular remodeling response remains unclear It is conceivable that after an acute regulation of cell proliferation and ECM degradation TGF 3 may exert a fine tune up between cells and ECM for a reconstruction of the remodeled wall The mechanical and biochemical mechanisms of flow or shear regulated arterial dilatation and the vessel remodeling have been widely studied 35 Vessel wall shear stress exerted by blood flow is a regulating mechanical force on endothelial cells that has important physiological and pathological cardiovascular consequences The endothelial monolayer in vivo acts as a signal transduction interface for mechanical forces in particular shear stress Mechanisms related to spatial relationships at the cell surfaces and throughout the cells in the wall that influence flow mediated endothelial mechanotransduction involve many cytokines including TGF superfamily Furthermore flow mediated ion channel activation and cytoskeletal dynamics are related to topographic characteristics of the luminal and abluminal surfaces of living endothelial cells 35 Arterial dilatation is thought to be endothelial dependent 26 36 Endothelial proliferation during the flow induced arterial enlargement has been shown to be a characteristic event 2 The vessel enlargement results in an increase in lumen surface area while endothelial cell proliferation assures a continuous cell lining throughout Our observation indicated that apoptosis was not remarkable in the early stage of flow induced dilatation although apoptosis has been implicated to play a role in vessel remodeling 1 There was little change in TUNNEL analysis after ACF creation However some apoptosis related factors were regulated For example the mRNA levels of Bcl xS were initially decreased at 1 day 3 days and 1 week followed by returning to base line level after 2 weeks There was an increase in caspase 3 and Bax mRNA levels at 4 weeks Follow up western blotting analysis was unable to determine the expression trends suggesting that cell apoptosis regulation in vivo may be too subtle to be detected Apoptosis related molecules such as Bcl xS Bax and casepase 3 are known to be proapoptotic factors and involved in variety of vessel remodeling processes 37 38 39 The initial arrest in Bcl xS gene expression may momentarily depress apoptosis It is conceivable that during the early stage of the remodeling cell proliferation is the dominant response and apoptosis may be somewhat repressed to favor cell survival This is contested by the little changes in TUNEL detection Conclusions In summary the experiments demonstrate that gene expression of TGF 1 and 3 precedes the flow induced arterial enlargement and is associated with cell proliferation Expression of apoptosis related molecules such as Bcl xS Bax and caspase 3 seems to be little regulated in the early stage of this vessel remodeling process
