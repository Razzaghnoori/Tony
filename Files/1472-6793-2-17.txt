 Background Various smooth muscles differ in the content of contractile proteins and their isoforms and these differences might contribute to manifestation of characteristic contractile phenotypes For example phasic and tonic behavior of gastrointestinal smooth muscles has been attributed to different expression levels of caldesmon and caldesmon binding proteins but not to differences in the relative proportions of myosin actin calponin and tropomyosin 1 2 Arteries and veins of different vascular beds are primarily composed of tonic smooth muscles However these two types of blood vessels serve distinct functions in the circulation i e resistance vs capacitance The basis for the functional dissimilarities between the resistive and capacitative networks is poorly understood although various possibilities have been considered Arterial walls for example include a substantial layer of smooth muscle which provides efficient adjustment of arteries to blood pressure changes In contrast the muscle layer of venous wall is thinner and veins better accommodate changes in blood volume Differences in smooth muscle layer thickness however do not always satisfactorily explain why in some instances including stimulation of postganglionic nerve terminals veins are more responsive than corresponding arteries 3 4 5 6 Although differences in the type and amount of neurotransmitters receptor density and or sensitivity for neurotransmitter action or signal transduction mechanisms that couple membrane receptors to the contractile elements have been proposed to underlie the functional distinctions between capacitative and resistive regions of the mesenteric circulation the possibility that mesenteric artery and vein convey distinct expression levels of contractile proteins has not been ruled out The present study was carried out to determine whether the artery and vein form the same circulatory bed i e mesenteric circulation demonstrate differences in the expression levels of six major contractile and thin filament binding proteins i e actin myosin heavy chain MHC myosin light chain MLC tropomyosin TM calponin and caldesmon We also compared the anatomical structure of the vessel walls to obtain basic information about the morphology of the vessels under study and to interpret the protein density measurements in relation to vessel wall morphology Our experiments provide hints for understanding how the morphology and contractile protein content might contribute to distinct functions of the arterial and venous sites of the splanchnic circulation In addition this study contributes to the relatively rare comparative studies on capacitative and resistive blood vessels from the same vascular bed Results Morphology of mesenteric artery and vein The gross organization of canine mesenteric artery and vein preparations was studied by conventional phase contrast microscopy The walls of secondary branches of the artery were 180 5 m in thickness and consisted of an inner endothelial layer tunica intima a tunica media and an outer tunica adventitia Fig 1 Panel A Cross sections of tunica media revealed that it consisted primarily of smooth muscle cells averaging 24 0 5 cells in cross section n 10 fields of view N 3 animals Although the structure of secondary and tertiary branches of mesenteric artery was similar the smooth muscle layers of tertiary artery consisted of 12 4 0 4 smooth muscle cells in cross section Fig 1 Panel B and were notably thinner 130 4 m n 10 N 3 P 0 001 Mesenteric veins and arteries exhibited similar gross organization but expected differences were also observed in some individual structural elements For example secondary branches mesenteric vein consisted of 3 4 0 2 smooth muscle cells and had an average wall thickness of 50 4 m Fig 1 Panel C Similarly tertiary branched mesenteric veins consisted of 3 3 0 2 smooth muscle cells in cross section and were 40 2 m thick Fig 1 Panel D n 10 fields of view for each vessel These observations point to another structural difference unlike arteries the average number of smooth muscle cells per cross section and thus the difference of wall thickness between secondary and tertiary veins was insignificant P 0 05 Ultrastructural details in vessel wall morphology were observed by electron microscopy of the canine mesenteric artery and vein Fig 2shows the organization of endothelium smooth muscle cells and nerves within the artery Endothelial cells made close association with smooth muscle in regions of the inner aspect of the artery that was free of internal elastic lamina Fig 2 Panel A Within the tunica media smooth muscle fibers were organized so that the long axis of the cells ran at an angle to circular axis of the vessel wall Fig 2 Panel B These cells were tightly packed with thick and thin filaments and had many of the ultrastructural characteristics of smooth muscle cells including dense bodies and bands occasional mitochondria sacroplasmic reticulum free ribosomes caveolae and a basal lamina Fig 2 Panels C and D Elastic connective tissue and an abundance of collagen fibrils occupied intercellular spaces between smooth muscle cells In the adventitial layer there was an abundance of collagen fibrils Occasional nerve trunks containing several axons were observed adjacent to the external elastic lamina and often in regions were the lamina was disrupted Nerve axons contained several types of vesicles including dense cored and small electron lucent vesicles Fig 2 Panel D The overall ultrastructural organization of the mesenteric vein Fig 3 was similar to that of the artery The tunica media was primarily made up of smooth muscle cells and extracellular matrix proteins the tunica adventitia was made up of collagen fibrils an external elastic lamina occasional nerve processes and fibroblasts Since the same set of components were observed in sections of either blood vessel wall the characteristic feature that distinguishes the artery from vein was wall thickness and number of smooth muscle cells that span through vessel wall Total protein content of mesenteric artery and vein For these experiments we used mesenteric arteries and veins from 12 different dogs The tissue homogenization conditions 1 favor extraction of the major smooth muscle cell contractile proteins actin and myosin and the thin filament binding components caldesmon calponin and tropomyosin TM The protein concentrations determined in the clear homogenates from the artery decreased after each extraction cycle from 6 26 mg ml in the first to 1 28 mg ml in the second and were lower than the detectable minimum 0 1 mg ml of the BCA micro assay after the third cycle Likewise in the vein the protein concentrations after the third cycle were lower than the detectable level Therefore the protein extraction after the third cycle was considered complete The 3 supernatants from each artery and from each vein were pooled together and the protein concentrations were assayed again On an average the total protein yield was significantly higher from the artery than from the vein 0 312 0 024 mg mg dry tissue weight versus 0 225 0 016 mg mg respectively P 0 05 Table 1 Thus the calculated average ratio of total protein in the artery versus vein was 1 4 1 Contractile protein content of mesenteric artery and vein To test whether differences in the total protein content were associated with differences in the content of individual contractile proteins we quantified proteins by using dilution series of purified protein standards as illustrated with actin in Fig 4 The band densities of increasing amounts of actin standards on Western immunoblots Fig 4 Panel A were fitted to a linear relationship Fig 4 Panel B which was then used to calculate the amounts of actin in extracts from the artery and vein Fig 4 Panel C As shown in Table 1 densitometry of the immunoreactive actin bands and calculation of the actin amounts as a fraction of the separated total protein revealed a lack of difference between the artery and vein P 0 05 Similar assays showed that the contents of MHC 200 kDa and MLC 20 kDa were also indistinguishable in the artery and vein Table 1 and so were the actin MHC ratios 3 72 0 38 in the artery and 3 59 0 26 in vein P 0 05 These data indicate that the fractions of the major motor proteins actin and myosin are similar in both blood vessels We assayed the contents of some thin filament binding proteins proposed to play roles in modulation of the actin myosin coupling e g calponin caldesmon and TM The assay pointed to a slightly bigger amount of calponin in the artery than vein however the difference was not statistically significant P 0 05 Table 1 There were significant differences in the content of caldesmon The high molecular weight caldesmon h caldesmon is the major isoform of intact vascular smooth muscle 7 On the Western blots h caldesmon appeared as a single band with apparent molecular weight of 130 kDa which comigrated with h caldesmon standard purified from porcine stomach 8 Densitometry of immunoreactive bands revealed that the artery contained approximately 1 39 times more h caldesmon than vein Fig 5and Table 1 Tropomyosin is a dimer protein composed of one heavy subunit TM 39 kDa and one light subunit TM 36 kDa Fig 6 Panel A Analysis of the TM bands revealed a lack of significant difference of the total TM between the artery and vein Table 1 However differences were observed in the content of the TM isoforms Fig 6and Table 1 i both the artery and vein had significantly more TM than TM and ii the content of TM was bigger in the artery while TM was more abundant in vein These TM isoform levels determined significantly different TM TM ratios 3 26 0 48 in the artery versus 1 87 0 26 in vein P 0 05 Discussion The overall architecture and contents of individual contractile proteins are among the factors contributing to differences in the functional behavior of blood vessels 9 However comparative information about arteries and veins from the same vascular bed is usually scarce as it is with the arteries and veins of the mesenteric circulation In the present study we focused on identifying differences in the structure and organization of mesenteric arterial and venous walls which might help to better understand the physiology of these two vascular beds The primary structural difference was that secondary arterial branches contain a greater number of smooth muscle cells within the tunica media and have 5 to 10 times thicker smooth muscle layer than that of veins Moreover arterial smooth muscle cells have smaller intercellular gaps This tighter arrangement suggests closer intercellular coupling and more efficient production of force during muscle constriction the arterial wall is thus better suited for vigorous mechanical resistance than the venous wall From a structural point of view mesenteric blood vessels comply with the general notion that arterial walls are thicker than venous walls from the same branches Likewise the walls of the arterial secondary branches are thicker compared to tertiary branches consistent with the notion that a gradient of wall thickness is necessary for adjustments of the arterial network to rapid reduction of the blood pressure Interestingly however secondary and tertiary mesenteric veins have almost identical thickness It appears therefore that descending down the mesenteric tree the contractile potential of arterial strips would decrease faster relative to that of veins Thus an awareness of the gradient of wall thickness might be useful in comprehending the relative potency of the artery and vein during comparative mechanical studies From the thicker smooth muscle layer of mesenteric artery we obtained a greater amount of total protein than from the thinner veins but the fraction of the major motor proteins actin and myosin as well as of thin filament binding protein calponin was indistinguishable An intriguing finding in this study was that the actin myosin ratio in the canine mesenteric circulation 3 7 in the artery and 3 6 in the vein is higher than in aorta carotid and coronary arteries 2 6 or in non vascular smooth muscles 1 5 of pig 10 These observations suggest that the contractile protein composition might be inconsistent among vascular beds of one species and might exhibit interspecies differences Caldesmon and TM were the two contractile proteins that displayed quantitative differences between artery and vein Caldesmon is likely to play a modulatory role on the production of smooth muscle force via a tethering of actin to myosin 11 and or of its effects on the actomyosin ATPase 12 13 14 Similarly TM does not seem to function as a major regulatory protein but modulatory effects due to its ability to maintain the actin filamentous structure 15 to inhibit the Ca 2 ATPase activity 16 alter the cytoskeletal dynamics 17 and improve actin filament flexibility during the contraction relaxation cycle 18 19 have been well documented Differences in the content of caldesmon or the TM isoforms therefore might be associated with modulatory effects on the time profile or magnitude of contraction Moreover it has been recognized that caldesmon and TM can modulate the actin myosin interaction in a cooperative manner 20 suggesting that functional effects of these proteins on actin myosin coupling and smooth muscle mechanics ought to be interpreted in parallel It remains to be determined whether the relatively bigger amount of caldesmon and TM is advantageous for the artery in fulfilling resistive functions and whether more TM is a prerequisite for veins to fulfill capacitative functions in the mesenteric circulation Conclusions The results of this study confirm previous studies that thicker and more tightly assembled smooth muscle layer rather than the profile of the major contractile proteins is the likely cause for a higher mechanical potential of the mesenteric artery compared to vein While in various circumstances the mesenteric veins display a greater responsiveness to contractile stimuli than the corresponding arteries 5 21 this difference should be attributed to the specificity of the neuroeffector coupling or to signal transduction mechanisms underlying the functional distinctions between capacitative and resistive regions of the mesenteric circulation Methods Tissue preparation Twelve mongrel dogs of either sex averaging 15 kg were obtained from vendors licensed by the United States Department of Agriculture The use of dogs for these experiments was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Nevada The animals were euthanized with an overdose of pentobarbitone sodium 100 mg kg intraperitoneally The abdomen was opened and segments of second and third order branches of the inferior

tissues and the endothelial cell layer was left intact The arteries and veins used for protein biochemistry experiments were perfused with distilled water for 30 min to remove endothelium In previous experiments we have shown that this procedure successfully removes the endothelial cell layer without affecting the smooth muscle contractility 5 6 Conventional phase contrast and electron microscopy
