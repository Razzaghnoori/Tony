 Background The cell s response to hormones is a dynamic process that requires the efficient transmission of signals from the extracellular environment to specific intracellular sites For PKA and PKC the primary signal is generated at the plasma membrane and proceeds through intermediary G proteins that stimulate adenylyl cyclase 1 or phospholipases 2 to generate the second messengers cAMP and diacylglycerol respectively The diffusion of these soluble second messengers leads to the activation of PKA and PKC at specific subcellular locations 3 4 The two families of the regulatory subunits of PKA RI and RII have distinct cAMP binding properties and phosphorylation states 4 5 Each family has two different isoforms a and 3 resulting in four distinct types RI RI RII RII The different R isoforms have distinct tissue and subcellular distributions suggesting that they may be selectively targeted by scaffold proteins e g AKAPs anchored through different anchoring proteins 6 7 PKC has at least 11 isoforms 8 The physiological role of the individual PKCs has not been elucidated because most cells express multiple isoforms having nearly identical ligand binding properties and substrate specificity Compartmentation of PKC isoforms has been suggested as a mechanism for targeting selectivity near their physiological substrates 9 10 Consistent with this theme of selectivity work with isoform specific antibodies demonstrated that PKC isoforms have distinct subcellular locations 11 It has been known for the past decade that compartmentalization of PKA can occur through association with A kinase anchoring proteins AKAPs This association ensures specificity in signal transduction by placing kinases close to their appropriate substrates where they can swiftly respond to second messengers 6 Another advantage of compartmentation to specific subcellular locations is to restrict accessibility to certain substrates Selected AKAPs have been identified that can interact with both PKA and PKC 12 13 For example it was shown that AKAP 79 maintains PKA PKC and protein phosphatase 2B at the postsynaptic density of mammalian synapses 14 12 Likewise gravin a second PKA PKC anchoring protein targets these kinases to the membrane cytoskeleton 13 AKAP79 gravin and its mouse homolog clone 72 thus belong to the recently identified class of scaffolding proteins that coordinate multiple kinase activity by bringing them to one site For PKA binding it was thought for a long time that only RII subunits bind to AKAPs However a new class of AKAPs was discovered when two dual specific AKAPs D AKAP1 and D AKAP2 were cloned using a fusion protein of the RI as the bait in a yeast two hybrid screen 15 16 Therefore the contrasted distribution pattern between RI and RII may in part be due to selective association with different compartmentalized pools of AKAPs Only recently has the subcellular distribution of PKA at neuromuscular junctions NMJs and the adjacent muscle been systematically studied 17 18 Imaizumi Scherrer and colleagues demonstrated that RI is localized at the NMJ 19 but whether RI associates with a D AKAP in this region of muscle is not known However a recent study showing the colocalization of D AKAP1 with RI at the NMJ supports the prediction that localization of the R subunit there requires interaction with an AKAP 17 RII has been shown to be associated with mAKAP in heart and skeletal muscle 20 21 however little is known regarding the expression patterns of RII and AKAPs in the perijunctional regions More information has accumulated concerning PKC expression associated with the NMJ and skeletal muscle PKC was shown to localize to the presynaptic terminals of NMJs 22 23 whereas PKC plays a postsynaptic role at the NMJ 24 In skeletal muscle PKC was found in human muscle fibers 25 and with T tubules in rabbit skeletal muscle 26 However it is unknown whether tethering to a PKC anchoring protein mediates the localization to these compartments The work reported here was undertaken to further understand the compartmentalization of PKA and PKC through association with AKAPs Because RI was observed in close association with the NMJ postsynaptic membrane 19 we probed for D AKAP expression and possible colocalization with this and other regulatory subunits We also investigated the distribution of gravin at the NMJ because this AKAP is an autoantigen for myasthenia gravis a degenerative disease of the NMJ Results Western blot assays confirmed that the antibodies used are monospecific fig 1 The blots show that PKC the major PKC isoform present in muscle is not detected by the PKC II antibody and that there is little overlap between the specificities of the PKA regulatory subunit antibodies As with a previous report studying different groups of skeletal muscle 18 the soluble fraction contained most of the RI A band for RII was detected in contrast to a report of no RII detection in soleus or extensor digitorum longus muscles 18 which might be explained by the presence of nerve fibers or adipocytes wherein RII is prevalent 27 The blot for the affinity purified D AKAP1 antibody is shown because the protein A purified antibody displayed additional unexplained bands however no difference in fluorescence labeling was observed when using antibodies purified either way A previous report using immunofluorescence demonstrated colocalization of RI with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor nAChR at the NMJ postsynaptic membrane 19 We used immunohistochemistry coupled with confocal microscopy to acquire detailed information as to the intracellular localization of D AKAP1 in the several regions of the NMJ and adjacent intercostal muscle to compare with that of RI Rhodamine conjugated bungarotoxin was used to delineate the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ because it binds tightly to the nAChR found at this membrane Because D AKAP1 was shown to associate with mitochondria 28 double labeling with markers for this organelle either anti lipoic acid or anti cytochrome c was used to examine whether RI or D AKAP1 are associated with mitochondria in the NMJ We found partial overlap of the RI label with synaptophysin which labels presynaptic vesicles fig 2a Importantly RI was observed to be concentrated in other vicinities of the presynapse as well In the postsynaptic region RI immunoreactivity showed partial overlap with the mitochondrial marker lipoic acid overlap with mitochondria in muscle fibers was also observed fig 2b In muscle labeling of the I band by anti RI was dominant The I band contains actin and is where mitochondria are located but has no myosin The distribution of D AKAP1 at the postsynaptic NMJ and the adjacent muscle is similar to that of RI although there is no codistribution at the presynaptic region between these two labels fig 3a D AKAP1 is expressed in both NMJ and intercostal muscle D AKAP1 codistribution with cytochrome c mitochondrial marker is significant fig 3a but not as pronounced as the RII association with mitochondria compare with fig 5 We observed an enrichment of D AKAP1 at the postsynaptic membrane as shown by codistribution with nAChR fig 3b As with RI labeling of the actin region by anti D AKAP1 was dominant fig 3a 3c Because the labeling patterns for RI and D AKAP1 appear similar in the muscle fibers and at the postsynaptic membrane D AKAP1 may anchor RI in these regions which further supports the cloning and biochemical evidence of interaction between these proteins 15 28 Phalloidin was used as a positive control for the actin region of muscle fibers fig 3c The no primary control was clean fig 3d Because the antibodies to D AKAP1 and RI were produced in rabbit and mouse respectively double labeling confocal experiments could be performed with these antibodies on the same tissue slice in order to test for colocalization The same applies for anti RII and anti RII We found that the labeling patterns for these two antibodies in muscle tissue counterstained with bungarotoxin and anti D AKAP1 data not shown was not modified from that found when counterstained with bungarotoxin and a mitochondrial marker see below indicating partial colocalization of D AKAP1 with RII but little if any overlap with RII In contrast the RI labeling was invariably almost completely abolished when counterstained with bungarotoxin and anti D AKAP1 in multiple experiments data not shown This suggests to us that anti D AKAP1 may be occluding RI bound to D AKAP1 to the extent that anti RI has little access to its antigen As shown in figure 4 RII is found in the postsynaptic region of the NMJ and did not precisely overlap with the bungarotoxin label but instead encompassed a broader area of this region RII immunoreactivity appeared to be punctate in the cytosol yet contrasted with the punctate distribution of mitochondria The presence of labeling at the NMJ is consistent with the prevalence of RII in neuronal tissue 27 The lack of staining in the muscle fibers is in agreement with the report that RII did not show significant hybridization with skeletal muscle 19 Triple labeling immunofluorescent staining patterns fig 5 suggests that RII is concentrated in the postsynaptic vicinity of the NMJ but is not colocalized with the nAChR RII immunoreactivity exhibited significant overlap with mitochondria in the postsynaptic region of the NMJ and with mitochondria in skeletal muscle fibers Labeling of the I band was dominant Interestingly intense immunoreactivity was found to be consistently localized with the z line Of the 7 kinase and AKAP labeling patterns shown in this paper RII is the only one that strongly associates with the z line contrast with the phalloidin labeling shown in fig 2c The labeling pattern of D AKAP2 fig 6 differs from that of D AKAP1 Even though the striated labeling in the muscle fibers appears similar to the striations noted for D AKAP1 and RI and is where actin is prevalent the overlap with the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c is poor in contrast with observations of close overlap in cells 29 In the NMJ the D AKAP2 pattern is rather diffuse being present in both postsynaptic and presynaptic vicinities and appears dissimilar to the mitochondrial pattern Intense PKC immunoreactivity was found in both postsynaptic and presynaptic regions fig 7 consistent with enhanced PKC and PKC labeling in the NMJ 24 Over a background of more diffuse staining two stronger bands can be observed One band codistributes with nAChR The other band is in the presynaptic region and parallels the nAChR band In addition to these bands there is strong immunoreactivity in other areas of the presynapse The labeling pattern of PKC is sufficiently different from that of the mitochondrial label to indicate that there is no association with this organelle in either the NMJ or muscle fibers PKC labeling in the muscle fibers is faint which corroborates the report that PKC and PKC are the predominant PKC isoforms in skeletal muscle 24 with PKC being more abundant in the membrane fraction of muscle and PKC being more abundant in the cytosolic fraction As with PKC gravin codistributes with nAChR fig 8 Immunoreactivity is predominantly in the postsynaptic region and doesn t overlap particularly well with the mitochondrial marker The strongest labeling is at the plasma membrane This labeling is consistent with the report that gravin possesses several targeting motifs that direct it to the membrane cytoskeleton 13 In the muscle fibers striations of staining are noticeable Even though there is partial overlap of these striations with those typical of mitochondria labeled with cytochrome c the staining occurs where actin is prevalent Because gravin has a putative actin binding domain it is likely that the association is with actin Tables 1and 2summarize the compartmental localization and mitochondrial association in the NMJ and intercostal muscle of the several AKAPs and kinases studied based on the immunofluorescence work reported here Discussion The work presented here adds to the emerging evidence that PKA and PKC signaling at the NMJ and adjacent intercostal muscle is compartmentalized Differential compartmentation of these signaling molecules in cells and tissues is being recognized as a mechanism to regulate their specificity reviewed recently by 6 A Kinase Anchoring Proteins AKAPs can direct their subcellular localization by binding directly to regulatory subunits of PKA or to the catalytic core of PKC Many AKAPs have been identified although information about their subcellular distribution in different tissues is largely lacking Because we produced antibodies to two novel dual specific AKAPs D AKAP1 and D AKAP2 and gravin we were uniquely positioned to use immunofluorescence to investigate their possible roles in kinase signaling in and around the NMJ Our interest in PKA and PKC activity in the NMJ derives from 1 a report that RI not only is enriched there but also appears to be tethered to the postsynaptic membrane 19 2 the rich literature describing selective PKC isoform activity and functional compartmentalization in the NMJ and skeletal muscle 3 our discoveries that D AKAP1 and D AKAP2 bind to and appear to colocalize with RI and often mitochondria 15 16 28 and 4 our finding that gravin binds to both PKA and PKC 13 We found that D AKAP1 appears to colocalize with RI at the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJ which houses the nAChR but not in the presynaptic region This observation is supported by previous work that demonstrated RI codistribution with nAChR 19 and D AKAP1 17 suggesting that this AKAP is the anchoring protein recruiting RI to this membrane This putative association is strengthened by finding for the first time that targeting of RI requires the AKAP binding surface 17 Yotiao is another AKAP enriched at the NMJ but appears to bind only RII 30 PKA phosphorylates the nAChR when stimulated at the synapse by the neuropeptide CGRP and by adenosine from muscle responding to acetylcholine reviewed by 31 This phosphorylation may regulate the degradation of the nAChR 32 Consistent with the action at the presynapse it was shown that PKA facilitation of acetylcholine release is dependent on nerve endplate calcium concentration 33 Based on our observation of colocalization with synaptophysin at presynaptic vesicles RI may be the isotype that influences this release of neurotransmitter We found that RI occupies the same region as mitochondria in intercostal muscle The presence of RI in soleus muscle was shown with Western blots by Hoover and coworkers 18 but was not seen with immunofluorescence of tibialis anterior muscle 17 19 Reinitz and coworkers 34 provided evidence suggesting that RI associates with membrane fractions in cardiac muscle when it is not associated with the catalytic subunit The same may be true for intercostal muscle in which case association with the sarcolemma mitochondria or other organelles is possible Furthermore RI was shown to bind to cytochrome c oxidase subunit Vb a mitochondrial inner membrane protein which faces the matrix in a cAMP dependent manner 35 How RI passes across the mitochondrial inner membrane is not known Previously we observed that D AKAP1 mRNA and protein expressions are high in muscle 15 In situ hybridization showed consistency of D AKAP1 and RI staining in tongue muscle indicating that in vitro association can indeed predict in situ interaction for these molecules Consistent with the observed mitochondrial staining by anti D AKAP1 it was shown previously that one of the two alternative NH2 terminal motifs of this AKAP is necessary and sufficient for targeting to mitochondria 28 Interestingly another AKAP governs voltage dependent potentiation of L type calcium channels through anchoring of PKA in transverse tubules 36 Because this potentiation is not dependent on RII it is thought that RI is capable of this AKAP directed modulation of calcium channel activity 37 The labeling pattern of D AKAP2 is diffuse in the NMJ yet localized to the actin region in muscle In our previous immunofluorescence work examining D AKAP2 subcellular localization the protein displayed a diffuse background in addition to mitochondrial staining 29 It was thought that the combination of specific and diffuse labeling indicated the presence of more than one pool of D AKAP2 inside the cells examined Whereas D AKAP1 appears to colocalize with mitochondria in muscle fibers D AKAP2 shows no such association This observation is not surprising because it is not expected that their targets need to be in the same organelle or even subcellular region Whether D AKAP2 binds specifically to actin remains to be determined RII localized quite well to mitochondria in both NMJ and muscle regions PKA association with mitochondria has been well documented 38 39 40 41 42 In mammalian sperm it was found that nearly all RII specific labeling was with mitochondria 43 Furthermore in bovine heart PKA activity was detected in the matrix or the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane 44 45 However the work of Halestrap and coworkers provided little evidence for intramitochondrial protein phosphorylation by PKA but gave some evidence for outer membrane phosphorylation both integral and loosely bound proteins 46 47 48 The localization of RII to the postsynaptic region beyond the postsynaptic membrane is consistent with part of the immunostaining of NMJs in the soleus muscle 18 yet differs in part because there is no overlap with the bungarotoxin label however this is in agreement with another study 17 PKC colocalizes with gravin at the postsynaptic membrane where the gravin staining is strongest PKC has been suggested to play a role in synapse stability and signal transduction at the NMJ 24 When calcium influx through the nAChR occurs acetylcholine appears to activate PKC phosphorylation of this receptor reviewed by 31 Phorbol ester activation of PKC causes loss of synapses and nAChR 49 Because the presynaptic PKC fluorescence band parallels the nAChR band see fig 7 it may be labeling the presynaptic membrane consistent with reports of PKC localization to the presynaptic terminals of NMJs 22 23 PKC initially associates with the cytoskeleton 50 Phosphorylation at two places on the kinase core is required first to activate PKC and second to release it from its cytoskeletal anchorage Our immunofluorescence results may be the visualization of two pools of PKC The observed bands may represent kinase anchored directly to the cytoskeleton perhaps on the presynaptic side where little gravin staining was found or anchored to gravin perhaps on the postsynaptic side The more diffuse staining found in both pre and postsynaptic regions may represent released hence activated kinase As with PKC gravin was seen to be directed to the postsynaptic membrane Strong labeling was also seen at the plasma membrane cytoskeleton see fig 8 consistent with the report of Nauert and coworkers 13 Interestingly a homology search of a database revealed a MARCKS homology actin binding domain in gravin In addition to acting as a scaffolding protein for kinases and phosphatases gravin forms a dynamic complex with beta adrenergic receptors 51 The same report also showed that the association of beta adrenergic receptors with PKA could be blocked by the Ht31 peptide which blocks AKAP kinase binding In addition to a PKC binding site gravin contains a PKA binding site Hence the beta adrenergic receptor may be tethered to PKA via gravin PKC may bind to this anchoring protein through displacement of the pseudosubstrate thus inhibiting the kinase activity by analogy with a functionally similar scaffolding AKAP AKAP79 52 Conclusions The distinctive labeling patterns of each of the seven kinase and anchoring antibodies investigated argues for the existence of microdomains of signaling pathways It appears that several AKAPs may be in close proximity yet it still needs to be determined if waves of cAMP would turn on signals in a local or global way Moreover the signals that cells in tissues receive from the surrounding matrix may provide a different micro environment of kinase anchoring from that of cultured cells An example is the association of D AKAP2 with mitochondria in cultured myocytes 29 that is not present in muscle tissue fig 6 Materials and Methods
