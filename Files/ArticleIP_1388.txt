was drunk and speeding and that he ran a stop sign In New York Russian and Belarussian diplomats reportedly resisted police who were trying to ticket their car because it was parked at a fire hydrant police said the diplomats appeared to be drunk New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani demanded their expulsion and denounced the Russians as scofflaws noting that their U N mission had accumulated 14 437

system One faction favors letting individuals manage their own investment accounts another favors leaving the stock picking to the government a third would set up individual accounts but would fund them separately through a payroll tax hike Conservatives hailed the rough consensus on stock investment as a paradigm shift while critics warned of leeching by Wall Street brokers and asked whether
