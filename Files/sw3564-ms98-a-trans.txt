        hello Jim      uh in Austin Texas   oh one of my favorite towns im im in Houston      in Houston uh   yeah   so we probably been having relatively similar weather   yeah probably although i would imagine that ive had uh  uh   yeah uh although recently its been fairly fairly humid uh   some warmer weather and and more humidity than  i think thats typically a little drier out there has it really   yeah we   yeah Austin is a uh actually i have my uh my brother and sisterinlaw live in Austin and it is one of my favorite locations its just i i think its beautiful   umhum yeah its nice today i i   how long have you lived there   uh i guess about a little less than five years now   yeah practically a native   we have lots of non native Texans   yeah       uh how hot does it get there in the summer time   oh it it varies i mean occasionally it it it gets up over a hundred but its not uh thats not really well i dont know i was going to say it wasnt not typical but i guess there is quite a phase this quite a period this summer that is was a hundred it stayed over a hundred uh it mid to high nineties its its fairly typical uh Houston doesnt get quite as hot actually because the humidity   yeah yeah yeah thats correct i mean being i think being a little closer to the uh  to the gulf we it has a moderating factor but again what we what we lack in the heat we make up for in the humidity i lived in Dallas for six years   and the ocean the gulf yeah umhum the humidity   yeah uhhuh   before uh i was transfered  down to Houston in uh nineteen ninety and uh  Dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i  you know Houston can get just as uncomfortable   right yeah well i   but for some reason and and i guess its uh not having just the extreme heat i mean we had uh one one year we had in in Dallas uh a week or more where it never got below of that eighty two or eighty three degrees at night and then over a hundred every day and that got to be awfully oppressive   yeah well i im originally from Kansas and and uh south west Kansas which is extremely dry and its the opposite but but i mean that real serene heat   yeah   and uh and and and very cold in the winter uh but   yeah   the last summer that i lived there i guess it was the last summer yeah i believe so the last summer that i lived there it we had a streak of something like thirty eight days in a row over a hundred degrees       uh it just absolutely sounds absurd and one day it it it actually hit one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade   you know you know it makes you wonder how anyone ever lived before air conditioning   oh i know i know well well thats uh   uh how much snow did you get in Kansas   oh well well that same year thats when thats when i finally left is that  that same year we had this incredible cold spell and and i uh i uh       oh i mean it was like uh you know thirty degrees below zero   no   yeah and and and i you know i had just bought a little MGB that i was going to fix up and you know sand it down and get it all fixed up and i and i had never bothered to check the antifreeze in it   yeah oh no   and uh you know here is this freezing day and i got my heaters up full blast trying to stay warm and and the uh uh and all of the sudden it dawns me i mean its like  one O clock in the morning oh i wonder if the cars got any antifreeze in it  and of course it didnt uh   oh no   you know and so so i you know i tried to jump start it i couldnt get it in it still i mean had some it was slushing and uh i tried to start it i tried to jump start it i couldnt it didnt have a jumper cable ran to the store and by the time i got back it had frozen out   yeah oh no   ran back to the store got a can of sterno and you know was doing all kinds of stuff put blankets on the top of it i babied it all night it was fun   did you did you uh keep it going   it actually i mean the box froze but it didnt it didnt crack anything and i uh i left it for a couple of days and we  called the tow truck and we hauled it over to a friends garage put heaters on it   yeah   warmed it up and i didnt keep it much longer after that but  but it it did uh   yeah yeah   and after that i decided i was going to go live some place where it was warm   well i have never lived anywhere uh  well the farthest north ive ever lived is Raleigh North Carolina which is certainly you know not your ice and snow country       uh and it got you know reasonably cold up there in the in the winter time but i have never lived anywhere where i really had to battle snow and uh i dont think i want to   yeah well its kind you know i i finally decided that snow is kind of a neat thing to visit uh you know when you when you felt some ice cold all white white Christmas and some things like that its a nice thing to go visit but its not something that i want to live in day in and day out   yeah i had some i had some friends who lived in uh  New Hampshire for a couple of years and then they moved back south because they said you know it just  prospect of every morning having to get out shovel the driveway to get out and then shovel the driveway to get back in the morning and shovel it again the next morning they said it just got to be too much       well you actually get kind of get used to it after a while i mean and and and in the cold really it doesnt get at you that much because you you of course you learn how to dress well and the houses are well insulated and stuff   yeah yeah   i actually i i moved from there to New Orleans and and
