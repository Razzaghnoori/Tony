that bushy white beard Mall Santas now must keep their hands visible and touch kids only in safe zones At least one mall has banned Santa from touching children at all Tots did get to hand Santa their wish lists but through a mail slot It doesn t help Kris Kringle s cause that a 71 year old mall Santa Claus in Washington state recently pleaded guilty to raping and molesting four children between the ages of 1 and 7 The mall Santa s real name is no joke Ronald McDonald Animal rights groups want to get rid of Santa s reindeer Pressure from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals forced the National Park Service to remove reindeer from their annual Mall Christmas pageant Fundamentalist Christians want to get rid of Santa himself He overshadows Jesus and profanes a sacred holiday In Holland one of St Nick s favorite countries he s been assaulted by teen agers on the street and denounced by feminists In Japan a department store recently stumbled into the yuletide spirit by displaying Santa Claus nailed to a crucifix Why mall Santas can t even say ho ho ho anymore It frightens youngsters Santa in short is in trouble Any day you can expect to hear that fringe right conspiracists have implicated him in the New World Order Look he sees you when you re sleeping He knows when you re awake He knows when you ve been bad or good And he s got a list with the name of every child in the world Tell me that s not suspicious Santa needs a makeover It wouldn t be his first one Santa Claus is one of America s grandest fabrications He is as Stephen Nissenbaum puts it in his excellent The Battle for Christmas an invented tradition In America s early years Christmas was a rowdy affair Manhattan s poor and working class folk ran wild through the streets and invaded the homes of the wealthy So in the early 19 th century a group of rich New Yorkers took it upon themselves to domesticate Christmas Their chief accomplishment Clement Moore s A Visit from St Nicholas the 1822 poem that introduced Americans to Santa Claus of course you know it Twas the night before Christmas Moore took an arcane European tradition and neatly transformed it into an American one St Nicholas was a real saint a 4 th century bishop from Asia Minor famed for his generosity The Dutch celebrated St Nicholas on Dec 6 On that day he visited homes and left gifts for children by the fireplace The Dutch St Nicholas was an ambivalent figure He was lean and solemn and he gave bad children birch rods Moore moved St Nick s visits to Christmas Eve equipped him with a beer belly a sleigh and eight reindeer and dropped Sinter Klaas darker side Moore s poem Nissenbaum writes was intended to help turn Christmas from a public to a private holiday to make it an event that rich and poor families would celebrate around their fireplaces And it worked By the mid 19 th century Santa Claus and the domestic Christmas were embedded in the American psyche Over the decades the Santa myth grew by accretion adding layer after layer of sweet detail In the mid 19 th century Thomas Nast s drawings defined Santa as fat jolly bearded and red suited At the same time Santa s home moved from Europe to the North Pole Mrs Claus appeared in 1899 In 1939 a copywriter for Montgomery Ward added Rudolph to the reindeer pack The store distributed 2 4 million copies of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer that year and another 3 5 million when it reissued the story seven years later Santa of course was a commercial figure from the beginning Store owners appropriated his picture for ads and posters Throughout the 19 th century and for most of this century Santa was both beloved and respected America repelled every effort to knock him off the pantheon In 1897 for example a girl named Virginia O Hanlon wrote a letter to the New York Sun Her friends had told her that Santa Claus didn t exist The Sun replied with one of the most famous editorials in American history Virginia your little friends are wrong They have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age Yes Virginia there is a Santa Claus He exists as certainly as love and generosity and devotion exist This year marks the centennial of Yes Virginia and the editorial has been much reprinted In the 20s and 30s U S judges even issued court rulings affirming Santa Claus existence But we have been affected by the skepticism of a skeptical age Or perhaps it s the irony of an ironical age Santa hasn t disappeared but he s been made ridiculous The assault by fundamentalists Hollywood and paranoid parents has taken its toll His public image has degraded Our Santa is unappetizing a mall pedophile or a fat buffoon There should and can be another kind of Santa for the 90s In an age that valorizes family and capitalism Santa should be recognized as a champion of both He has been married to the same woman for 98 years He operates a fabulously successful toy factory It has a package delivery system that makes Federal Express look like the Pony Express Long before the Americans with Disabilities Act Santa staffed his factory with undersized elves Santa is a role model for our ambitious children the perfect benevolent tycoon Santa works all year round then gives away everything he made This should be the Santa for our time a Soros of the North Pole Santa the philanthropist
