 Our Last Cigarette The earliest smoking song I ve ever come across is Tobacco s But an Indian Weed from the late 1600s which seems a bit slow off the mark Sir Walter Raleigh had brought the first tobacco leaves back from the colonies to Queen Elizabeth almost a century earlier On the other hand he also brought back the potato and how many great potato songs had anybody written by then But sooner or later everything winds up in the ashtray of history and 300 years after that first entry it seems almost certain that the Cigarette Songbook has no new leaves to turn over For that reason alone kd lang s Drag will prove a useful anthropological document rounding up as it does some of the smokiest songs of the century from Smoke Rings the old theme of Glen Gray and the Casa Loma Orchestra from the 1930s to Steve Miller s 70s rocker The Joker I m a smoker I m a midnight toker The first thing to be said is that Miss lang or maybe it s miss lang lives up to her title Drag is a deep languorous inhalation Its orchestrations especially David Tom s guitar loops are as near as anyone s ever come to the sensation of smoking even if by the time she gets halfway through the Hollies The Air That I Breathe click to hear it Peace came upon me And it lee ee ee eaves me weak she seems to be unwinding from a heavy night at the opium den rather than down to her last Marlboro Light The second thing to be said is that Drag is a pun On the cover lang is wearing pinstripes and a ruby cravat like Oscar Wilde heading out clubbing It s as much about sexual role play and smoking as a metaphor for love every popular singer s real addiction If any male vocalist is looking for an equally adroit album title encompassing both cigarettes and sexuality may I suggest at least for those versed in the divergences of British and American slang Fag Incidentally Wilde in The Picture of Dorian Gray writes A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure It is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied What more can one want This would seem to be kd s view of love an addiction that must inevitably disappoint In a way it s the album she s been working up to for years She s covered I m Down to My Last Cigarette and Three Cigarettes in an Ashtray and best of all Black Coffee click to hear it a smoldering Peggy Lee favorite that climaxes Now man was born to go a lovin But was woman born to weep and fret And stay at home and tend her ovenAnd drown her past regretsIn coffee and cigarettes I m moanin all the mornin Moanin all the nightAnd in between It s nicotine You get the idea That by the way is the first use of nicotine in a Tin Pan Alley lyric lang s best known original song Constant Craving speaks for itself Her best written song Miss Chatelaine from the CD Ingenue is about love as an exhilarating high and the next track on that album begins You swim through my veins Artistically speaking kd lang is addicted to addiction She s not the first of course Harry Warren and Al Dubin covered most of the bases in a song for 42 nd Street in 1933 italics mine Ev ry kiss ev ry hug Seems to act just like a drug You re getting to be a habit with me Let me stay in your arms I m addicted to your charms You re getting to be a habit with me I used to think your love was something that I Could take or leave alone But now I couldn t live without my supply Only in the final eight bars do the writers pull any punches I must have you ev ry day As regularly as coffee or tea Tea You mean after all that we re talking about hot beverages here Well probably Coffee s addictive so are reefer Cab Calloway Fats Waller and coke Cole Porter I get no kick from cocaine But in most pop songs cigarettes are merely a stylish accessory The best example of stylish smoke comes at the opening of one of the most recorded songs ever Eric Maschwitz a BBC radio producer moonlighting under the name Holt Marvell wrote the lyric as an attempt to come up with his own You re the Top like laundry list As it happens I think he improved on the original His is one of the most quoted lines in all popular music A cigarette that bears a lipstick s tracesAn airline ticket to romantic placesAnd still my heart has wingsThese foolish things Remind me of you In the cold light of day it s an image that s as likely to make you feel icky as nostalgic a half smoked fag with some cheesy lip gloss on it But set to those notes it s a fine example of the transformational properties of music the perfect opening for Maschwitz s rueful accumulation of sophisticated memory joggers wild strawberries only seven francs a kilo the waiters whistling as the last bar closes and so on Since then the singing cigarette has dwindled away to isolated outposts of adolescent rock like Smokin in the Boys Room One of the consequences for an album like Drag is that the most innocuous songs now paradoxically pack more of a punch than ostensibly more searing stuff like My Old Addiction kd lang is never more brazen than when dusting off Smoke Rings click to hear it from 1932 Puff Puff Puff Puff your cares awayPuff Puff Puff Night and day lang s great quality is that she can pull off even the most anachronistic trifle without patronizing it The songs emerge as charming and dated yet somehow contemporary Her approach which she s used consistently since recording Cole Porter s So in Love seven years ago is to honor the broad parameters of the original layout tempo arrangement while using pared down guitar based rock orchestrations The only surprise is that more singers haven t picked up on it I d be interested to see if you could apply that technique and the arrangements to older material such as Victor Herbert s 1905 nod to Kipling A Woman Is Only a Woman But a Good Cigar Is a Smoke though that s probably an unlikely sentiment for kd lang Still it s these older songs that seem the correct assessment Smoking is a consolation for the vicissitudes of life a prop for losers That s how Sinatra s been using cigarettes for 60 years dimming the lights and getting them out for Angel Eyes or One for My Baby sad songs for guys with nothing to do but drown their sorrows It s a persona that found its apotheosis in 1981 on the cover of She Shot Me Down his darkest album Sinatra hunched in a leather jacket wreathed in smoke It s not an image the tobacco companies care for When a British company back in the 60s tried the saloon singer approach in a TV ad with a moody reflective loner and the tag line You re never alone with a Strand it wound up putting itself out of business The Joe Camel approach is unlikely to produce any decent songs but it undoubtedly sells more cigarettes Whatever happens to tobacco sales under the new settlement between the states and the tobacco companies or more accurately between the tobacco lobbyists and some enterprising tort lawyers it s bound to result in the further withdrawal of cigarettes from the mainstream of popular culture including songs That being the case maybe like the fatalistic protagonist of the 1908 operetta Algeria we should light up one last time Fragrant clouds then from us veilEv ry sorrow ev ry doubtTill we wake at last to findThat our cigarette is out
