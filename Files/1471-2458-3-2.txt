                    Background        Since human infection with         Cryptosporidium parvum was first        documented in      this protozoan parasite has been        recognized worldwide as a major cause of diarrheal disease        in humans     In healthy immunocompetent persons         C parvum causes a selflimited        diarrheal illness cryptosporidiosis however in persons        with severe immunosuppression particularly those infected        with the human immunodeficiency virus HIV and who have        developed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS the        diarrhea can be prolonged severe and lifethreatening             Currently there are no effective chemotherapeutic        agents against cryptosporidiosis             Cryptosporidium oocysts are found in        the feces of infected humans livestock and wild animals            Humans acquire the infection through persontoperson        or animaltoperson contact ingestion of        fecallycontaminated water or food or contact with        fecallycontaminated environmental surfaces                    Cryptosporidium oocysts have an        ubiquitous geographic distribution and can be detected in        most surface drinking water sources     The oocysts are        resistant to environmental degradation     survive        chlorination water treatment and are too small  to         microns to be removed by conventional water filters            Risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis have been        determined primarily in studies of communitywide        outbreaks and drinking water has been implicated as the        source of these outbreaks                 Casecontrol studies in AIDS patients have also been        conducted during outbreaks      but levels of        endemic risk in the United States remain uncertain even        though there is great concern for diarrheal disease        associated with drinking water in this population             Because defining the risk associated with drinking tap        water is particularly important for counseling        immunocompromised patients on reducing their risk of        cryptosporidiosis we conducted a casecontrol study among        persons with AIDS in San Francisco to test the hypothesis        that the pattern of tap water consumption is associated        with the development of endemic cryptosporidiosis                    Methods                  Study design          We conducted a matched casecontrol study Among          patients reported to the San Francisco AIDS Registry from          May  through September  we compared patients who          developed cryptosporidiosis to those who did not We          evaluated the hypothesis that cryptosporidiosis among          AIDS patients would be associated with the pattern of tap          water consumption after adjusting for potential          confounders in a multivariable conditional logistic          regression model The study was not designed to assess          whether point of use filtering boiling or other tap          water processing among tap water consumers was          protective Therefore for this study tap water was          defined as municipal water from the faucet whether or not          it was filtered boiled or processed further          The Committee on Human Research and the Biosafety          Committee of the University of California at San          Francisco approved this study protocol                          Study subjects          The study population consisted of individuals with an          AIDSdefining diagnosis living in San Francisco          California The San Francisco Department of Public Health          SFDPH maintains a reporting system on cases of HIVAIDS          residing in San Francisco Records are regularly updated          with CD T lymphocyte count and diagnosis of conditions          associated with HIVAIDS such as cryptosporidiosis The          completeness of reporting AIDS cases in San Francisco has          been  overall  from hospitals  from clinics          and  from private physicians              A case was defined as a resident of San Francisco with          AIDS who was reported to the San Francisco Department of          Public Health with a laboratoryconfirmed positive stool          test for           Cryptosporidium parvum from May           through September  Cases could have          cryptosporidiosis diagnosed as an initial AIDSdefining          opportunistic infection or as a subsequent opportunistic          infection A control was defined as any resident of San          Francisco who was reported with AIDS to the San Francisco          Department of Public Health and did not have a          laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis For          cases and controls we collected information on date of          birth raceethnicity gender month and year of the          diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis all CD T lymphocyte          counts recorded and the date of each test For each case          we determined the CD count closest to the date of          cryptosporidiosis diagnosis          Cases and controls were matched based on five          criteria age within  years sex raceethnicity CD          T lymphocyte count   points and date of CD          count within  months of the cases CD count that was          closest to the date of diagnosis and date of case          diagnosis Controls who were participating in other          studies conducted by the San Francisco Department of          Public Health were not eligible for this study In          addition we excluded eligible controls who had a history          of psychiatric illness or psychosis Controls were tested          for subclinical disease by testing stool for           Cryptosporidium  Three documented          negative stool samples defined a potential control for          this study No potential controls were positive on stool          testing One to three controls were matched to each          case          The primary health care providers of the cases and          controls were asked for permission to solicit the          participation of their patients in this study Cases and          controls were initially contacted by phone at home          between  am and  pm If three calls were          unsuccessful up to two written solicitations were sent          The questionnaire was administered by telephone in          English or Spanish after verbal consent was obtained          Controls were sent a package containing stool collection          vials and instructions for collection and mailing of          samples Controls received a payment of  after SFDPH          received written consent Cases received a payment of           for participation in this study                          Exposure measurement          The questionnaire was designed to assess the relative          importance of several risk factors for cryptosporidiosis          in the recent past Cases were asked about water          exposures in the fourweek period before the onset of          diarrhea Controls were asked about water exposures in          the fourweek period before the interview The          interviewer requested information about sources of          exposure to water Respondents were asked whether they          always sometimes or never drank tap water inside and          outside the home such as workplace or restaurants They          were asked to reply yes or no to the use of tap water          for brushing teeth washing vegetables consuming          beverages containing ice made from tap water both inside          and outside the home Respondents were asked the type of          drinking water consumed while traveling outside San          Francisco whether they used hot tubs swam in lakes or          streams or had other recreational exposure in the four          weeks prior to diarrhea for cases or interview for          controls Our primary exposure variable was the pattern          of tap water consumption always sometimes never          whether or not the water was processed further          We asked about the pattern of bottled water          consumption inside and outside the home Responses to          cleaning vegetables with tap water yes no and          consumption of unpasteurized milk yes no were also          obtained Other sources of cryptosporidiosis infection          were assessed such as potential exposure to fecal          material from sexual behavior diapers patient care or          animals Subjects were asked about recent travel outside          of San Francisco          San Franciscos municipal water system distributes          water that is either filtered or unfiltered at the          treatment facilities The water distribution varies both          geographically and temporally depending on the          operational requirements of the water system          Respondents residential address was used to determine          whether  weeks prior to the cases illness their          residence received municipal water that was either          filtered mixed or unfiltered Addresses and interview          dates were provided to the San Francisco Public Utilities          Commission Water Quality Bureau to classify this          exposure This analysis was added after study completion          and was not a primary hypothesis                          Statistical analysis          For the sample size calculations we estimated that our          study would have required  cases and  controls to          detect an odds ratio of  with a Type I error of           and  power However because the number of cases          occurring decreased dramatically we extended our study          period to accrue more study subjects At the end of the          study we had  cases and  matched controls          Bivariate analyses of associations with          cryptosporidiosis infection were performed for water          exposure variables fecal exposure variables and other          possible exposures using conditional logistic regression          The matched odds ratios ORs and  confidence          intervals CIs are reported          Risk factors for cryptosporidiosis were determined a          priori Composite variables were developed for three          major exposure routes tap water bottled water fecal          matter For each we constructed three levels of          exposure lowest intermediate and highest For example          subjects who answered never to drinking tap water at          home and also answered never to drinking tap water          outside the home were categorized as lowest exposure          for the tap water composite variable Subjects who          responded always to both questions were classified as          highest exposure and a mixed response resulted in an          intermediate exposure classification A similar composite          variable was created from bottled water consumed at home          and outside the home A fecal exposure composite variable          was created from two questions sex partner with          diarrhea and touching anything soiled with feces or          helping someone with toileting If respondents answered          yes to having either exposure they were classified as          having been exposed to fecal material          A composite variable was created for recreational          water exposure ie exposure to pools lakes rivers          streams or oceans If respondents ingested water from          any of these bodies of water or submerged their heads          under the water then they were classified as having been          exposed to a recreational body of water that could have          put them at risk for cryptosporidiosis          To examine the independent association between the          pattern of tap water consumption and cryptosporidiosis          infection while adjusting for other potential sources of          cryptosporidial infection adjusted matched odds ratios          and  confidence intervals were calculated using          multivariable conditional logistic regression models                          Population attributable fraction          The population attributable fraction PAF is the          theoretical proportion of disease cases that would have          been prevented had a specific exposure never occurred          assuming the exposure is causal     We calculated          the proportion of cryptosporidiosis cases theoretically          attributable to various water exposures from the results          of the multivariable conditional logistic regression          models using PAF methods for casecontrol studies                       All analyses were conducted in SPlus     For one          bivariate analysis where cells contained zero unmatched          medianunbiased odds ratios and exact  confidence          intervals were calculated from the midp function as          described by Rothman                                Results        During the study period  cases from the AIDS

for recruitment and  individuals        refused The remaining  cases constituted the case        sample        Using pairwise matching criteria  eligible controls        were identified from the AIDS registry From these         individuals were not contacted because the primary care        provider did not grant permission  individuals moved out        of jurisdiction  was deceased  were ineligible  were        lost to followup  did not respond to repeated attempts        to be contacted  were not needed for the study because we        had a sufficient number of controls per case and         individuals refused The remaining  controls constituted        the control sample        The demographic characteristics of the cases and        controls are shown in Table  The study population        consisted of  cases each matched by date of case        diagnosis CD count age ethnicity and gender to  to         controls for a total of  controls Seventyeight percent        of

Compared to        never drinking tap water inside or outside the home        lowest exposure cryptosporidiosis was associated with        the intermediate exposure category of tap water consumption

sometimes drinking tap water and          reported always drinking tap water outside the home        The unadjusted matched odds ratios for the occurrence        of cryptosporidiosis according to exposure to nondrinking        water sources are shown in Table  Neither sexual        activity sex with a partner with diarrhea nor travel        outside of San Francisco were associated with the        development of cryptosporidiosis Sex with a partner with        diarrhea had an elevated but not statistically        significant measure of association with cryptosporidiosis        OR   CI  Having touched anything        soiled with feces or helping someone with toileting were        not associated with cryptosporidiosis        Two multivariable conditional logistic regression models        are shown in Table  Model  tested the hypothesis of        whether the pattern of tap water consumption inside the        home and outside the home were separately associated with        cryptosporidiosis after adjusting for potential exposure to        fecal material had sex with partner who had diarrhea        cared for person with diarrhea or touched something soiled        with feces from person with diarrhea and living in a        residence supplied with filtered or unfiltered municipal        water In this model the pattern of tap water consumption        inside the home was associated with cryptosporidiosis        sometimes category OR   CI  always        category OR   CI  as was the pattern        of tap water consumption outside the home always category        OR   CI  In model  the overall        pattern of tap water consumption was strongly associated        with cryptosporidiosis with a doseresponse relationship        intermediate exposure OR   CI         highest exposure OR   CI  In both        models cryptosporidiosis was not associated with whether        the residence was supplied with filtered or unfiltered        municipal tap water        Assuming a causal relationship between tap water        consumption and the development of cryptosporidiosis in        persons with AIDS the PAF was  that is the proportion        of cases in San Francisco AIDS patients attributable to tap        water consumption could have been as high as  The PAF        from other potential factors such as exposure to feces or        living at a residence supplied with unfiltered water was        below                     Discussion        This is the first populationbased casecontrol study        enrolling incident cases of cryptosporidiosis to evaluate        and detect a strong association between an increasing        pattern of tap water consumption and the development of        cryptosporidiosis among AIDS patients in the United States        Prior studies of cryptosporidiosis in the US among AIDS        patients did not interview incident cases and therefore        often did not have information on individuallevel        waterborne exposures        We also detected a        strong negative association between the pattern of always        drinking bottled water at home and cryptosporidiosis This        can be explained by the finding that persons who reported        always drinking bottled water rarely drank tap water        Additionally this result suggests drinking bottled water        may be a safer alternative to drinking tap water        San Franciscos municipal water is derived from several        sources Some of these sources filter the water before        distribution to city residences     No waterborne        outbreak of cryptosporidiosis has ever been detected This        study did not find an association between developing        cryptosporidiosis and living in a residence that received        filtered compared to unfiltered water even after adjusting        for the pattern of tap water consumption Table         Although this result is consistent with a previous ecologic        study     suggesting that filtering at the level of a        municipal system may not be successful in decreasing cases        of cryptosporidiosis this negative finding must be viewed        with caution since our study was not specifically designed        nor statistically powered to assess this exposure        Because this was an observational study our results do        not prove that tap water was the source of cryptosporidial        infection However the doseresponse relationship between        the pattern of tap water consumption and cryptosporidiosis        makes a causal relationship more likely Nonetheless it is        possible that residual confounding due to measured or        unmeasured factors may explain the results However        statistical adjustment for known confounders did not weaken        the association between the pattern of tap water        consumption and cryptosporidiosis The strength of this        association would require that unknown or unmeasured        confounders have very strong effects     which is        unlikely given that adjustment for the likely confounders        did not change our results        We also considered the possibility that our finding is        due to bias from cases having differential recall of        specific water exposures However during this period there        was a general awareness in the AIDS community of tap water        as a potential source of cryptosporidial infection            We believe this prior awareness would have influenced the        recall of both cases and controls thereby reducing any        differential recall Also there does not appear to be        differential recall with respect to sexual and other        potential fecal exposures Therefore we believe that even        if such a recall bias was operating it would not account        for the large association we detected        Other routes of fecal contamination were not associated        with cryptosporidiosis in the bivariate and multivariable        analyses Sex with a partner with diarrhea was moderately        associated in the bivariate analysis OR  but was not        statistically significant Because the incubation period        between exposure to         Cryptosporidium oocysts and symptoms        is not well understood in persons with AIDS it is possible        that contact with fecal material which occurred long before        the incident diagnosis might be the source of these        infections In favor of this hypothesis is the observation        that cryptosporidiosis is more common among gay and        bisexual men with AIDS than among other groups with AIDS            Nonetheless prior sexual practices are unlikely to        be associated with current water consumption patterns                   The methods we used to calculate the attributable        fractions depend on two assumptions the incidence of        disease in the base population is sufficiently small so        that the odds ratio provides a satisfactory estimate of the        relative risk and the cases in this study are        representative of all cases in the population thus        allowing us to calculate the proportion of cases in each        stratum of exposure categories     The annual risk of        a cryptosporidiosis diagnosis among AIDS patients during        this study period was less than       sufficiently        low so that the odds ratio approximates the relative risk        The study base population the San Francisco AIDS registry        is representative of AIDS cases in San Francisco                   There were several limitations to this study First the        annual number of cryptosporidiosis cases dropped        dramatically during the study period resulting in a much        smaller study population than initially planned The number        of cryptosporidiosis cases decreased annually  cases        were reported in   in   in  and  in             In the year  only  cases of        cryptosporidiosis were recorded in the AIDS Registry            Because of the small study size our ability to more        precisely calculate matched adjusted odds ratios for the        multivariable model were limited However for our primary        hypothesis the association of the pattern of tap water        consumption and cryptosporidiosis the sample size was        sufficient to detect the observed large and statistically        significant doseresponse relationship Second cases were        asked about potential exposures in the four weeks prior to        their illness onset whereas controls whose stools tested        negative for         Cryptosporidium  were asked about        potential exposures in the four weeks prior to their        interview Because of the lag time between selecting a        eligible control and interviewing them an intercurrent        illness could have caused them to lower or increase their        tap water consumption in the four weeks prior to their        interview thereby inflating or deflating the association        the between the pattern of tap water consumption and        cryptosporidiosis        Third when this study was designed the use of highly        active antiretroviral therapy HAART was uncommon about         and this information was not collected on subjects        however from  to  the use of HAART increased from         to  among persons living with AIDS in San Francisco            Although cases and controls were matched on CD T        lymphocyte count the exposure to HAART may have been a        potential confounder if this exposure was protective        against cryptosporidiosis independent of CD count and if        HAART exposure was correlated with decreased tap water        consumption Fourth we did not actually measure tap water        consumption but rather we asked about the pattern of use        never sometimes always in the four weeks preceding        illness cases or interview controls This assumes that        these pattern of use categories have the same meaning to        cases and controls with respect to quantity of water        consumed which may not be the true        Finally our matched casecontrol study was designed to        assess the firstlevel effect of tap water exposure and not        the effect of boiling or filtering although this        information was collected from subjects that answered yes        to consuming tap water To assess the effects of filtering        or boiling would require a casecontrol analysis among only        those that consumed tap water this was not possible with        the pairwise matching and small study size Additionally        our study underestimates the association between the        pattern of tap water consumption and cryptosporidiosis        because among those that consumed tap water some of them        also filtered or boiled their tap water which would have        mitigated the risk of tap water exposure Among those that        consumed tap water at home sometimes or always          of cases and   of controls   of cases        and   of controls filtered their water sometimes        or always and   of cases and   of        controls boiled their water sometimes or always        In spite of its limitations our study suggests that the        relative risk of cryptosporidiosis among AIDS patients from        drinking tap water is high adjusted OR  for highest        exposure category A similar study conducted among        immunocompetent persons in the same geographic region found        that cryptosporidiosis was only associated with foreign        travel but not tap water consumption     This        discordance in results supports the observation that host        susceptibility ie immune status is the primary        determinant of developing cryptosporidiosis among AIDS        patients Because the relative importance of the risk        factors for cryptosporidiosis is different among        immunocompetent and immunocompromised persons in the San        Francisco Bay Area public health prevention messages to        the two groups must be tailored accordingly                    Conclusions        The public health significance of our study ie a        population attributable fraction of  is noteworthy        especially since there are no effective chemotherapeutic        agents against cryptosporidiosis     The only effective        way to combat cryptosporidiosis among AIDS patients is        treatment with HAART    because this raises CD T        lymphocyte count and AIDS patients with CD counts over         cellsml are better able to resist cryptosporidial        infection     Although our results cannot be        considered definitive until there is more data we would        recommend persons with AIDS in the San Francisco area        especially those with compromised immune systems avoid tap        water AIDS patients in other geographic areas may consider        avoiding tap water This is consistent with current Centers        for Disease Control and Prevention CDC prevention        Guidelines that for a nonoutbreak setting people with        HIV disease may consider tap water avoidance or boiling        water prior to drinking to reduce the risk of infection        with         Cryptosporidium     Whether it        would be better to drink boiled water or bottled water is        unknown at this time although our results suggest that        appropriately bottled water may be effective Prevention of        infection either by avoidance of risky exposures or by        improving immune function or both is critical in this        vulnerable population                    Competing interests        None declared
