 Movies Volcano 20 th Century Fox The backlash against natural disaster movies shifts into high gear Despite Volcano s superior special effects critics deem it inferior to the last volcano movie Dante s Peak Problems 1 The plot or the lack thereof Without special effects as the main attraction there would be no movie here at all writes the New York Times Janet Maslin 2 Overacting by stars Tommy Lee Jones and Anne Heche in lieu of actual roles to play 3 A volcano that is both implausible and boring Volcano is a movie without a villain or a mystery The volcano has no quirks of personality because it has no personality Defeating it is a breeze because it is dumb mechanical and predictable David Plotz Slate Also see the official Volcano page Romy and Michele s High School Reunion Buena Vista Pictures Classic chick flick or a bad Bill Ted knockoff The New York Times Maslin says that Mira Sorvino Mighty Aphrodite and Lisa Kudrow Friends in their roles as bimbettes avenging the wrongs of high school elevat e bubble headedness to new levels of comic ingenuity The Washington Post s Desson Howe calls the film a sublime comedy about bitchiness and oneupwomanship But Variety s Todd

stripe critics agree that the former labor secretary s self deprecating style he makes a lot of jokes about being short masks a massive ego he thinks he has all the answers The Weekly Standard s Andrew Ferguson says Reich leaves the nuts and bolts of politics a supremely unhappy man convinced as strongly as ever of his superiority to its processes its practitioners and to the man who gave him the coolest job he ll ever have However reviewers do praise Reich s lucid prose pointed observations and sense of humor There is a Thurberesque side to him Evan Thomas the New York Times Book Review See Herbert Stein s review in Slate Random House plugs the book here Anything Your Little Heart Desires An American Family Story by Patricia Bosworth Simon Schuster Not all memoirs are evil Critical approbation for this one about Bosworth s father Bartley Crum a corporate lawyer who represented William Randolph Hearst and the Hollywood 10 and committed suicide during the McCarthy era Bosworth the biographer of Diane Arbus and Montgomery Clift provides a vivid sense of upper middle class life in the early Cold War years when prominent citizens suddenly turned their backs on colleagues such as Crum and called them Communist dupes writes Kathy Deacon in the Village Voice In the New York Times Book Review Richard Lingeman says Bosworth tells her elegiac story in a tone that is admirably restrained in prose that conveys strong feeling by understatement Hystories Hysterical Epidemics and Modern Media by Elaine Showalter Columbia University Press The feminist literary critic s claim that the Gulf War and chronic fatigue syndromes are merely psychological maladies meets with predictably high levels of vitriol In the New York Times Book Review social psychologist Carol Tavris takes Showalter to task for using literary Freudianism to explain real problems Sometimes a headache is a language of distress and sometimes it s a tumor Also Tavris says recent revelations that Gulf War troops may indeed have been exposed to chemical weapons belie Showalter s case In the New Republic the anti Freudian Frederick Crews describes Showalter s theory of hysteria as itself an attempt to whip up a little hysteria Columbia University Press plugs the book Theater Titanic Lunt Fontanne Theatre New York City Surprisingly the 10 million spectacular isn t Broadway s all time biggest flop But that is probably the most exciting thing that can be said about it says the New York Times Ben Brantley Critics complain that the musical fails to deliver the extravagant sets and staging they ve come to expect from theatrical blockbusters By sidestepping obvious clich s rushing crowds crashing waves in an effort to make a sensitive and tasteful show about a trashy subject says Newsday s Linda Winer the production achieves only banality The Little Foxes Vivian Beaumont Theater Lincoln Center New York City Apparently not even the sure fire plot machinations of Lillian Hellman and beguiling wiles of actress Stockard Channing can rescue this Lincoln Center production from its pretensions The play is so wildly miscast and so haplessly misconceived that it is hard to figure out what its creators exactly had in mind says the New York Times Brantley His best guess a Freudian essay on lovelessness and neurosis The Washington Post s Lloyd Rose calls the production a preachy bore Dance In Honor of the Divine Lou Harrison the Mark Morris Dance Group Brooklyn Academy of Music New York City The bad boy of modern dance takes on Lou Harrison the eclectic classical composer As you watch the stage your brain seems to get bigger your life more interesting says the Wall Street Journal s Joan Acocella The main attraction a live orchestra Yo Yo Ma played opening night Also Morris much praised penchant for dancers with unusually shaped bodies It is unique among the major companies of its kind in looking utterly human like a cross section of real people who just happen to move vividly or be capable of generating a potent atmosphere Tobi Tobias New York Update More Mailer bashing In the Washington Post Steven Moore says that Norman Mailer s retelling of Jesus life reads like a simplified novelization of the gospels for grade school children In the New Republic James Wood says Each new book by him is worse than the last he has become a bibliographer s definition of nostalgia He
