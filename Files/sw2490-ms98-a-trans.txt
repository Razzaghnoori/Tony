 okay well what do you think do you well i m kind of leaning towards i don t know i m thinking about what from one to ten what my number would be it d probably be somewhere closer to uh less control because i don t see i m not a member of the NRA although my father is but uh huh i i guess i believe i i think the NRA has gone overboard the wrong way you know they re sitting there on number ten saying they re saying absolutely no gun control we don t even want to think about it and yeah and i think that s a dumb situation because there has got to be some kind of background check to see that the people who are buying a gun are buying it for a useful purpose you know if if if you re going to hunt with it if you re going to do sport shooting you can wait a week yeah um hum right that s true it s not a big deal for them to go if they can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket you know i mean they should be able to go back and find out if you ve had any kind of psychiatric record armed you know felony record you know right that s true any of that kind of stuff and it seems to me right now that there s not there s not that much of a check i i m not really sure what Texas law i think there s a check for felonies for felonies on your record if the gun shop owner does it you know but right but um hum yeah but he has to go out and do it that s true i think that yeah if you and if it s a private sale of course then there s nothing right and see that s my only problem with uh making you um you know get the check and everything is is i guess bad guys if you want to call them bad guys they are going to get a gun no matter what um hum they re not i don t think they re going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there s a check i think they re going to go out and find it someway individual sale or something like that yes but but maybe well prevent a few John Hinkleys yeah i hope that s true you know i i that s that s the kind of people i like i say i don t think the guy who s going to rob a 7 Eleven is going to rob a 7 Eleven whether he has a gun or a knife baseball bat or you know whatever yeah right knives exactly he s going to do what he wants to do that s true i i just think it makes the honest people more honest and but you know yeah and and the people who want it it s not that big a deal like i said to wait right right and if you have to have it in a hurry something s wrong yeah yeah it makes you wonder what they need it for all of a sudden here hum that s right that s right well i m married to a policeman so we we talk about this a lot yeah i imagine i imagine his his opinion is a little bit towards the one there on the scale of one to ten he needs some more gosh if i was a cop i d be yeah yeah yeah i was watching a worried about that too many people have too many too much access yeah they do they do and i i guess i think the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is there should be some law against the types of gun i mean some of these Saturday night specials that these companies put out that are a piece of i mean they re they re basically it says here buy me and go rob a 7 Eleven that s right right or even even the um the little um toy guns look real i mean i ve heard so much about that on TV and that s kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one yes they that s really gotten bad or your child accidently if your child is old enough to i mean there re a lot of kids who when they re ten look like they re twelve or fourteen or yeah yeah right and and especially some of the minority children whether you know a racist or not that s the truth and and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn t be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands and a cop comes up um hum right i mean you can t blame them it looks like they ve got a weapon you can t jeez jeez and you can t take the chances the that s right because there s been kids that age who have killed people and you know you know there was a law in exactly i think it s in Oregon where they ve now made all toy guns they re they re making them like neon colors you know yeah and the kids don t care my kid doesn t care he picks up a stick and goes bang so it doesn t make any difference to him right and i think that s a good idea that s right i know right right a gun s a gun to them they can play with anything make it a gun that s exactly right yeah yeah so you ought to do i think they ought to do that with toy guns they ought to make them very reasonably do something outrageous to them you know so that they re not so that they re very distinguishable from a real gun right right exactly that s right that s a good idea well i was uh watching TV yesterday and there s a town in Georgia yes and it s the law that you have a gun every adult you know uh is able to carry a gun and and they encourage it yeah and the police love it which really surprised me and i and i think and that s what they were going after um that s kind of they encourage it hum they went to interview this town i mean it s a little dinky town they went to interview them about the gun control laws and uh the police said you all the people said that s fine we care less you know we re all honest and everything like that we we all carry them but we we don t mind being checked and uh and i think it kind of took that um hum neatness away from it you know like well heck everybody s got one you know and i don t know i so it was it was it was quite unusual to see the people in that town that s kind of an odd thing i don t know i have a gun and i mean my folks have always had i learned to shoot when i was real little i think that s a lot of it too is that people um hum need to teach their kids what not to what to do and what not to do because i started shooting my dad right exactly started letting me shoot like a little air BB gun when i was probably five or six years old but um hum yeah you know it was this is how you hold it this is the only place that you do it which was you know out far and away and you don t ever touch it unless i m here and you don t point it at at people and then they had then i went to the Texas right that s what we re doing exactly Parks and Recreation i guess but anyway the safety hunter safety program that you have to do now i think it started in about nineteen seventy if you want if you want to go deer hunting and your birthday s after oh yeah oh nineteen something fifty five or something then you have to go attend one of these hunter safety courses or you can t get a deer license um hum well that s neat well that s real neat and it and it s basic stuff it s like it s don t you know when you re climbi ng over a barbed wire fence don t point you don t lean your gun against it you know and you and then you crawl over it and have it shoot yourself and uh it yeah right well that s real good those things happen it it it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people right right and it s and they usually are real basic yeah put the safety on the gun don t assume always assume it s loaded that s that s got to be the most common thing that people yeah it s oh it s empty it s empty boom you know common sense things i know and people don t want to believe that yeah it was fair i took the clip out or whatever and yeah and i forgot about the one in the chamber oh in the chamber that s exactly right yeah well we we re trying to teach our daughter she knows real well about um about her daddy s guns what not to do and what to do around them oh yeah does he got them locked up all the time too when he s home yeah um and and and she and she s real um and she ll know she ll even tell her little friends don t ever you know touch my daddy s guns or something like that so she s real she s real good about it and she s never been curious don t even think about it yeah yeah hum i mean because he s always you know if he s has them out cleaning them you know she can be there and he ll tell her how he s doing it or you know show her the insides and stuff like that um hum yeah if you make it where it s not something to be feared and curious yeah not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared of if it if it s just one more piece of something but but they ve got to understand like you said never touch it but yeah right exactly right they have to have that respect for what it does and what it can do ours is a we have a shotgun and it s up in the closet um hum and then the shells are in another part and it s sometimes i think about it and and i got it because my husband used to travel and be out of he was out of country one time for three months oh yeah and i was like uh you know we re in a nice neighborhood but still and you and then i ve got it so far sometimes i think i i wonder if i still i m not about to load it because i you know i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there and it s in a case and it s you know it s put up and it s away and all that but i don t want to take the chance and i think if somebody ever does break in it s going to take me a year to find the shells and then get it don t come in the um hum right he s got to go to a lot of trouble yeah hold on hold on it s in here somewhere i know it is yeah well i know i know how to use them we go we go hunting every once in a while and he showed me how to use his guns and i really enjoy it but hum boy if someone did break in i don t i don t know that i could or would even grab it i know i i used to think about that it was a lot easier when i was when i was when i was single it was one thing and when i was married just married with no kids when it was just me um hum that s true it was an easy decision yeah yeah it was like you you come after me you re going to get it you know and now there s so many other things where are the kids what are they doing you know where is this person coming in from uh you ve got and and if if you if you manage to get it out yeah right yes right and then you know what how how can you even afford to to think about what what you re going to do with it because you don t know where your kids are at the same time ugh true true well we have dogs that are pretty very protective so if they re if they re stupid yeah if they re stupid enough to come through then yeah we do too yeah i figure they ll make enough noise but yeah it s it s i kind of think we we have two big dogs in the backyard i always kind of thought that too kind of an extra buffer yeah yeah they ve got to be pretty stupid and and most people uh uh that uh break in or whatever go to houses without the dogs luckily yeah anything that the well any any advantage they can take right and that s one of them so well unfortunately yeah guess it makes them worth the dog food over the years yeah yeah really does well do you think we ve yeah i i think that s about all i can me too on gun control we re we re in pretty good agreement actually on it it would be an interesting it would be even more interesting you you to to meet some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum that s opposite yeah i think we are right right but i m glad you re not so me too it s nice to find there s another reasonable person in Garland well it s been nice talking to you bye bye right well good you too thanks bye bye
