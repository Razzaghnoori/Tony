 The Muddled Middle The right and the left have been quarreling about the character of the American middle class for at least three decades now In the conservatives populist version the common sense morals of Middle Americans are under attack by libertine elites and a decadent media The left conjures up a heartland full of racists misogynists and religious maniacs Both pit a morally hidebound middle against a culturally permissive overclass But neither of these overwrought images of fierce division captures today s more complex reality The truth of the matter is that the liberals have won the culture wars Maybe not as thoroughly as they would have liked and maybe with much of the looniness removed but they won them and we are a more tolerant egalitarian and unified nation because of it It is the prime virtue of Alan Wolfe s new book One Nation After All that it grasps the contours of what he calls this mature middle class Wolfe a professor of sociology at Boston University and his assistant Maria Poarch conducted interviews with 25 people in each of eight cities The locations ranged from Rancho Bernardo a gated retirement community in California to Medford Mass home to police officers and firemen to Broken Arrow Okla on the buckle of the Bible Belt What intrigues Wolfe is not the regional peculiarities of these places but the overlap among them The blacks of Dekalb County Ga turn out to have much in common with the Jews of Brookline Mass Newt Gingrich s constituents in Cobb County Ga bear a basic resemblance to the Latinos and Asians of Eastlake Calif Hence one nation The after all that completes the title is wry not just as in surprise surprise but also after all the cultural upheavals of the last decades These suburbanites Wolfe finds are wary of both right wing preachers and bleeding heart liberals They long for a sensible center and distrust ideological thinking They re hardly heroic in their virtues there s none of the grandeur of say the Protestant Ethic here But neither is there much of the demonic There s no wife swapping or anti Semitism Their morality might be described as nonjudgmental pragmatism Wolfe finds them using few words such as sin moral rot decay or Satan Middle class Americans don t deem people of other faiths as wanting or immoral They re reluctant to pass judgment on how other people act and think They don t hanker for the old family order or want to put women back in ancient strictures but neither do they endorse the left s anything goes morality Wolfe describes these Middle Americans with the term ambivalent which I don t think is quite right since it suggests they re unsure of their own views Rather I d call them syncretists who draw on the values of both moral obligation and modern self expression They wish to preserve the freedoms brought by women working sexual enlightenment and feminism even as they also worry about the fragility of family life and the dangers their children face The same mix is evident on public policy issues such as race welfare and immigration Wolfe s interviewees draw sharp lines between the deserving and undeserving poor When they think about riven families and social pathology in the inner city they generally blame people s lack of personal responsibility But such sentiments aren t necessarily racist Wolfe s suburbanites have sympathy for unwed ghetto mothers believe in giving people a second chance and know that the safety net is a moral not just a practical necessity And if they don t like feeling swamped by immigrants or people who want Spanish placed on a par with English they have come to value different ethnic and racial traditions so long as those traditions don t trump one s identity as an American At almost every turn Wolfe affirms a sensibility of the serene The concepts he invokes quiet faith mature patriotism ordinary duties morality writ small soft multiculturalism proclaim a preference both his and his subjects for the middle way Against hotter images of a churning id of rabid racism or dangerously aggrieved Middle Americans he restores to the middle its claims of reason and morality We do not have to fear them Wolfe s approach has its limitations His interviews tend to focus on the more educated affluent segments of the middle class segments that may more easily slip into genteel euphemisms and present themselves as enlightened And the brevity of the sessions 90 minutes to 120 minutes to cover a lot of ground can permit the breathless clutter of quick responses to keep at bay deeper and darker sentiments Moreover by contrasting his central metaphor of one nation against the alternative vision of culture war Wolfe makes his own position seem moderate and attractive Were he not constantly playing off a notion of a fiercely divided society one might discover other questions and thus other important qualities of the middle class Finally in one case I suspect Wolfe is incorrect He sees homosexuality as something of a grand exception to his larger thesis Only a small percentage of his interviewees are willing to admit its legitimacy as a lifestyle But the vast majority of them have come to accept homosexuals as worthy of rights and even of respect if not of admiration Measured against the historical baseline of great fear and misunderstanding this tolerance may actually vindicate Wolfe s larger argument Still Wolfe s portrait captures an essential truth Despite the huffing and puffing divisions have been closing in gender in notions of patriotism and even in some dimensions of race Religious fundamentalists who once declaimed against fornication now seek simply to hold the line at gay marriage Meanwhile liberals in the Democratic party have been publicly embracing the idiom of hard work and personal responsibility Wolfe also throws down an implicit challenge to liberals At one point he imagines this middle class plaint By dismissing our fears about declining morality out of hand you fail to recognize that middle class morality is not necessarily opposed to the values of inclusion and equality that you currently profess Liberals have been like the pre Civil War Whigs at least as rendered by Louis Hartz in his classic Liberal Tradition in America The Whigs kept seeing the proles through the lens of Europe s old feudal societies imagining that America s lower orders wanted to seize property rather than acquire it Rebuffing these lower classes when they could have beguiled them the Whigs made potential friends into enemies The post 1960s Democratic Party has come close to making the same mistake Wolfe reminds us that for the Democrats taking back the middle doesn t have to mean craven opportunism or a betrayal of its beliefs Rather it can simply mean rediscovering the common ground that liberals have long shared with the middle class without even realizing it It might be argued that Wolfe s portrait of the middle s muddle will be shocking only to a rarified and dogmatic crew of ideologues But that s the virtue of this calm and sensible book It doesn t aim to dazzle with flashy but misleading rubrics like backlash One Nation After All is full of the very qualities its author imputes to the people ordinary virtue mature patriotism and quiet faith
