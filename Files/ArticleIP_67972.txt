 Shakespearean Follies Subject Culturebox s Rusty Shakespeare From Guatam Makunda Re Date Thu Dec 23 Judith Shulevitz needs to brush up on her Shakespeare as well I m afraid Fluellen s statement in Henry V Act IV Scene VII is in full Kill the poys and the luggage tis expressly against the law of arms tis an arrant a piece of knavery mark you now as can be offert in your conscience now is it not To this statement Gower another soldier replies Tis certain there s not a boy left alive and the cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha done this slaughter besides they have burn d and carried away all that was in the king s tent wherefore the king most worthily hath caused every soldier to cut his prisoner s throat O tis a gallant king This then prompts an extended comparison on the part of Fluellen of Henry V and Alexander the Great Thus Fluellen s condemnation was for the French slaughter of the boys in the English baggage train a slaughter conducted apparently by French soldiers who fled the battle This is what Fluellen and Gower think provoked King Henry s command to kill England s French prisoners and both soldiers fully approve of that command John Keegan s excellent book The Face of Battle also looks at the issue and concludes that his command was well within the norms of warfare for the period Henry V is in fact Shakespeare s archetype of the perfect Hero King precisely because of his Machiavellian qualities which certainly are present Henry understands as he explains during his tour of the army before Agincourt that the moral demands upon a King are very different from those upon ordinary men To reply click here Subject Re Culturebox s Rusty Shakespeare From Judith Shulevitz Re Date Tue Dec 28 Guatam Makunda has a point I did misread the passage But he or she is wrong to conclude that I thereby vitiate my larger argument First things first I stand corrected Fluellen is in fact referring to the French slaughter of the English servants But I submit that there s a good reason for my having misread the text on the fly Fluellen s remark follows immediately Henry s order to his men to kill their prisoners which would have scared anybody in Shakespeare audience who knows anything about war The side whose captured soldiers have been murdered invariably retaliates by killing the men it has captured and the men ordered to slit their prisoners throats understood that I think Shakespeare means for us to confuse the two for a moment until Gower replies and we know where we are Fluellen does not then go on to compare Henry to Alexander the Great exactly Fluellen in the great tradition of the Shakespearean Fool uses the comparison to make Henry out to be an ass Fluellen first compares Henry to Alexander the Pig is corrected by Gower defends his malapropism then goes on to say that the reason Alexander and Henry are alike is they both kill their friends Henry of course killed Falstaff metaphorically by cutting him to the quick Obviously we are meant to laugh at Fluellen s nonsense but still When a Shakespearean fool mocks a king intentionally or not we have to sit up and take notice As for Keegan and The Face of Battle Guatam Makunda inadvertently makes my point for me Keegan would not have had to weigh in if there wasn t a raging debate about the rightness or wrongness of Henry s actions Is Henry the archetype of the Hero Machiavellian or otherwise I would argue that Shakespeare did not create archetypes He created characters Indeed he may have created Character itself What makes a Shakespearean character is his roundedness his moral complexity his good sides and his evil sides all mixed in As Harold Bloom puts it Shakespeare more or less invented our modern notions of psychology Is Henry all good Hell no Is he all bad No not really but he s out there and Shakespeare knew it My point was simply that he s not an exemplary role model and it s ridiculous for business executives to think that Shakespeare had handed them a road map to the unproblematic exercise of power To reply click here Subject Moneybox s Faulty Logic From Silas Dogood Re Date Wed Dec 22 Moneybox thinks the stock market doesn t reflect the health of the overall economy because just 48 percent of Americans own stock Using this reasoning and bearing in mind that in 1929 less than 10 percent of the populace owned stock we may be assured that the crash of 29 and the Great Depression were only coincidental and not causally linked Uh huh To reply click here Subject A Trifling 1 Trillion From gbh Re Date Wed Dec 22 The net worth of the U S household sector has increased by close to 20 trillion in the last five years If the wealth effect still follows the rule of thumb outlined by Moneybox 5 cents in consumer spending for every dollar of wealth created in the stock market that means a boost to consumption of 1 trillion That would account for about a third of nominal GDP growth over the past five years Sounds pretty consequential to me Plus when you consider that the savings out of income is close to zero the old 5 percent number is undoubtedly low To reply click here Subject What L A Times Scandal From Epicurus Re Date Wed Dec 22 Chatterbox like David Shaw in his interminable piece in the Los Angeles Times never makes it clear why the revenue sharing arrangement between Staples and the newspaper was such an egregious violation of journalistic ethics Dumb maybe as Chatterbox points out but where is the attack on integrity The ad side of all newspapers is constantly trying to get the ed side to say nice things about those advertising In this case though the advertisers in the special issue of the LAT magazine were companies other than Staples And the Times writers were never pressured to do puff pieces Yes the Times almost unwittingly was an instrument for Staples to engage in a kickback scheme i e Staples leaned on contractors and vendors to pony up for ads for which they got some return But this breach is more an offense by Staples The LAT was on the hook for support already But again the writers were free to write what they wanted so why is the staff there so exercised which they became only after the WSJ and NYT started knocking their conduct One more point Chatterbox says the LAT participated in a bad business deal Perhaps But he should take into account that the LAT also has a corporate commitment to downtown L A and that through its continuing expansion the paper as well as the town would benefit Enlightened self interest and all that To reply click here Subject Free It s a Wonderful Life From Mike Gebert Re Date Tue Dec 28 Your discussion of the copyright status of It s a Wonderful Life is correct enough but I think you re wrong to regard the current Republic Pictures copyright rooted in its underlying copyright of the musical score as a settled legal concept It s true no one has challenged it but would you want to be the station manager at the UPN station in Provo who took on NBC s exclusive rights in court In fact the seemingly farfetched act you suggest would liberate the movie Removing the music track is not so farfetched at all the 1939 movie Love Affair has been released on video with its score replaced for exactly that reason Surely It s a Wonderful Life would be even more worth the trouble if any video distributor thought they could do it without immediately facing a battalion of high priced lawyers This same legal gambit has been used for years in the world of classic film distribution When the balance of power among public and private parties was fairly even the private copyright never stood up for very long A famously shady and litigious film distributor once tried to gain control of among other things D W Griffith s Birth of a Nation long since public domain by buying up the rights to the Thomas Dixon novels it was loosely based on he was pretty much laughed away by his rivals To reply click here
