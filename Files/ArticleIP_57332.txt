 Gates Crashing Subject Don t Condescend to the WTO Protesters Re Dec 1 From Richard Perry Date Wed Dec 1 It s not just interesting that the major media coverage of WTO Seattle this piece included has been dismissive and condescending it s telling The New York Times front page piece which Today s Papers quotes refers to the protesters sentiments the smug Brainless in Seattle headline in TP betrays a similar willful ostrich pose The protesters main victory lies in making the WTO front page news in the first place The WTO is a non democratic unless you want to stretch the definition of democratic to absurd proportions organization with great power to affect well everyone It is symptomatic of the decay of accountability and legitimacy in ostensibly democratic people centered government This is a major issue and it s not going to get play if a few loud activists don t make noise and force corporate media to at least take note even as they reel out the tired Friedman esque line that a global economy is both inevitable and the best of all possible worlds so get used to it take your medicine shut up and get back to work Guys in black masks smashing Starbucks windows make easy targets sure It s a lot harder to actually look beneath the surface and think through the present and potential effects of the incredibly complex and in many ways dangerous phenomenon of globalization To reply

Cornel West at the head of the smirking line and politically correct Yes its choices are trendy and will date it badly and quickly In this it is very much like another Microsoft product the new Encarta Dictionary The dictionary and its style guide would make Mrs Grundy proud They cite as objectionable three times as many words as any other dictionary damning every word that any small political group anywhere has ever criticized The style guide suggests not using homosexual although it gives no usable alternative it labels cancer patient as offensive and recommends patient with cancer as the proper phrasing However the personal criticism of Henry Louis Gates is in my opinion overdone Gates wants to and has succeeded in his profession That isn t a bad thing He has done so by hard work by doing a lot of worthy editing and literary criticism He wants to read and know everything much like Diderot to whom Early compares him That s admirable not a weakness Sheath the claws To

Standard Times in 1964 it was common to lift obits from the Providence Journal word for word To reply click here Subject Re Plagiarized Obits Re Nov 23 From Richard Riley Date Mon Nov 29 Re the Washington Post and New York Times obituaries of the same person containing an identical paragraph Doesn t that probably just mean that the paragraph came from a wire service that both papers subscribe to probably the Associated Press If so that s not plagiarism while I don t know this my guess is that agreements between newspapers and the AP or other wire services let the papers do pretty much whatever they want with the wire copy The episode involving a Baltimore Sun music critic on the other hand does sound more like plagiarism so I don t see that the cases are alike To reply click

sentence And a browser s source code is only a fraction of the size of that of an operating system Ewww That is only true if you accept the Microsoft premise that welding a graphical user interface GUI onto an operating system leaves you with a bigger better operating system OS a proposal which is not universally accepted by the computer programming community at large A browser s source is small because it uses the functions of the GUI In UNIX Linux the OS isn t tightly bound to a GUI hence Linux s greater configurability for specific tasks as well as its potential for more than one GUI This is the real problem with Windows It s much more than an operating system it s an OS DOS or NT inextricably meshed with a GUI MS Windows Most of the size of the Windows basic installation software are details for add on services to the OS many of which go unused An OS is not a GUI and a GUI is not an OS even when their coding is intertwined The size of the OS in the context of code source or object is the size essential to execute files For Windows that amounts to a DOS layer the minimum required for complete if not pretty control about 400k of object code on disk In Linux it s a kernel with enough support to maintain a command console something around 120k Remember Both of these OS s can boot from floppies Browsers as mentioned don t have to be very big either if they have a rich set of GUI features to draw from It s the dressy Windows GUI that takes up all the space on your disk Yes you have it yes you installed it with the OS but the GUI isn t the OS Even at Microsoft the GUI and the OS are coded by separate different teams of programmers Deftly and flawlessly unraveling the deliberately convoluted intricacies of the Microsoft situation may be too much for the valiant Slate crew already caught in the middle twixt truth and fealty as they are The OS GUI distinction is among those at the core of the government s antitrust case I hate to be nit picky but this distinction is the nit If you don t get how important the distinction is would you at least credit the vehemence with which the computer software community argues this issue The article s closing sentence manages to gloss it right over To reply click here
