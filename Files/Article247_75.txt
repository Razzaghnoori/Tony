 Kathleen Willey Grope n Gripe Extravaganza A FEW MORE POINTS about the Kathleen Willey incident As noted in yesterday s Chatterbox if true Willey s story is the worst of Clinton s alleged sexual indiscretions worse than Lewinsky worse than Paula Jones But is Willey telling the truth In his original Newsweek article on the Willey Willy business reporter Michael Isikoff said Willey s friend Julie Steele initially confirmed Willey s account saying she Steele had heard the gruesome details from Willey the night of the incident But in the same article Isikoff reported that Steele had later recanted and said that Willey had asked her to lie about what had happened in order to give credibility to the allegation that she had been harassed According to Isikoff Steele now said that Willey only told her that the president had made a pass at her and not until weeks after the incident ARE WE TO BELIEVE Steele s recantation Or had the same Mystery Suborner who gave Monica Lewinsky anti Willey talking points to give to Linda Tripp you now do not believe that what she claimed happened really happened You now find it completely plausible that she herself smeared her lipstick also given them to Steele with greater success Chatterbox has no idea what the answer is Steele s testimony will clearly now be very important But the mere existence of the talking points casts a retrospective cloud over her semi exculpatory recantation STEELE S NEW ACCOUNT is only semi exculpatory because she did tell Isikoff that Willey had talked to her about Clinton making a pass just not an unwanted pass The New York Times rehashing Isikoff s reporting in a front page piece last Saturday conveniently omitted this point leaving the false impression that the first Steele had heard about any Clinton pass was when Willey called to ask her to lie when Isikoff was on his way to her home ONE ANTI WILLEY CONSIDERATION is this her husband apparently stole about 274 000 of a client s money and didn t repay it Instead with the repayment deadline looming he committed suicide Kathleen Willey got 1 million in insurance money after his death and apparently didn t give any of it to the poor client whose money was stolen Indeed she has fought through protracted legal proceedings to successfully stiff him Is Chatterbox alone in finding this behavior deeply troubling DESIGNATED SCANDAL VILLAIN LINDA TRIPP of course told Isikoff that when she ran into Willey after Willey s Oval Office encounter Willey looked flustered happy and joyful not harrassed But is Tripp s account really all that incompatible with Willey s Even if Clinton had made an unwanted grope Willey still could have looked flustered and happy afterwards and maybe even have failed to tell Tripp she was at some level appalled After all it must be a heady thing for the president make a pass at you even an unwanted pass though Chatterbox has no personal experience in this department Willey may have been joyful that she was going to get the job she desperately wanted Even if Clinton s behavior was piggish it s a bit unfair to expect Willey to get instantly angry and dress down the president of the United States as if he were the heavy in some How to Stop Sex Harassment training video
