 Mike s On Talk radio is uniquely American it s democratic it s interactive it s OK OK it s mostly Rush talking to wack jobs on Social Security about the budget and Howard jawing with lowlifes on weed about breasts But not completely Further up the yak food chain past the local politics and sports gabbers you can find Garrison Keillor and the Car Talk guys and if you re lucky the gentle wit of Whad Ya Know and its host Michael Feldman This is talk radio for the rest of us people who like information and words have the conventional concerns of family and work and enjoy a little innuendo now and then Our listeners read says Feldman a 47 year old former English teacher who looks and sounds fully capable of being beaten up by Woody Allen They play racquetball They disproportionately own foreign cars They carry dental insurance When asked if his marketing people are satisfied with this following after 10 years of national broadcasts the show syndicated by Public Radio International now reaches a total of 1 million people every week via more than 200 stations Feldman responds What are marketing people Although such comments reflect Whad Ya Know s let s go in the barn and put on a show feel the show is a full time gig for Feldman who describes his salary as about 4 Keillor units The two hour Saturday morning show airs live usually from a 175 seat classroom at the University of Wisconsin in Madison where Feldman attended college and now lives with his wife and two young daughters But sometimes Feldman takes it on the road to places like Northfield Minn and Springfield Mo The show always opens with a five minute topical monologue One thing you gotta say about Congress They can t run the government but they ve made it a federal offense to fire your travel agent and then segues to an interview with a guest or two recent visitors included novelist Jane Smiley and a Democratic Party adviser who witnessed Bill Clinton and Helmut Kohl s glutton off at a Milwaukee diner Next comes the Whad Ya Know Quiz which pairs a member of the studio audience with a caller Quiz categories include People Science Odds and Ends and Things You Should Have Learned in School Had You Been Paying Attention Sample question Are more people injured by clothing or by razors Answer Clothing Kitschy prizes like a book called Songs for Dogs and the People Who Love Them or a pair of underwear with the Contract With America printed on them go to the winners There s also the phone call to an inhabitant of the Town of the Week The town is selected by a dart thrown at a map and Feldman dials the town randomly until someone answers and chats with him the feature ran eight years before he lighted upon an inhabitant who d heard of the show But most of the show is just Feldman pacing the audience and being funny It s sort of like Donahue without the issues Feldman once told a Wisconsin magazine Or better yet without Donahue BLOCK QUOTE WOMAN AUDIENCE MEMBER How can I wean myself from sleeping with a fan FELDMAN I say marry him END BLOCK QUOTE In an age when even the most seemingly spontaneous public events are in fact preceded by stacks of memos and weeks of meetings extemporaneous entertainment like this is no mean feat And it s no mean feat either Unlike Howard Stern and Dave Letterman Feldman sees to it that his foils have as much fun as he does BLOCK QUOTE FELDMAN What s your name AUDIENCE MEMBER Hankus Netsky FELDMAN Is that the Pig Latin version I m being serious with you now give me a serious answer What s your name HANKUS That s really it FELDMAN Hankus is your actual name HANKUS It s true I was actually named Hankus because my mother FELDMAN Why HANKUS GIRLFRIEND Tell him the truth FELDMAN There can t be a good reason for it HANKUS Well let s see There s a Jewish tradition of naming kids after FELDMAN Of giving kids lousy names HANKUS Actually my mother had to name me after a relative whose name started with an H and she didn t like any of the American names like Howard or Harry or any of that sort of stuff so she got this name from a cartoon show as a matter of fact FELDMAN What cartoon had a character named Hankus HANKUS There was a cartoon in Philadelphia called Hankus the Horse END BLOCK QUOTE At this point Feldman dials Hankus mother in Philadelphia BLOCK QUOTE FELDMAN Hello Mrs Netsky this is Mike Feldman calling from the radio show Whad Ya Know with Mike Feldman If you can answer a simple question we have a wonderful prize for you Got a minute HANKUS MOM Just a minute yes FELDMAN OK the question is What famous cartoon horse is your son named after HANKUS MOM Hankus the Horse The nurses in the hospital when I had to fill in the certificate didn t like that They said you ve got to give him a proper name FELDMAN They didn t think Hankus the Horse was a proper name for a baby END BLOCK QUOTE Playing the man from Mars agog at Earthling ways Feldman listens skeptically to a guy in the studio audience who describes himself as a community planner busy coordinating a community s relationships with the state and federal government Bearing down Feldman gets him to admit that his real duties are to beg for money for sewers But the Madison Martian will gladly play the butt of a joke if it ll help him figure out the locals Acclimating himself to the online world in one show he required callers to tap their words into a keyboard as they spoke Meanwhile he did the same with his manual typewriter It s very nice to meet you over the Internet What do you look like spoke typed a caller named Julia Parentheses smiling broadly six foot four and a half blond Lutheran type you Feldman spoke typed back To communicate using only your typing skills to me that s a special level in hell Besides he confesses I don t like to be accessed Which makes public radio the perfect medium for him and explains why the TV pilots he made failed to sell The concept was for me to be a white Arsenio Hall he says of one pilot I had the hardest time figuring out what that would be not hip not black not up that late It came out as Art Linkletter To tell you the truth he sighs summing up his of life on public radio I don t see any way out of this Illustration by Nina Frenkel
