 The Dell Factor When Michael Dell the CEO and founder of Dell Computer laid his head on his pillow the night of Feb 25 he must have been one tired chief executive In the previous seven days he had made 830 million enough to exhaust anyone in the best way of course Dell was not however the most tired CEO in the land that evening And in fact his income for the previous week was not even one fourth that earned by Microsoft s own Bill Gates who was 3 8 billion richer when he fell asleep on the 25 th than he had been a week before It has to be difficult resisting those impulse purchases of new Porsches when you re able to say to yourself What the hell I made 4 billion last week I can probably splurge a little Still 830 million is no shabby performance and Dell certainly slept the sleep of the innocent or at least of the successful that night Of course neither Dell nor Gates actually saw any of these hundreds of millions of dollars since their gains were reaped entirely on paper in the form of sharp increases in the stock prices of both Dell and Microsoft We ve grown accustomed in recent years to CEOs being worth billions of dollars But actually this is a relatively recent development in American business and while the financial success of Michael Dell is a fine expression of the American dream the lessons the business world has drawn from that success are less salutary The curious phenomenon that Dell s and Gates enormous wealth points to is a resurgence in American business of what s often called proprietary capitalism a system in which the people who run corporations are also the people who own them The traditional story of industrial capitalism s development in the United States is that it had its roots in family owned enterprises but that it quickly evolved into a system where the people who owned companies delegated the responsibility for running them to managers The genius of American business in fact lay in this embrace of managerialism of the idea that you didn t actually have to own stock in a company to do an excellent job managing it Alfred Sloan of General Motors who never made 830 million in his life owned only a tiny sliver of GM but he still managed it as if it were his There were always exceptions to this reign of the managers to be sure including Ford where the Ford family kept tight control at least through the end of World War II IBM which was run by founder Thomas Watson and his son for most of the century and DuPont But even these corporations saw the authority of the founders dissipate as the enterprises grew larger and more ambitious in their appetite for capital The more money you borrow and the more shares of stock you issue the more people you give a share in your business As a result except for the media business where many large companies are still owned by individuals or families most powerful U S corporations have fit a particular model The ownership of stock has been diffuse and the management of the company has been professional in the sense that it has had no substantial personal stake in the corporation What s striking then about Michael Dell and Bill Gates is that they and their enormous personal fortunes hearken back to an older model where a personal stake in a company was a guarantee of one s devotion to it Dell owns almost 20 percent of Dell Computer while Gates owns 22 percent of Microsoft Larry Ellison Gates nemesis at Oracle has a sizable minority stake in his company And Steven Jobs having learned his lesson at Apple where he was forced out by professional manager John Sculley owns 71 percent of his new company Pixar makers of Toy Story thereby ensuring that no one will ever push him around again In the financial services industry Fidelity Investments is still run by the Johnson family while Charles Schwab is the largest shareholder in the company that bears his name The Walton family owns a sizable chunk of Wal Mart while Phil Knight founder of Nike owns one third of that company Of course that means Knight lost 310 million on Feb 24 but such are the perils of ownership The older managerial model is certainly still alive and well as proved by the extraordinary number of new CEOs who have been hired from outside corporations in the last three years But the return to the owner manager model is real In part this is a function of the enormous entrepreneurial boom in the computer industry over the last two and a half decades The key word in Silicon Valley has always been equity and the best company leaders have clung to as much of it as they could In fact with the notable exception of Compaq there is shockingly no family with the last name Compaq the best technology companies have been those in which the people who started the company have continued to run it and to own much of it Not coincidentally these are the companies that have made people into billionaires But the return to the owner manager model is also connected to an important transformation in the way American business understands incentives During the glory days of the post World War II boom it was assumed that a high salary and meaningful responsibility were enough to motivate executives to do the best they could In the wake of the near collapse of many U S corporations in the 1970s though people began to think that the real problem was that managers needed to be more like owners That helps explain the explosion in the use of stock options since the 1980s Give managers a stake in their companies the thinking went and they ll perform better After all look at Dell and Microsoft Insofar as it assumed that people already being paid millions of dollars will work extra hard only if given still more financial incentives the options boom was a glorious product of the Reagan era The idea of linking an executive s pay to performance is on its own terms obviously a good one But too often stock options are just gravy tossed in on top of a huge base salary to satisfy the demands of executive privilege Piles of options by themselves do not make CEOs act like owners though they can make them ridiculously wealthy There s a dramatic difference between someone like Michael Dell and someone like Al Dunlap Dell s financial health is completely wrapped up with the company he started and still owns Dunlap for his efforts in wrecking that is restructuring corporations is rewarded with huge chunks of options that he immediately exercises so he can pocket the cash not so he can invest in the future of the company More than that the lesson of Dell s success has been misunderstood Since Michael Dell has been a great manager and has made billions of dollars corporations have imagined that he s been a great manager because he s made billions of dollars But it s more likely that Dell has been a great manager because he s been running a company that is in some important sense his Not that he s walking away from the billions of dollars of course True the owner manager model successful as it has been is not the only possible model for success But in Dell s case it s clearly the ownership not the accompanying financial reward that has really mattered Most corporations with their skyrocketing pay to CEOs seem to have turned that formula on its head believing that they can compete successfully only by duplicating the enormous financial gains someone like Dell has reaped In confusing stock options with ownership corporations confuse trappings with substance Unfortunately these are trappings that come with billion dollar price tags attached
