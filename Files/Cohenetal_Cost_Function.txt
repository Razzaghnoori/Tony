the posts of industrial countries are remarkably alike Each of the major functions delivery mail processing transportation and window service is conducted using similar methods and technologies Therefore it may be possible for a fairly simple model to explain total and unit cost differences between posts Ideally developing a cost model for the 20 plus industrial posts would involve collecting data on many individual cost elements from each and using regression analysis to estimate the coefficients of a cost function In today s environment this is impossible because virtually all posts in industrial countries consider much of their operational cost data to be commercially sensitive and will not share them In our previous paper Cohen et al 2002 we developed a model that related unit costs to volume per capita The model is based on U S costs More specifically it is based on the accrued cost of the major functions and their cost elasticities with respect to volume A plot of that cost function reveals the classic hyperbolic shape with unit costs increasing more rapidly as volume per capita declines because of the loss of economies of scale See Figure 1 In our previous paper we made adjustments to the model to allow for comparison with Poste Italiane In particular adjustments were made for differences in labor cost amount of worksharing and mix of mail by shape 1 In this paper we add an adjustment for counter costs 2 The resulting model estimate of Poste Italiane s unit cost is 74 cents versus the actual value of 79 cents It must be pointed out that the cost model is used to estimate costs over an extreme range of volume U S volume per capita in 1999 was 739 pieces while Italy s was 115 pieces per capita Given this range the authors are encouraged by the relatively small deviation of the estimate from actual 1 See the Appendix to Cohen et al 2002 2 The USPS has only 14 counters per 100 000 population while Poste Italiane has 24 counters per 100 000 population Figure 1 Model Estimates of Unit Cost Benchmarked by U S Costs and Volumes 2 50 2 00 Cost per Piece US 1 50 1 00 0 50 0 00 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Pieces per Capita In this paper we examine the hypothesis that the cost model provides reasonable estimates of the unit costs of other posts of industrialized countries 3 The hypothesis cannot however be directly confirmed because we do not have sufficient cost data on other countries to compare with the model results We provide indirect confirming evidence of the hypothesis using the fact that the model implies that mail processing and delivery costs will comprise specific percentages of total costs at specific per capita volume levels We have obtained the actual percentages of mail processing costs and delivery costs relative to total costs for seven posts with which we compare the predicted percentages Although the evidence is not conclusive it confirms the hypothesis We first present our model for total costs and unit costs We next present the test of our hypothesis by comparing the predicted percentages for each of the seven posts with the actual percentages We then produce a trend line through the data points and compare it with the model results Finally we compare actual unit revenues and some derived unit costs for the seven posts with the model s prediction of unit costs The editors of the book in which our previous paper Cohen et al 2002 appears suggested that we examine the hypothesis that the cost model accurately describes the costs of other posts 2 THE COST MODEL The model is the same as that used by Cohen et al 2001 except that we now present it as a generalized cost function The model assumes that there are two primary determinants of cost for a postal system volume and size of the network For each activity a post performs there are volume driven attributable costs and networkdriven institutional costs To create a total cost function we use FY 1999 U S Postal Service data to define the relationship between costs and cost drivers Costs for each postal activity mail processing delivery etc that can be attributed to mail volumes are divided by total volume to obtain an estimate of the marginal cost 4 The remaining costs are institutional costs that are primarily driven by the size of the network Population is a reasonable proxy for the size of the network and therefore institutional costs are divided by the U S population to obtain the additional cost per person This produces annual cost functions for each of the major postal activities and a total cost function Since all costs are variable in the long run it is reasonable that non delivery institutional costs would decline over the large volume range we explore with this model For purposes of this analysis we assume that 25 percent of non delivery institutional costs would be volume variable 5 No portion of delivery institutional costs is considered to be volume variable however because route structure generally does not change as volume drops As long as coverage is relatively high carriers will have to cover their entire route Thus fixed delivery costs would not be expected to drop until volume per capita were so low that the resulting very low coverage allowed carriers to skip parts of their routes 4 Attributable costs using the PRC cost treatment are greater than volume variable costs Consequently the estimate is slightly higher than the true marginal cost 5 The results are not very sensitive to this assumption as can be seen in Cohen et al 2001 The cost function in U S dollars is Variable Institutional Mail Processing 0 1032V 2 10P Delivery 0 0525V 42 24P Transportation 0 0200V 0 92P Window Service 0 0092V 4 64P All Other costs 0 0241V 24 41P Total costs 0 2089V 74 31P where V Volume and P Population It can be seen that the total cost of providing postal service in the U S for FY 1999 was 20 89 cents per piece plus 74 31 per person The total cost for other countries can be estimated by substituting volume and population into the above formula The total cost function can be used to estimate average unit cost by dividing the terms by V Average Unit Cost 0 2089 74 31 P V This can be restated in terms of V P or pieces per capita ppc as Average Unit Cost 0 2089 74 31 ppc The percent of total cost for each function included in the model and cost elasticity with respect to volume are shown in Table 1 The model assumes constant unit variable costs Thus when volume is reduced total variable cost is reduced by the same percentage At lower per capita volumes the ratio of fixed to variable cost increases and the cost elasticities decrease because a greater proportion of total costs is fixed Similarly the model assumes a constant coefficient for population Table 1 FY 1999 USPS Percent of Total Cost and Elasticity with respect to Volume of the Major a Source Postal Rate Commission Docket R2000 1 b Includes both in and out of office activities c Does not include intra city transportation costs The U S cost elasticities in Table 1 when applied to the accrued costs of each function determine the coefficients in the cost function which in turn generate the unique shape of the unit cost function Figure 1 Further these coefficients determine the percent of total cost that comes from mail processing and delivery at a specific volume per capita The total cost for an individual country can be expressed as a function of pieces per capita by rewriting the above basic total cost equation as Total Cost for country i 0 2089 Pi V Pi 74 31 Pi where Pi population for country i 0 2089Pi slope 74 31Pi intercept The values of the slope rate of increase in total costs and intercept institutional costs are directly related to the population of the country If country A has twice as many inhabitants as country B then the slope and intercept of A s cost function will be twice as large as the slope and intercept of B s cost function Figure 2 displays the total cost curves as functions of pieces per capita for each of the countries in the sample The differences in slopes and intercepts reflect population differences If total volume instead of pieces per capita were displayed on the vertical axis then the Y intercepts would remain unchanged but the cost curves would be parallel Although Figure 2 shows a family of total costs curves Figure 1 displays a single unit cost curve because the unit cost curve depends on only one variable pieces per capita Figure 2 Total Cost Functions for Sampled Posts Not Adjusted for Structural Differences 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Pieces per Capita 3 ADJUSTMENTS To estimate the cost of a post using the model it is necessary to take into account labor cost differences between the U S Postal Service and the given post The test of our hypothesis however does not involve predicting unit costs of other posts It involves predicting the percentage of total cost devoted to mail processing and delivery Thus labor costs do not need to be adjusted The total percentage of mail processing costs would have to be adjusted if worksharing automation or mail mix had significantly different impacts on mail processing costs We have adjusted mail processing costs for La Poste and Posti Finland Both France and Finland include the costs of cancellation and mail preparation in counter costs Because the U S Postal Service classifies these costs as part of mail processing we adjust the percentages of mail processing costs upward for France and Finland to reflect a similar treatment This has no effect on total costs and therefore only affects the mail processing percentage The number of deliveries per week varies among the posts in the sample Canada Finland and Portugal deliver five times per week Great Britain delivers 12 times weekly in urban areas and six in rural areas Consequently it is necessary to adjust the percentage of delivery costs for these posts to the level it would be with six deliveries per week as in the U S When the percentage of delivery cost is increased or decreased for a given post the percentage of mail processing cost is decreased or increased accordingly 6 4 CONFIRMING THE HYPOTHESIS 4 1 Data Canada Post Consignia Royal Mail Posti Finland and La Poste supplied the percentages of delivery and mail processing costs to us The authors supplied the data for CTT Correios de Portugal and Poste Italiane Only La Poste delivers unaddressed mail separately from normal mail Consequently the volumes and percentages of total cost for La Poste do not include unaddressed mail Unaddressed mail is included in the calculations for other posts The cost percentages reflect labor and non labor costs except for Germany The Deutsche Post percentages are derived from workforce full time equivalents contained in its annual report for FY 2001 and an internal Post Italiane study on German delivery operations developed in part from meetings with Deutsche Post management The Deutsche Post annual report provides the total number of full time equivalents involved in postal operations and the Poste Italiane document provides the number involved in delivery operations While this is a proxy for labor and non labor costs it is considered realistic since in the U S the use of workforce full time equivalents provide estimates within a few percentage points of those calculated with labor and non labor costs 6 The population density or more specifically the postal density the average time it takes to travel between addresses of a country has an impact on street delivery costs Ideally we could adjust for this if data were available See Bernard et al 2002 4 2 Empirical Findings Empirical findings from the investigation are presented in Figure 3 The top line represents delivery cost percentage of total cost as a function of pieces per capita as predicted by our cost model The bottom line represents the same for mail processing costs Figure 3 Functional Percentage of Total Costs Benchmarked by U S Costs and Volumes Percentage of Total Costs 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 Pieces per Capita With the exception of the lowest volume post Poste Italiane the model s predicted percentages are close to the actual percentages for delivery We think Poste Italiane a very low volume post may have a somewhat lower percentage of delivery costs than predicted owing to low coverage on very low volume routes especially in rural areas When carriers deliver to only a small number of stops on a route they tend to cover the route in a way more similar to a traveling salesman than following a fixed route past every stop Thus there may be less fixed costs on these routes than indicated by the elasticities embedded in the cost model based on U S costs which reflect very high coverage levels If this conjecture is correct then Italy s delivery percentages could be adjusted upwards by an unknown amount towards the predicted value and their mail processing costs would then have to be adjusted downwards A downward adjustment would also improve Italy s relation to the mail processing prediction but move Portugal further away Some of the deviation for Italy and Portugal may be due to the fact that they have proportionally much larger retail operations involving collection and acceptance than the U S and other posts For example Portugal s retail post office operations account for 21 percent of total costs while in the U S they account for approximately six percent Poste Italiane also has a relatively large percentage of costs in collection and acceptance 15 percent Nevertheless the authors cannot explain why Portugal s percentage of mail processing cost is so low in comparison to the other posts in the sample A significant virtue of these curves is that they are independent of the price of labor Thus by using this evaluation technique we are able to avoid the need for obtaining productive hourly costs translated into dollars using purchasing power parities It appears that other factors for which adjustments are not made do not cause significant differences This could be because these factors do not vary significantly from the U S do not drive costs significantly or tend to cancel each other out 4 3 Trend Analysis The bold lines in Figure 4 display trend curves for the actual processing and delivery cost percentages from the test countries 7 These curves were generated using Excel They have virtually the same shape as the curves predicted by the model and further confirm the fit between the model and the data The low delivery cost percentage of the low volume per capita country Italy pulls the delivery trend line down away from the predicted line The fact that the actual mail processing percentages for Italy and Portugal are about equidistant below and above the predicted values causes the mail processing trend line to match the model line at low volumes despite relatively large errors These disparities at low volumes between the trend and model lines reinforce our belief that the model is less useful in predicting costs for low per capita volume posts than it is for medium to high volume per capita posts It is to be expected that the accuracy of predictions will diminish as the range over which the predictions are made increases These trend lines were selected because they best fit the data For delivery percentages the trend line is y 46 943e 0 0004x with an R2 of 0 78 For mail processing percentages the trend line is y 10 869Ln x 38 407 with an R2 of 0 69

order to compare unit costs it is desirable to make the adjustments we have discussed above plus an adjustment for productive hourly wage in purchasing power parities PPP Data for these adjustments were not available except for Italy The U S values used in making adjustments for Poste Italiane data are listed in the appendix In the absence of actual cost data we compare model cost results to actual revenues For the posts in our sample we have used the model to estimate unit costs and adjusted only for deliveries per week Canada Finland U K and Portugal In Table 2 we compare these estimates with average revenue per piece converted to U S cents using OECD s PPP for 1999 Table 2 Comparison of Model Estimated Coststo Actual Revenue per Piece for 1999 U S cents Model Cost Revenue Estimates per Piecea Canada 43 41 Finland 34 39 France 38b 40b Germany 50 57 Italy 90 79c Portugal 62 54 U K 46 50 U S 31c a From annual reports and Posts of authors 2000 for Portugal b Includes unaddressed mail c Actual cost per piece The largest discrepancy appears to be Italy We know however that the Post Italiane productive hourly wage is three quarters of that of the U S Postal Service As stated in the introduction when we adjust for Italian labor costs worksharing mail mix and number of counters we get a modeled unit cost of 74 cents 6 CONCLUSIONS The principal conclusion is that empirical evidence corroborates the validity of this model because the predicted functional percentages of costs are reasonably close to actual values See Figure 3 In particular the general shape of the unit cost curve with respect to per capita volume appears to be valid for the posts of industrialized countries sampled See Figure 1 The model however is a more accurate predictor of the cost behavior of medium to large per capita volume posts than for small per capita volume posts The model also demonstrates that both volume and population are important explanatory factors of postal costs Clearly additional research is warranted Regulators and operators in any industrialized country are encouraged to use the data in the appendix on U S cost characteristics to make adjustments to the model and determine if the model forecasts costs with reasonable accuracy Of course we would not expect exact correspondence even after adjustments are made owing to differences in efficiency and
