 Background While the radiographic and histologic progression of fracture healing is well understood there are less data on the cytokines that regulate and control the healing process at the cellular level The bone morphogenetic proteins BMP have been found to be expressed in the fracture callus by immunostaining of the protein 1 2 3 as well as by measurement of mRNA 4 5 and in situ hybridization 6 7 The receptors for BMP are also up regulated during fracture repair 1 2 8 Morone et al 9 observed increased mRNA expression of both matrix genes and BMP genes during the healing of spinal fusions in rabbits There was a sequential expression of these genes in that BMP 6 peaked first followed by BMP 4 then BMP 2 and last by a second peak of BMP 6 expression 9 The data for BMP expression during fracture repair combined with the efficacy of the BMPs in stimulating bone induction and fracture healing have led to the concept that the BMPs are key molecules in the initiation of this healing process 10 Derangement of the expression of BMPs and other skeletally active cytokines may be important in understanding the failure of healing in delayed unions It is not clear why in some fractures the healing process seems to come to a halt and does not progress further without surgical intervention We have found that younger rats heal mid shaft femoral fractures faster than do older rats 11 In these earlier studies one year old rats failed to achieve normal biomechanical strength within 24 weeks after mid shaft femoral fracture 11 In contrast young rats achieved normal biomechanical strength by four weeks after fracture 12 In this model as the rats get older it takes progressively longer for them to begin a periosteal reaction after fracture and it takes longer to achieve bridging callus This slowing of fracture healing with age has been reported in humans 13 as well as in rats 14 15 In humans the time to union increased with age for humeral fractures 13 The reason for the slowing of fracture healing in older animals is not fully understood For some time it has been known that there are changes in the periosteal cell layer with age 16 Following fracture there is an increase in the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the fracture site This rate slows with age Fewer cells enter mitosis and more time is required for the cells to undergo mitosis 16 This may reflect a reduction in the number of osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal repair in older individuals 17 Alternatively changes in the expression of the cytokines controlling fracture healing would also affect the rate of healing Recent work has shown that the genes responsible for embryonic induction of skeletal tissue are also involved in fracture healing The BMPs are prominently expressed during embryonic tissue induction reviewed by 18 BMP 2 and BMP 4 have been reported in the fracture callus of rats 19 and mice 20 This led to the hypothesis that the delayed fracture healing in older individuals may be related to abnormalities in the BMP signaling pathway To test this hypothesis bone fracture was induced in young and older rats and gene expression was measured in the fracture callus at various times after fracture induction Expression of osteocalcin type I collagen and type II collagen were measured as markers of fracture callus formation BMP 2 BMP 4 and the type IA BMP receptor were measured as potential regulators of the healing process 2 9 19 20 Materials and Methods Rats Intact female Sprague Dawley rats were used at 6 weeks of age 136 3 g body weight at fracture or at 12 15 months of age 309 6 g at fracture They were purchased at 1 or 6 months of age respectively and housed with Teklad Rodent Diet W 8604 Harlan Madison WI and tap water ad libitum This work was done in an AAALAC accredited vivarium under a protocol approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee Surgery The animals were anesthetized with ketamine xylazine at approximately 30 mg 5 mg per kg body weight A small skin incision was made in the knee and the patella deflected A hole was drilled into the intercondylar notch and a stainless steel wire 1 0 mm diameter type 304 V O SWGX 400 Small Parts Inc Miami Lakes FL was inserted into the medullary canal and recessed slightly The muscle was sutured and the skin closed with wound clips As described earlier 11 a closed mid diaphyseal fracture was induced using a Bonnarens and Einhorn fracture induction device 21 The device was preset to 1 mm of travel The 544 g weight was dropped from a height of 18 cm for the young rats or 34 cm for the older rats Randomly selected intact rats of the same age were used for 0 time controls Femoral radiographs were made at fracture at one week after fracture and at euthanasia Rats were euthanized at 1 2 4 and 6 weeks after fracture The times were chosen based on the study by Morone et al 9 and on our experience with fracture healing in younger rats 12 The femora were rapidly harvested and a portion of the femur was collected using a Dremel tool Dremel Racine WI with an ultra thin flex diamond disc saw Stoelting Wood Dale IL Two cuts were made at right angles to the long axis of the femur on either side of the visible callus on the periosteal surface of the femur The tissue collection included any portion of the femur whose external surface was altered by the fracture repair process In practice this collected bone sample was one third of the overall femoral length was centered on the callus and included the callus cortical bone and marrow elements The sample was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C until analyzed Gene Expression Tissues were homogenized with a Polytron sonicating homogenizer PT10 35 Brinkman Instrument Inc Westbury NY and RNA was extracted with TRIzol Gibco BRL Gaithersburg MD The RNA samples 0 8 g were then reverse transcribed at 42 C for 15 minutes using random hexamers as primers This was then amplified by 35 to 50 cycles of the polymerase chain reaction PCR GeneAmp RNA PCR kit N808 0143 Perkin Elmer Foster City CA with primers Table 1 designed for osteocalcin type I collagen 1 type II collagen BMP 2 BMP 4 type IA BMP receptor 18S ribosomal RNA or G3PDH Cat 5507 Clontech Laboratories Inc Palo Alto CA The cycling conditions were 95 C for 2 minutes 80 C for 5 minutes with hot start addition of the Taq DNA polymerase 35 to 50 cycles of 95 C for 15 sec and 58 62 C annealing temp Table 1 for 30 sec and finishing with a single step of 72 C for 7 minutes The resulting cDNA samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 1 5 agarose gel with ethidium bromide in 0 5X TBE buffer at 100 volts A water blank lane and a lane containing 1 0 g of a 100 bp DNA ladder Cat 15628 109 Gibco BRL as a molecular weight marker were run on each gel The agarose gels were blotted to nylon membranes Hybond N Amersham Arlington Heights IL The amplimers were UV cross linked and hybridized with Rapid Hyb buffer Amersham at 42 C using 32P ATP end labeled oligonucleotides Table 1 G3PDH probe from Clontech as probes The membranes were washed with 6X SSC 0 1 SDS 4X SSC 0 1 SDS and 2X SSC 0 1 SDS for consecutive 15 minute washes at 25 C The radioactivity on the Southern blots was quantified with a Fujifilm Bio Imaging Analyzer BAS 1500 with MacBAS Ver 2 5 software Rectangles of constant area were defined and radioactivity was recorded in units of photo stimulated luminescence PSL The samples were organized so that one sample from each time point for both ages was present on each gel and on each resulting blot This resulted in a total of three blots for each gene These three blots were hybridized at the same time with a single preparation of labeled probe Statistics Individual treatment groups are presented as mean SEM Comparisons were made with the Mann Whitney U test For the measurement of gene expression there were three to four samples per time point per age except for the older rats at 2 n 2 and 6 n 1 weeks after fracture due to unanticipated attrition For the younger rats at 0 1 2 4 and 6 weeks after fracture there were 3 3 4 3 and 4 rats per group respectively while for the older rats there were 3 3 2 3 and 1 rats per group respectively The experiment was designed to have three rats per group However one older rat at 2 weeks after fracture was unusable due to bone infection For the four rats designated for study at 6 weeks after fracture two were lost due to the intramedullary pin backing out necessitating early euthanasia and one was infected and therefore unusable Results Radiology Radiographs were made of all rats after surgery one week later and at the time of euthanasia There were similar mid diaphyseal fractures in both the younger and the older rats At one week after fracture there was an obvious periosteal reaction in the younger rats By six weeks after fracture the younger rats had healed their fractures with abundant mineralized callus and remodeling was underway In contrast there is little change in the radiographs of the older rats at one week after fracture At six weeks after fracture these older rats had not healed their fractures and showed only minimal periosteal reaction All younger rats achieved bridging callus by six weeks after fracture whereas none of the older rats achieved bridging callus by this time data not shown Time course for gene expression Most genes had the same pattern of low levels of expression in unfractured bone There was an increased mRNA level after fracture which led to a peak in activity at one or two weeks after fracture Thereafter mRNA expression levels fell to very low levels at four weeks after fracture and undetectable levels at six weeks after fracture Figs 1and 2 The 7 younger rats were well healed radiographically by this time and their decreased gene expression was understandable However for the 15 month old rats reported in detail here there was the same pattern of low level of gene expression at four to six weeks after fracture Since these rats had not healed radiographically the reduction in gene expression to baseline was more difficult to explain Additional studies were done with 16 one year old rats which confirmed this pattern Seven of these one year old rats were studied at four weeks after fracture and the other 9 one year old rats were studied at six weeks after fracture These one year old rats had the same pattern of low to undetectable gene expression at four to six weeks after fracture Thus a total of 20 rats at 12 15 months of age have been studied at four to six weeks after fracture and all had low to undetectable gene expression for both skeletal matrix genes and for BMP related genes Matrix genes Three genes were measured as an index of matrix synthesis osteocalcin and type I collagen for bone and type II collagen for cartilage Both osteocalcin mRNA levels Fig 1 top and type I collagen mRNA levels Fig 1 middle tended to be higher in the unfractured 0 time younger rats than in the 0 time older rats Fracture resulted in a rise in gene expression in both age groups to a peak at two weeks after fracture Thereafter gene expression levels fell to low levels lower than the 0 time controls for each age group at four and six weeks after fracture Fig 1 Type II collagen mRNA expression differed from that of type I collagen in being undetectable in the diaphyseal bone of the 0 time controls in both age groups Fig 1 bottom This reflected a lack of cartilage synthesis in the intact diaphysis of the femur Fracture resulted in a rise in gene expression for both age groups to a peak at one to two weeks after fracture Both age groups decreased the mRNA expression of this gene at four and six weeks after fracture to undetectable levels Fig 1 bottom BMP related genes Three genes were measured to evaluate the regulatory control process over fracture healing BMP 2 mRNA levels were undetectable in the 0 time controls of both age groups Fig 2 top Fracture induced the expression of this gene Expression peaked at one to two weeks after fracture for both age groups BMP 2 expression for both age groups fell to undetectable levels at four and six weeks after fracture Fig 2 top BMP 4 mRNA levels were also undetectable in the 0 time controls for both age groups Fig 2 middle Fracture increased gene expression to a peak at one week after fracture in both age groups There was a tendency for the older rats to have higher BMP 4 levels at weeks 1 and 2 after fracture P 0 10 Gene expression levels declined to undetectable levels at four and six weeks after fracture Fig 2 middle In contrast the type IA BMP receptor mRNA levels were detectable in the 0 time control younger rats but not in the older rats Fig 2 bottom Fracture enhanced gene expression several fold in both age groups to a peak at one week after fracture The mRNA levels at four and six weeks after fracture were very low to undetectable in both groups Fig 2 bottom Housekeeping genes Gene expression data are usually normalized to the expression of another gene whose mRNA levels are not affected by the experimental variables being studied This controls for and corrects for variation in extraction reverse transcription and the polymerase chain reaction In this project 18S ribosomal RNA was found to give a signal at each time after fracture in each sample However the 18S rRNA amplimer varied with time after fracture data not shown Other housekeeping genes that are widely used were also studied and were found to vary in expression with time after fracture Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase G3PDH actin and tubulin increased in both age groups following fracture Expression then decreased in both young and older rats at four and six weeks after fracture data not shown This response to treatment made these genes unsuitable for normalization of the expression of the skeletally related genes that were described above Discussion In this study we have measured mRNA gene expression in female rats for six weeks after femoral fracture Females were chosen because female rats do not grow as large as male rats 22 This then minimized the difference in body size between the two ages Young mammals rapidly progress to fracture healing as we 11 and others 13 14 15 have shown before In contrast older rats and older humans heal more slowly 11 13 14 15 In our earlier studies comparable rats at one year of age failed to regain normal skeletal biomechanics within six months of femoral fracture while younger rats regained normal biomechanics within four weeks after fracture 11 In the present study the goal was to examine possible alterations in expression of genes related to the BMPs in order to explain this failure of the older rats to heal promptly Despite the difference in age all genes studied increased in expression after fracture followed by a decrease to baseline values by 4 weeks after fracture This decrease in the mRNA gene expression to undetectable levels at 4 6 weeks after fracture was the major conclusion of this study The decrease occurred in rats of both ages and was independent of the healing status of the fractures This was a surprising result and occurred for both matrix and regulatory genes It was unexpected since the genes under study were genes needed for fracture healing We had anticipated that the older rats would have an up regulation of regulatory gene expression to attempt to accelerate the healing process We speculate that this decrease in gene expression is responsible for the failure of healing to progress more quickly in the older rats Our results appear to violate the principle of negative feedback control over biological processes A slower healing sequence in older individuals might be caused by a diminished number of cells available to effect the repair 16 17 This inadequate cellular response should lead to enhanced cytokine signaling by the BMPs to attempt to elicit a healing response by the bone cells The enhanced signal should persist until healing is complete The failure of enhanced BMP expression at four and six weeks after fracture in the older rats is difficult to explain It may suggest that there is a constant time of stimulation of cytokine production following injury rather than negative feedback control over the process of fracture healing Injury may initiate a stimulus for bone healing that leads to enhanced BMP production for only a short time For the younger rats this time period seems adequate to allow healing to occur For the older rats a more prolonged signal may be required The evaluation of this hypothesis will require additional experimentation There are changes in the periosteal cell layer with advancing age 16 Following fracture there is an increase in the rate of mitosis in the periosteum near the fracture site This rate is altered with age Fewer cells enter mitosis and more time is required for the cells to undergo mitosis 16 This may reflect a reduction in the number of osteogenic stem cells available for skeletal repair in older individuals 17 Despite this we have extracted a similar amount of mRNA from the fracture site with a similar increase in gene expression in both the older and the younger rats There was no evidence for a failure of gene expression for any of the genes studied thus far in the fracture callus of older rats The role of the BMPs has been studied in fracture healing in rats 2 3 5 mice 4 7 8 and rabbits 6 and in healing of spinal fusions in rabbits 9 For the most part these studies were done in younger animals who heal their bone fractures quickly The rise in expression of the BMPs in these animals persists for the entire length of fracture healing through the point of formation of bridging callus By correlating the gene up regulation to the stage of fracture healing it gives the impression that the BMPs are regulating all stages of fracture healing In contrast we have used age as an experimental model to slow the process of fracture healing 11 This serves to separate the various radiographic stages of fracture healing and allows us to associate progression of healing with specific sets of up regulated genes In the present study expression of BMP 2 and BMP 4 along with the type IA BMP receptor decreased to baseline prior to the formation of bridging callus This suggests that there may be a constant time of up regulation of gene expression following fracture in the rat Fracture is followed by four weeks of up regulation of the stimulatory cytokines after fracture and healing must take place within that window of time if it is to occur The older rats cannot respond that quickly and fail to complete the healing process Alternatively these cytokines may only be needed for the formation of the soft callus Once the soft callus is formed these genes regress to baseline Other genes not yet identified may be needed to stimulate the formation of bridging callus on the scaffold of cartilage and fibrous tissue formed as part of the soft callus If the latter hypothesis is correct there should be expression of other cytokines late in the healing process to stimulate bone formation We are currently engaged in a broader search for such genes In the unfractured bone samples gene expression was undetectable in the older rats for all of the measured genes shown in the Figures An exception to this was osteocalcin for which there was a low basal level of gene expression in the older rats In contrast the unfractured bones from the young rats had clearly detectable amplimers for osteocalcin type I collagen and the type IA BMP receptor This higher level of basal gene expression reflected the greater growth rate in the diaphyseal bone of the younger rats Unfractured bone of both ages lacked detectable amplimers for type II collagen reflecting the lack of appreciable cartilage synthesis in the diaphysis of the long bones There was a positive 18S rRNA signal in each sample This is evidence that the failure to detect amplimers for both the matrix genes and the BMP related genes at 4 and 6 weeks after fracture was related to decreased mRNA expression of these genes The positive 18S signal would argue against technical difficulties in detecting expression in these samples The unstable expression of housekeeping genes after fracture is not surprising There is considerable increase in metabolic activity by the bone cells in response to fracture and there is also a change in the cell population of the fracture callus in comparison to intact diaphyseal bone It is not unusual to see change in the expression of housekeeping genes with large changes in cell activity 23 24 25 26 We have considered whether instability could be impeding fracture healing in these older rats and we cannot find evidence of it All rats have intramedullary fixation In addition there has been no evidence of a hypertrophic callus caused by instability in the femora of the older rats that fail to reach union Instead after the fracture is induced there is a slowing in the formation of the soft callus as revealed by the later peak in type II collagen There is a more profound slowing of the bony reaction on the periosteal surface of the femoral diaphysis The young rats have a visible periosteal reaction at week 1 while the older rats do not form mineralized tissue on the periosteal surface until the fourth week after fracture Even if instability were present this would not impede cytokine formation since in a mouse model unstable tibial fractures were associated with prolonged expression of Indian hedgehog and BMP 6 27 These findings have led us to hypothesize inadequate cytokine signaling in the older rats to explain the delayed fracture healing The number of animals used in the present study while adequate to test for early decreased gene expression in the older rats was inadequate to compare each individual time point between the two ages This is currently being tested in a larger experiment Conclusions In summary mid diaphyseal fractures of the femur in rats were followed by increased mRNA expression for osteocalcin type I collagen 1 type II collagen BMP 2 BMP 4 and the type IA BMP receptor In the younger rats there was elevated gene expression until fracture healing occurred In contrast in the older rats fracture healing was slower so that cytokine gene expression returned to baseline prior to radiographic or biomechanical healing of the fractures This decreased expression of bone inductive genes prior to an adequate biological response suggests the absence of negative feedback regulation over fracture healing
