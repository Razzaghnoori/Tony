 Books Texaco by Patrick Chamoiseau translated by Rose Myriam R jouis and Val Vinokurov Pantheon Chamoiseau s 1992 novel newly translated from the French wins him instant canonization and comparisons to Gabriel Garc a M rquez V S Naipaul Salman Rushdie and Michel de Montaigne This 150 year history of a black Martinique family garnered France s prestigious Prix Goncourt It earns praise for having restored grittiness to the whimsical tradition of magical realism And its Creole inflected language is described as prose saturated in a kind of bemused gorgeousness Richard Bernstein the New York Times The New Yorker s John Updike dissents calling Chamoiseau too self conscious a C line who has read L vi Strauss and Derrida His narrative flows sluggishly molasses flecked with bits of sugar cane John Wayne s America The Politics of Celebrity by Garry Wills Simon Schuster A universal pan for the hyper prolific cultural critic s latest book Wills analysis of Wayne as a cultural icon is deemed pretentious long winded and jargon filled In the New York Review of Books Michael Wood says Wills resorted to a bundle of rather weary paradoxes the lost but unforgettable frontier the wilderness which is society s favorite dream Excerpts of the book are available here The Divorce Culture by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead Knopf Harsh words from across the ideological spectrum for Whitehead s attack on divorce and the permissive culture that tolerates it The New York Times Book Review says her scholarship rates no higher than the the popular expert opinion and self help books she rightly criticizes The New Republic s Margaret Talbot says Whitehead and other divorcephobes ignore America s history of liberal divorce laws the economics of women in the workplace and common sense Parents who make each other s lives a snarling misery probably won t make their children s lives a bower of happiness Even the conservative Weekly Standard faults Whitehead for shoddy scholarship and pop psychology For more debate on divorce see the Dialogue between Katha Pollitt and David Blankenhorn in Slate When the Sons of Heaven Meet the Daughters of the Earth by Fernanda Eberstadt Knopf Eberstadt s sendup of the New York art world of the 1980s is pronounced a success In the New York Times Roxana Robinson says the novel about an Upper West Side patroness and a New Hampshire painter hailed as the white Basquiat has fun with philosophical questions Where is the useful intersection between art and commerce How corrosive is fame What is Outsider Art anyway The Washington Times Brooke Allen likes the book but complains that Eberstadt s tone becomes overly messianic It sometimes reads like a pitch against the National Endowment for the Arts Movies The Devil s Own Columbia Pictures Production problems and bad advance press boded ill for the latest thriller from Alan J Pakula All the President s Men Multiple writers tried their hand at the script which star Brad Pitt publicly attacked But the consensus is that the film emerges solid if uninspired with grace notes of moral complexity The friendship between an honest New York cop Harrison Ford and an Irish Republican Army terrorist Pitt eschews the black and white formulas typical of suspense films says Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly The New Yorker s Terrence Rafferty on the other hand finds the premise an astonishingly banal male bonding motif Click here for The Devil s Own home page Chasing Amy Miramax Kevin Smith s low budget romantic comedy the third in a series that began with Clerks 1994 wins favor for introducing a twist into the familiar boy meets girl plot here boy meets lesbian As obstacles in the course of true love go that s fairly major says Rafferty The film is a devastating critique of the hetero male ego says David Ansen of Newsweek The direction however is dismissed by Rafferty as amateurish Miramax serves up stills and clips Theater The Young Man From Atlanta Longacre Theatre New York Mixed reviews for the Broadway debut of Horton Foote s Pulitzer Prize winning play Critics applaud performances by Rip Torn The Larry Sanders Show and Shirley Knight as a middle aged Houston couple mourning their son s death They get all the small regional footnotes of gesture and inflection just right But these actors also convey the sense of an internal furnace of pain and anxiety that gives fevered glow to such minutiae Ben Brantley the New York Times However the play itself is found wanting Says New York s John Simon There s good down home Southern fried atmosphere but where the hell is the play Updates In the New Republic Tony Judt calls Sidney Blumenthal s claim in The New Yorker that Whittaker Chambers attacked Alger Hiss because of spurned gay love a smear 1990s style Blumenthal s contemptible insinuations are a reminder that there is nearly always something provincial and self serving about the response of American intellectuals to
