for the Japanese atrocities inflicted on British POWs in Burma during World War II The London Evening Standard said in an editorial that no reasonable person could feel any personal animus against

incentive to influence the election the editorial said What next voter air miles It said that the first multi party elections to be held on the soil of the People s Republic of China might not please those who would wish Hong Kong to be a less political society but once it has been let out the electoral genie is hard to put back in the bottle In Indonesia newspapers have been competing to denounce
