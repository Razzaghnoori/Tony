 France in the Doghouse France has been barred from some of NATO s top secret military plans because the United States fears they will be passed on to the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic the Daily Telegraph reported Friday from Washington quoting a senior Western military source The source said Washington has started cutting Paris out of the loop on some operations because of the worry of information being handed either to the Serbs direct or indirectly through the Russians In an editorial headlined Send in the troops the Telegraph said that with an impetus building to NATO s advantage the alliance should seize this moment to announce a new goal and new means to achieve it The first is the independence of Kosovo the second is the commitment of ground forces a move that senior military leaders consider essential to success The deployment of ground troops has been gathering ever greater support in the British press since it became clear that the bombing is strengthening rather than weakening Milosevic s resolve to complete the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo A majority of papers both conservative and liberal have now come out in favor of it with one important exception Rupert Murdoch s tabloid Sun Britain s largest circulation paper While the upscale Murdoch papers the Times and the Sunday Times now support ground intervention the Sun backs Prime Minister Tony Blair in his promise not to send in British troops While it bursts with aggression against Milosevic Clobba Slobba being its rallying cry the Sun threatened Monday to withdraw its support for Blair if he changed his mind Don t Send Our Troops off To Die was its front page headline The weightiest British opponent of the war remains the Times op ed columnist Simon Jenkins who writing from the United States Friday said that the misreading of Mr Milosevic by Nato deserves to rank with Gallipoli and Pearl Harbor in the annals of military incompetence He wrote It is grimly intriguing that the American pro war lobby is made up of mostly younger people who do not remember or have forgotten the Vietnam escalation The issue once again is not the plausibility of the operation but the esteem of Uncle Sam and confidence in America s military omnipotence As for whether a Kosovan war will be anything but an American one you can hear read and talk about this subject from dawn to dusk and not hear a word about British involvement beyond the complaint that America is having to rescue Europe from another of its messes French papers Friday contained reports from Kosovo by a group of French journalists who spent time with combatants of the Kosovo Liberation Army Le Figaro reported that the KLA claims to control just about 40 percent of Kosovo and to be in close contact with NATO forces from which it could call in air support at any time It quoted Capt Florin Kulaj commander of the KLA s 850 strong 136 th Brigade as saying that he had identified ground targets for NATO attacks such as a bridge used by Serb forces which had been bombed on Wednesday But Capt Kulaj also admitted that the KLA was surrounded by Serb troops and short of weapons New recruits hardly get one Kalashnikov between two of them he said We don t ask the West to send ground troops If our men are given the means to fight we will be able to defend the civilian population of Kosovo But Lib ration reported from Washington that the United States is still reluctant to arm the KLA because it doubts its democratic credentials According to Le Monde Friday most of the Russian media are deaf and blind to the Kosovo refugee crisis After two weeks of conflict most newspapers continue to see it only as a showdown between NATO confused with the United States and considered the aggressor and the regime of Slobodan Milosevic president of Yugoslavia it reported Accordingly not a single newspaper has devoted a front page story or even a headline to the exodus of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo Russian press comments from the past week selected by Le Monde s Moscow correspondent included the following Vremia said The horrible descriptions of massacres of Albanian Kosovars in the West are wrong and exaggerated New Izvestiya offered While the president of the Unites States plays golf tens of thousands of innocent people are fleeing from the hell unleashed by NATO airplanes and Nezavissimaya Gazeta said that NATO was conducting barbaric bombardments under the false pretext of a humanitarian catastrophe While Le Figaro in a front page editorial said that the tide is now turning in NATO s favor and marveled at the astonishing unity of the alliance so far Milan s Corriere della Sera berated Italian Prime Minister Massimo D Alema for condoning open revolt against the war within his coalition government Noting that Communist Party leader Armando Cossutta was seeking a meeting with Milosevic and that another coalition party was calling on the government to distance itself from NATO while Italy is at war and its airmen running the risk of being shot down Sergio Romano wrote in a front page comment I have tried to find a
