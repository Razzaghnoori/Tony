 Too True To Be Good Not everything you read on the World Wide Web is true Not everything you read in the New York Times is true either So when you read about scientific breakthroughs how do you know what to believe Partly you trust your instincts A theory that life evolved from clay is more inherently plausible than a theory that life evolved from Play Doh Partly you consider the source A Harvard professor is more credible than a Dartmouth dishwasher And partly you rely on expert judgments If a prestigious journal has agreed to publish the clay theory it s probably wrong Yes I meant to say that If a prestigious journal publishes a theory it s probably wrong Given two equally plausible theories from equally credible sources that have passed equally strict scrutiny the one that makes it into a top journal has a smaller chance of being right Here s why Editors like to publish theories they find surprising And the best way to surprise an editor is to be wrong That s not to say that editors are reckless At least in mathematics and economics the two fields where I can testify from personal experience the editorial process is rigorously demanding Long before an article is submitted for publication the author is expected to circulate drafts among experts in the field and to respond to their criticisms and comments a process that typically takes years Only then is the now heavily revised article formally submitted whereupon the editor handpicks an expert referee to examine it line by line a process that can easily take another year or more Are referees ever lax and careless Surely Are they lax and careless with articles of genuine importance In my observation essentially never Through multiple rounds of correspondence referees demand satisfaction regarding every important detail In many cases the author will visit the referee s home institution for a semester or a year to be available for periodic grilling That s exactly what s so damning about the hoax perpetrated in 1996 by Alan Sokal Sokal s paper intentionally stripped of logic evidence and even meaning was accepted for publication in the cultural studies journal Social Text True this was a one time event but it was an event so far removed from anything that could possibly occur in a legitimate academic enterprise that it converted agnostics like me who had doubted the status of cultural studies as an intellectual discipline into hard core cynics with no doubt whatsoever In a serious economics journal it would be impossible to publish an article like Sokal s But it would not be impossible or even unusual to publish a carefully reasoned article that s still wrong That s because of the bias I mentioned earlier Given two papers that have both survived the vetting process editors tend to prefer the more surprising which means that on average they prefer the one that s wrong It s easy to see how the same dynamic could work at a newspaper Man bites dog is a better story than dog bites man but it s also more likely to be wrong even if both stories are reported by equally reliable witnesses In general and this observation is a mainstay of college statistics courses when you think you ve seen something unusual you re more likely to be mistaken than when you think you ve seen something ordinary But it s the unusual that makes the front page A few years ago economics professors J Bradford De Long and Kevin Lang devised an ingenious way to determine just how many published economic hypotheses are actually true They looked through several years worth of issues of the top economics journals and found 78 hypotheses that were confirmed by strong evidence the sort of evidence that led the authors to accept their own hypotheses Another 198 hypotheses were rejected by their authors In exactly none of the 78 cases could the confirmation be called overwhelming But that s OK Strong evidence is after all strong evidence even when it s a little shy of overwhelming In most cases overwhelming evidence is too much to ask for because evidence can be hard to collect and hard to interpret So no individual article can be criticized for failing to live up to an unattainable standard But said De Long and Lang out of 78 true hypotheses surely there should be at least a few that are overwhelmingly confirmed In fact they gave a precise definition of the word overwhelming according to which roughly 10 percent of all true hypotheses should come packaged with overwhelming evidence So if all 78 hypotheses are true then roughly 7 8 of them call it eight should be confirmed overwhelmingly And they re not OK so maybe that s because not all 78 are true Maybe only 50 are true In that case five should be confirmed overwhelmingly Or maybe only 30 are true in which case three should be confirmed overwhelmingly The problem is that exactly zero are confirmed overwhelmingly and zero is 10 percent of zero So out of 78 confirmed hypotheses it seems that approximately zero are true Using a more sophisticated version of the same techniques De Long and Lang concluded that some of the 78 confirmed hypotheses might be true but probably not more than about a third of them In other words when a published article in a top journal presents evidence that its hypothesis is true its hypothesis is probably false It would be very interesting to perform the same experiment with say medical journals instead of economics journals I d be very surprised if the results were substantially different If this makes you feel pessimistic about the progress of science keep in mind that we can learn a lot from even a very few true hypotheses submerged in a sea of false ones And here s another ray of hope De Long and Lang s results were published in the prestigious Journal of Political Economy so they re probably wrong to begin with And this account of them was published in Slate so it s probably wrong too
