 Background Birth weight is a composite of fetal growth and length of gestation each of which has different contributors and different sequelae Removing the contribution of gestational age to birth weight is a first step in understanding the determinants of fetal growth Preterm birth is a prime predictor of neonatal complications mortality and developmental delay 1 2 Also birth weight may predict both short and long term adverse outcomes For example higher birth weight among term infants is associated with birth complications 3 as well as reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and hypertension in later life but an increased risk of obesity 4 5 6 7 8 9 In 1996 Alexander et al published birth weight curves using a 1991 nationwide United States reference later updated using 1994 1996 data 10 11 However these authors included weights only for the 5 th 10 th 50 th 90 th and 95 thpercentiles at each completed week of gestation While such categorical divisions may serve for clinical or demographic use many research studies have been hampered by the traditional classifications small for gestational age SGA and large for gestational age LGA historically defined as those infants below the 10 thor above the 90 thpercentile at each gestational age 12 These divisions are arbitrary and such gross categorizations may mask differences in risk within or between populations In addition associations of fetal growth with later disease appear to span the entire birth weight spectrum and are not limited to infants above or below a particular cut point 13 Thus precise determination of birth weight relative to gestational age is needed to understand both the determinants of intrauterine growth and the sequelae of altered growth The purpose of our analysis was to create a more nearly continuous reference measure of birth weight for gestational age using a recent nationwide dataset Methods We obtained data from the National Center for Health Statistics 1999 and 2000 Natality Data Sets on CD ROM 14 These public use data files include information recorded on birth certificates from all 3 963 465 live births in 1999 and 4 063 823 live births in 2000 that occurred in the United States We limited analysis to singletons born to United States resident mothers at 22 to 44 completed weeks gestational age n 7 609 221 We included only births in which the gestational age was determined from a recorded last menstrual period and for which plurality birth weight and baby s sex were recorded n 6 714 495 We next trimmed the data to exclude birth weights inconsistent with the gestational age according to the criteria published by Alexander et al 10 We thus retained information on 6 690 717 babies For each completed week of gestation we divided the total number of births into 100 equally sized groups each representing an increment of 1 percentile point We then used a resistant nonlinear smoothing technique 4325H 15 twice to account for the same birth weight value straddling several percentiles within each week of gestation which might represent a bias towards reporting round numbers of birth weight values This approach differs from that used by Alexander et al 10 who smoothed across gestational age groups We report the highest weight in each group except in the heaviest group We present tables for all individuals as well as those stratified by the baby s sex and birth order For situations in which a normally distributed index of birth weight for gestational age may be desirable we provide what we term a z value printed in Table 1 see additional file worksheet Table 1 z values In many analyses a z score for a subject is determined by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation from a standardization population The z scores from the sample are interpreted as if they arise from a normally distributed population In our analysis however we use data from the entire population of annual births in the United States not just a sample obviating the need for sampling strategies or normality assumptions In fact the distribution of birth weights at each completed week of gestation was not normal in this complete dataset Kolmogorov Smirnov test p 0 01 for all weeks For example for an infant born at 427 g at 24 weeks assuming a normal distribution of birth weight would assign a z score of 1 28 10 thpercentile whereas using our method the same infant would be assigned a z value of 1 695 5 thpercentile a difference of 0 4 units Therefore in comparison with the reference group this infant is lighter than it would appear using a normal distribution assumption Additional file Click here for file In contrast to this usual practice we first calculated actual percentile ranks and then assigned z values for each percentile This amounts to a non parametric transformation to a normal distribution One can manipulate the z values as if they were conventional z scores Thus a research subject in the 5 thpercentile or with a z value of 1 695 is lighter than 95 and heavier than 4 of the reference population at that gestational age We provide the z value corresponding to the middle of each percentile step e g for the 5 thpercentile which spans babies from 4 to 5 we present the z value corresponding to 4 5 Babies with weights greater than the 99 thpercentile should be assigned a z value of 2 576 corresponding to 99 5 We performed all analyses using SAS version 8 2 SAS Institute Cary NC with the exception of the smoothing procedure for which we used STATA version 7 STATA Corporation College Station TX Results The number of infants at each gestational age ranged from a low of 2 497 at 22 weeks to a maximum of 1 677 211 at 39 weeks There were 3 423 215 51 2 boys and 3 267 502 48 8 girls A total of 2 755 841 41 2 mothers were primiparous There were 3 979 490 59 5 infants born to non Hispanic white mothers and 954 021 14 4 born to non Hispanic black mothers For all births Table 2 shows the birth weight delineating the top of each percentile step from 1 through 99 percent for each completed week of gestation see additional file worksheet Table 2 All The top row of the table reports the number of observations represented per percentile cell For example at 24 weeks of gestation there were approximately 4200 reference births or 42 births per cell at 39 weeks of gestation there were 16 772 per cell In Figure 1 we show that the 10 th 50 th and 90 thpercentiles from this analysis of 1999 and 2000 births are virtually identical to those published by Alexander et al based upon the combined 1994 1996 birth cohorts 11 This figure displays the expected increasing slopes during the third trimester and a leveling off beyond 40 weeks previously seen in menstrually dated pregnancies 10 16 The maximum variance in the estimated percentile cut point occurs at the 50 thpercentile within each gestation week cohort For the 24 week cohort of all births the point estimate of the 50th percentile is 652 grams and the 95 confidence interval for the point estimate includes values between 648 and 655 grams This includes the presented values for the 48th through 51st percentile and z values between 0 038 and 0 013 Thus the birth weight z score should be treated as a covariate measured with error 17 though the error is very small even in this worst case For more extreme percentiles at 24 weeks the confidence interval is smaller for percentiles greater than 84 or less than 13 the interval excludes the values for both neighboring percentiles Similarly as the number of births per percentile increases the confidence interval at 50 gets smaller For weeks with more than 80 births per percentile 28 weeks the confidence interval even at 50 excludes the neighboring percentiles Tables 3 and 4 contain percentile limits for boys and girls see additional file worksheets Table 3 Males and Table 4 Females As others have reported 11 18 boys were generally heavier than girls at each gestational age Figure 2 Tables 5 and 6 provide percentile values for firstborn and non firstborn infants see additional file worksheets Table 5 Firstborn and Table 6 Nonfirstborn Children born to parous mothers had higher birth weights at each gestational age as anticipated Figure 3 18 19 Finally Tables 7 and 8 present birth weight percentiles for infants born to non Hispanic white and black mothers only see additional file worksheets Table 7 Whiteonly and Table 8 Blackonly From approximately 33 gestational weeks onwards babies born to non Hispanic white mothers are heavier than those born to black mothers Figure 4 as has been seen previously 11 Table 9summarizes the contents of Tables 2 8 Tables 2 through 8 are available for investigators to download electronically see additional file Investigators can then compare their data against these reference data using the statistical software package of their choice In most cases the reference data including all births Table 2 should be used and researchers wishing to account for infant sex maternal race or parity can do so using statistical adjustment with their own data However if such adjustment is not possible then Tables 3 8 can be used We provide Table 10 which includes selected data from Tables 1 2 3 and 4 as an example for the use of our method The percentile assigned to an infant is the smallest one with a value larger than the infant s birth weight Thus an infant weighing 2500 grams born at 37 completed weeks of gestation would be assigned to the 9 thpercentile This percentile which includes infants from 8 thto 9 thpercentile corresponds to a z value of 1 372 If the investigator preferred to use the sex specific tables the same infant would be at the 7 thpercentile with a z value of 1 514 if a boy and at the 11 thpercentile with a z value of 1 254 if a girl In some cases the same birth weight straddles several percentiles for a given gestational age despite smoothing particularly at the lowest gestational ages This is an expected occurrence when a large number of birth weights have identical recorded values In such cases we recommend that users assign the mean of the z values crossed by the single birth weight Discussion In this paper we have used 1999 and 2000 United States nationwide Natality databases to generate multiple reference percentiles for birth weight at each completed week of gestation Birth weight rose in a non linear pattern as gestational age increased In concordance with published data at each gestational age birth weights were higher among boys than girls and among non firstborn infants than firstborns Near term infants born to non Hispanic white mothers were larger than those born to non Hispanic blacks Our more detailed data correspond well with the limited percentiles published by Alexander et al Figure 1 which have been used as a reference standard within the United States 10 11 Our data should prove useful to investigators working to understand both the determinants and the sequelae of fetal growth The electronic publication of these data allows for dissemination and widespread use of such a detailed reference Previous studies have been hampered by the lack of a continuous measure of birth weight independent of gestational age We first consider previous approaches for the use of fetal growth as an outcome The interactions among fetal maternal and environmental factors that influence fetal growth remain poorly understood Removing the contribution of gestational age to birth weight is a first step in understanding the roles of these factors in determining fetal growth 20 21 Many researchers have attempted to remove the influence of gestational age when studying predictors of birth weight by using the categories small SGA large LGA and appropriate for gestational age AGA 22 23 However this categorization reduces the power to detect small associations between fetal exposures and birth weight unless there is a change in the relationship exactly at the arbitrary cutpoint This is a particular problem when the size of the association is small in magnitude Additionally comparing SGA or LGA with AGA infants inhibits study of variation within the majority of babies that are AGA Others have used various methods to control for gestational age when investigating determinants of fetal growth One procedure has been to use a birth weight ratio This measure is calculated by dividing an infant s birth weight by a reference median birth weight at the given gestational age 16 24 25 However the reference median is chosen this ratio will assume a linear relationship between birth weight and its influences across the range of birth weights which may not be correct Another approach has been to include gestational age in a multiple regression equation along with other potential predictors of birth weight This strategy has been used to generate a predicted weight against which an individual baby s weight can be compared 16 26 Like the birth weight ratio regression analysis also typically assumes a linear relationship between birth weight and gestational age This assumption may or may not be appropriate but in any case is not required by our method which is based on actual data In addition to examining determinants of fetal growth adjusting birth weight for gestational age is also needed to understand the influence of fetal growth on later outcomes While birth weight alone may predict risk for adult diseases 8 27 most published data emanate from an era when few premature babies survived until adulthood Future studies of the early life origins of adult disease will require disentangling the effects of length of gestation from fetal growth A continuous measure is needed since many studies in this field suggest associations that span the entire range of birth weight and are not limited to birth weight extremes For use of fetal growth as a predictor variable previously published methods either assume a normal distribution of birth weights at each completed week of gestation 20 or include both birth weight and gestational age in multivariable regression models 28 29 30 However these approaches are limited because they assume either no relationship or a linear relationship between birth weight and gestational age Our method provides comprehensive reference values from broadly based nationwide data without making parametric functional or other modeling assumptions It is useful whether fetal growth is used as an outcome or as an exposure predictor These results are not intended to assign a percentile to an individual infant for clinical use Rather this approach should help researchers investigate the factors associated with infants born at for example the 20 thas compared with the 40 th 60 th or 80 thpercentile as well as the sequelae of such differences in fetal growth We have trimmed the dataset prior to analysis following the methods of Alexander et al 10 This procedure primarily excludes infants with implausibly high birth weights at the younger gestational ages likely because of inaccurate dating Investigators might therefore wish to consider whether study subjects well beyond the 99 5 thpercentile at the youngest gestational ages have accurately recorded weights and gestational ages prior to inclusion in any analyses Additionally some infants with inaccurate gestational ages may remain in the dataset despite trimming which would tend to inflate values for percentiles above the median Several limitations should be considered One is that relatively low numbers of births at the earlier gestational ages may make percentile estimates for these infants less stable However our major percentiles are quite consistent with the combined 1994 1996 data even at the earliest gestational ages Figure 1 10 11 We were not able to account for altitude although few infants in the US are born at high altitude In addition infants born before term may have different growth patterns from those remaining in utero These curves thus represent cross sectional weights at birth rather than longitudinal fetal growth The Natality dataset calculates gestational age from last menstrual period Some studies suggest that prenatal ultrasound may provide more accurate dates even when the last menstrual period is recalled with apparent certainty 31 32 Thus some investigators advocate use of ultrasound to generate birth weight norms 25 Nevertheless the use of ultrasound reference data has several problems Because prenatal ultrasounds are not universally performed these reference datasets are generally regional 26 33 Additionally data are available only for the subset of women who receive early ultrasounds and may not include women seeking prenatal care late in pregnancy or those who choose not to have an ultrasound Further different institutions may use different methods to estimate gestational age for a fetus of a given size Thus the United States Natality data remain most representative of pregnancies throughout the United States and appropriate for use as reference In addition to calculating reference percentiles for all newborns we have presented percentiles stratified by infant sex birth order and maternal race Other researchers have advocated further adjusting estimates for factors such as maternal height and weight 16 26 and even for weights of prior infants born to the same mother 19 We fear that an overly stratified reference may obscure important predictors of birth weight While sex and birth order are immutable the other factors likely serve as surrogates for a combination of maternal exposures such as stress socioeconomic position and nutrition and thus are not permanently bound to differences in fetal growth for future populations In conclusion we have presented a United States national reference standard for size at birth over a broad range of birth weight percentiles from 22 through 44 completed weeks of gestation Advances in computer technology now permit manipulation of such large data sets as well as electronic publication of multiple reference percentiles for widespread use These data should prove useful for researchers investigating the determinants and sequelae of altered fetal growth Competing
