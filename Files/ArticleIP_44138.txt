 Febreze Take Me Away Please send your questions for publication to prudence slate com Dear Prudie Why do advice columnists speak of themselves in the third person There is an air of Bob Dole ism about the whole thing Should I in polite company be referring to myself the same way Please sign me All Doled Out in Ohio Dear All There is no protocol mandating the third person for advice columnists Prudie does so because it feels comfortable and she has tired of the I word Prudie agrees with you though about the Bob Dole thing so if you run for office by all means use the first person pronoun so that people won t make fun of you As for polite company the only kind to be in follow the above suggestion and speak as though you were running for office Prudie third personally Dear Prudence My wife and I recently renovated a fabulous condo loft in a historic downtown area The unit immediately below us has been rented out as a live work space to a couple with a video business Here s the thing They are both heavy smokers and have managed in three months to smell up the rest of the building Recently the ashtray smell has begun to permeate our apartment I presume through the wooden floors I am a nonsmoker and allergic to cigarette smoke Entreaties to the apartment s owner have gone nowhere I am not an intolerant person having grown up in New York City where one man s ceiling is another man s floor I am not an anti smoking nut either just as long as I can stay away from it What can I do I don t feel it s appropriate to try and dictate someone s behavior in their own apartment but the smell drives me nuts Smokeless in Savannah Dear Smoke You do indeed have a problem It sounds as though you have purchased your loft but the nicotine addicted couple is renting And you are correct that you cannot dictate private activities in someone else s home unless body parts are sailing by your window Because you report that the owner is unwilling to support you you have limited options Short of selling your fabulous renovated condo you can stock up on neutral smelling air freshener or make a plea to the smokers themselves Prudie by the way is sympathetic because she has marveled that cigar smokers can stink up the outdoors And just a little P S because Prudie senses you are in a New York state of mind In apartments everywhere in the world one man s ceiling is another man s floor Prudie odorously Prudence In reference to the etc I am LEFT handed and therefore left footed but I don t think that affects my ability to be honest Really tired of the LEFT jokes insults etc Sue Oh my Prudie has found yet another way to be politically incorrect How s this for making amends Prudie was not in her RIGHT mind when she wrote that answer Feel better Prudie adroitly Dear Prudie In your response to several weeks ago you said that Sometimes an inexperienced woman a young one will be turned off when a guy is too nice A friend of mine who is about my age 20 said the same thing recently She just isn t attracted to nice guys but can t really explain why Being a much more eloquent and mature woman yourself do you think you could explain Immature Woman Syndrome to me so that I can understand the many wonderful but immature young women I know Or if you think it would be easier you could just elope with me so that I wouldn t have to face the thankless but highly entertaining task of dealing with them Happily Confused Dear Hap Prudie thinks you have a darling sense of humor and thanks you for the offer of marriage As for your question Prudie did not say all young women are unresponsive to nice guys just some Proof of this is the numerous older women who picked guys who were nice and who are still married All you need to know about the I Y W syndrome is that a grounded woman someone you would want will not be looking for a guy who is trouble or Mr Bad Behavior The babes with radar for difficult men have the idea that they can fix a guy or tame him It gives them a feeling of power and danger Prudie has long felt however that women are not reform schools You will be fine my dear Prudie just knows it Prudie maturely Pru My sister has three adorable daughters one aged 8 and twins aged 4 I do not yet have children of my own so I visit my nieces as often as possible On occassion my oldest niece will spend a weekend with me My problem is with how my sister treats her girls she screams Shut up at them constantly and also hassles the 8 year old about her weight She s a bit chunky but not obese for pete s sake Our mother certainly never treated us this way and it makes cringe to think of what these comments might be doing to the girls Can I say something to her How mm Dear m It sounds as though your sister is overwhelmed by the responsibilities and obligations of raising young children and twins can be a special strain trust me You don t say what your relationship is with her but Prudie suggests you arrange to have coffee and a chat during which you can tell her that you are aware of her short fuse with her adorable girls you understand the many demands on her and that there is help for the situation Pass on the name of a group for parents like her It is Parents Anonymous and it helps stressed out parents who fear they might escalate from yelling to actual physical abuse There are 2 300 chapters so chances are good she s near one Even the knowledge of such a group will reassure her that her problem is by no means unique to her family and that she s definitely not alone You might also point out that harping at the older child about her weight is psychologically counterproductive Suggest that she choose the household food with nutrition in mind so that the 8 year old cannot dive into a bag of Cheetos Overeating children however can find ways of filching chocolate etc when they re out of the house You could also say more importantly that some unhappiness may be making the child cling to food Good luck in your mission to help your nieces and your sister Prudie supportively
