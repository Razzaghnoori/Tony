        well i havent had an awful lot of uh incidents in regarding child care when my two year old was in New Orleans she got bit on the cheek and uh but uh thats about the the uh the extent of it         but but but the when i really am uh am concerned about is that uh so many of these child care places are are coming under uh uh you know investigation for for uh you know child molestation   uhhuh   and i and i and im saying to myself well you know you you dump your your your little turnip off to uh you know this child care place and they dont pay very much and why why why would they be interested in your in your little turnip unless you know one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well thats somebody to molest you know   uhhuh   and uh thats a terrible kind of thing and i i dont think my children have ever been subject to that but my wife didnt work and so we didnt really didnt have that much exposure to it   uhhuh well i am a working mother  i have three children and my children since i um since they were very young ive had various various um different alternatives child care arrangements and like most working mothers i im really not defensive about it i personally feel um in our particular situation im a much better mother when i work out of the home and my kids i think are very very secure well raised children my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune  over the years for a variety of opportunities   hm   so i i i uh you know it is a problem and but as you pointed out i think i think the real problem is the low pay child care facilities and that is sometimes what some women who have to work that is all they can afford when our children were very young we had a pay a live in paid babysitter that was wonderful and then as they got older they went to uh i preferred to call them schools and they really were all day preschools and they were wonderful   hm   and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things   oh well thats interesting   but we did we really truly did pay a fortune i mean we were paying at one point well about about close uh close to about five hundred dollars a week for two children   oh my God well you must have a just one hero ace professional job to support something like that   so well im a physician im a physician uh and as is my husband and i and i felt very uh very good about working im a pediatrician actually   oh well yeah umhum   so uh but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children but and we all know the kind of things that youre supposed to look for i think   well not not all of us you know what the kind of things youre supposed to look for im an engineer and     oh well i think its real important that you have a place that first of all parents have a lot of input into and that theyre always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in and we had a really wonderful arrangement um im with the university actually and they had a wonderful uh program that started at age three   uhhuh   and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work and so many times at lunchtime i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing and they had wonderful they had things like gardens and lots of pets and just they had a four to one uh teacher student ratio so that that sort of and all most of the teachers had degrees um   yeah five hundred dollars a week for two kids thats incredible   yeah it was incredible actually  but it was good i mean it was it was at that time there were two children and they were in special programs and each one was a little over two hundred a week and then in addition i paid a little bit extra   oh oh   but the kids were i mean they really had some great opportunities but that what you were alluding to earlier is you know women who work for minimal wage and   well well yeah   and and really have to feel they have to put their children sometimes they do put them in uh fairly low paying situations situations   you know they could uh somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare and you know and thats a good starting wage but boy three hundred dollars a week doesnt go very far on child care   uhhuh umhum no even that that really i think i dont its been awhile since ive looked at my youngest child is eight so its been a little while since ive looked into actually day care centers but they are you know the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since and so     i mean we used to pay pay fifty cents an hour to babysit but mine mine are twenty two twenty three and twenty seven so you know that i guess babysitters now are up at what five dollars an hour   umhum umhum something like   oh my     well you know but you made the comment earlier why would someone be interested in children i mean it has been a real um there there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences and i think i think they have captured a certain market again but but then there are babysitting groups as a pediatrician one of the things weve been real concerned about is the infections as you start putting lots of little kids together the infection rates that go around and   umhum oh yeah
