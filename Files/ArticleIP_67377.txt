German press supposedly ignored or downplayed the story of the recent monetary settlement agreement for victims of Nazi slave labor and forced labor programs It was the lead story in every paper I saw yesterday It was the lead story in every national newscast I saw yesterday The story touches on everything from the nation s most shameful chapter to the business community s potential bottom lines Believe me it has been one of the top stories here for the last six months And for the average citizen it has become a subject as inescapable as the Nazi past itself Witness the present controversy surrounding an artist s idea to stage what looks like a really cool light show on New Year s Eve in Berlin Everyone from new Nobel Prize winner G nter Grass to politicians to local artists say the show must not go on Why Because Hitler s architect Albert Speer staged lightshows Say what you want about the Germans and their past they are the third most obsessed nation on earth when it comes to the Nazi era as a story England and the U S are of course numbers one and two To reply click here Subject Re What Papers Was Chancellor Reading From Alexander Chancellor Re Date Fri Dec 17 My sincere

15 I d like to help set the record for Slate The Gore quote from Time magazine was Bradley proposes the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit I was the author of that proposal I wrote that so I say welcome aboard That is something for which I have been the principal proponent for a long time Clearly Gore was referring to a proposal to expand EITC On Feb 7 1989 Gore and Reps Tom Downey George Miller and John Lewis introduced a bill to expand the EITC by 34 billion by raising taxes on people earning more than 200 000 a year Much of that proposal was incorporated into the 1993 Clinton Gore tax increase I wrote a story about the tax proposal for the Memphis Commercial Appeal To reply click here Subject Re Gore Was Present at the Creation From Jodie Allen Re Date Fri Dec 17 Mr Brosnan has added another small footnote to the long history of the EITC He notes that then Sen Gore co sponsored one of many EITC expansion plans though not one that made it directly into law As the House Ways and Means Committee s authoritative Green Book notes there were several expansions to the EITC The earned income credit EIC Code sec 32 enacted in 1975 generally equals a specified percentage of wages up to a maximum dollar amount The income ranges and percentages have been revised several times since original enactment expanding the credit see table 13 12 In 1987 the credit was indexed for inflation In 1990 and again in 1993 Congress enacted substantial expansions of the credit So what Vice President Gore might have accurately said was I was the co author of one of numerous proposals to expand the EITC though the one I co sponsored wasn t the one that was enacted into law in that period That s not what he said To reply click here Subject Not Campaign Finance Reform Cynical Politics From Pat Johnson Re Date Mon Dec 20 You are too quick to brush off the dubious motive behind Al Gore s offer to forgo radio and TV ads in the Democratic primary Gore had everything to gain and nothing to lose by the offer Gore went on the air with both TV and radio commercials almost two months before Bradley did Bradley saved his money and went on the air just before Thanksgiving Bradley has already bought up airtime to use during the last several weeks of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary To pull TV ads now only helps Gore he s already been on the air a lot longer than Bradley Gore has outspent Bradley by a wide margin and is close to hitting the spending caps In terms of Gore s offer for debates twice weekly where was the offer back in April May June and July There was no offer because Gore ignored him Now that Bradley has made it a race Gore wants to dictate the pace of the campaign Bradley and Gore have now met three times and will meet four more times in January Bradley is not a hypocrite on campaign finance reform for refusing Gore s grandstanding offer TV and radio are a reality in modern campaigns Bradley has to build up his name recognition to beat a sitting vice president Bradley s ads which are paid for by hard dollars help get his name and message across to people who are not familiar with him If you noticed Gore didn t offer not to spend the money that would be saved by not purchasing TV or radio ads His campaign is in danger of running out of money early in the primary season By not paying for ads in the Democratic primary that would allow Gore to pay for ads in the period between the primaries and the convention Again the offer benefits Gore because his earlier spending spree has backfired on him Gore has grandstanded in the past and he will in the future If he was serious about the offer he wouldn t have sprung it on Meet the Press he would have talked to Bradley about it behind the scenes first To offer deals that only benefit you isn t campaign finance reform it s cynical politics To reply click here Subject B2B Need Not Equal B2C From Eugene Huang Re Date Tue Dec 14 Mr Surowiecki says that the success of business to business B2B Internet sales depends on consumers ultimately buying the stuff B2C certainly a valid point But Mr Surowiecki misses one crucial point B2B can exist without B2C since consumers can purchase goods in the offline world If you take most large industries and automobiles to use Surowiecki s example are no exception businesses purchase a lot of goods on parity with consumers in some industries like automobiles but also in far greater quantities in others energy telecommunications office supply goods construction goods etc Furthermore the economies of scale you get by focusing on B2B are enormous To take the example of the automobile while a consumer may make a single purchase amounting to 20K in net revenue when the City of New York or Philadelphia or LA etc makes a purchase for a fleet of cars it s a one time sale amounting to 20K large number of cars very large number As you can see making the business sale is probably more cost effective than making the consumer sale Take for instance the oil industry Marketplaces for petrochemicals can be established online between businesses but it would be illogical for a Web company to try and sell gasoline to a single consumer pumping gas To reply click here
