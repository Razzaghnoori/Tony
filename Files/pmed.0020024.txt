                            Many different things combine to cause epidemics of disease Among these factors are the        characteristics of the infecting organism the resistance of the host and as is        increasingly realized climatic conditions        El Nio the best known climatic disturbance is caused by a warming of the Pacific        Ocean which then affects the climate globally Previous work has suggested that this        recurring phenomenon can have a profound effect on the incidence of many diseases        including dengue malaria and diarrheal diseases        In a paper in this months         PLoS Medicine  Sultan and colleagues from a climate research institute        and an infectious diseases center in France looked at the relation between climate and        meningitis outbreaks in Mali in West Africa a region that every year between February and        May sees devastating epidemics of meningococcal meningitis affecting up to  people        The most important recurring climatic event in this region is a dry wind known as the        Harmattan that blows throughout the winter causing a drop in humidity and the production        of vast quantities of dust        What the authors found was that over the years  the week of the onset of the        yearly meningitis epidemic came at around the same time as the peak of one measure of the        windthe sixth week of the year As Pascual and Dobson say in their Perspective article on        this study Sultan and colleagues study is exceptional in that it illustrates a clear        relationship between an external environmental variable and the initiation of disease        outbreaks        How do climatic changes influence disease In some cases such as the role of flooding        in spreading a waterborne disease the causes are perhaps obvious but why should a dry        wind affect disease incidence Previous works have suggested that the climate can work in a        number of ways by influencing the life cycle of both disease vectors and the        diseasecausing organism and as here perhaps by affecting the resistance of the host        Sultan and colleagues speculate that the drying effects of the wind on the mucous membranes        could increase the chances of the organism getting established in the human host Whatever        the causes one very useful feature of climate is that once the patterns are understood        they can often be predicted        A way of predicting these meningitis epidemics could be enormously useful Sultan and        colleagues looked at only a few years but if these findings are confirmed over a longer        time period they could make preparing for an epidemic much more efficient
