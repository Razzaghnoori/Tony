 okay the topic said to discuss the weather what is it like where you are and how s that different from normal and well i tell you what it is it s warm where i m at well let s see if you re in Plano and i m in Plano are you in east Plano or west Plano uh west Plano okay well i m in east Plano i m out in Las Rios so it s bound to be different over here but yeah yeah okay good deal well i tell you what uh yesterday i went out and played a little golf and uh i paid the price my neck got got burned to a crisp oh got a little sunburn yeah yeah but uh it was it was beautiful out wow i worked around in the yard a little bit and i ve got sunburned a few years ago and you know got one of those what second or third degree burns and the doctor looked at it and said don t ever oh Lord don t ever let that area get sunburned again yeah and uh it s got the you know the kind of the black freckled things on it that the doctor looks at every once in a while for that what melanoma business right exactly so i am super whenever we go down to Galveston to the beach or something like that you know i look kind of stupid i m out there in a T shirt and everything else all covered up pretty much covered up but uh you know i m never going to let my shoulders and back get sunburned again well i tell you i m the same way i tell you i i knew better i should have put some sunscreen on uh yesterday but i don t know it felt so nice out um hum well it is March after all you know you re not supposed to worry about sunburn in March well that s right that s right they shouldn t even be selling suntan lotion yet that s right but uh hopefully uh you know it s going to stay warm for this weekend yeah and uh well yeah i hope so yeah we re going to go to Lubbock they ll probably have another sandstorm out there you know so you re going to go to the big city of Lubbock huh yeah big Lubbock yeah are are you a native type Planoite or you been here a while or no i just been uh up here in Plano for about uh i guess close to three years now and uh okay well well where did you come from originally i grew up in a small town right outside of Amarillo and uh then when i went to school at Tech there in Lubbock oh okay well i m a Tech graduate so are you okay yeah i grew up over in New Mexico at Roswell i see and my wife is from Plains if you know where Plains is i ve heard of Plains yeah it s on the it s on the road where do you know where well you go south out of Lubbock down to Brownfield and then you like you re headed over toward Roswell Plains is right there right uh about fifteen miles in from the New Mexico line i see okay so so yeah you talk of little towns in west Texas yeah i m well no see i m from a town named Panhandle okay yeah i know where Panhandle is that s north up there isn t it yeah yeah yeah right right right up there by Amarillo yeah so uh yeah i had a friend who lived in Dumas okay yeah on the other side of Amarillo yeah so yeah so anyway yeah we re kind of familiar with that part of the world now there s where the weather s interesting i think it s kind of dull around here compared to well that s right because uh one day it ll be eighty and the next day it ll be about thirty below i tell you what and uh yeah my mother still lives in Lubbock and we talked to her the other day and they said Friday they had or Thursday or Friday they had a you know one of the world class sandstorms out there that happens every once in a while hadn t had one like that in a couple of years oh Lord that s one thing i do not miss about uh being in Lubbock i tell you because one i i ll never forget uh one spring we had a real big dust storm come in and it started raining and uh it was like raining mud out there you know yeah i recall a snirtstorm out there one day where about this time of year that there was a big cold front coming in and they got the dirt up in the air and then it snowed a little bit and uh oh Lord and uh i can imagine that happening more in Amarillo than i could in Lubbock but still anywhere out there it could happen right that s exactly right i tell you yeah i we like i said i grew up in New Mexico we lived in Albuquerque Karen and i both lived in Albuquerque for quite a long time and then i went to work for TI here right and i came here in sixty nine and then seventy two they opened or seventy three they opened up that plant out there in Lubbock and uh man that was like going home and uh so we went out there were there for about ten years until that all folded up out there i see ended up coming back but uh yeah the weather out there was uh huh it it could get a little bit a little bit interesting now and again oh it sure can because uh the you never just you just can never tell what it s going to do uh huh and uh it s just hard to plan anything well if you ve been here for three years you didn t get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four uh that i did this okay oh wow that would have been six or seven years ago then yeah uh my first year down here uh uh that first winter i remembered TI was closed one one day uh um hum with the ice yeah that yeah with the ice but that uh that s about the worst worst winter i ve been been through down here well the uh was it i guess it was three years ago that they had the real right before was it right before Christmas or where yeah where it got just real real cold yeah yeah got down to around zero somewhere and then warmed back up and killed everything off yeah right yeah that was that was bad news we re still try i set out a whole bunch of crepe myrtles and stuff and of course it killed th em oh Lord well they all come back from from the bottom right so i m getting kind of convinced that if something doesn t grow naturally here there s no sense in planting it because eventually you re going to lose it that s right because the weather s going to get it exactly and you noticed all the pretty little trees that are out everything now the native trees that still don t have the leaves on them yet that s right that s exactly right they re they know better they know better yeah yeah and uh my wife and i are going through that process now we just bought a house and we re trying to decide what we want to do with our landscaping and we still have to put a yard in um hum um hum and uh i m still trying to decide when when the best time s going to be to do that so uh yeah well you re just about there i think it s that s that s right you know i d i d like to get the yard in before all the rain start and uh you know if we could get it up a little bit then the rain would really just help it um hum well we moved into this house it was a year old and the landscaping was semi in but there was still a lot more to do i see and one of the things that uh well they were really selling everybody on back then was this Indian Hawthorne boy you know that s the best stuff in the world right well i am somewhat less than enthused about that i ve got some out here that s five six years old now and still doesn t look a whole lot different than the day that i put it in oh is that right and i noticed that a lot of the garden well you know that Indian Hawthorne that didn t work out quite as well as we thought you know so now they re pushing something else right oh Neil Sperry hasn t been pushing that real hard and heavy here lately yeah yeah well anyway uh like i said if it if it doesn t grow out in the woods here somewhere i m not sure that s worth planting huh that it s worth planting yeah that s exactly right this uh photinia the red tipped photinia red tipped bush yeah it seems to do pretty good we ve got some here that s really taken off well yeah i i i know everybody in our neighborhood has has those bushes and uh um hum like i say really seem to to do well that and uh the little dwarf yaupon hollies you know they they seem to or just yaupons period seem to do all right right holley yeah right we ve got a couple of Live Oaks in the front yard and of course they re they weren t native to this particular spot but they seem to have done pretty good and they sure have and that s a good tree it sort of stays green most of the year you know and and uh yeah it s it s it s a strange one it will kind of scare you if you don t know what it s doing because right now is when it s dropping it s leaves right and you go out there and look at your tree after a good windstorm and the thing is bare and you think oh no the thing s dying but you look look real close and there s all the little new leaves getting ready to come out so it holds it s leaves all winter then loses them in the spring right yeah that and that red what is it red oak red oak yeah we re thinking about putting one of those in only thing is those things grow pretty slow you have to uh huh well you know i heard something about that here whether Neil uh here again it may have been Neil Sperry they say you know everybody looks at these oaks and says yeah they grow slow and all that right but most of the time that s the way that the native ones grow because they don t get the water they don t get the they re they re growing under bad conditions oh is that right yeah and uh if you bring one in and put it under good conditions they ll grow about as fast as any tree so if you really fertilize it and huh well that s surprising so yeah that s good to know so anyway that s that was i guess he was talking about some of the other kinds of oaks i don t know right right whether the live live oaks is not really an oak i guess it s something oh i think it s just by name yeah yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because it s got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it right right but uh i think the real honest to gosh oaks like the what bur oaks and pin oaks and red oaks and all that sort of thing they they ll grow a lot faster yeah huh well i guess we were supposed to be talking about the weather but that s at least we had a good conversation anyway yeah yeah well are you you with TI but uh yes i am yeah yeah how many these have you gotten very many of these calls at home um probably about three i guess yeah okay well i got the first one this evening that i had gotten at home i i see i d made a couple at work you know made made several from work but i d never uh i d never gotten one yet i was just right gotten one at home huh yeah i ve gotten about three i guess yeah yeah so well you know you d think that this crazy system if you re going to talk about something about the weather they d have tried to plug you in with plug you in to somebody split it up a little bit like you know New York or something yeah like New York or somewhere yeah that s right yeah weather difference between east and west Plano but uh exactly clear across town but uh clear across town well when we lived in Albuquerque there was such a elevation difference there that there was a weather difference between the valley and the heights right you know it would be snowing up in our area and then the sun would be shining and it would be hot down in the downtown but uh that s not the way Plano works
