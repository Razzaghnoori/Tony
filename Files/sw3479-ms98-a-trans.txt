                 well what do you uh  how do you feel about your uh job benefits   well im a contract person and uh so i dont have a lot of benefits and uh uh i do think theyre very important my husband has medical insurance and he has a life insurance policy his company does not really have a retirement plan and i think thats something thats very important   umhum   and uh i believe medical insurance and retirement are probably the two strongest   yeah well i um  i worked for a   two most important   a large oil company for ten years and then resigned in eighty four and went into business for myself   uhhuh   uh and what i discovered at one after i had resigned it was kind of amazing i had never really thought about that corporate umbrella   yes  right   while while it was there and after i resigned and i walked out from under it i really felt exposed and it was something that i had been completely you know you grow accustomed to having that behind you or or or over you   uhhuh yeah you sort of take it for granted   absolutely and it was ill ill tell you i was absolutely amazed at how at at the difference and then  plus whenever i had to start paying for my own health insurance   oh i know isnt that a shock   and and life insurance  believe me it was it was a rude awakening  so anyway i was in business for myself for six years and then i have gone back to work uh since uh uh nineteen ninety im back in Houston with another oil company so im back under that corporate umbrella and i will tell you i am glad to have the coverage again   well we uh kind of discovered it when uh the company my husband was with       uh was in real estate and he had some nice benefits with it and all of a sudden when the market dropped out up here of course then you know everything kind of went downhill     right   and then he went with a steel company and they they folded but he was still under the uh COBRA plan on the medical insurance   uhhuh   and then all of a sudden the people that had taken it over went bankrupt well that ended COBRA plan plan and everything and uh   yeah   then we discovered and our medical insurance for three months was running us uh i think it was nineteen hundred dollars   holymoly   you know our age and uh i had some arthritis and stuff and man they socked it to us   uhhuh uhhuh yeah   and you know course now fortunately we were back we have some medical insurance   well well i feel like im im the luckiest person in the world on in several ways number one i had the opportunity to get out whenever i left um uh Houston in uh eighty four and resigned i had the opportunity to get out and do all those things that i thought would be so glamorous and exciting wording working for myself   yeah   and they were and they were for a while and then i found out that it was just as much work to do that as it is going into an office you know getting on a plane and flying around and all that kind of stuff     umhum umhum umhum     and   what did you do consulting work   well no actually i was uh my brother and i had a architectural design firm we did uh retail tenant finish out all over the US and it was   oh uhhuh umhum   you know very successful and a lot of fun and more work than ive ever done in my life and at the same time i got all of that out of my system and it is so its so wonderful now and im so appreciative too of and and i know         now i think so much better than some of my coworkers what it means to and have somebody thats providing   umhum   some of this stuff for you and uh you know im real lucky my company has good uh health benefits and dental   benefits umhum   and also uh retirement plan on a contributory thrift plan that im   umhum   i was just thinking about that today i need to up my contribution to that if i can force myself to save a little bit more   umhum well i know that my husband the company hes with now has excellent uh hospitalization and prescription card and dental insurance but they have no retirement   uhhuh yeah   benefits and you know we definitely you know miss this i grew up in a family that had their own business you cannot pay me enough money to go into business for myself and my husband  has watched my family and i dont believe you could pay him enough   yeah well i tell you until youve done it you dont know what its like you you its on your mind twenty four hours a day seven days a week and im i literally drove myself nearly insane i was at the office on Saturdays and Sundays id get up at   umhum umhum umhum umhum umhum youre always   id get up at id be sitting around at at nine nine oclock at night and get up and go to the office and work until one oclock   umhum   you you know and   well and you think you know okay  you know are the employees going to get paid this week  you know are we going to meet our and i   precisely precisely and then the employees get paid and you dont   thats right thats right i can remember my dad saying somebody saying they wished you know beef wasnt so high you know they could only afford chicken and my dad said if someone doesnt buy some beef im not gonna be able to afford the chicken   yeah yeah   you know and uh   well ill tell you ill tell you the odds are definitely stacked against the small business person   they they really are they really are cold um   uh the problem that we ran into is that you know we we  got beyond just being a real time
