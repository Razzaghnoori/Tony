 Two Poems To hear the poet read the first of Two Poems click You said you had lunch in Pittsfield was it on North Street That reminds me of when we lived on the farm It must be eighty years ago We went to a one room school house didn t you drive past it once Each row was a different grade I sat in the first seat of the first row The teacher s name was Miss Brown She was so pretty I wonder if she s still alive The day before we left the farm our cat disappeared We couldn t find her anywhere I was sad for weeks Three months later she showed up at our new house in Pittsfield Robbins Avenue I can t think of the number now My sister was in New York She didn t like the people she was living with so she d visit us She fell in love with the young man who lived next door Maurice Your uncle Maurice They got married and moved to Cleveland They re both gone now aren t they You know I can t picture her A few years later we moved to New York This just jumped into my mind I must have been three years old We were still in Russia Mir A small town but famous for its Yeshiva My oldest brother Joe took our horses down to the river They were the two best horses in the town My father had a phaeton A beautiful old buggy He was like a taxi driver he took people to Minsk Or Vilna That day he was at the station The passenger station waiting for customers My brother was still just a kid He must have been washing the horses in the river I can remember it was a hot day Maybe he was giving them a drink And while I was watching the reins got caught around a pole in the river The horses kept twisting the reins around that pole It was slippery the reins kept sliding down under the water and they were pulling the horses down with them I ran into town and got my father who came running back with a knife in his teeth He jumped into the river with all his clothes on He took the knife and sawed away at the reins until he finally cut through He saved the horses I haven t thought about this in a thousand years It s like a dream you get up it s forgotten Then it all comes back Didn t I ever tell you Look at me I m starting to cry What s there to cry about Such an old old memory why should it make me cry To hear the poet read the second of Two Poems click I m writing a poem about you You are What s it about It s the story about your childhood the horses in the river The ones that nearly drowned I saved them You told it to me just a few weeks ago I should dig up more of my memories I wish you would Like when I lived on the farm and one of the girls fell down the well Yes I forget if it was Rose or Pauline it was a deep well I remember that story Have you finished your poem I m still working on it You mean you re correcting it with commas and semicolons Exactly When can I see it As soon as it s finished Is it an epic It s not that long No I mean all my thoughts the flashes of what s going through my life the whole family history living through the woe the river and the water I know Will it be published I have to finish it first It s better to write about real life that s more important than writing something fanciful I try to write all my poems about real life You see the apple never falls far from the tree I guess not You re my apple There s probably a worm crawling through that apple Then it s got something sweet to chew on Well you re my tree Yes I m your tree you re an apple I m a tree
