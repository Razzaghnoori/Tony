 The Cutting Edge Back in the mid 1950s Detroit s Big Three automakers saw they had a problem Nearly everyone had a car and the population wasn t growing The only way to keep making money was to make each automobile more expensive and more profitable The goal their mantra went was not to sell more cars but to sell more car The marketing strategy was to link automobiles to the glamour and speed of the supersonic jet fighter planes that the Navy and Air Force had introduced in 1953 and 1954 Their swept wing and delta wing designs were sharp yet curvy a quality that was abstracted into the parabolic boomerang shapes that started to turn up on objects such as ballpoint pens and surfaces such as Formica In 1955 Chrysler adopted a double boomerang corporate logo to symbolize what it called the forward look By the end of the decade American cars were banana splits on wheels dripping with the extraneous decoration that stylists called gorp Flash forward to 1998 Gillette dominates the global shaving market Like Alexander the Great a Gillette hero because he demanded that his soldiers shave the Boston based company has no new worlds to conquer Yet its lofty stock price assumes continued growth The solution not to sell more razors but to sell more razor The 750 million result the triple blade Mach 3 Its name means three times the speed of sound The three blades on the head look appealingly like a tiny Venetian blind an image emblazoned on the package like a scene from a 1950s noir movie The plastic package is also embossed with parabolas and the razor itself is festooned with them Starting in August a 300 million advertising campaign will show jet pilots breaking the sound barrier and then being magically transported to their bathrooms where they ll enjoy the quickest slickest shave in history And yes Gillette plans to charge 35 percent more for it than for its previous top of the line product the Sensor Excel By 2000 Gillette has told analysts the profit margin on each Mach 3 replacement cartridge will reach 50 percent It s like 1956 all over again only smaller Yet the Mach 3 is not the sort of retro design that evokes bygone imagery of progress with self conscious irony Unlike the lounge music revival it s aimed not at a hip coterie but at Everyman The Mach 3 razor appears to be a sincere attempt to embody progress For the last quarter century or so designers have not made this a high priority Products have evoked cool Ray Ban sunglasses or competence Sub Zero refrigerators upper class aspirations Ralph Lauren home furnishings or adolescent rebellion just about any snowboard Few have tried to communicate that things are actually getting better as the Mach 3 does The immediate reaction a lower stock price for Gillette and quite a few jokes There is on the face of it something ridiculous about a three blade razor Gillette introduced the twin blade Trac II razor in 1972 and three years later Saturday Night Live ran a parody of a three blade model It featured an animation sequence that showed the second blade cutting what the first one missed and the third getting even closer The tag line Because you ll believe anything So is this Mach 3 an improvement or a mockery of consumer gullibility The product itself won t be in stores until summer so it s way too early to know how the shaving public will respond I do know that a couple of mornings with the Mach 3 has just about wiped the smirk off my face The damned thing works Just as the promotional copy promises I am able to shave with fewer strokes This shortens an unpleasant activity and spares me those final touch up strokes that often leave me bleeding Since its first safety razor almost a century ago Gillette has always conceived the actual razor mainly as an inducement for selling replacement blades Mach 3 represents the culmination of this trend it s mainly the cartridge that s been upgraded Gillette claims 35 improvements beyond the extra blade Some such as a colored strip to indicate when the blade needs replacing are aimed more at beefing up the profit margin than at improving the shave But others such as thinner edged blades with hard coatings and individual spring loaded pivots for each blade with the Sensor the two blades pivot together may for all I know be responsible for the razor s improved performance The razor s body is functionally just a handle But it still needs to communicate that the Mach 3 is worth the extra cost So Gillette is touting the rubberized boomerangs on its top and bottom as gripping aids to keep it from slipping in your hands even though the parallel ridges on the Sensor line probably work about as well The difference is all in the styling Most of the improvements in the Mach 3 the tiny springs and metallurgical manipulations aren t even visible to the casual shopper Like the microchip and the altered gene they fall beneath the threshold of visual perception With its outward imagery Gillette is trying to evoke a midcentury aesthetic of progress identified with military might brute force and speed And yet while the Mach 3 looks like a throwback to a time when progress took a back seat to empty stylistic gestures deep down inside the razor really does represent an advance
