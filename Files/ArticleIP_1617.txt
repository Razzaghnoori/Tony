 That Feel Good Feeling Star Spangled Bonds produced by Peter Mullett Films Kershner Co for U S Savings Bonds Star Spangled Bonds strings a series of luminous limnings aimed straight at the heart It taps and markets the image of America as the land of milk and honey of opportunity and prosperity of freedom well earned and much valued Nothing novel about the advertising techniques here But they re put to effective use and are unlikely to offend in this era of peace and plenty where the political battles in Washington seem so completely irrelevant that pollsters are hard pressed to elicit strong reactions from their public Not that the spot raises the specters of isolation and apathy of course Star Spangled Bonds America is involved concerned and while the spot does draw explicitly on the country s speckled history it is careful to take the edge off Set appropriately to the Star Spangled Banner la Jimi Hendrix and presented montage style the spot mines the collective memory for its material There are shots aplenty from times of war and protest the curve of a fighter jet Iwo Jima in black and white a Black Panther s finger snap battlefield comradeship a civil rights clash the dun and dunes of what appears to be Operation Desert Storm an anti Vietnam War rally then the Vietnam War Memorial in sunset silhouette And there s plenty of fuzzy stuff a shot of a child playing with fluffy white pigeons of a fiercely bespectacled towhead whooshing down a slide of a happy freckles and ice cream spattered face No in your face politics perhaps but children and their rights remain sacred in the public eye even Republican conservatives didn t dare oppose the Kennedy Hatch plan of health care for kids paid for by cigarette taxes part of this summer s bipartisan budget bill Threading the collage is the word freedom presented on the unlikeliest of canvases on a scrap caught on a wire fence on the black leather back of a biker s jacket on a green road sign In each case the word is first brought to life with a few images then rounded off by a question that is answered by the images that follow For example A shot of the wire fence merges via the pigeons in the park into sepia scenes winged feet in the wild West an ancient merry go round and comes to brief rest on a sign emblazoned on the side of a bus What is it The montage continues familiar scenes reminding us what freedom has come to mean It s about popping a wheelie on your mountain bike framed by the Golden Gate It s about acing a race tasting the rain reaping a new harvest mourning a loss watching a rocket blast into space This is freedom hard won the fruit of wars and sacrifice and struggle How much does it cost How do we protect it The unlikely and more than slightly jarring response reminds us that freedom is as tenuous as it is precious that the current sense of plenty must be zealously guarded Take stock in America we re told And against a shot of a savings bond backdropped by a waving flag Buy U S Savings Bonds A discordant note this one but an effective reminder that there s more to the feel good feeling than just feeling good Robert Shrum
