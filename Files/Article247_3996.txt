 Japanese Mini Music and the Death of Irony Dear Merrill Good morning It s an honor to share breakfast conversation with one of the few people the disgruntled smartasses of my formless generation can genuinely look up to as a formative influence So it was with particular pleasure that today as I do every day I padded across the floors of my suburban Long Island home in my color coordinated L L Bean slippers pajamas and bathrobe matching set sat down in my spacious breakfast nook over my customary English muffin and marmalade took a sip of this delightful Turkish blend my wife and I picked up in the most adorable little catalogue we found and began flipping through the day s periodicals in search of something pithy and clever to ruminate upon And boy did I find it It looks like the Gore camp is really in a tizzy over the latest Er ah AHEM OK So I m lying I uh don t live a life anywhere remotely near what I gather the average reader of Slate must be like No offense everybody To be honest I was up until about 4 or 5 a m as I am almost every night watching Space Ghost cartoons in a drugged haze after seriously pissing off my editor by turning in the week s Onion assignments really really late Since like many self hating depressives I don t normally even get out of bed until at least noon it sure felt weird dragging myself into the corner store to buy the morning editions of the New York Times and Wall Street Journal for some reason they didn t have the Washington Post for the first time in gee um oh say my entire life I generally do get around to reading USA Today but that s because I get paid to make fun of it and wondering just how a longhair dropout like myself somehow ended up for this one week anyway being an actual official employee of sorts of our man Bill Gates the Richest Guy in the Freaking Universe But I did find something wonderful actually and right on the front page of the Journal the profile on Takahito Sakurai the Tokyo composer who creates the music that announces the arrival and departure of Japan s commuter trains Because the schedule is so busy each composition has to be only seven seconds long but he still considers it his mandate to make each one of them True Art Too cool When you consider that Japan is also the center of something called the Osaka Noise Scene a sort of hardcore punk based solely on feedback and industrial sounds played at screeching distorted levels you get a situation where the tie wearing salarymen a great word are listening to seven second music on the platform and the punk kids are listening in bars to extended hour long jams that sound exactly like a screeching out of control train It s this sort of postmodern news story that I love the most because you re not sure if it makes you want to laugh or cry My favorite type of found comedy any day Also I realize we re supposed to keep this current and newsy and this is definitely an old story by now but I just have to ask what you think about the whole Death of Irony debate that everybody was talking about a while back As a Master Ironist yourself you must have had some thoughts about this character Jedediah Purdy or Jed Clampett or Tom Joad or whatever his mame is I myself thought it d be cool to take out a full page ad someplace as an Open Letter to the guy from the Onion staff saying Dear Purdy We re sorry We were just trying to be funny We only wanted people to like us We promise not to do it again etc but I can t afford a full page of the paper I work for let alone of a publication a sincere earnest gentleman of his ilk would be likely to read Regards Todd
