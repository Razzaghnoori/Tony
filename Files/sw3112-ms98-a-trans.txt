          well Nancy  uh as as i was talking my brother uh his name is Ainsley and he was a conductor in New York City of a Goldman band and they did park concerts at the Lincoln Center   oh   uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know John Phillips Sousa and uh all of and Franco Goldman in fact the name of the uh the band was because one of the famous uh march composers of all time uh Richard Franco Goldman and his son Edwin actually i may may have those reversed father and son started the band like seventy years ago i think so its the oldest organization really of its type in the country and uh my brother became involved with them over twenty years ago as a manager and then ended up being both manager and conductor for quite a number of years   oh that that must have been wonderful  were you able to hear   so well i was able to uh to hear him about three years ago for the first time at a a concert there  and uh it was quite enjoyable um   yeah sometimes   in that uh he also had one of the composers well actually there were two of the composers that he used were actually there at the performance also   oh   so i got to meet them and in particular i got to go to the rehearsal before hand and that was when i realized how good he really was was at a rehearsal as opposed to an actually performance of uh working with the musicians and and one of his biggest struggles uh with the band was that this was all union musicians   oh   which didnt give him a lot of leeway once they were in the band uh he had a very difficult time replacing them no matter how they were performing at that particular season and uh he ended up with some very unusual characters in that that organization it was easy to tell that just from the rehearsal time but uh anyway what were you going to tell me about your dad   well um actually that lead into a couple different things um my dad worked with unions um for placing so he could really relate to what you were saying but um my dad enjoyed opera and classical music and ballets and so um even as a child i got to go to a lot of different um kinds of musical events um i grew up in Detroit and so we had opportunities for a wide range of things um one of the regrets i have is that i grew up with a house filled with classical music and music that i really loved but i never took the time to find out um who the composers were or it it was just always there and there were certain things that um i liked so much but i still have trouble to this day sometimes i will recognize a passage but ill have no idea what its from or whose it is and um over the last few years   oh   and when my father lived with us um i made more of an effort to learn but um thats something that i regretted but um when you mentioned the band music my   uhhuh   son just started high school this year and has been in band since middle school but this was the first year   uhhuh   with marching band and i really enjoy band music um it   oh yeah i i was in the band in high school and that   oh what instrument did you play   i played the clarinet   oh i like that a   and uh  so i i did that my all through high school and then i guess my first year in college i played but it wasnt a marching band it was just a it was a symphonic band and uh ironically in college the marching band was part of the athletic department rather than the music department   oh   and i was i was in the symphonic band that was actually part of the music department and i thought that was pretty unusual   yeah what uh my husband Tim played a trombone in high school and he also played in a a band in college not marching band but   oh   symphonic and that was really the first time that i got to hear a lot of the um band music and some of the wonderful composers other than the traditional Sousa and things that everybody knows and   right   so ive enjoyed this so much um with our son now doing that and he plays tuba  so i dont dont get to see him when hes doing um   uhhuh a tuba tuba   concerts we just see the top of the bell at the back but in marching season hes easy to pick out     right well does he bring the tuba home to   yes uh   oh my goodness   we uh   laughed when theyre in sixth grade and they try them out on instruments and try to find the appropriate instruments we thought of suggesting that they ought to also find out what vehicles the parents drive because       uh the tuba and the sousaphone dont fit in in every kind of uh car   yeah just anything i have a niece that plays the harp   oh   and she found the same thing that uh she had i think what they call a troubadour harp for a while and that she learned on and trained on but then uh uh a harp became available which there are just not very many instruments uh and a used harp became available in Colorado and they lived in in uh Missouri at the time and they actually drove to Colorado to buy this instrument but they first had to go and buy a full sized station wagon uh so theyd have room to bring it home       and thats dictated their cars every since then just having one large enough for a full you know concert harp   yes   that she plays uh well i uh because of my brothers uh work with music for a long time he was a uh a critic for the Music Journal and as a result of that he well that was part of the reason he ended up with this incredible classical album uh library or collection which i have now inherited and um   oh   i i dont listen to in nearly enough its the same sort of thing theres so much music that i recognize but dont who is yeah who is the composer but ive based on just measuring number of inches or in this case feet of albums that i think i have about a a uh two thousand album classical record collection now   oh gosh   so i figured that uh i could probably listen to a different album every day of the year for about seven years   God   if i wanted to at this point but then its hard to find a place to stack that much music   yes   most of it is still in boxes stacked quite high in a back room but uh anyway um   well he must have collected that over a period of years   well he really did uh i know that he was a critic probably in the early sixties in New York City he had um we were thirteen and a half years apart i think and he left home at like sixteen to go to Westminster Choir College   hum   and you know he did not finish high school he just went straight straight to Westminster s o i never really remember having lived at home with him and after he did get out of college it was not long he before he uh just moved to New York City knowing that thats where he had to live to quote unquote make it in the music world and um became a music critic and that probably puts us somewhere around the early sixties uh when he was doing that ive seen that date a good bit on the uh on some of the albums because he would typically uh sign and date everything that i think everything that he owned he did that with but certainly all of his albums and all of the music uh he had signed and dated   i was going to ask you and it seemed that there must have been a big gap um i also have a brother whos thirteen years older and one whos nineteen years older you you dont run into that very often   my goodness you have one thats nineteen years older   uhhuh   my goodness that is a wide spread well we were at the opposite ends there were two sisters in between but uh because he left home so early i think there was one summer i can remember him living at home and i was maybe six years old   yeah   i mean other than that uh i dont even ever remember living in in the same house with him at all   oh im glad you got to go and hear him in New York though that um that must have been very special   well it was it was thrilling um my mother was with me at the time and it was ironically it was the first time that wed seen him conduct that particular group which hed been with so long she had seen him fact she had seen him conduct in Carnegie Hall before   oh   um and im not sure it was probably the American Symphony Orchestra when Leopold Stokowlski was uh in New York City that was Stokowlskis orchestra and Ainsley was an associate conductor with him for quite a while  and it at one point did in fact uh uh conduct there at Carnegie Hall so she got to see him there and i i didnt
