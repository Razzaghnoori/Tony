 Introduction Arthritic diseases are characterized by a progressive loss of extracellular matrix ECM which may ultimately lead to frank tissue loss and gross joint damage The conditions under which chondrocytes can be induced to replenish or repair a depleted matrix and thereby prevent or slow the disease process remain unclear If these conditions were known then in principal one could design a therapeutic strategy that takes into account the capacity or absence thereof for chondrocytes to repair their matrix naturally A number of model systems have provided some insights For instance IL 1 degraded cartilage tissues and cell suspensions are frequently employed as model systems to study cartilage metabolism under osteoarthritis like conditions 1 2 3 4 and to assess the efficacy of various drug therapies 5 6 7 8 9 IL 1 signals cells via cell surface receptors to upregulate proteases matrix metalloproteinases and aggrecanase while downregulating matrix metalloproteinase inhibition and proteoglycan synthesis 10 11 The ultimate effect of these metabolic changes include damage to the ECM loss of ECM components especially proteoglycan and alteration of the normal balance of catabolic and anabolic processes that regulate cartilage ECM composition With regard to the repair phase following IL 1 induced cartilage damage relatively little is known but partial to complete recovery appears possible 1 3 In studies of repair investigators focused on glycosaminoglycan GAG an important and abundant cartilage macromolecule and used histologic biochemical and or radiolabel incorporation methods to measure GAG concentration GAG and or GAG synthesis rates at selected time points Although these data suggest that repair might be possible our understanding is limited because of the uncertainty in the temporal changes in matrix composition for a given sample This uncertainty is a direct consequence of the inherently destructive nature of histologic and biochemical methods these techniques therefore do not permit monitoring of the spatial and temporal evolution of matrix macromolecules within individual samples animals Having to infer temporal spatial information from a cross section of samples confounds efforts to conduct a detailed analysis of responses in these model systems The delayed Gadolinium Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Cartilage dGEMRIC method overcomes these problems in that it is nondestructive and can be used to assess quantitatively the spatial distribution of cartilage GAG 12 13 We and others previously reported on the use of dGEMRIC to monitor GAG regeneration in living cartilage tissue over time in trypsin depleted bovine cartilage 14 and in cell laden polymer matrices tissue engineered cartilage 15 Those studies clearly demonstrated that dGEMRIC is feasible for long term GAG monitoring and that its sensitivity is sufficient to permit observation of the spatiotemporal evolution of GAG Each of those studies began with a homogeneously proteoglycan deficient matrix in which GAG was replenished over a 5 to 8 week period to levels considered to be within the normal range In young bovine articular cartilage a tissue that many investigators have used to investigate the impact of physical and biochemical factors on ECM metabolism 14 16 17 18 19 20 21 IL 1 induces a characteristic spatially heterogeneous depletion of GAG This young tissue still contains blood vessels and it is in the perivascular regions that IL 1 induced GAG depletion is most severe We know from studies investigating the recovery of trypsin induced homogeneous GAG depletion in young bovine cartilage that the inherent ability of chondrocytes to replenish the matrix is relatively uniform 14 In the present study we take advantage of the characteristic spatial heterogeneity of IL 1 induced GAG depletion to study the relative replenishment rates between regions of varying severity of GAG depletion Accordingly our goal was to use dGEMRIC to determine whether bovine cartilage explants briefly exposed to IL 1 would recover GAG at a uniform rate or at a rate that depended on the degree of IL 1 induced GAG depletion Specifically we sought to examine recovery after relatively mild and modest degradation conditions that did not induce a complete loss of tissue GAG Method Culture and degradation protocols Cartilage bone cores of 5mm or 7mm in diameter were harvested from young bovine femoropatellar groove articular cartilage within 24 hours of slaughter After removing the articular surface three or four 1 mm thick discs were sliced parallel to the articular surface A flat edge was made on some of the discs to ease orientation and registration during imaging and analysis The discs were weighed and then immediately placed in 2ml sterile culture media in 24 well culture plates All explants were incubated at 37 C throughout the study Culture medium was prepared with low glucose Dulbecco s modified Eagle medium with 10mmol l HEPES GIBCO BRL Grand Island NY USA 0 1mmol l nonessential amino acids Sigma Chemical St Louis MO USA 0 4 mmol l L proline Sigma Chemical and 1mmol l gadolinium DTPA Magnevist Berlex Imaging Wayne NJ USA Supplements including 1 fetal calf serum GIBCO BRL Grand Island NY 1 l glutamine Sigma Chemical 1 ascorbic acid Sigma Chemical and 1 penicillin and streptomycin Sigma Chemical were added immediately prior to use Media was was collected daily and analyzed for GAG release by the dimethylmethylene blue DMMB assay using purified shark chondroitin sulfate Sigma Chemical as the reference standard All samples were cultured in basal media for at least 3 days after harvest To create samples that have heterogeneously degraded ECM samples were exposed to IL 1 Cistron Biotechnology Pine Brooks NJ USA which was added each day to the culture medium Two series of experiments were conducted each with its own set of controls In the first series samples were exposed to 10 ng ml IL 1 for 3 and 6 days incurring mild degradation n 4 The addition of IL 1 to the media began at days 6 and 3 respectively after harvest such that all samples began the recovery phase on day 9 after harvest Control samples were cultured in basal media for the entire experiment In the second series samples were exposed to 20 ng ml IL 1 n 10 for 6 and 9 days and incurred moderate degradation In this group the addition of IL 1 addition to the media for all samples started at 3 days after harvest and therefore samples began the recovery phase at day 9 or 12 after harvest Again control samples were cultured in basal media for the entire experiment Control samples are referred to as mild controls or moderate controls according to the IL 1 series with which they were cultured n 2 and 2 Following IL 1 exposure the samples were transferred to sterile flat bottomed 10mm nuclear magnetic resonance NMR tubes Wilbur Scientific Boston MA USA that were custom cut to a length of 5cm where they were cultured in basal media for the duration of the recovery experiment In summary the experiment comprised three periods an initial period before any exposure to IL 1 an exposure period during which tissue was exposed to IL 1 in preparation for the recovery phase followed by a recovery period during which there was no IL 1 present Imaging protocols For imaging the shortened NMR culture tubes were joined to full length NMR tubes via a sterilized rubber stopper inserted into the open ends of both tubes All images were acquired on a Bruker 8 45 T magnetic resonance microimaging system Bruker Instruments Billerica MA USA with a standard 10mm radiofrequency coil T1 weighted images in the axial orientation with respect to explant cylindrical geometry were measured weekly post IL 1 exposure with either an inversion recovery sequence mild series or a saturation recovery sequence moderate series The saturation recovery protocol consisted of 10 T1 weighted images measured with time to repeat times of 25 75 125 175 275 375 475 600 900 and 1800ms For inversion recovery measurements images were acquired with nine inversion delays of 16 7 33 3 50 66 7 100 150 250 400 and 600ms Both pulse sequences used a time to echo of 8 5ms section thicknesses of 0 5mm in plane resolutions of 100 m and two averages for a total imaging time of less than 1 hour per sample Analysis of GAG release throughout these experiments suggested that within the range of sensitivity provided by our dimethylmethylene blue assay GAG release patterns were unaffected by removal from incubation at 37 C to room temperature for 3 6 hours of imaging each week because all the plugs were out of the incubator for the imaging session Tissue T1s without contrast agent were determined spectroscopically using an inversion delay pulse sequence with 12 delays ranging from 0 2 to 10s and a 10mm broadband radiofrequency probe At the conclusion of each experimental series two samples one control and one treated were equilibrated in gadolinium free medium then extracted from media and blotted dry and placed in an NMR tube As had previously been observed we found very little difference in T1 between samples of the same series 5 or across series 10 12 Therefore the T1 times in the absence of contrast agent of samples from the same series were averaged and these averages used as the reference tissue T1 for all other samples within the same experiment series Image processing MATLAB The Math Works Natick MA USA was used to create a T1 map by curve fitting each T1 weighted image series on a voxel by voxel basis T1 maps were then processed into GAG maps with MATLAB using equations derived from a modified ideal Donnan theory This dGEMRIC method of relating measured T1 and cartilage GAG was previously validated and reported 12 13 22 The mean GAG for a sample at a given time point was computed as the mean GAG calculated across all cartilage containing pixels of the image The rate of GAG accumulation i e the tissue s recovery rate was calculated as the difference in the mean GAG values at specified time points divided by the elapsed time As expected qualitative assessment of images from samples exposed to IL 1 exhibited the characteristic heterogeneity in degree of GAG depletion In order to quantitate objectively the time course of GAG recovery relative to the degree of GAG depletion GAG maps were registered using Adobe Photoshop Adobe Systems Inc San Jose CA USA in order to allow chosen regions of interest to be automatically analyzed across multiple images from successive imaging sessions Registered images were segmented so that tissue regions of relatively high medium or low GAG were identified in images taken after 3 weeks of recovery The GAG and location of these pixels were tracked in time High medium and low GAG regions of the 3 week images were discerned according to the following definitions Pixel assigned to high GAG region if GAG pixel mean GAG all pixels 0 5 SD all pixels Pixel assigned to low GAG region if GAG pixel mean GAG all pixels 0 5 SD all pixels Pixel assigned to medium GAG region if not assigned to high or low region Statistical analysis Magnetic resonance imaging derived group mean GAG changes were assessed using repeated measures oneway analysis of variance with a compound symmetry variance structure using SAS SAS Institute Inc Cary NC USA to test the hypothesis that mean GAG in a given sample or regions of a given sample did not change with time This technique analyzed the significance of time as an effect on weekly GAG measurements or weekly changes in GAG taken from the same samples or same region of a sample each week Paired two sample Student s t tests Microsoft Excel were used to determine the degree of GAG recovery observed with respect to initial GAG before exposure to IL 1 Results Glycosaminoglycan release into media The release of GAG into the media was measured daily as a surrogate for monitoring the effect of IL 1 exposure and of ECM stability following IL 1 withdrawal Control samples from each series had a small rate of release throughout 0 4 0 2 g mg initial wet weight day except for a slightly higher release rate 0 7 0 2 g mg initial wet weight day during the first 2 3 days after harvest Assuming an initial GAG of approximately 5 of wet weight this steady state release rate corresponds to a loss of about 0 6 1 day As expected during the IL 1 exposure period the exposed samples lost significantly more GAG than did controls in accordance with the severity of the IL 1 exposure Those in the mild and moderate groups lost 148 49 g and 433 98 g GAG respectively as compared with the 81 5 g and 103 58 g lost during the same period by the control samples The GAG release rates never dropped to negligible levels during the exposure period indicating that GAG was not totally depleted from the disks at these exposure levels Turning to the recovery period within 1 2 days after cessation of IL 1 exposure the GAG release rates dropped to levels comparable with those of control samples GAG release persisted at this level 0 3 0 1 and 0 5 0 3 g mg initial wet weight day for mild and moderate groups respectively throughout the remainder of the study Tissue glycosaminoglycan concentration over time Use of dGEMRIC allowed for the actual GAG in the tissue to be followed over time The images of the control samples showed relatively stable GAG over the culture period Fig 1a 1c with the coefficient of variation SD mean over time for bulk GAG i e GAG averaged over the entire cartilage image slice ranging from 2 to 12 One can also see that the bulk GAG was considerably different for the mild and moderate control samples This is probably a reflection of differences between the animals used for each series a conclusion supported by considering measurements made before IL 1 exposure on a subset of samples 92 11mg ml for the mild series and 57 6mg ml for the moderate series n 6 for each To provide a relative reference the mean and SD of untreated samples are represented by the shaded regions in Fig 2a 2b Images of the exposed samples acquired immediately following cessation of IL 1 revealed a much lower GAG than the initial values and the GAG in exposed samples increased with time of recovery Figs 1and 2 Over the 3 week recovery period following IL 1 exposure GAG increased in all samples exposed to IL 1 Fig 1b 1dand Fig 2 n 14 P 0 0001 In the mild group the GAG increased by 19 5 mg ml n 4 P 0 06 whereas in the moderate group GAG increased by 26 11 mg ml n 10 P 0 0001 Given the variation in initial GAG we evaluated the percentage degree of recovery only for those samples for which we obtained an initial image before any exposure to IL 1 n 4 mild and n 4 moderate In these cases the GAG after 3 weeks of recovery did not reach the initial levels The GAG in the mild group reached 77 19 of initial GAG n 4 P 0 019 and the moderate group reached 49 11 of initial GAG n 4 P 0 00003 Regional analysis of glycosaminoglycan concentration recovery The mean rate of GAG recovery increase in GAG time averaged across all pixels of IL 1 degraded samples remained steady throughout 3 weeks of post IL 1 exposure culture at a rate of 1 2 mg ml per day 1 2 0 9mg ml per day However looking specifically at the spatial distribution of GAG considerable differences in weekly GAG recovery are clearly evident across different regions of the same samples In both the mild and moderate groups heterogeneous degradation patterns prevailed with greatest degradation occurring in perivascular regions Fig 1c 1d although the degradation in the moderate group was more severe and homogeneous than in the mild group the control images and abundant experience with this model system supports the implicit assumption here that the initial before IL 1 distribution of GAG was homogeneous From a qualitative examination of the recovery images it can also be appreciated that the regions with relatively low GAG after 3 weeks are also the regions that had relatively low GAG at the beginning of the recovery period immediately after IL 1 exposure Figs 1and 3 To examine this observation more quantitatively and to assess whether the rates of GAG accumulation were correspondingly heterogeneous we examined separately the GAG accumulation in three regions namely those with high medium and low GAG at week 3 as specified above under Image processing which is illustrated for one sample in Fig 3a Interestingly regions of low GAG appeared to recover at the same rate as did regions of medium or high GAG during the first 2 weeks of post IL 1 exposure culture In the first 2 weeks of recovery all regions recovered at a rate of 10 15mg ml per week During the third week the recovery patterns for the three regions differed significantly P 0 001 with the low regions showing negligible GAG accumulation and the high regions the greatest accumulation Fig 3a 3c Discussion The present study clearly demonstrates that bovine cartilage explants can at least partially recover from IL 1 induced degradation by synthesizing new GAG but that the ultimate rate of recovery may be dependent on the degree of initial depletion By monitoring the spatially localized changes in GAG over a 3 week recovery period we showed that GAG increases significantly with time in post IL 1 exposure culture with the early recovery first 2 weeks being independent of absolute GAG but the later recovery third week occurring only in regions with higher GAG With respect to the spatial heterogeneity in recovery rates we are not aware of any histologic or other data describing the apparent dependence of the rate of GAG replenishment on the initial state of the ECM We previously showed that spontaneous recovery from complete trypsin induced GAG loss occurs uniformly throughout the tissue showing no significant spatial heterogeneity in recovery rates and nearly complete recovery to the initial state in approximately 5 weeks 14 Those data suggest that the capacity for cells to synthesize new matrix is uniform throughout the tissue Thus the differential response seen here is presumably due to the state of the ECM immediately after IL 1 exposure Here we consider GAG as a surrogate for defining the ECM state immediately following IL 1 exposure GAG itself is one direct measure of ECM state In the context of the present study GAG might also serve as a surrogate for the state of other ECM macromolecules such as collagen Given the broad spectrum of IL 1 induced enzymes we consider that regions of the tissue where GAG is more severely affected by IL 1 may also be regions that experience greater damage to the collagen network as compared with regions that are more resistant to the effects of IL 1 Our finding that the regions that experienced the least recovery were those most severely affected by IL 1 could be a consequence of these same regions sustaining more significant damage to the ECM network This conclusion is consistent with findings regarding IL 1 induced degradation in rabbits in which recovery rates decreased with apparent severity of degradation 1 Interestingly it is in the latter phase of recovery that a discrepancy in recovery rates becomes evident During the early phases of recovery the rate of GAG accumulation in the regions with the lowest GAG was comparable to the rates of recovery in regions with the highest GAG The mechanism for this heterogeneity is unclear It could be a manifestation of a corresponding distribution of IL 1 induced changes in chondrocyte metabolism or viability 23 or it could be a manifestation of a corresponding distribution of damage to the collagen scaffold which in turn limits the ability to replenish GAG Kruijsen et al 24 showed that both the severity and chronicity of antigen induced inflammation determined the degree of chondrocyte killing in their in vivo murine model of arthritis Their studies showed that chondrocyte death was most highly correlated with the degree of joint inflammation present 14 days after arthritis induction That finding suggests that sustained exposure to IL 1 a proinflammatory agent may also cause chondrocyte death However the fact that the early recovery phase in the present study showed no heterogeneity makes cell death a less likely cause of limited GAG replenishment A limitation and obvious next step to this study is that we do not have independent information about the integrity of the collagen matrix Magnetic resonance imaging techniques are actively being developed to image the collagen component of tissue which can be incorporated into future studies 25 Human osteoarthritic tissue is by histologic measures spatially heterogeneous in both collagen damage and degree of proteoglycan depletion The notion that the differential ability to replenish GAG fully is related to the differential state of the collagen matrix has been suggested by others based in part on the finding that GAG depletion corresponds with regions that are positive for the col3 4 epitope which is indicative of collagen damage 6 26 Although we lack specific information on the state of the collagen matrix the differences observed in the present study and indeed the demonstrated ability to evaluate regional differences in response suggest that dGEMRIC and model systems such as these may be useful for establishing a better understanding of the capacity of cartilage to repair osteoarthritis like degradation The rate of GAG replenishment observed in this study compares well with published synthesis data Using sulfate incorporation over periods of less than 24 hours we and others have reported sulfate incorporation ratios between 0 06 and 0 13nmol mg wet weight hour for young bovine cartilage 27 28 29 These incorporation rates imply GAG synthesis rates of 6 13 mg ml tissue water per week assuming 1 sulfate per disaccharide 502 g mol disaccaride and 0 8ml tissue water g wet weight By comparison we observed GAG accumulation rates of 4 14mg ml per week as inferred from the change in GAG These values also compare well with the 2 7 3mg ml per week rates of GAG replenishment seen in young bovine cartilage explants recovering from trypsin induced GAG depletion 14 Comparison of these GAG accumulation rates with the rate of GAG release into the culture medium clearly suggests that at least 75 of the newly synthesized GAG is retained by the tissue By contrast in control tissue the amount of GAG synthesized is roughly equivalent to the amount released into the medium We do not have the ability to determine the regional variations in synthesis and loss Although we clearly observed regional variations in GAG accumulation it is important to appreciate that these differences could arise by regional differences in synthesis or in loss or both Looking more generally at attempts to evaluate GAG recovery in IL 1 degraded cartilage our data are consistent with the temporal progression seen in other model systems in which recovery occurs and is measurable within the first few weeks after a GAG depleting intervention For example Takegami et al 9 reported GAG recovery in alginate cultures of human intervertebral disc cells pre exposed to 0 5ng ml IL 1 for 3 days During the first 2 weeks of post IL 1 exposure culture those investigators observed GAG recovery rates of approximately 4 day with very little change in GAG observed during the third week when GAG levels reached about 85 of the control level In an in vivo rabbit knee joint subjected to intra articular injections of IL 1 Page Thomas et al 3 used SO 4 uptake and toluidine blue staining to observe GAG losses of 25 60 in several cartilage sites within the knee with gradual recovery over the subsequent 3 4 weeks Arner 1 also examined in vivo GAG synthesis and accumulation in rabbits following intra articular injections of IL 1 Using dimethylmethylene blue assay and sulfate incorporation Arner found that both single and multiple injections of IL 1 led to an initial depression in GAG synthesis rate and a slight drop in tissue GAG for 4 days after IL 1 exposure These changes were followed by enhanced synthesis relative to controls with a commensurate increase in tissue GAG over the subsequent 2 weeks as the content of GAG in the tissue approached 90 of control levels In those in vivo systems it appears that GAG loss continues for 4 7 days after IL 1 exposure 1 This is longer than the 1 2 days seen in the present study in which GAG loss into the medium returned to control levels and is probably a consequence of IL 1 clearing more quickly from the in vitro environment Thus in widely different model systems including that reported here it appears that after an IL 1 induced GAG depleting intervention tissue can reaccumulate GAG and does so most rapidly during the first few weeks However unlike the study described here in which both spatial and temporal changes in GAG were monitored in the studies described above it was not possible to derive more specific spatial information because the destructive nature of the GAG measurements required that time course information be inferred from averages of separate animals samples harvested at different time points Our data can also be compared with those from other studies in which magnetic resonance methods were used to monitor changes in cartilage tissue during culture Our group previously observed spatially uniform recovery of explants following trypsin induced GAG depletion using dGEMRIC with the increases in GAG occurring most rapidly during the first week and slowing considerably after 3 weeks 14 Williams et al 15 used the same method to monitor GAG accumulation in tissue engineered cartilage over 6 weeks and observed relatively steady GAG accumulation over the entire period with the bulk of the accumulation occurring at the periphery of the explant The initial state of the cell polymer construct was presumably uniform and the heterogeneous GAG accumulation was attributed to differences in the biophysical environment Potter et al 30 observed the growth of tissue engineered over a period of 4 weeks using proton NMR without any additional contrast agent The relative changes in T1 and T2 times of those studies tracked the histologic finding that GAG increased for the first 3 weeks and then remained relatively constant Collectively those studies and the present one illustrate spatial and temporal variations in GAG accumulation in native treated and tissue engineered cartilage Much work of course remains if we are to begin to understand the biochemical biophysical and structural factors that underlie the differential behavior Furthermore much work remains to determine the generalizability of the behavior in these model systems involving young tissue to behavior of cartilage in vivo in older humans Conclusion In the present study we demonstrated that chondrocytes in a matrix degraded by IL 1 exposure partially replenished the GAG and the most severely degraded regions replenished less fully than did other regions Future studies are underway to examine whether heterogeneity in replenishment rate is seen in human osteoarthritic tissue The study provides additional evidence that the in vitro dGEMRIC method is a practical means for studying GAG homeostasis and events that disturb it Ultimately such studies provide the foundation for evaluating the effects of therapeutic interventions on GAG degradation or regeneration in vitro or in vivo 13 Competing interests None declared Abbreviations dGEMRIC delayed gadolinium enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of cartilage ECM extracellular matrix GAG
