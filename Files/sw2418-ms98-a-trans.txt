with us i have another one and shes talked to students uh so i guess they have uh sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things so theyre if youre a computer user so my daughter has talked to two students uh that were non TIers so i guess oh yeah   oh i think thats a thats a good idea all right   were were on finances have you have you retired or uh   oh no no no no  actually i left TI um i had basically set my sights to leave TI when they announced there would be no salary increases in ninety one   oh   because i i definitely definitely need to make a little more money and uh i havent really accomplished that yet but im trying   oh yeah oh yeah its uh thats the finances i guess were on the subject of finances it is tough uh ive been with TI im just going to be fifteen years this year and thats a tough thing uh the salary thing TI doesnt quite always do it right well what about our our our financial budget well you you should have a lot of information on a budget then if youre uh   i wish i did i i hope youre youre a person who does things better than i i dont have a budget thats one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good oh long range planning budget mode um im a single mom and ive been just uh trying to get   well you you you deserve an honor for that a gold star for that i guess   thank you its nice to have someone understand that   right sure   how how about yourself do you have a budget you live by   well i guess i do i do have a long term budget because i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college so that ive been thinking about that for quite a while now monthly monthly no ill tell you a funny story about budgeting uh ive been married twenty six years and i did you know that the macho thing the man always did the bills for i dont know fifteen years or more and i got so sick of it trying to balance the budget   umhum   uh one and i always tried to show my wife you know heres how you once a year id say heres how you do the budget in case i get sick or heres how you do the checks you know   right   one day i gave her the checkbook and i said im not doing this anymore you do it you learn it and ive been happy ever since   well thats great how about your   she does it all now for about ten years and i dont even she complains to me about it she threatens me to give it back to me and i said ive been a happy man since i havent fooled with that checkbook you know  so i know its a big pain to try to do that       it really is it it really is you know uh that was always a a major problem in our marriage what i have always identified is i am basically good with money it i dont really need a budget to tell me not to spend it i think that comes from never having enough you know im always afraid of  im going to need some and where will it be   right right oh yeah   so um no i ive ive finally worked myself into a spot where i can budget when i when i was first divorced i had um i sat down and budgeted and i had outgo that was what much higher than what i had coming in   yes i think uh that is a tough uh we all seems to think seems to be that way   i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me and   yeah   and so now that ive gotten you know i lost the house now that ive gotten past that i can sit down and say okay this is the reality this is how much money i have each month the scary thing is as far as long term i dont have anything i dont know if you have an IRA or uh you know and ive got two girls also and i havent saved anything for their college and   yeah thats you need to do that ill ill ill give you a hint i dont know if youre a talk a radio talk uh person listener do you listen to radio talk shows   sometimes i have   listen to Bruce Williams uh for financial advice hes on oh i dont know what hes going to be in Austin hes on five seventy here international oh hes nationally famous   umhum   hes a college graduate type guy hes been in all hes an entrepreneur and he gives very practical financial advice about cars very you know not not nothing college level basic stuff his name is Bruce Williams hes on national radio uh i dont know what it would be down there you might want to whatever your radio talk shows are down there hes on that channel its uh its five seventy up here   well ill check that out uhhuh   and id listen to talk shows for everything for gardening and everything just when im doing chores and uh he gives a wealth of information very practical stuff and and   youve learned a lot   he will help you avoid a lot of little things uh financially   well thats thats good to know how   he yeah there theres a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget and i im not expert again because i dont really do it monthly   umhum well you must have done something youre youre helping your children in school and youre you know   right i did start a college fund im not uh i have one again at UT down there now her first year and shes almost gone through her whole college fund you know   uhhum uhhum excuse me Jim could you hold on i have someone at the door ill be right back   sure go ahead sure   thank you i think we might have just screwed up the computer but well find out   oh no yeah right they give us ten minutes uh uh the only advice i give you on college would be theres a lot of scholarship money out there my daughter got a little bit not much only first year she got about two thousand dollars worth   oh   and you ought to as your daughters approach the college age uh start finding out about the scholarship money because there is a lot of money out there and uh   and and how did your daughter get scholarship money on   uh band she got you know five hundred dollars at a at a clip through bands through leadership uh theres all kinds of civic organizations organizations that will give you you know one shot money uh you get a presidents award if youre youre in in high school doing certain this up area in Arlington uh theres a lot of and of course you if you you score high on the SAT you can get you know two thousand a year you know or more   umhum wow   you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades she she did very well in school and uh but she only got first year money she got about two thousand dollars it was only five hundred dollars at a clip from this organization   uhhum   we called there were there were two or three people there was some little civic organization in Dallas that gave money away and only two or three people applied she applied and got five hundred dollars from that   wow oh im definitely going to be uh actively looking into that   so look into that bit the year that they graduate you know before though you know while theyre graduating theres all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away churches and everything and they dont even have a dozen applicants because uh uh the kids are going off after the big money   umhum   uh of course you have to have some sort of record in high school uh of of achievement and everything but sometimes its just uh like our band gave money away were a band booster club we gave we give uh two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids uh who we think were worthy you know so   well thats great to know   theres money out there   yeah thats good   go ahead you can talk i i dont want to i want to chew up the whole line here   oh well youre doing youre doing just fine and and uh actually i when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions i was wondering what you do at TI   oh im an engineer im uh in fact im working the night uh because of the cutbacks and everything uh my job there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved and so they put me on nights i i call this my recession job and im working nights just kind of cov ering uh shutdown equipment and everything and just being available here i dont mind   oh goodness umhum umhum   uh it beats being laid off and everything and uh you you got to be a little flexible uh in my old age im trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school   oh absolutely yeah   and then id like to teach maybe mathematics or something im trying to study for that now   oh i hope you can do that what what i did is i was approached and and ive i went to TI just right at the time that uh my marriage was ending i had been a   right uh   a stay at home mom and and i i  was very fortunate in starting and i really enjoyed it while i was at TI but you know the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening and i had less than five years   umhum   and also i wanted to make a little bit more money so i decided id like to go out and try sales and uh im im out trying to sell   oh yeah   telephone systems to businesses and the potential there is fantastic the reality of it is its tough   right oh sure well its tough right now for everybody up here in the Dallas Metroplex its awful hey ive got another clue for you for college   exactly umhum   another clue for you for college money go to work for UT   okay   uh we have a friend who works who is a secretary for TCU you know up here they give you scholarship a hundred percent   yes   if youre if you work for TCU   they do   yes so check that one out you know   im going to check that ive got ive got two friends that work at at UT i didnt know that at all definitely i will   ask them about it call them and because its full full scholarship now its uh not room and board but its tuition full tuition paid if your parent works at TCU   uhhuh well that sounds fantastic   and her her her uh mother went over there just for that
