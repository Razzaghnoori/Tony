 Background Jet injection is a relatively simple and low cost method for gene transfer into somatic tissues 1 Aside from the injector no special equipment or solutions are required Plasmid DNA is suspended at the desired concentration in one of several types of solution and injected into tissue More than one plasmid construct can be injected simultaneously Injection of antigen encoding plasmids can be combined with either adjuvants or plasmids encoding immune enhancing cytokines Low volume jet injection deliberately limits the volume of the injected solution and is utilized to target delivery to small tissue areas 2 In mice multiple different routes of DNA immunization have been used successfully 3 Particle bombardment of skin is reported to be superior to both intra dermal and intra muscular needle and syringe injection for induction of immunity in mice when compared directly 4 5 6 7 8 In Aotus monkeys and pigs intra dermal administration of DNA vaccine by needle and syringe is reported to be more effective at inducing an immune response than intra muscular administration by needle and syringe 9 10 High volume jet injection 500 l of either 100 or 1000 g DNA into ovine muscle or mammary gland 11 12 or 500 g DNA into four separate muscle sites in rabbits 13 induces humoral immunity Multiple studies have demonstrated that particle bombardment of skin elicits immune responses in larger animals 14 15 16 17 18 Similarly high volume jet injection 100 l of either 50 or 250 g DNA into the skin of primates induces immunity 19 Delivery to the oral mucosa by jet injection elicited a higher IgA response than intranasal delivery in mice 20 However none of these studies compared different intracutaneous DNA delivery methods within the same study This investigation tested the ability of low volume jet injection to target delivery of a DNA vaccine to the skin for the purpose of inducing immunity A direct comparison of the new methodology to the established techniques of particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection was performed The experiments demonstrated that low volume jet injection successfully induced immunity in rabbits Moreover there were no significant differences between jet injection and particle bombardment in the maximal antibody titers or number of injections before response In contrast no rabbits receiving DNA vaccine by needle and syringe injection developed an antibody response In the low volume jet injection and particle bombardment groups gene expression levels in the skin did not predict the magnitude of the immune response While immune responses were comparable luciferase gene expression levels in the skin following particle bombardment were 10 100 times higher than low volume jet injection Results and discussion Low volume jet injection targets delivery of a plasmid DNA solution to the epidermis and dermis of rabbits Injection path lengths were measured following low volume jet injection of a 1 India ink solution Injection paths averaged between 0 5 mm and 0 75 mm Figure 1 The injection paths did not extend through the dermis These experiments show that low volume jet injection specifically targeted delivery of a DNA solution to the skin and that the injection paths did not reach into the underlying tissue Optimal injection parameters for low volume jet injection particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection Optimal injection parameters for each technique were established by comparing relative mean expression levels of the luciferase reporter gene in the skin 48 hours after injection Injection parameters that yielded the highest levels of luciferase expression were selected as optimal Particle bombardment produced the highest mean levels of luciferase activity Table 1 Mean luciferase activity following low volume jet injection was 10 100 fold lower than following particle bombardment Mean luciferase activity following needle and syringe injection was 50 fold lower than jet injection Maximal antibody titers and number of injections before response following low volume jet injection particle bombardment and needle and syringe delivery of a DNA vaccine to the skin Injections of plasmid DNA encoding the Hepatitis B Surface Antigen HBSAg were performed at Days 0 14 and 28 Antibody titers were determined prior to any injection Day 0 two weeks after each of the three injections Days 14 28 and 42 and four weeks after the third and final injection Day 56 By days 14 and 28 two of five rabbits immunized by low volume jet injection demonstrated a statistically significant and titratable response at serial time points that persisted through day 56 Figure 2A ANOVA P 0 009 at the 1 250 dilution P 0 003 at the 1 2 500 dilution at day 56 The number of injections before response and the maximal antibody responses were comparable to rabbits that received DNA immunization by particle bombardment By days 14 1 and 42 2 three of five rabbits immunized by particle bombardment demonstrated a statistically significant response at serial time points Figure 2B One rabbit expired during anesthesia at the day 28 injection time point At day 56 the immune response was statistically significant only at the 1 250 dilution in the two remaining rabbits ANOVA P 0 001 at the 1 250 dilution P 0 609 at the 1 2 500 dilution There was no statistically significant difference in maximal antibody titers between low volume jet injection and particle bombardment ANOVA P 0 875 Figure 3 In contrast to immunization with either low volume jet or particle bombardment there was no significant titratable antibody response in rabbits that received DNA immunization by needle and syringe injection ANOVA P 0 062 at the 1 250 dilution P 0 140 at the 1 2 500 dilution at day 56 Longer term experiments and larger groups of rabbits will be required to determine if persistence of antibody is different between the low volume jet injected and particle bombardment groups The experiments demonstrate that intradermal low volume jet injection of a DNA vaccine can be utilized to elicit immune responses The low volume jet injection method was comparable to the more established technique of particle bombardment and was significantly better than the established technique of needle and syringe injection Conclusion Low volume jet injection is an effective new methodology for intradermal DNA immunization that has advantages over the established techniques of needle and syringe injection and particle bombardment It is more effective than needle and syringe injection and is simpler to perform than particle bombardment because the plasmid DNA solution can be injected directly rather than being precipitated onto specific particles High levels of gene expression were not required for successful intradermal genetic immunization by low volume jet injection Gene expression levels following particle bombardment were 10 100 fold higher than those found following low volume jet injection but the immune response was equivalent The disassociation between local gene expression levels in the injected skin and immune response is consistent with a previous report 16 Materials and methods Plasmids A plasmid encoding the HBSAg under the control of the Human Cytomegalovirus Immediate Early gene I HCMVIE1 enhancer promoter pRc CMV HBs S was obtained from Aldevron Fargo ND 20 A plasmid encoding the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the HCMVIE1 enhancer promoter pHCMVIE1 luciferase was used to measure relative gene expression levels following gene transfer by low volume jet injection particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection 2 Plasmids were propagated in DH5 cells and purified by Bio 101 Merlin Core Services Carlsbad CA Animals skin preparation and injection schedules Twenty five male New Zealand White rabbits were obtained at 2 3 kg in weight Animals were purchased from a commercial vendor Covance Denver PA Health status was evaluated quarterly by the vendor and the animals were free of tested pathogens other than Bordetella bronchiseptica and rotavirus but these were not expected to interfere with the current study The rabbits were in excellent health and not symptomatic The rabbits were anesthetized with 40 mg kg Ketamine 100 mg ml and 3 mg kg Xylazine 20 mg ml prior to each injection In preparation for injection the dorsal skin was shaved treated with a depilatory and washed with a chlorhexidine scrub followed by 70 alcohol Following injections 0 05 mg kg Buprenorphine 0 3 mg ml was given for analgesia To establish skin penetration depth following low volume jet injection one rabbit was injected at 6 different sites with a 1 India ink solution The skin was removed at necropsy and examined under a dissecting microscope to measure the length of the injection paths To establish optimal injection conditions for low volume jet injection two rabbits were injected at a total of 15 sites per rabbit with pHCMVIE1 luciferase and euthanized 48 h later The injected skin was removed at necropsy and tested for luciferase activity When using particle bombardment the goal is to deliver the majority of gold particles into the epithelial cell layer rather than the deeper less cellular dermis 21 To establish skin penetration depth following particle bombardment four rabbits were injected at eight sites on each rabbit The skin was removed at necropsy and fixed in 10 neutral formalin embedded by standard methods and 5 micron sections were prepared Hematoxylin and eosin stained sections were examined under the microscope to determine the penetration depth Gold particles were found distributed primarily in the epidermis and minimally in the superficial dermis of the rabbit skin data not shown To establish optimal injection conditions for particle bombardment six rabbits were injected at a total of 12 sites per rabbit with pHCMVIE1 luciferase and euthanized 48 h later The injected skin was removed at necropsy and tested for luciferase activity To establish optimal conditions for intra dermal needle and syringe injection two rabbits were injected at a total of 7 sites per rabbit with pHCMVIE1 luciferase and euthanized 48 h later The injected skin was removed at necropsy and tested for luciferase activity For the immunization experiments rabbits were injected at three time points at two weeks intervals 0 days 14 days and 28 days Three ml blood was obtained from an ear vein prior to each injection and two weeks and four weeks following the third and final injection One of the five rabbits that received particle bombardment injection died under anesthesia prior to the second injection A necropsy was performed no abnormalities were found and the death was attributed to anesthesia Optimization of low volume jet injection particle bombardment and needle and syringe injection conditions Low volume jet injection was performed with a prototype low volume jet injector with adjustable injection volume and pressure The plasmid DNA solution at 1 g l was prepared in phosphate buffered saline PBS The injector is manufactured with a refillable liquid reservoir that holds 180 l and can rapidly deliver multiple injections to the same site EMS Konstanz Germany 2 22 For optimization of the jet injection experiments three different injection volume settings 5 l 6 l and 7 l at three different pressures 1 2 and 3 Bar were tested When using low volume jet injection for intradermal delivery the goal is contain the delivery solution within the epidermis and dermis but optimize gene expression levels Conditions for optimal gene expression were established by testing luciferase activity in the skin 48 h following injection of pHCMVIE1 luciferase Four rapid injections at each volume were used for total DNA delivery of 20 l 20 g plasmid DNA 24 l 24 g plasmid DNA and 28 l 28 g plasmid DNA The injected fluid remained within the dermis under all conditions The delivery volume with the highest mean luciferase expression was chosen as the optimal delivery condition for the immunization studies This optimal setting of 28 l 28 g plasmid DNA delivered at 3 Bar was utilized for each immunization time point A Helios Gene Gun System Bio Rad Laboratories Hercules CA was utilized for particle bombardment Plasmid DNA was precipitated onto gold particles 1 6 microns in diameter following standard protocols 21 Optimization conditions tested included the helium pressure concentration of polyvinylpyrrolidone PVP amount of carrier gold and DNA concentration as described previously 23 Conditions for optimal gene expression were established by testing luciferase activity in the skin 48 h following injection of pHCMVIE1 luciferase The set of conditions pressure PVP concentration gold and DNA amounts with the highest mean luciferase expression and optimal skin penetration was chosen as the optimal combination for immunization studies This optimal setting of one g plasmid DNA prepared with 0 05 mg ml PVP 0 50 mg gold delivered at 360 psi was utilized for each immunization time point A plasmid DNA solution at 1 g l was prepared in PBS A 29 gauge needle and 1 ml syringe were utilized for intra dermal injection Conditions for optimal gene expression in the injected skin were established prior to the genetic immunization experiments When using needle and syringe injection for intradermal delivery the goal is contain the delivery solution within the epidermis and dermis but optimize gene expression levels Conditions for optimal gene expression were established by testing luciferase activity in the skin 48 h following injection of pHCMVIE1 luciferase A maximum of 20 l 20 g plasmid DNA could be injected and kept contained within the epidermis and dermis This volume yielded the highest luciferase values The optimal condition of twenty l 20 g plasmid DNA was delivered at each immunization time point Luciferase Assay Two days after injection rabbits were euthanized and the area of injected skin excised Skin tissue was homogenized in lysis reagent buffer Luciferase Assay System Promega Madison WI For each injection sample luciferase activity was measured in duplicate using a TD 20 20 Luminometer Turner Designs Sunnyvale CA 2 Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay ELISA Affinity purified recombinant Hepatitis B antigen produced in Saccharomyces cerevisae following transformation with the plasmid pCGA7 was used for detection of antibody responses using an ELISA Aldevron Fargo ND 20 The recombinant antigens were diluted in 0 1 M carbonate buffer pH 9 6 and coated at 1 ug 100 ul per well in 96 well microtitre plates Dynex Technologies INC Chantilly VA Adjoining negative control wells were coated

in PBS before serum was added One hundred ul of PBS Tween 20 with 1 BSA was added to each well To quantify the antibody response at the different time points after injection s for each rabbit 100 ul of diluted serum samples at 1 25 1 250 and 1 2 500 were added to separate wells in duplicate Assays for all time points were performed simultaneously The entire assay was repeated at least twice for all samples Rabbit sera obtained prior to any injection were utilized as negative controls The plate was incubated at 37 C for 1 h After additional washing phosphatase conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG antibody was added into each sample well and incubated for 1 h at 37 C Diethanolamine DEA buffer phosphatase substrate Kirkegaard Perry Lab Gaithersburg Maryland was added into all wells and the plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark The reaction was terminated after the appearance of color using 3 N NaOH The absorbance was measured at 410 nm using a microplate reader Emax Sunnyvale CA The mean value for each set of duplicate wells was determined Specific binding to the Hepatitis B antigen was determined by subtracting the mean value from the negative
