largest growing area in the country for businesses yeah i like the pine trees yeah yeah yeah i ve i ve been over there from time to time uh you re you re at the University of North Carolina no North

dad is too in fact i went up there visiting i had a friend at Davidson one time and i went up there visiting him and and he took me out running through the trails in the piney woods up there and i just loved it yeah yeah it s nice so well what are we supposed to i i was kind of fumbling this was the first i haven t been home other nights when they ve called so this is the first time i ve participated yeah and uh uh and i i was fumbling for my uh pin number uh when she was talking about what to talk about and what are we supposed to discuss it s it s clothing yeah uh how you dress to go to work or something like that right how you how you dress to go to work and how it changes from season to season oh and from day to day okay well i m ready any time you are sir okay okay ready i m going to press the one hey uh how does this work Fernando do we talk for five minutes and does somebody cut us off or no then then we say bye and uh i i probably uh how do we know how do we know when the time s up well i i got a stopwatch here oh okay so i ll probably say you know it s like well we ve been talking for five six minutes so okay okay you want to go first or me well uh we ll just open it okay i ll press the one ready okay ready one okay okay so well you see since i don t work i just go you know to class it all depends because i like to wear like sweat pants yeah because it s more comfortable for me but you know it s like when you re in school you either wear sweatpants or jeans yeah uh you know i i i can remember back to my college days and uh it was uh T shirts and jeans in the warm weather and jackets and jeans in the short weather uh the thing is here i m i m supposed to be an executive you you can uh uh take that or or not depends on where you re looking from yeah and however and you normally think people in our position wear shirts and ties well many do but i am absolutely not comfortable with a necktie yeah i carry one in my briefcase and i wear it i wear it when the occasion demands if somebody important is coming to visit well i take it out and put it on uh i wear a sport jacket sometimes and i wear uh well reasonably not not real dressy dressy pants but but reasonably decent reasonably decent pants yeah and uh comfortable comfortable that way and a good loose fitting pair of shoes that i take off under tables when i m in a conference room because i can t stand having anything on my feet and uh say i like my shirt and short i wear short sleeved shirts all year round i just okay are they like T shirts or are they like do they have yeah yeah no short sleeved sort of semi dress shirt oh okay but i i i absolutely cannot stand anything down over my elbows and when i m working and and i mean that s even in the winter time well because how how hot i mean like like in the coldest that it gets in winter down there how much is it well we ll have a day or two that it ll be down near zero as it has been the last two years just before Christmas but at uh uh normally it ll be in the thirties and forties on the coldest days and we ve experienced some seventies here uh to eighties recently yeah yeah that s but i i don t ever feel the need to dress that warmly i i don t have to travel that far to work uh what what what what about uh your clothes in the winter time up there well it s basically you know it s like i got like a leather jacket or a you know so i just put on a T shirt and a leather jacket and i usually stay in class that way and if not i would wear a sweatshirt underneath it and then you know you d but what happens is uh what i ve seen here on campus it s very strange because a lot of black people here they wear like dress pants and dress shirts to go everywhere um hum my goodness i i ve not see that at all okay and they wear either that or they wear dress pants and b lack turtlenecks or white turtlenecks um hum yeah and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans yeah but um but basically all over here everywhere everybody wears jeans and if not what the what the thing is that they re wear ing now is sometimes you wear like shorts with biker pants underneath it which is okay that that sounds pretty good uh it sounds like it s a very relaxed atmosphere on campus you know i ve uh i ve uh always TI is a very informal company uh i i think the thing that i ve noticed in more recent years there s more ties and jackets and shirts as the younger the younger crowd seems to want to dress those of us i ve been here thirty two years those of us been here for a long time don t care to dress up but when we came to work i was told that the president of the company set the standard of dress and he s he dressed like the janitor so we all we all did and the feeling has always been that without the shirts and ties and suit coats that people were in a more relaxed atmosphere and you could have a freer exchange of information yeah and i ve seen this actually i spent seven years overseas with TI and while i was gone where at where at uh Malaysia four years in Malaysia and three years in the Philippines oh okay and and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in TI for the first time yeah what was interesting Malaysia is a tropical country just uh two degrees above the equator yeah and when i went over there i packed a lot of clothes and i packed two sport jackets and two ties and the ties got lost and never got there and i was there three years or four years rather and never missed them i absolutely never wore anything out in the tropics like a necktie but the thing is when you started with TI was it as big a company as it is now oh no no uh i think it was something i started in nineteen fifty nine we re talking about at the most eight to nine thousand people world wide and at that time the whole world was right here in Dallas as far as TI was concerned yeah yeah which is which is basic i mean when hello uh is that uh i m sorry that s you probably got wait calling yeah i got a wait call hang on a second okay well i guess i m supposed to talk alone while he s on the wait call about clothing right so i don t know what to say i don t wear any clothing we re at nudist camp we don t wear any clothes here you still there Fernando sorry uh yeah oh that s okay and anyway uh where uh oh we re talking about the size of the company yeah it was uh about eight or nine thousand people when i got here it has in the past gotten up to eighty six thousand we re not we re that high right now yeah but uh in in many many many many countries or was that in the seventies uh no i started in nineteen fifty nine i no no but uh when it it had gone up oh yeah yeah yeah it peaked out in the seventies yes yeah i ve i ve i ve got thirty two years in yeah yeah i remember i i quit i sort of remember that i m only twenty two but in the seventies i heard you know TI was even making uh those little watches you know those those uh LED watches that you couldn t see in the sun okay right right right we made those yeah yeah yeah i used to referee soccer games and uh uh i would use those watches to time the games and i d be out on the field middle of the field at high noon yeah and have to cup my hand over it and peek down there with my eye to see what time it was and uh yeah we were about the first ones to make those and went out of that business in nineteen eighty one so yeah uh back to uh uh back to clothes i don t really i don t really have what you d you d think was an expensive wardrobe i mean some people are very very very clothes conscious uh well they said that women like the the you know executive women or women that work whatever they spend uh five hundred dollars on clothes a year so but but for me huh um hum um hum yeah i wouldn t i i would think they d spend at least that as the at the cost of clothes yeah i mean women go all i mean what i ve seen like you know they like to wear something different every day and for me it s like people know how i dress and we we have you know like the gym here yeah they give you shirts right which which you use and then you take back they give you a clean one yeah yeah and so sometimes you wear you know the shirts from from the gym everyday of the week the only thing is that you can tell them apart because they have the year that they were bought in yeah um hum so i mean you don t feel as bad because it s like they they give you different year sometimes you know so you re wearing you know sometimes you re wearing eighty nine the other times sometimes you re wearing ninety one the other times you re wearing you know eighty six so it s okay you know is that for like gym classes for PE classes and things like that right see when we take PE you have to dress in the in PE clothes but it is it s issued to any one that wants one that s in the university yeah yeah right right right how many hours are you taking well right now since i m graduating i m only
