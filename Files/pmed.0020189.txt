                            Shah Ebrahim says in his answer to my statement in our debate  that plaque is so        common that it makes sense to treat only those likely to have an acute event in the near        future Not everyone has a heart attack but everyone ages nor can we be sure who will be        lucky as they age and who will not Anyone with a lowdensity lipoprotein level above         mgdl is at risk  Narrowing of arteries must certainly contribute to health decline in        aging He says that most plaque is stable and does not rupture The halfmillion people who        have a heart attack and the hundreds of thousands of individuals who have a stroke in the        United States alone each year would disagree Waiting decades more for further studies will        not help all those now succumbing to the disease as long as all the components have        already been well vetted as they have been Ebrahims statement that most plaques are        stable and unlikely to rupture is based on his own study published in         Stroke  but the paper has no data relating to how many patients found        to have increased intimamedia wall thickness IMT or plaque actually had heart attacks or        strokes It did find that intimalwall changes were highly associated with ischemic heart        disease        It is correct that risk factors can predict heart disease and stroke to some degree        though I have many patients for whom that approach fails while IMT detects the risk        otherwise missed However risk factor analysis is not enough Changes in smoking diet        weight blood pressure and such are all targets for treatment but how do doctors know        whether they have controlled them adequately If IMT increases more control is required        If IMT stabilizes or reverses a little then it means that control is at goal Family        history of premature coronary artery disease is a major but underused risk factor The        causative factors have not yet been elucidated by research so we do not know what the        goals are However IMT provides a highly satisfactory parameter by which to judge the        effectiveness of treatment in familial coronary artery disease IMT stabilization and        reversal are good whereas progression is bad and requires more intensive measures        Epidemiology and publichealth planning correctly look at policies to apply to large        populations However the practice of medicine is patient by patient accomplished in the        facetoface doctorpatient relationship Policy can be useful as a resource but each        patient should have the maximum individualized care and access that a doctor can provide        Patients should be able to make their own informed choices and not be dictated to by        policies meant for masses Shouldnt everyone with increased IMT at least be informed of        the options available to limit it rather than waiting until acute events or advanced        narrowing occur It would be best to start a healthy lifestyle from birth but fortunately        by adulthood there is still time to make an enormous difference in practical terms if we        take action at the stage when intimal widening is detectable with the highly sensitive        ultrasound described in my original viewpoint
