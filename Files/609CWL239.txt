 I m In Indianapolis again for the next few months directing A Christmas Carol and Candida the next two main stage shows at one of my favorite theatres the IRT As an associate artist of the the theatre it s my privilege to be aware of the great thing happening at the IRT and to encourage you to give generously to see the success continue You need to know that the IRT is talked about very favorably among theatre artists around the country Indianapolis is truly one of the best places for actors to work for many reasons the artistic quality is top rate the education programs lead the country other theatres wish they could reach even half of the 45 000 students the IRT does the treatment we receive here is the friendliest and most accommodating the IRT audiences really listen and respond For those of us who travel more than half a year these things are just as important as salary considerations when taking an acting job I ve been affiliated with the IRT for 17 years I started my directing career here This place is a second home for me and I feel lucky to have it Hoosier hospitality is everything they say that s why so many artists fall in love with the IRT and keep returning They make visiting artists happy with things such as emergency babysitting transportation and dinners in staff member s homes They help us find fitness centers yoga classes and chiropractors they take care of our mail and packages for us The people at the IRT and its volunteers go out of their way to make us feel like we re special residents during our stay I also know it costs a lot of money to run a theatre company I ask you to please give today to the IRT and help them continue the marvelous work they have been producing for 26 years Happy Holidays Scott Wentworth
