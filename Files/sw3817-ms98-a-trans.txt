        planned a family reunion recently     the last family reunion i did not plan i only participated and enjoyed about two years ago how about you   you know i really havent and i know of friends whove done it recently and have really enjoyed um the the planning process but uh most of our family see each other fairly frequently so its its uh you know not a a major event to to try and plan it because were all fairly close um   it often depends how far you want to go back on on our particular family reunion they went back to my greatgreatgrandfather so that it was quite um spread out and there were many families um and there were many people we didnt know i think the total participation i dont know how many were invited but there were about two hundred and fifty people there   thats wonderful   and some of the families one of the cutest things that some of the the families families did was to get Tshirts that identified themselves as that branch of the family     oh thats great   it was fun   so your greatgrandfather was still living and everyone up to that point was invited   actually he was not he has gone  but they decided to go ahead and take the family reunion back that far so that it wouldnt just be people meeting third cousins but people meeting i guess whatever fifth and seventh cousins   uhhuh wow   and the other thing that i thought was particularly fun was uh the huge they had a huge family tree uh that was posted so you could sort of everybody could sort of see who married whom and   uhhuh   so that was fun   thats wonderful two hundred people who organized it who was the one that instigated the the planning process   you know in every family theres usually one person that is gifted to do these things  i have a cousin who never marries who is a librarian sounds like a bad novel         um and she did she was shes always been interested in genealogy and shes kind of kept track  and so   i was gonna ask next how she was familiar with where everyone was   um i think she just started out writing to key people in the different branches of families and asking them to contact everyone and i really  on the family tree there really was everyone except there was just some one group that had sort of gotten lost   uhhuh uhhuh   in Missouri but this is was in Indiana  and it was a lot of the people had kind of stayed in one area   uhhuh uhhuh   so it wasnt like they were necessarily from all over the country but   now given the size of the group were there people were most of the families fairly large is that what contributed to that   were a good Catholic German stock and so yes       the original family that i eluded to my greatgrandfather had twelve children and they had some pictures of that that was another thing they did that i thought was fun   thats great   sounds like the trelve twelve tribes of Israel or something   thats wonderful im sure that was a wonderful experience for the kids too and even if they didnt appreciate it at the moment theyll  probably really appreciate it later   thats always true they remember most the games they had lots of games and competitions which were fun well are you planning a family reunion   no uh  uh   oh do you how your relatives youre from San youre in San Francisco   yeah my folks uh moved from Michigan to San Diego and thats where they raised the three of us my daughter my sisters and myself but uh   sometimes when youve moved perhaps your family reunion if there ever one would would be back in Michigan i mean that would be where your roots would be   i would expect yeah yeah and i know that my grandparents families were fairly large but my father has just one brother and my mom has one brother so weve kept in touch those first cousins very pretty closely um im not quite sure how id even pursue finding the rest of the folks in Michigan     this is a little office   i think i think each of my grandparents had ten siblings   that sounds   so theres got to be a few of those second does that make second cousin or third cousin im not sure   typical i never knew that i i always i thought the children like the children of your first cousins i always called those second cousins and my children and my cousins children i called third cousins     oh okay okay   thats how ive always named it some people have this once removed stuff and i dont know what that means   so perhaps my grandparents siblings would be my great great   theyd just be your greataunts greataunt your grandparents siblings would be your great aunts and uncles   aunts and uncles right right   and so but it it is interesting sometimes a little sad when families branch out quite so much but i dont know thats the American way   did you find that you had a lot in common did people find out things about each other that they hadnt been aware   i had two distant relatives who lived in the Dallas Fort Worth area  that that i never had met and didnt know they were here and we we all laughed how it was funny to go back to Indiana to meet people who lived   really     ten miles from you so that was sort of funny in fact one of them its like my father i dont remember how this was i guess it was actually just my fathers cousin so its not all that far away turns out he even goes to our church here in Dallas so   uhhuh
