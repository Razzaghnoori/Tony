 October 14 1993 Name Address City ST Zip Dear Name During the current period of declining state funding for our law school there is one outstanding development In increasing numbers alumni and friends are providing the private resources necessary for scholarships faculty support and other items which enrich the school s curriculum related programs Significant examples are the 500 000 trust agreement executed by Judge Sam Rosen in 1992 in honor of his friend and our former Dean Bill Foust More recently alumni have responded generously to the special Bruce Townsend Endowed Professorship campaign as more than 250 000 has now been given or pledged Have these events put our law school on easy street By no means They will however together with Annual Fund contributions and other gifts assure that students at the school continue to receive an excellent legal education So as the end of 1993 approaches we ask that you remember what your law school education has meant to you and to support the Law School Annual Fund Consider the current enrollment picture at the school and the costs students bear today Demand for a legal education remains high The School of Law in Indianapolis received nearly 1 300 applications to enroll its 1993 first year class of 260 students The school s 800 full and part time students provide in fees and tuition 49 of the school s annual operating budget For 1993 94 Indiana residents pay 143 65 per credit hour and non residents pay 373 80 The average annual course load for first year students in the day program 31 credit hours costs 4 453 for residents and 11 588 for non residents To meet tuition payments and other expenses total loans of the student body each year now exceed 4 000 000 Consequently we have approached the limit on student tuition increases You are all too familiar with Indiana s budget pinch and the pressures on state government to cut expenditures Consequently significant increases in state financial support for higher education is extremely unlikely during the remainder of this decade Gifts from alumni and friends therefore are more critical than ever They provide scholarship dollars which aid students and enable the school to compete with other public and private law schools for outstanding young people Gifts also support student organizations such as moot court supply library materials pay for student research assistants and make available other necessary resources Your contributions to the Annual Fund at the Maennerchor Society level have provided significant assistance to the school Please continue that tradition by completing and returning the enclosed pledge card Payment of 1 000 or more may be made now or at anytime before December 31 1993 Thank you for your past help and your continued support Sincere best wishes John M Holt Donald K Densborn Chairman Chairman Maennerchor Society Dean s Council
