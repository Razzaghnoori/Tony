 Background Lung cancer is the leading killer of all cancer patients It is generally classified as small cell carcinoma and non small cell carcinoma Treatment of lung cancer is less than optimal and the mean survival for advanced lung cancer patient is less than one year regardless what treatment regimen was used 1 A new approach other than conventional chemoradiation therapy is needed for prolonged survival of lung cancer Emerging new treatment modalities are generally targeted to specific tyrosine kinases of the tumor cells through basically two independent approaches 2 One is to use highly specific monoclonal antibody to target the membrane receptors of growth factors important for tumor cell growth and the antibody antigen complex evokes host immune system to kill the tumor cells This approach is exemplified by Her2 neu receptor in breast cancer patients and Herceptin 3 The second approach is to develop small organic molecules targeting the specific tyrosine kinases in the signaling pathway in the tumor cells that can easily gain access into the tumor cells This approach is best exemplified by Gleevec and BCR ABL fusion kinase in chronic myelogenous leukemia 4 Gleevec also known as STI571 Imatinib from Novartis Pharmaceutical Inc a recently FDA approved drug for chronic myelogenous leukemia is an ATP analogue and it competitively binds to and inhibits BCR ABL tyrosine kinase resulted from the chromosomal translocation t 9 22 Gleevec has been shown to induce clinical hematological and molecular remissions for CML patients 4 It cross reacts with two other important growth factor receptors containing tyrosine kinase domains c kit and PDGF receptors that play important roles in growth and proliferation of a variety of cell types 5 C kit also known as CD117 is frequently mutated in gastrointestinal stromal tumor GIST and the mutated c kit shows higher tyrosine kinase activity Gleevec has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth and proliferation of GIST and induce complete or partial clinical remission in GIST patients 6 7 Recently Gleevec was showed to inhibit the growth of dermatofibrosarcma protuberans DFSP through inhibiting the PDGF receptor 8 9 As a part of effort to evaluate the newly emerging drugs for lung cancer we studied the role of Gleevec on non small cell lung cancer We previously showed that non small cell lung cancers express minimal negligible level of c kit Zhang P unpublished Therefore it is unlikely that Gleevec exerts the effect if any through c kit on non small cell lung cancer We reported here a study of inhibitory effect of Gleevec on lung cancer cells A549 cells in vitro We showed that Gleevec alone can inhibit the growth and proliferation of A549 cells at the known therapeutic concentration for CML Addition of Gleevec to A549 cells with cisplatin induced cell death synergistically suggesting Gleevec can potentiate the cisplatin effect on A549 cells We have demonstrated that A549 cells express PDGFR one of the known potential targets for Gleevec effect The inhibitory effect of Gleevec on the A549 cells is likely mediated through inhibition of PDGF receptor phosphorylation We further tested 33 lung cancer patients tumor specimens and showed that most of the lung cancer tumor specimens expressed PDGFR These results provided important in vitro data to support the notion that Gleevec can inhibit the A549 cell growth and proliferation and may potentially offer a treatment option for lung cancer either alone or in conjunction with chemotherapy drug cisplatin Results Gleevec inhibited the A549 cell growth in a dose dependent manner We first test to see if Gleevec can inhibit the growth of A549 cells under the culture conditions We have chosen to perform the experiments under the normal culture condition since we reasoned that the effect of Gleevec on tumor cells if any should be under the normal not serum free condition Therefore we chose to add the drug directly into the culture medium containing 5 fetal calf serum A549 lung cancer cells were plated at two cell densities into the 96 well plates and Gleevec was added to the culture medium We used the MTT assays to assess the viability of the tumor cells treated with or without the drug It was evident that increasing concentrations of Gleevec in the culture medium inhibited the growth of A549 cells in a dose dependent manner The concentration of Gleevec to inhibit 50 cell growth IC50 was estimated to be around 2 3 M Figure 1 whereas the IC50 of cisplatin on A549 cells was estimated to be 64 70 M Figure 2 We have also seen that Gleevec can inhibit the growth of human 293 kidney cells but at slightly higher concentration 4 M The IC50 concentration for A549 cells didn t appear to have inhibitory effects on human 293 cells Figure 3 These results showed that Gleevec alone can indeed inhibit the growth of A549 lung carcinoma cells The inhibitory effect of Gleevec on the A549 cells appeared to be in a therapeutic range of the drug as demonstrated in chronic myelogenous leukemia cells from the patients Gleevec potentiated the cell killing effect of cisplatin One of the major reasons of testing Gleevec for treatment of non small cell lung carcinoma is to see if the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor Gleevec and other potential small molecules currently on clinical trials can be used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in combination with conventional chemotherapy We sought to see if Gleevec can potentiate the cell killing effects of cisplatin the leading chemotherapeutic drug for almost all advanced cancer patients We used the IC50 concentrations for both Gleevec and cisplatin to treat A549 cells in culture and assessed the viability of the cells by MTT assays at the different time points Figure 4 Gleevec 2 M and cisplatin 64 M both inhibited the growth of the tumor cells individually after treatment of the cells for 48 hour Combination of Gleevec and cisplatin synergistically inhibited the growth of A549 cells Figure 4 This synergistic effect of Gleevec and cisplatin on A549 lung cancer cells were not seen for human 293 kidney cells Figure 5 Expression of PDGFR in the A549 lung cancer cells Since the effect of Gleevec is mediated through inhibiting BCR ABL tyrosine kinase c kit and PDGF receptors we are interested in the potential target for Gleevec effect in the lung cancer cells We have previously showed by immunohistochemical staining that in 54 primary non small cell lung carcinoma specimens expression of c kit was weak and minimal if any Tang and Zhang unpublished observation We sought to determine the expression levels of PDGF receptors and in A549 cells and the primary non small cell lung carcinoma by immunofluorescent and immunohistochemical staining methods In A549 cells expression of PDGFR not PDGFR was detected with strong cytoplasmic and membrane staining patterns Figure 6and 7 There was no demonstrable nuclear staining signal We further detected the presence of PDGFR in the whole cell lysates of A549 cells by Western blotting analysis Figure 8 A549 cells were cultured under the condition described and the cells were lysed and the whole cell proteins were separated on 7 5 SDS PAGE The proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane and the PDGFR was detected with anti PDGFR antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnologies Inc Treatment of the cells with Gleevec at two concentrations did not influence the expression of PDGFR expression in the cells PDGFR was not detected in A549 cells using both immunofluorescent staining and Western blot analyses Data not shown Microarrays and immunohistochemical staining Existing data suggest that Gleevec can exert its inhibitory effect on tumor cells through inhibiting PDGF receptor function and we have shown that the primary non small cells lung cancer expressed minimal c Kit We would like to see if PDGF receptor expression in lung cancer patients is frequent finding and this could potentially provide a cellular mechanism by which Gleevec inhibits the lung cancer tumor growth We used the tumor tissue micro array technique using the high density lung tissue arrays from Clinomic Biosciences Inc MA Lung tissue micro array slides containing 33 primary lung cancer tumor specimens with the corresponding normal lung tissues were used for immunohistochemical staining using anti PDGFR and antibodies as described The clinical diagnoses of lung cancers were reviewed and confirmed Using clinical diagnostic criteria the immunostaining patterns and intensities were verified by two independent board certified surgical pathologists Since immunohistochemical staining is a semi quantitative method we scored the staining intensities arbitrarily as 1 2 and 3 Figure 9 There were 18 cases of squamous carcinomas of the lung within the tissue array slide and 16 of the 18 cases were positive for PDGFR 89 7 of the 16 cases were scored 1 39 5 cases 2 28 and 4 cases 3 positivity 22 Table 1 There were 11 of the 11 adenocarcinoma specimens that were positive for PDGFR 100 6 cases 1 55 3 cases 2 27 2 cases 3 18 respectively Small cell carcinomas were also positive expression of PDGFR 4 cases 2 100 Two cases of malignant mesotheliomas were negative for PDGFR The corresponding normal lung tissues were found to be negative for PDGFR Although there were some interstitial staining signals for PDGFR the tumor tissues were negative for PDGFR Figure 7 micro array data not shown These results demonstrated that PDGFR expression is elevated in the tumor tissues compared to normal lung parenchyma and the expression of PDGFR in tumor tissue may play important roles in tumor growth and progression Discussion Gleevec effects vs drug toxicity We have shown in this study that Gleevec alone can inhibit the growth of A549 cells at the concentration of 2 3 M IC50 This is within the known therapeutic ranges for patients with CML since the plasma levels of Gleevec inducing hematologic and cytogenetic response in patients with CML were reported to be in the range of 0 1 3 4 g ml 0 17 5 68 M after treatment with 25 600 mg day 4 In our system the level of Gleevec at the tested concentration was in the low micromolar ranges and the inhibitory effect of Gleevec on A549 cells is likely to be genuine through binding to the receptor not due to the toxic effects of the drug This inhibitory effect can also be seen with the human kidney 293 cells with slight higher IC50 At the concentration of 4 M or higher the inhibitory effect of Gleevec on both A549 and 293 cells were found to be identical Figure 2and 3 Higher concentration than 6 M in the cell culture condition is unlikely to be translated to clinical patients since the adverse effects of the drug will become intolerable for the patients Potential target of Gleevec in lung cancers Gleevec was designed to inhibit the BCR ABL tyrosine kinase and it cross reacts with c kit and PDGFR 5 In non small cell lung cancer BCR ABL expression has never been reported and it is unlikely that BCR ABL fusion protein plays any role in lung cancer There has been no report to link cellular ABL kinase mutation to any cancer patients except BCR ABL in CML although the detailed c Abl function has not been extensively studied in lung cancer patients CAbl is a tyrosine kinase that plays important roles in cell growth differentiation and apoptosis Although c Abl mutations have not been reported in human cancers c Abl related protein ARG or Abl 2 was shown to be regulated in non small cell lung cancers by hypermethylation Dr Steven Reynolds National Institute of Occupational and Safety Health Morgantown WV personal communication ARG shares significant homology with c Abl throughout the amino acid sequences Gleevec has been shown to inhibit ARG tyrosine kinase 10 Dr Jean Wang Biology University of California San Diego personal communication although the functional significance of ARG kinase in lung cancer is yet to be elucidated We have studied the expression of c kit CD117 in the non small cell lung cancer patients and we found that approximately 13 of the tumor specimens were weakly positive for c kit The level of expression is generally weak 1 These results lead us to find an alternative target for Gleevec because of the low expression level and low frequency of expression of c kit in the lung cancer patients PDGFR expression in lung cancer We have shown convincingly that lung cancer cell A549 expressed PDGFR both by immunostaining the cells and by Western blot analysis PDGF receptors are widely expressed in a variety of tissues and the levels of expression in normal tissues are minimal Over expression of PDGFR has been reported in a variety of human tumors including glioma and glioblastoma pancreatic and colonic cancers breast bone and ovarian tumors 11 In normal cells expression of PDGFR can be seen in the fibroblasts and the smooth muscle cells in the lung and airway 12 There is so far to our knowledge no report to link the expression of PDGFR to lung cancer Since it has been reported that Gleevec can inhibit the function of PDGFR under the cell culture conditions it is likely that Gleevec exerts its inhibitory effects on A549 lung cancer cells through inhibiting the PDGFR function Synergistic effect of Gleevec and cisplatin on A549 cells We have shown that Gleevec can exert its effect synergistically with cisplatin Cisplatin causes two types of DNA damage DNA adducts and inter stranded cross linking resulting in activation of apoptosis pathway in the target tumor cells 13 14 Our results suggest that inhibition of tyrosine kinase activity of the potential targets by Gleevec appear to potentiate the effect of cisplatin in DNA damage induced apoptosis in A549 cells Although the underlying mechanism of such synergism is unclear it is of great interest to combine the two drugs in clinical lung cancer patients to see if the synergy of the two drugs exists under the physiological conditions It has been widely thought but never been proven that the specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as Gleevec can be used as adjuvant therapy in combination with conventional chemotherapy because the limited clinical trial data suggests only a marginal benefits using this kind of drug to treat the cancer alone John Rogers WVU Cancer center ECOG trial member personal communication Current study results suggests that Gleevec can potentiate the cisplatin effect on A549 lung cancer cells and these findings provide important in vitro data for further testing the possibility of using Gleevec as adjuvant therapy for clinical lung cancer patients Methods Cell culture and drug testing Lung cancer cell line A549
