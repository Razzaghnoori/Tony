 okay well go ahead i ll let you start uh i was thinking about whether or not we should have people uh be required to do service public service for a year or two and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family uh huh or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to i mean you can t make it everybody right yeah but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can t buy somebody off and and maybe send them in their place or or get out of it some other way too um hum or it could be like the draft where you know before they draft you they take you you get a physical anyway so when they send you a draft notice and then they give you a physical and if there s nothing physically wrong with you then you re drafted it doesn t matter how rich you are and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members right that would be good what d you say give physicals to the rest of the family members and they all had to pass oh yeah uh i thought it a good idea too though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money uh uh huh and uh if they did this maybe help them out in their college cost and maybe they could pay people for doing this at least something so they could could subsist that s true um hum well that s true the America s paying all this money to have other people give uh aid to other countries so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time yeah because actually when you when you do uh service overseas you end up learning something usually that s that s really useful plumbing or farming or or something like that so you re really learning a skill yeah and you know all these old people they would get out of this right all the ones that are already retired so what could we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country i m just teasing what d you say um hum yeah i i think well that s probably the idea i don t know whether their idea is to be within the country or outside the country well i thought it d be a good idea if maybe you took the some of the kids and had them go over to other countries and children from their countries came over to ours too a trade off yeah that would be neat yeah sort of like an exchange program uh huh yeah and other than that i can t think of any other ideas yeah that d be sort of neat yeah well i like the idea of uh being uh a mandatory thing for welfare course that s what um that s sort of like what Truman had or or was it Roosevelt i can t remember um with the big oh with WPA yeah yeah uh huh getting people or the work the work program and all the all the make work jobs that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building and we re still using those things too what d you say we re still using those things yeah that s true a lot of them still out there like all these wonderful highways in West Virginia and no one knows why they built lodges before too like at Caddo Lake lake what Caddo Lake Caddo Lake it s between Texas and Louisiana no never heard of it it crosses into both of them well it s real pretty it s like a swamp you know with all the Spanish moss on the trees it s really it s eerie yeah oh oh okay real pretty like a swamp oh yeah yeah oh okay yeah i been uh i got uh talked to someone else before that was a uh a Texan but i guess that s uh that s what we re going to have this is uh a TI experiment to see how talk Texans talk to other people i don t know where are you from uh Virginia Virginia oh that s neat i talked to somebody from Ohio the other night oh yeah it is neat to get other people especially since you got other ideas about how people uh how people react to things and stuff especially when it comes to um social services uh i m i m i m glad they have a lot of uh um you know topics on social services because um hum like this thing this is a pretty good idea i didn t even know they were thinking about it i wonder if they thought about it themselves or whether someone somewhere is really uh thinking that uh it d be a good idea to have everybody spend some time in public service there is somebody and i read uh i can t remember who it is but there s a really famous of dang i can t remember his name yeah that proposed it i read something in People about it huh Mitch Snider i don t know who Mitch Snider is politician is pushing it or uh or Mitch Snider or Mitch Snider oh okay well see that s a DC thing Mitch Snider is the the advocate for the homeless that uh he he said said said it out here in Washington uh Washington but he started the um uh the movement for creative nonviolence yeah yeah he started that and that that was basically a you know donate time and money to uh help the homeless but uh so what have your other topics been excuse uh the other topic was like i said uh something about politicians i can t remember exactly what it was it was a real general statement i had one that i hated it was what meal would you cook for uh a special dinner i mean how far can you go with that one right and another one though that was good was uh gee whiz yeah what do you think about the social changes for the last ten twenty and thirty years and what do you think has caused some of the social problems that have been it s probably the best one uh huh that would be neat i d have to basically say my birth yeah and we had to talk about air pollution too what do you think s causing it and what should we do about it um hum well that would be sort of interesting because then you get people from other countries i mean other parts of the state you know of course Pittsburgh would say you know oh find the better cheaper ways of burning coal you know yeah uh huh right cleaner ways of burning coal and people in the south would say don t burn coal you know it s because we don t have much coal oh we have a lot of coal but uh it s uh it s a dirty fuel that s for sure in Virginia yeah well how d you get into this program excuse me how d you get into this program how did i get into it oh i m uh electrical enginee r uh here in Virginia for TI no no uh no they i m in telecommunications company and they uh sent it out in our bulk mail so that if any engineers want to participate you know so does your company have something to do with TI uh not really i mean no more than any other company you know we buy their parts just as much as anybody else but uh no no real association with TI other than being in the same industry hum um hum electronics industry they just uh they just sent out a letter to everybody they does do business with saying that you know if you re interested we re doing a study and and since and do you know how much how long this is supposed to go on i don t know no i don t that s i don t either i mean it says just keep on until and they ll notify you at first i was thinking it was just a week because that s all it shows you know on the schedule but then it seems like it might be longer than a week um hum right so what do you think we re going to get what what do you think what what do you think we re going to get for this get yeah money prizes oh i don t know do you know anybody that s ever done this get your own yeah get your own T I seven four L S thirty two or something what was it i know TI gets prizes a little chip oh yeah i didn t hear about that probably for TI employees yeah and i was led to believe that if you weren t TI that you get money i m not TI oh oh you re not you don t work for Texas Instruments oh okay huh uh let s see one of my friends had a roommate that worked for TI and she saw this on her computer and thought it might be neat so she ran off copies of the thing oh oh and i just signed up for it oh that s a neat idea uh huh yeah yeah well he s gotten a good mix i i was saying because i ve like i said i heard some other people talking they ve talked to different people in different states and stuff uh huh that s good especially since you call that one eight hundred number so so probably knock TI s profits margin way down and it shouldn t be too good right now anyway because they ve been laying off so many people yeah right this is probably some government study program yeah really so we re footing the bill on our taxes okay okay well i enjoyed talking with you okay well thanks a bunch we ll talk to you later bye i got to save my two year old from a pile of grapes she s diving into well i m going to try to please clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around okay bye okay we ll i ll talk to you bye bye
