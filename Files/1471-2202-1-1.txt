 Background The G protein coupled receptors constitute a large family of receptors widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system CNS Classical neurotransmitter receptors such as muscarinic acetylcholine receptors mAChR adrenergic dopaminergic serotoninergic as well as neuropeptide receptors belong to this family 1 In vitro studies in transfected cells show that following receptor activation by an agonist that induces signal transduction G protein coupled receptor undergoes phosphorylation endocytosis and dissociation from their ligand in the endosome and finally the receptors are recycled to the plasma membrane 2 3 4 The delta opioid receptor is a member of the seven transmembrane superfamily of G protein coupled receptors 5 6 In vitro studies carried out on NG108 15 neurohybrid cells which express large numbers of opioid receptors show that these receptors undergo a rapid agonist induced desensitization that occurs within minutes and down regulation that occurs more slowly over several hours 4 7 The internalization of receptor agonist ligand complex has been detected with similar kinetics to those of down regulation 8 9 These findings raise two related questions 1 can opioid receptors be internalized in vivo by the same agonist induced endocytosis observed in vitro and if this is the case 2 does the internalization process have the same kinetics reported from in vitro studies We examined the effect of dermenkephalin a specific opioid agonist in order to mimic the effect of a strong and constant activation by an agonist on the distribution of the opioid receptors in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord We used a monoclonal anti idiotypic antibody anti Id mAb raised against the opioid receptors 10 and detected by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry In the present work we demonstrate that opioid receptor undergo rapid agonist induced endocytosis in the CNS Results Light microscopy revealed that the regional distribution of anti Id mAb immunoreactivity in control rats receiving saline solution was comparable to previous studies using unoperated rats 10 11 12 13 A high concentration of immunoreactivity was localized in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn Fig 1a In addition labelling was found around the central canal layer X Fig 1b and in the ventral horn Ultrastructural study of lamina I and II showed that immunoreactivity was mainly localized at appositions between two neurites axo dendritic Fig 2a and axo axonic appositions Fig 2b were noted Some neurites displayed multiple labelling sites at appositions with dendrite and or axon as shown in Fig 3 We never observed staining directly at the level of a synaptic differentiation However synaptic differentiations were occasionally near or in continuity with sites of axo dendritic labelling Fig 2a Occasionally the labelling was at the interface between a neurite and a glial process in laminae I and II of the spinal cord In all cases it was not possible to associate the membrane labelling with one or the other profile due to the localization of the labelling strictly in the extracellular space A few intracellular labellings were also found mainly associated with rough endoplasmic reticulum RER and Golgi apparatus in the soma of labelled cells not shown see 12 For rats receiving the cocktail of peptidase inhibitors at the ultrastructural level we observed a pattern of labelling comparable to that described in rats receiving a saline solution not shown No visible redistribution of anti id mAb immunoreactivity was observed in response to kelatorphan and thiorphan Fifteen minutes after dermenkephalin administration the ultrastructural analysis showed a pattern of labelling quite different from that observed in the control rats in lamina I At the level of labelling the plasma membrane was noticeably invaginated Fig 4a and b Most of the labelling was associated with axon terminals Fig 4a Dendritic labelling was also found Fig 4b but was less abundant The rest of the labelling was associated with unidentifiable profiles In lamina II labelling was associated with both invaginated and flat plasma membrane In sections from the four animals studied after 30 minutes of stimulation immunoreactivity was observed intracellularly In lamina I large vesicles 120 nm 150 nm were labelled in the cytoplasm close to the plasma membrane Fig 4c Labelled microtubules were also found Fig 4d No extracellular labelling associated with the plasma membrane was found in this lamina In lamina II cytoplasmic labellings mainly labelled vesicles as well as membrane labellings not restricted to the invaginated area were found Discussion In this study we provide morphological evidence that opioid receptors are endocytosed in response to dermenkephalin in vivo The choice of dermenkephalin as agonist in this study was determined by the intrinsic quality of this ligand Isolated from the skin of the frog Phyllomedusa sauvagei 14 this natural peptide shows the highest affinity for the opioid receptor 0 47 nM and a selectivity of 4 000 fold greater for the than the opioid receptors even when compared to the other very potent deltorphin I isolated from the frog Phyllomedusa bicolor 15 which has an affinity of 0 60 nM and a selectivity of 3 570 fold greater Both peptides along with the dermorphin and the deltorphin II also isolated from amphibian skin possess an unique feature among peptides synthesized by animal cells in having a D amino acid residue providing a very strong resistance to enzymatic degradation to these ligands Considering our experimental conditions particularly using a single in vivo injection the dermenkephalin seemed the most suitable agonist ligand to specifically stimulate the opioid receptor and provoke a possible internalization of the receptor due to its affinity as well as to its strong resistance to degradation The selectivity of the rat monoclonal anti idiotypic antibody used as primary antibody to recognize the opioid receptor anti Id mAb in the present report has been thoroughly investigated in previous studies 10 12 13 First the anti Id mAb raised against an anti DADLE 10 11 totally inhibited the agonist ligand anti ligand interaction showing a good anti idiotypic activity Second it was able to label the opioid receptor expressed by the NG 108 15 cell line and inhibited 3H DADLE binding to this same cell line The anti Id mAb was also able to precipitate a 52 500 Da molecule in the NG 108 15 cells Third in rat spinal cord 12 we found that preincubation of fixed tissue with specific opioid ligands DADLE Met enkephalin dermenkephalin and naltrindole at 10 9M totally prevented the antibody labeling showing a good competition between ligands and the anti Id mAb Fourth we also found previously in rat spinal cord that anti Id mAb has an hundred fold greater affinity for opioid receptors than opioid receptors 12 Taken together these data show that anti Id mAb is a reliable tool to specifically detect the opioid receptor using immunocytochemical techniques In the present study we found in our control group the same pattern of labelling seen by earlier studies in unoperated rats 10 11 12 suggesting that saline injection at the level of the spinal cord does not provoke a visible redistribution of the opioid sites at the plasma membrane No labelling associated with an invaginated plasma membrane was found in our experimental control rats In rats receiving the cocktail of peptidase inhibitor i e without dermenkephalin no modification of the opioid receptor distribution was noted compared with our control rats receiving only NaCl A previous study showed that kelatorphan in addition to blocking the degradation of the exogenous peptide by suppressing the aminopeptidase activity markedly increased the spontaneous release of endogenous Met enkephalin in vivo and in vitro 16 Thiorphan is a potent enkephalinase inhibitor 17 Nevertheless it seems that under our experimental conditions even if more enkephalin was released by the kelatorphan and this enkephalin was selectively protected from degradation by thiorphan no receptor endocytosis was observed in response to endogenous enkephalin However no nociceptive stimulation was applied in our protocol and we therefore can not exclude the possibility that insufficient enkephalin was released to provoke the internalization of the opioid receptor Another hypothesis poses the question of whether the internalization process is agonist selective In a study carried out in vivo on guinea pig ileum 18 the authors showed a rapid endocytosis of the opioid receptor in neurons in response to etorphine stimulation but not after morphine administration This shows that using a high affinity agonist such as morphine it is not possible to trigger the endocytosis process The authors suggest that morphine has low intrinsic activity at opioid receptor compared for instance to the lower affinity agonist D Ala 2 N MePhe 4 Gly 5 ol enkephaline DAMGO which is able to trigger an internalization process This differential agonist selective response for the same receptor could participate in mechanisms regulating cellular adaptation to ligands We do not know if endogenous enkephalins are able to induce the endocytosis of opioid receptors in vivo A recent study carried out on organotypic cultures and neuromuscular preparations demonstrated a possible internalization process of opioid receptor by endogenously released enkephalins after electrical stimulation 19 Our data presented here show clearly that without any kind of stimulation the endogenously released enkephalins even protected by enkephalinase inhibitors were not able to induced an internalization of the opioid receptors in the rat spinal cord Nevertheless a more specific study should be conducted in order to answer this question By contrast application of dermenkephalin induced an internalization of the opioid receptor within 30 minutes Dermenkephalin is markedly increased in potency in the presence of peptidase inhibition more than one hundred fold with a cocktail of bacitracin bestatin and captopril as in Kramer s study 20 and to a greater extent with kelatorphan and thiorphan as used in the present study This suggests that the effect observed after dermenkephalin application associated with the peptidase inhibition is probably stronger than the potency of dermenkephalin alone It seems that the opioid receptor was internalized to a greater extent in the lamina I than in the deeper layers This could be due to a gradient of diffusion in the tissues of dermenkephalin Our results show a majority of labelling associated with axons confirming the reports that opioid receptors mainly have a presynaptic localization in the dorsal horn of the rat spinal cord 12 21 22 23 On the other hand association of labelling with a dendrite is consistent with the existence of a postsynaptic receptor population in lamina I and II This is in agreement with data obtained after unilateral dorsal rhizotomy which showed residual and presumably postsynaptic sites 21 We cannot exclude the possibility that labelled vesicles found in the cytoplasm after 30 minutes of stimulation may correspond to receptors in the process of expression to the plasma membrane Studies using direct antibodies raised against the opioid sites has shown immunoreactivity mostly associated with large dense core vesicles in the normal rat dorsal horn 22 23 Intracellular labelling was also found in our control rats but the association of labelling was mainly with RER and Golgi apparatus in soma probably corresponding to receptors in the process of synthesis or recycling This observation confirms findings described in our recent study where somatic labelling was detected 13 Also a few labelled vesicles have been outlined in our previous study 12 but the frequency of this association was slight and not comparable with those described in the present study after stimulation by dermenkephalin The differences found in the distribution of the labelling membrane labelling versus intracellular labelling between our study and the direct antibody study 23 may be due to the intrinsic characteristic between an anti idiotypic antibody raised against the binding site of the receptor and a direct antibody recognizing a fragment of the receptor Taken together the data suggest that immunoreactive vesicles found in our study are the result of an internalization of the opioid receptors in response to the stimulation by dermenkephalin Our results indicate that opioid receptors undergo rapid agonist regulated endocytosis which is similar to that exhibited by a variety of peptide hormones and growth factors 24 25 as well as certain G protein coupled receptors like adrenergic receptors 4 neurotensin receptors 26 or substance P receptors 27 In adrenergic receptors which have been characterized in detail rapid endocytosis appears to be required for resensitization of receptors following agonist induced phosphorylation 28 For opioid receptors the fate of the internalized receptors is still uncertain In vivo studies have shown that 3H lofentanyl a mu agonist is internalized in axon terminals of rat vagus nerve and transported retrogradely in the nodose ganglion 29 A more recent study carried out in rat spinal cord slices found a possible internalization of opioid receptor after stimulation by DAMGO 30 In vitro studies carried out on NG108 15 a neurohybrid cell expressing opioid receptors showed internalization after the application of opioid agonists in bath medium like DADLE or etorphin 9 31 The internalized receptors are then compartmentalized in particular into lysosomes and Golgi apparatus 32 More recently in vitro studies carried out on opioid receptors showed that following a rapid internalization in response to an agonist stimulation the endocytosed receptors were recycled back to the plasma membrane 33 It seems that the internalization recycling process is a necessary step in the resensitization of the receptor In vivo due to the current experimental conditions the fate of internalized receptors remains to be examined Our findings demonstrate that dermenkephalin after in vivo administration can induce an internalization of the opioid receptor at the level of the spinal cord The effect of the reduction of receptor number at the plasma membrane might be a rapid decrease of the physiological response to the stimulus These results bring an important confirmation that data obtained in an in vitro system for G protein coupled receptor internalization 3 are relevant to the CNS in vivo The consequences on receptor expression recycling and or degradation remain to be established Materials and methods Experiments were performed on twelve male 200 300 gm Wistar rats housed in controlled environmental conditions 22 1 C 12 h alternate light dark cycles food and water ad libitum for at least one week before being used for the experiments Three groups of four animals were used two groups received dermenkephalin and one control group received 0 9 NaCl Two additional rats received a cocktail of peptidase inhibitors i e without dermenkephalin in NaCl for 15 and 30 minutes to check if the endogenous enkephalins protected by kelatorphan and thiorphan could by themselves induce receptor internalization Under deep urethane anesthesia 1 5 g kg 1body weight the cisterna magna was opened A catheter was inserted intrathecally in the subarachnoid space to the level of the fourth or fifth cervical segment The two experimental groups received intrathecally 10 l of a mixture containing 10 M

rats received 10 l 0 9 NaCl A few minutes after injection the catheter was gently removed Fifteen or 30 minutes after the intrathecal injection the rats were perfused with 100 ml of 0 9 NaCl containing 0 1 sodium nitrite as washing solution followed by about 800 ml of fixative containing 4 paraformaldehyde in S rensen buffer 0 1 M pH 7 4 The procedure for the ultrastructural localization of opioid receptors was carried out as previously described 12 Briefly transverse sections of cervical and thoracic cord 50 m were cut with a vibratome A rat monoclonal anti idiotypic antibody anti Id mAb 8 mg ml generated against an anti D Ala 2 D Leu 5 Enkephalin DADLE antibody and displaying affinity for opioid receptors 10 12 was used as the primary antibody The sections were incubated with the
