 The Gold Bug Variations The legend of King Midas has been generally misunderstood Most people think the curse that turned everything the old miser touched into gold leaving him unable to eat or drink was a lesson in the perils of avarice But Midas true sin was his failure to understand monetary economics What the gods were really telling him is that gold is just a metal If it sometimes seems to be more that is only because society has found it convenient to use gold as a medium of exchange a bridge between other truly desirable objects There are other possible mediums of exchange and it is silly to imagine that this pretty but only moderately useful substance has some irreplaceable significance But there are many people nearly all of them ardent conservatives who reject that lesson While Jack Kemp Steve Forbes and Wall Street Journal editor Robert Bartley are best known for their promotion of supply side economics they are equally dedicated to the belief that the key to prosperity is a return to the gold standard which John Maynard Keynes pronounced a barbarous relic more than 60 years ago With any luck these latter day Midases will never lay a finger on actual monetary policy Nonetheless these are influential people they are one of the factions now struggling for the Republican Party s soul and the passionate arguments they make for a gold standard are a useful window on how they think There is a case to be made for a return to the gold standard It is not a very good case and most sensible economists reject it but the idea is not completely crazy On the other hand the ideas of our modern gold bugs are completely crazy Their belief in gold is it turns out not pragmatic but mystical The current world monetary system assigns no special role to gold indeed the Federal Reserve is not obliged to tie the dollar to anything It can print as much or as little money as it deems appropriate There are powerful advantages to such an unconstrained system Above all the Fed is free to respond to actual or threatened recessions by pumping in money To take only one example that flexibility is the reason the stock market crash of 1987 which started out every bit as frightening as that of 1929 did not cause a slump in the real economy While a freely floating national money has advantages however it also has risks For one thing it can create uncertainties for international traders and investors Over the past five years the dollar has been worth as much as 120 yen and as little as 80 The costs of this volatility are hard to measure partly because sophisticated financial markets allow businesses to hedge much of that risk but they must be significant Furthermore a system that leaves monetary managers free to do good also leaves them free to be irresponsible and in some countries they have been quick to take the opportunity That is why countries with a history of runaway inflation like Argentina often come to the conclusion that monetary independence is a poisoned chalice Argentine law now requires that one peso be worth exactly one U S dollar and that every peso in circulation be backed by a dollar in reserves So there is no obvious answer to the question of whether or not to tie a nation s currency to some external standard By establishing a fixed rate of exchange between currencies or even adopting a common currency nations can eliminate the uncertainties of fluctuating exchange rates and a country with a history of irresponsible policies may be able to gain credibility by association The Italian government wants to join a European Monetary Union largely because it hopes to refinance its massive debts at German interest rates On the other hand what happens if two nations have joined their currencies and one finds itself experiencing an inflationary boom while the other is in a deflationary recession This is exactly what happened to Europe in the early 1990s when western Germany boomed while the rest of Europe slid into double digit unemployment Then the monetary policy that is appropriate for one is exactly wrong for the other These ambiguities explain why economists are divided over the wisdom of Europe s attempt to create a common currency I personally think that it will lead on average to somewhat higher European unemployment rates but many sensible economists disagree So where does gold enter the picture While some modern nations have chosen with reasonable justification to renounce their monetary autonomy in favor of some external standard the standard they choose these days is always the currency of another presumably more responsible nation Argentina seeks salvation from the dollar Italy from the deutsche mark But the men and women who run the Fed and even those who run the German Bundesbank are mere mortals who may yet succumb to the temptations of the printing press Why not ensure monetary virtue by trusting not in the wisdom of men but in an objective standard Why not emulate our great grandfathers and tie our currencies to gold Very few economists think this would be a good idea The argument against it is one of pragmatism not principle First a gold standard would have all the disadvantages of any system of rigidly fixed exchange rates and even economists who are enthusiastic about a common European currency generally think that fixing the European currency to the dollar or yen would be going too far Second and crucially gold is not a stable standard when measured in terms of other goods and services On the contrary it is a commodity whose price is constantly buffeted by shifts in supply and demand that have nothing to do with the needs of the world economy by changes for example in dentistry The United States abandoned its policy of stabilizing gold prices back in 1971 Since then the price of gold has increased roughly tenfold while consumer prices have increased about 250 percent If we had tried to keep the price of gold from rising this would have required a massive decline in the prices of practically everything else deflation on a scale not seen since the Depression This doesn t sound like a particularly good idea So why are Jack Kemp the Wall Street Journal and so on so fixated on gold I did not fully understand their position until I read a recent letter to of all places the left wing magazine Mother Jones from Jude Wanniski one of the founders of supply side economics and its reigning guru One of the many comic opera touches in the late unlamented Dole campaign was the constant struggle between Jack Kemp who tried incessantly to give Wanniski a key role and the sensible economists who tried to keep him out Wanniski s main concern was to deny that the rich have gotten richer in recent decades his letter is posted on the Mother Jones Web site and makes interesting reading But particularly noteworthy was the following passage First let us get our accounting unit squared away To measure anything in the floating paper dollar will get us nowhere We must convert all wealth into the measure employed by mankind for 6 000 years i e ounces of gold On this measure the Dow Jones industrial average of 6 000 today is only 60 percent of the DJIA of 30 years ago when it hit 1 000 Back then gold was 35 per ounce Today it is 380 plus This is another way of saying that in the last 30 years the people who owned America have lost 40 percent of their wealth held in the form of equity If you owned no part of corporate America 30 years ago because you were poor you lost nothing If you owned lots of it you lost your shirt in the general inflation Never mind the question of whether the Dow Jones industrial average is the proper measure of how well the rich are doing What is fascinating about this passage is that Wanniski regards gold as the appropriate measure of wealth regardless of the quantity of other goods and services that it can buy Since the dollar was de linked from gold in 1971 the Dow has risen about 700 percent while the prices of the goods we ordinarily associate with the pursuit of happiness food houses clothes cars servants have gone up only about 250 percent In terms of the ability to buy almost anything except gold the purchasing power of the rich has soared but Wanniski insists that this is irrelevant because gold and only gold is the true standard of value Wanniski in other words has committed the sin of King Midas He has forgotten that gold is only a metal and that its value comes only from the truly useful goods for which it can be exchanged I wonder whether the gods read Slate If so they know what to do
