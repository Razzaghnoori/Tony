single presidential candidate The paper notes the forthcoming publication of a book by two former Moral Majority officials arguing that government cannot correct what is wrong with America The Times concludes that the troubles of the religious right will increase the willingness of Republican candidates to distance themselves from the coalition Oddly this analysis does not factor in the effect of the failed impeachment move on the mood of Christian conservatives The LA Times leads with Dole s announcement that Albanian Kosovars are prepared to sign the interim peace accord that emerged from the recent talks in Rambouillet Yugoslav President Milosevic would not grant Dole a visa forcing the former Senator to exercise his influence from neighboring Macedonia The paper notes the scheduled arm twisting visits of European and U S officials from Balkan contact group nations leading up to the resumption of talks on March 15 The Post looks on the bright side of things noting Dole s assertion that Kosovar acquiescence might pressure Milosevic to accede The NYT emphasizes that Dole failed to clinch a deal and that agreement remains uncertain The Times does not spare the most

strategic partnership with China The WP picks up on the story pointedly noting that the espionage was previously reported by the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post The WP goes on to cite actions the administration has taken to toughen security and White House denials that Clinton sought to minimize the Chinese espionage The paper avers that a former top Los Alamos official told The
