 Slate Sincerely Flattered Time magazine we notice seems to have started a new feature called Dear Dr Notebook which poses and answers questions that arise from the current news We can t help sensing a family resemblance to Slate s months old Explainer column which well poses and answers questions that arise from the current news There are differences of course Time as a serious newsmagazine deals with issues such as Why are there Clinton masks for Halloween but no Monica masks Or How do you clean a mirror studded leather dress like the one Prada showed in Milan Slate by contrast as a frivolous attitude besotted Webzine asks and answers How does the Kosovo situation compare with the one in Bosnia Or What s the difference among all these journalists named Broder Turning the page in Time we came across another newish feature called News Quiz not to be confused with a Slate feature of the same name started several months earlier There is nothing proprietary about the name News Quiz of course and we would not insult the author of Slate s News Quiz by suggesting that there is any similarity between Time s News Quiz and the one Randy Cohen produces for us But it is remarkable that Time should have gone almost 75 years without a news quiz only to start one shortly after Slate did Brooding about all this we flung away Time with irritation and picked up Newsweek The No 2 newsmagazine we noticed also has a new front of the book feature euphoniously titled The Buzz O Meter The gimmick seems to be that you take an issue in the news and list the various buzzes on it buzz No 2 perhaps contradicting buzz No 1 in some ironic or amusing way buzz Nos 3 and 4 peeling additional layers off the onion of perception and so on Could this we wondered possibly be an hommage to the strangely similar technique invented by William Saletan for Slate s The Week The Spin Was there a lavish banquet ceremony of thanksgiving and celebration of Will s achievements to which we misplaced our invitation We consulted Microsoft s new president Steve Ballmer on what if anything we should do about all this He replied with simple eloquence Have them killed But he quickly added Unless of course that would in any way violate the antitrust laws My Name Is Michael and I m a Scapoholic Speaking of the antitrust laws readers who have been enjoying Michael Lewis Dispatches from the courtroom where government lawyers are attempting the most brazen legal challenge to human progress since the Scopes Trial should be aware of the following Mr Lewis views do not necessarily reflect those of Slate magazine its editors or its advertisers Especially its editors In fact we were sitting around the other day trying to recall whose stupid idea it was to hire Michael Lewis a known Netscape user sometimes four five six or more times a day the man clearly belongs in Netscape Anonymous to cover an event as complex and vital to civilization s future as the Microsoft trial Oddly enough no Slate editor could recall making this tawdry assignment Nor does anyone recall telling Mr Lewis that he was free to express his views whatever they may be no matter how fatuous or uninformed by the slightest understanding of the free enterprise system and without considering for a moment that Slate is owned by Microsoft and that some of its staff members have young children and very little talent that would make us employable at a less saintlike public spirited and compassionate company No one admits to having said to him Let the microchips fall where they may In fact no one can recall ever exchanging a word with Mr Lewis before his absurd reports began appearing on our site He must have just hacked his way in E Mail Bonding Slate s two new every weekday e mail deliveries are up and running and available as another free service to Slate subscribers Slate Afternoon Delivery includes some of the day s updates of Slate news and business departments such as Moneybox and Frame Game along with Slate s daily unlike some rival news quizzes we could name News Quiz Slate Evening Delivery is a selection from Slate s cultural reviews and reportage Each item in both of these new deliveries is personally selected for you by Slate Deputy Editor Jack Shafer plucked at its very peak of ripeness and e mailed to you so fresh it gleams No waiting around for stale shopworn news and reviews to be delivered once a week and days late by certain newsmagazines we don t care to mention Click here to sign up for any or all of Slate s e mail services including Slate Morning Delivery with Today s Papers our weekly print out edition Slate on Paper or our weekly listing and description of what s new in Slate Or if you haven t yet done so click here to subscribe to Slate Michael Kinsley
