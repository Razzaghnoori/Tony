 London Calling On Broadway where distinguished American writers complain that it s nearly impossible to get their plays produced the British dramatist David Hare has opened no fewer than four in the past 12 months Last spring Hare s play about Oscar Wilde The Judas Kiss came from London It was followed this winter by his adaptation The Blue Room which made the cover of Newsweek on the backside as it were of Nicole Kidman At the moment Hare occupies two stages in New York Amy s View starring Judi Dench is playing to full houses at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre while Hare himself is performing a monologue about Israel Via Dolorosa at the Booth Theatre It shouldn t come as any surprise that American audiences have a taste for British drama Stage envy is a well trod Anglophilic path which has in the last few years widened into a mostly one way superhighway stretching from London s West End to the New York Theater District Current productions that have breezed down it include The Weir by the young Irish playwright Conor McPherson and Closer by Patrick Marber Lately we Americans even seem more interested in our own playwrights when we see them reflected back at us by the Brits Revivals of Tennessee Williams early work Not About Nightingales and Eugene O Neill s The Iceman Cometh starring Kevin Spacey are both English imports In a recent discussion in the Sunday Arts Leisure section three New York Times drama critics discussed this phenomenon Basically they all concluded that British is better But Hare who now dominates Broadway in a way Tom Stoppard never has may illustrate a somewhat different phenomenon There is of course an element of Anglomania in his success here But I think it may also speak to something more interesting Hare feeds an appetite for a theater engaged with society which our domestic dramatic economy isn t satisfying at the moment He is in almost every way an old fashioned playwright who uses dramatic form to amplify questions of politics religion society and relations between the sexes And while I think that even Hare s best work falls short of greatness the combination of his seriousness and his success bode well for theater as a form on both sides of the Atlantic Hare s early work has the reputation for being left wing agitprop In fact while less skillful than his later efforts his early plays are not mere polemics Hare s first produced play Slag 1970 is a kind of dystopian fantasy about radical feminism in which the attempt to run a girls school dissolves into absurd infighting It is true that the author s Labor Party socialism originally took the not very novel form of negative portrayals of establishment institutions and the residue of British imperialism But what soon began to distinguish him from a lot of his like minded contemporaries were a low key wit and an ability to write memorable roles for women Hare s first play to open at the National Theatre in London in 1978 and currently being revived there was Plenty later made into a film with Meryl Streep Streep plays the role of Susan Traherne a woman who works undercover in France during World War II and subsequently finds herself unable to cope with postwar British life Despite her craziness we see that she has a point His radicalism mellowed with time and success Where once he proposed a debate between between socialism and capitalism between the Third World and the First as in Map of the World 1983 Hare s later plays posit a subtler conflict over personal and political values The first time he really demonstrated this maturity was in The Secret Rapture 1988 a work Hare himself has pointed to as an important departure It s about two sisters who have to deal with the messy legacy of their departed father One is generous and impractical The other is ruthless and self interested in a Thatcherite vein but nonetheless sympathetic in the end Frank Rich then the lead drama critic for the New York Times who liked the play when it debuted in London wrote a harsh review of the New York production and especially of the performance by the author s then girlfriend Blair Brown An embittered Hare pledged not to bring another play to New York until Rich stopped reviewing In following years Hare became more interested in the soul of Britain under Thatcherism In the early 1990s he wrote a trilogy of State of the Nation plays Racing Demon about the Church of England Murmuring Judges about the legal system and The Absence of War about the Labor Party All opened to acclaim at the National Theatre and provoked national debate in Britain Racing Demon a play about Anglican priests even came to New York once Rich moved on Why you have to ask is it so seldom that important seeming American plays address societal issues such as these You might start with the fact that the United States unlike Britain has no centralized national theater either literally or figuratively What occurs on the New York stage doesn t resonate around the country or even down the Amtrak corridor to Washington And you might add that the political interests of American playwrights tend to revolve more around issues of identity and less around national institutions We also have a different kind of theatrical tradition which is less talky and intellectualized than the British one The playwright whom Hare harks back to most directly is George Bernard Shaw Though his wit is not of Shavian sharpness his plays are in another sense more sophisticated Where Shaw s characters tend to represent views pitted against each other Hare s cannot resist becoming genuine characters contradictory quirky and imperfect both as heroes and villains The play where one sees this most clearly is Skylight 1995 for my money his most successful work It s the classic Hare setup a collision between two people who see life differently but are nonetheless connected a successful Thatcher era businessman and his former mistress a schoolteacher in London s East End You know where Hare comes down in the debate between their values But the play does not exist for one character s worldview to vanquish the other s Both are by turns persuasive flawed and poignant The recent offerings on Broadway show not only Hare s gift for the exposition of issues but also his limitations The Blue Room which I saw in its London production last fall was probably the weakest of the bunch Arthur Schnitzler s original play La Ronde was a scandalous for its time depiction of empty sexual promiscuity so scandalous it wasn t meant to be performed But with the shock value lost the play needed something more than Hare s topical amendments added His adaptation didn t provide much food for thought which is unusual for him A bit of hackwork it suggested that he might be spreading himself too thin V ia Dolorosa which I also saw in London is more stimulating intellectually but only a bit Based on a visit to Israel it s journalism by other means of the sort that Anna Deveare Smith has done so brilliantly But Hare is no Smith His performance adds little to his script and his script adds little to the subject arriving mostly at familiar platitudes about Israel Nonetheless one has to admire his guts for trying to entertain an audience single handedly with a talk about Middle East politics no less And the work is somewhat interesting despite its inherent limitations We see how Hare can turn even a monologue into a kind of dialogue of perspectives as he pits the passionate commitment of West Bank settlers against the humanism of the Israeli culturati Are we where we live or what we think he asks at the end of the play What matters Stones or Ideas Amy s View the best of the recent works to show up here is a more familiar and successful exercise It is a play with clear imperfections such as an excessively shrill third act But one forgives such flaws because of the way Hare draws his audience into the play s issues Here the debate he sets up is a three way among mother daughter and the daughter s boyfriend Esme played by Judi Dench is an actress who lives for the theater Her daughter one of Hare s ethereal women a little too good for this world lives for love The daughter s boyfriend Dominic is a cynic who lives only for himself Within this conflict of values is a clash about art Dominic a director of exploitative films and television contends that the theater is a dead form Esme stands in for the continued vitality of the stage The final act finds her having lost everything her home her financial independence and her daughter but performing brilliantly in a new play that she describes as sincere We see her failings redeemed through commitment to her craft The same might justly be said of the man who wrote the play
