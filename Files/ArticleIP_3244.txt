 Dark and Stormy Nights Fifteen minutes into The Gingerbread Man the Robert Altman thriller based on a story by John Grisham I found myself scribbling in my notebook Robert Altman is God Here amid the seemingly aimless hubbub the muddy narrative the loose framing and the faraway characters a sense of place Savannah had begun to emerge and also a free floating anxiety No one knows what s under the surface of these people no one knows anything The scary side of the city featured in Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil has never been captured with such brusque poetry and Altman seems to pull the portrait out of his hat At the precise moment that I was declaring really revisiting my reverence for the great director the elderly couple sitting next to me was grumbling I can t understand a word they re saying Can you understand a word they re saying I don t know what s going on Stupid movie What s going on Do you want to go I stifled an urge to whisper If you leave now you can catch the Matlock rerun which would have been snotty but not completely off the point Matlock is what they expected and what they got was Altman s Matlock the same sort of sub noir story line but with the camera moved back a clinical distance and the soundtrack rendered clangorous disharmonic The Gingerbread Man is to Matlock what The Rite of Spring is to the Rockettes It s also to be honest only a fair to middling mystery I guessed the ending not just the major revelations but who would live and who would die in the first half hour and I m no Matlock But the movie is still a delight a fascinatingly strange and chaotic ballet set to familiar noir motifs Altman had me hooked from the credits in which the camera cruises high above an eerie topography both parched and veined with swamps while the composer Mark Isham serves up off the beat thumps and hollow brass gongs and fragments of cell phone conversations remain just on the far side of audibility Altman makes you work to pick up dialogue to follow the threads to figure out always after the fact just what people s motivations were His framing is the least insistent of any major director which is especially radical in a genre where audiences are accustomed to having their gaze directed The actors seem caught on the fly they give performances that don t seem like performances and are the richer for it Kenneth Branagh has never been finer and that s saying something As Rick Magruder a Savannah defense attorney famed for keeping scum bags out of prison he s a strutting cock a chain smoking hothead who thinks with his pecker The character stays remote and self involved and a bit of a fool and because Branagh never asks for sympathy I found myself giving him plenty much as I ve given my sympathy to another Southern peckerhead with spotty morals who s been in the news of late Anyway it s hard to tsk tsk the man when his chief motivation is bedding Embeth Davidtz as Mallory Doss a dark eyed neurasthenic enigma with the South s most willowy gams Seemingly terrorized by her hooting mad derelict father Robert Duvall in a hilarious cameo Doss doffs her duds at the first opportunity and promptly has the hapless attorney on a very tight retainer The brilliant cinematographer Changwei Gu shoots her nude through a doorway of hanging beads and in close up through a fogged rain drizzled windshield he keeps her simultaneously naked and veiled and the effect is both alluring and unnerving Actors are reborn in Altman movies That s Daryl Hannah as Branagh s associate sporting dark hair thick glasses and a sensibly reticent demeanor In one stroke this underrated actress takes herself out of the blond airhead class As a dissolute party hearty private investigator Robert Downey Jr seizes his drug addled image and dances with it He s wonderful and he s worrisome A lot of big deal movie stars could walk into an open manhole and our lives would not be appreciably poorer But whatever must be done to keep this man alive and working regularly scheduled rehabs full time minders a religious conversion should be done and done now Altman exploits Downey s image like the cold SOB he probably is There s something arrogant about this director s refusal to pander but it s a splendid arrogance An Altman film is like a box of chocolates You never know what you re gonna get nougat or arsenic So you stay braced alert Unlike most contemporary cinema you don t leave an Altman movie feeling dumber than when you went in Where Altman keeps you at a distance the Mexican born director Alfonso Cuar n A Little Princess pulls you deep inside his characters heads Already Cuar n is one of the most accomplished subjective filmmakers alive Through his camera the external world becomes transfigured by emotion so that everything even what might not be literally true seems real What better director to film a Dickens novel Cuar n s Great Expectations which has been updated to Gulf Coast Florida and the New York art world of the 80s and given a rock n roll backbeat is fluid and lyrical and thoroughly transporting I ve read the Dickens original over and over and seen all the previous adaptations yet I didn t for an instant yearn for 19 th century London at least not until the movie had ended when I was scratching my head over why it finally seemed so un Dickensianly miniature The good stuff first The hero is no longer Pip but Finn who is frolicking in the waves among the gulls when a shackled and bloodied escaped killer Robert De Niro erupts from the water and forces him to bring food and drink and a tool for cutting chains When Finn returns the scene has an eye popping storybook terror with its cocked frames its sharp reeds standing out from the deep black night sky and with De Niro giving the young boy that patented sour stomach bogeyman grimace After the convict overture we learn that Finn who has a gift for drawing and painting lives with his sister Maggie Kim Dickens and brother in law Joe Chris Cooper in a ramshackle house by the gulf Joe catches fish and Maggie gets laid by other guys and splits What happens then is an enchanting blend of old and new as Finn is summoned to the manse of Nora Dinsmoor Anne Bancroft a filthy rich ex socialite driven mad by her abandonment decades earlier by a wayward fiance But it s Dinsmoor s niece Estella who becomes the focus of Finn s fantasy life and art The little blonde is pretty but no enchantress she s too glum and snooty Growing up to be Gwyneth Paltrow makes her more bewitching but no less blank Paltrow as ever is inhumanly gorgeous like some Close Encounters of the Third Kind creature with that elongated neck and those stringy limbs that big face with its faintly mocking beatitude I can t decide if the woman is an actress since she s able to get by so easily without doing all that much Paltrow certainly doesn t appear to have suffered for her art Unlike other screen beauties Michelle Pfeiffer Jessica Lange Madeleine Stowe she doesn t seem to have any interesting neuroses to ply In Great Expectations she never makes the leap from erotic object to flesh and blood human and that s not just the fault of the script and director We re told of Estella s inner struggle of the tug of war between the punishing cock tease that her aunt has engineered her to be and her inherent decency but the conflict isn t palpable in Paltrow s paltry performance Nor does the grown up Finn Ethan Hawke develop much stature When an anonymous benefactor provides him with the means to travel to New York and show his paintings at a SoHo gallery he goes somewhat mulishly He never becomes absorbed into the art world and its black clad poseurs always remaining a glassy eyed outsider Finn s awkwardness keeps him inoffensive but it thoroughly obviates the dramatic arc that s the whole point of Dickens novel If success doesn t change Finn for the worse then his rejection of the high life doesn t entail the same kind of sacrifices or come as a consequence of some harrowing epiphany And so the movie after a miniclimax or two just comes to an end suddenly smaller than the sum of its parts Great Expectations is magical anyway just this side of surreal Finn tells us that Dinsmoor s room smelled like dead flowers and cat piss and I mean no disrespect when I say that Bancroft s performance evokes those same aromas Those dreading a standard issue musty Miss Havisham will be delighted by this flamboyantly posturing pantsuit clad crone with her face cream and chica boom slang Bancroft is so spectacularly abrasive that it s scandalous that she doesn t get the incendiary comeuppance of Dickens novel that objective correlative finale in which the seething dried out harridan spontaneously combusts Hong Kong action fans hoping for spontaneous combustion from the American debut of superstar Chow Yun Fat might want to turn their weapons on the producers On the evidence of The Replacement Killers they seem bent on turning the most galvanic figure of Hong Kong action cinema into a pallid family man domesticating him in all senses Chow for those who haven t caught his act in any number of John Woo and Ringo Lam shoot em ups is one of those poker faced can t catch me artillery wielding supermarksmen who can blow away 50 bad guys without removing his sunglasses or the toothpick from his mouth He strikes poses reminiscent of Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood but his tiny smile lets you know he s having a blast and he seems more human than all his American action models put together In The Replacement Killers he s a decent fellow devoted to his mother and sister forced by an underworld kingpin Kenneth Tsang to travel to the United States to assassinate people The saintly assassin draws the line at shooting a little boy however so the kingpin along with J rgen Prochnow and other killers with scarred in hell faces comes after him with Uzis rocket launchers and so on The director Antoine Fuqua a veteran of Coolio music videos does a passable slow motion Woo imitation Woo is one of the executive producers but the plot and dialogue are Brand X and Chow by turns courtly worried and earnest has nothing of the rock n roll bad boy that put him on the map He s likable but he only comes alive with a gun in each hand spinning round and round firing front and back the tails of his jacket flapping The movie s chief pleasure is Mira Sorvino as a wise ass passport forger who can detonate an insult with throaty Bacall like precision and then leap into gun battles with hell for leather abandon Her part makes no sense but watching those long limbs flying through the air I never felt like complaining Davidtz Paltrow Sorvino it s a banner month for leg men
