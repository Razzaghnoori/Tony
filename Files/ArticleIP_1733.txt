 Irish Times GET INTERNATIONAL PAPERS BY E MAIL For Tuesday and Friday morning delivery of this column plus Today s Papers daily and Pundit Central Monday morning click here George Mitchell and George Michael vied for stardom in the British press Thursday On what is a make or break day for the Ulster peace talks all the British broadsheets led with stories of British government optimism for a last minute settlement despite the Ulster Unionists firm rejection of the draft agreement submitted by Mitchell the former U S senator who is mediating the talks The British tabloids however gave top priority to the arrest of pop singer George Michael for engaging in a lewd act in a public restroom in the Will Rogers Memorial Park in Beverly Hills Rupert Murdoch s Sun Britain s best selling newspaper dedicated its first seven pages to Michael s misfortune with a front page headline that read Zip Me Up Before You Go Go In its main editorial the Sun which on Murdoch s instructions supports Tony Blair praised the British prime minister s peace efforts but condemned Mitchell s draft as an appeasement of IRA terrorism that would sign away the sovereignty of a part of the United Kingdom to Dublin It is like letting Argentina help run the Falklands or Spain share control of Gibraltar But the Sun was at odds with most newspapers on both sides of the Irish sea Although Northern Ireland s Protestant Belfast Telegraph declared in an editorial that the creation of cross border north south bodies was asking too much of the Ulster Unionists the Republican Irish News in Belfast urged the Unionists to accept them as a logical development Its front page headline on the talks was So Near and Yet So Far Dublin s Irish Independent reporting optimism in Dublin as well as London said in an editorial that the prize is within the negotiators grasp If they fail to seize it they will surrender to the sinister men lurking in the wings At the moment of truth they must not flinch The Irish Times carried no editorial on the talks Thursday but its columnist Mary Holland wrote on the op ed page that Blair had failed dramatically to convince the unionist leader David Trimble of the need for radical change She added Perhaps even at this 11 th hour Mr Blair will be able to convince the unionists that embracing change is the best way to safeguard the Union But the damage that has been done in the past few days is enormous An op ed comment by Simon Beck in Hong Kong s South China Morning Post Thursday expressed alarm that recent World Trade Organization rulings against the United States could encourage U S protectionism and lead to a loss of U S confidence in the organization One of the rulings mentioned condemned a U S ban on imports of shrimp caught in Asian nets that could also kill rare turtles another rejected a U S complaint that Japan was obstructing imports of American Kodak film A few more headlines proclaiming that the WTO is letting innocent turtles die at the hands of ruthless Asian fishermen or allowing Japan to cheat U S workers out of jobs will not create the climate for a clear headed debate on the future of world trade the article concluded China s accession to the WTO was one of the issues on which Chinese President Jiang Zemin hopes to make substantial progress when President Clinton visits Beijing in June the SCMP reported quoting diplomatic sources Others were Taiwan and the resumption of high tech U S exports to China Chinese presidential aides had indicated they hope Clinton will promise to put pressure on Taipei to enter negotiations with China The Chinese president also hopes Clinton s visit will bolster his own prestige as a statesman upstaged by new Prime Minister Zhu Rongji s successful European tour The father of Dodi Fayed who died with Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris last summer told London s Daily Mail that he is sick of the British royal family Mohammed al Fayed who owns the former Duke and Duchess of Windsor s house in Paris which he had hoped to make Dodi and Diana s home recently sold its contents at an auction in New York Now he says he plans to redecorate it I want to get rid of all the royal spirits he told the Daily Mail They haven t done me any good To hell with the Windsors and the royal family The house does not deserve to be preserved historically Meanwhile the Daily Telegraph reported fury among British POWs once held by the Japanese that the queen is to invest the emperor of Japan with the Order of the Garter Britain s highest order of chivalry when he visits London next month Tammy Wynette the subject of many large obituaries in the European press was remembered on Le Monde s op ed page Thursday for her advice to rester pr s de son homme quoiqu il arrive car apr s tout ce n est qu un homme And George Mitchell profiled in Milan s Corriere della Sera was described as a great listener who first as a federal judge and then as a senator has spent his career trying to understand the point of view of his adversaries
