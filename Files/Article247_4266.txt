 DeParle Gets Half the Story Jason DeParle s New York Times reports on Wisconsin s radical welfare reform are typically fair minded and gripping Today s Page One summing up is no exception But it also makes one of the basic errors of welfare coverage an error that might be called the Leavers Fallacy Specifically DeParle tends to judge the success of welfare reform by what happened to families that were on welfare before the Wisconsin reform took effect but who then left As Christopher Jencks and Joseph Swingle point out in the current American Prospect t hese families are only half the story The other half includes those families who would have gone on welfare under the old system but who now no longer even apply for welfare These latter families you d think would tend to be more successful in the marketplace than people who now spend some time on the rolls To really judge welfare reform then you have to look at what happens to all families who would have been on welfare under the old system those who leave and those who never go on Actually you can t even stop there You have to look at what is happening to the overall society in which those families live at what s happening in the schools and on the streets to poor single mothers who might get welfare but also to single men and non poor families who live in the same neighborhoods DeParle s piece has good anecdotal reportage about specific women who left welfare for work and who still have big problems From this he concludes that welfare reform may end up making less of a difference in the lives of the poor socially or economically than much of the public imagined But his piece has very little evidence and almost no statistical evidence about what has happened overall to Wisconsin s poor including those who no longer even apply for welfare the other half of the story Thus DeParle points out that a long list of things remains present in the lives of the poor including violent neighborhoods absent fathers bare cupboards epidemics of depression the temptations of drugs That s very true But are they getting better or worse That is the issue isn t it DeParle doesn t tell us Are the neighborhoods more violent Are fathers taking more of an interest in their children Are there fewer kids born without fathers present in the household Are more mothers being beaten up by their boyfriends Are kids doing better in school Is the culture of drug taking and drug dealing becoming more or less entrenched Are more people depressed Hungry Overall how has the texture of ghetto life changed Welfare reformers said it would be change for the better Were they right Some of these things would not be difficult to report on some would be very difficult That s why we give Pulitzer Prizes DeParle doesn t really seem to try to come up with much We learn a lot about the problems in the lives of the handful of women he has chosen as his case studies but not only are they all individual anecdotes they are all leavers people who were on welfare before The broader surveys DeParle offers are also all surveys of leavers He offers no economic surveys of the whole population much less social surveys of crime marriage and the like The Jencks and Swingle article provides some of that necessary missing information for the nation as a whole as much as the existing statistics can provide Although American Prospect gives the piece a sleazily slanted cover line Welfare Reform s Victims the article contains more positive news than negative Employment among single mothers has increased more than almost anyone expected Most single mothers are a little better off economically but a small minority at the bottom seem to be a little worse off The rise of the single parent family may finally have been arrested although this began in 1994 so it s not clear that welfare reform can take the credit The most troubling statistic for reformers In Wisconsin the proportion of children born out of wedlock doesn t seem to have improved lately DeParle s one stab at a general assessment of the social health of Milwaukee s ghetto is rhetorically brilliant but ultimately unconvincing He tracks down William Love a bus driver who in 1998 along with two other drivers gave the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel an upbeat assessment of the impact of reform on his clientele The Journal Sentinel clip got passed around in pro reform circles and wound up in a Clinton radio address DeParle says Love is now having doubts Love is also a landlord and some of his tenants who no longer receive guaranteed monthly welfare checks are offering excuses for missing the rent So far haven t seen a big difference one way or another he tells DeParle It s a good shot at welfare reform cheerleaders but ultimately my suspicion is that Mr Love may be one of those kind interviewees who winds up telling reporters what they want to hear And aren t there other bus drivers to talk to like the two drivers whose pro reform observations in the original Journal Sentinel piece were actually stronger than Love s What about local church leaders Social workers Cops Some other beefs with today s piece Discussing one leaver survey DeParle declares that for most families the work has failed to translate into economic progress These families he says earn 400 less than they would have received by staying on welfare But he later admits this figure ignores earned income tax credits which at these levels typically total about 3 000 a year Doesn t that mean families are actually 2 600 ahead Isn t that the story DeParle refers to Milwaukee s growing homeless shelter population but doesn t give any figures on how much it s growing When I checked a couple of years ago the shelter population had indeed increased but only by a handful of families Is the problem now more severe Are we talking about dozens of people or thousands DeParle s big concluding anecdote is the story of Michelle Crawford a 39 year old Milwaukee woman who went to work last year at a plastics plant after two decades of desperation and chronic dependence on welfare She s still working but DeParle notes that even though she earned nearly 16 000 this year she struggles to simply keep food on the table to feed her family But wait a minute DeParle also notes that her husband Donald recently found a job as a hotel maintenance man Presumably he gets paid How much And doesn t that money get added to the 16 000 to help feed her three children Maybe it s not enough to make a big difference but DeParle doesn t even bother to tell us Is there an editor in the house Coming soon kausfiles Y2K policy
