                       I hope it come out well                     Well we will tell a story about the my mother and her sister and my grandfather grandmother and the other five children went down to Chattanooga where they had been raised in a place called Sequatchie Valley and my grandfather worked for the railroad         Uh so they had families and friends and they would go back and forth and visit and drive from Charlotte to Chattanooga TN and back         Now it takes about five hours used to take about a day and a half I suppose         Um the one day were coming back coming down the highway uh they ran into some chickens and evidently hit a chicken and drove them back to Charlotte some distance and when they go home from GA coming back through GA they got out of the car and there was a chicken uh dead up against the radiator of the car         So naturally they got out of the car took the chicken and plucked the chicken and boiled uh it and cooked it and had it for supper that night                  The other is a story about our history of I was married um Kaye and she seemed a quiet young lady from wellreserved family Presbyterian heritage         And later in life I found that her father when he was a young man rode a motorcycle         And in those days people that rode motorcycles around Charlotte were probably more rambunctious sort         He had an uncle out in CA and so he rode his motorcycle from Charlotte NC up to CA um not sure but maybe in Los Angeles area         And there he went in search of his uncle         His uncle had been into some kind of mischief and had been put in jail         He was serving on what we used to call chain gang and take your leg put a clip around it and chain a ball on one end and then give you a shovel or rake or a pick hed go out and maintain the highways         Well my wifes father found where his uncle was located and where he was working So in an opportune time he rode his motorcycle and got his uncle to hop on the back of the motorcycle and they headed for NC         And so he helped his uncle escape the chain gang and after they got back in NC his uncle became sick and within about three months uh died from tuberculosis         And thats a story of my wife side of family not a story from my side of the family         RECORDING PAUSED THEN RESUMED                     In the early part of                     Uhhuh                     To uh that didnt have orphanages and things and so when a family parents would die or someone couldnt take care of the children                     Uhhuh                     They would uh give them to another family to raise                     Um                     So my great grandfather uh adopted grandfather                     Uh                     by common law                     Um                     He had some other brothers and sisters and they went to other homes but when his parents died                     Uhhuh                     My great grandfather did not have any children                     Uh                     Great grandmother did not have any children so they adopted my grandfather and they had a large farm uh and my great grandfather was very industrious                     Um                     And so they farmed the farm and then they set up a touring company and they bought automobiles and they would go up to NY and pick people up and drive them down to FL                     Um                     For vacation back and forth and it was a time when they didnt have glass windows in the car they had what we called isinglass which was not plastic but was made out of a material                       Oh                              That rolled up                     Uh                     Or that they could hang a                     Uh                     So they would drive the folks back and forth from FL and then he created a construction company and in the First World War                     Uhhuh                     Went out and built the roads to go to a large camp that was here in Charlotte                     Um                     And so my father and my grandfather at that time uh were in involved in laying the putting the road                     Um                     Into a military camp         Uh my grandfather had seven boys and three girls so they had a very large family         they all worked on the farm         and he educated his most of his children my father went to the seventh grade and quit school                     Uhhuh                     But his other brothers and sisters went on through school and went to uh uh college         One                     Uh                              One studied to be a doctor there was an electrician a minister                     Uh                     There was a banker                     Uhhuh                     Uh and so they had different positions but the tradition of my great great grandfather and grandfather carried on to the children and my father who was not very well education                     Uhhuh                     Was an industrious man and he developed his own company                     Uhhuh                     Made his own way in life and became a member of school board                     Uhhuh                     He went to the seventh grade and quit and yet when he um was older and in business                     Uhhuh                     he was chairman of the local school board                     Uhhuh                     Where he went to school although he never graduated          and also the next two higher schools                     Uh                     He was on those boards                     Oh                              He used to kid and say that he went to uh                     Several schools                     No he he would go they would ask him when the businessmen would ask him what fraternity he was a member of                     Uhhuh                     And he would always say Hodskins which was the name of the school where he where went                     Uh                     Up to the seventh grade                              And theyd say What Greek letter is that         and hed say Its not Greek its Southern                  Hodskins fraternity                     Uh                              They kidded a lot in the family played practical jokes on one another                     Um                     My father bought a mule that wouldnt                     Um                     work for anyone but him                     Uhhuh                     And he would rent out the mule for people to plow their gardens and they would be so frustrated they would take the mule off to plow their garden and the mule wouldnt do anything                  And they would bring him back home and fuss at him                     Uh                     Then he would laugh and give them their money back                  My great my grandfather                     Uh                     developed the farm they were using into a residential area                     Uhhuh                     And he was good at doing things with his hands and some business but he took a lot tried to be a banker and he couldnt be banker because he built homes for people then financed the homes                     Uhhuh                     And uh he took the second mortgage                     Uhhuh                     And when the Depression came along back in the s uh all those homes were taken over by the banks and he was left without anything and he was destitute                     Uh                     When he died he was very poor                     Oh                     But he had been fairly wealthy along the way                     Uh                     In that community                       And he named the streets in the community for his children he named the name the name of the community was Thomasborough which he named after the family                     Thomas                     Tom                     They had uh a large uh home on the peak of the hill                     Uhhuh                     And uh they would ring a big dinner bell                     Uhhuh                     And the women would prepare for the workers and maybe they would have  workers come back and eat lunch behind the um house                     Uhhuh                     Out on the grass so when my grandmother and grandfather died the oldest son came through         He took the dinner bell and carried it off to his house he never used the dinner bell but it was a large bell like a church bell                     Um                     Uh they met together as a community and they founded a church and they met in a place called the Cannery                     Um                     They built a large building put in pots to cook with and the people who had local farms could go there                     Uh                     And cook their food and put them in cans and jars                     Uh huh                     And so it was a cannery and they started meeting at the cannery                     Oh                     Uh and then later built built the church there in the community                     Oh         It seems I dont know much about my familys history tree because since people choose not to tell stories I hear people choose to preserve the history and tell the stories so since that everybody here could tell stories about their family grandfather great grandfather well                     And the house his great grandfather lived in had a step                     Uhhuh                     Out front that was made of slate                     Uh slate                     Slate                     Yes                     And it that its carved                      Uhhuh                     That it could have been well thats what was thats whats in it and thats our front step at the front door                     Oh         You move it here the slate                     Uhhuh youll have to look at it         Its a step and it has in it is it                      Oh                     Not quite sure                     That would have been your great grandfather                     It would have been before me                     Way way back but it was at your great grandfathers house                     Uhhuh                     The house yeah                     And the house burned down                     Uh                     And that was one of the few things that uh                     UhhuhKT A piece of slate couldnt burn                     Uh                     And Lamars mother and father had it at their house out in the yard just on the ground at a tree                              Uh                     So when we built this house we made our we planned it so                     Uh                     It was the length of this piece of slate so thats from his great grandfathers house                     My grandfathers house in front of the its like a yard square yard and at the end at the gate there is a pair of stone lions                     Oh                     And thats are very popular in China                     Uhhuh                     Lions seem to be the                     The male and the  female with the paw                               Yeah the male and the female yeah with a ball                     A ball                     Yeah One is uh holding the ball with  a paw                               A paw                              The other is                     Holding it                     Having the ball in the mouth                     Oh                     Or it seems to be like it seems to be protecting the prosperity and also uh just a sign of peace and prosperity and dignity for the the family I think we have long history but nobody tells the story                              Im sure they do   much further back than our ancestors                     Thats because the the you remember uh I dont know whether you went to that park or not         That park very small but with a lot of of handwriting Asian handwriting carved on on slate too you you didnt go to the park                      In                                Not it has a lot of flowers                                             Lotus it should it should be called Lotus Park                      Oh yeah we did not go there                               We did not go          because when we were there the the greenery and all was gone                     Oh oh yeah not the right time  summer should be the right time                      So we did not go to Lotus Park                     Thats a thats a                     Ive seen  several pictures of it  in summertime                      Well the ladys house we went to the other night                     Oh yeah Nancy and John took that picture and she she published  that article                      Newspaper                              In the newspaper  we saw that                     Yeah in the newspaper January  that is a park built in  and  or something like that its even  more year                                                    One more thousand         but nobody tells a story about that its just not the tradition anymore                     Well I think part of that is when you had the Cultural Revolution                     Yeah I  I think so because                     So many people didnt want to  let their history be known                               So many is feudal  because a lot of things like the lions some people were saying is the symbol of feudalism because it protect the emperor emperor or empress                                           In some things so people just choose not to tell stories it seems that as soon as uh the new nation is was established everything should take a new look and                                           We just a cut off and say bye bye to the history                              Ooh I loved hearing the stories of the emperors though                     Uhhuh                     And all the concubines                              Concubines                     The mistresses                     Wives                     The wives                     Oh
