 Shut Up He Explained Owen Fiss is a professor at the Yale Law School and a highly regarded scholar of constitutional law The subject of this short book is the present direction of the law governing the freedom of speech What Professor Fiss has to say about it is worth attending to not merely because of his prominence in the field but because his argument is planted in the common assumptive ground of a lot of contemporary academic thought about the bankruptcy of individualism The thesis of the book is Fiss but the wisdom is conventional Professor Fiss thinks the present direction of First Amendment law is a bad one and he has an idea about how we might improve it The short way to put his argument though it is not quite the way he puts it is to say that our approach to speech has become increasingly permissive Courts have become more and more reluctant to allow the state to interfere with the rights of individual speakers to say what they wish and it is time to roll back that permissiveness and to embark on a new approach that would permit the state to silence some speakers and promote others but still Fiss argues in the name of freedom of speech This is what Fiss means by the irony in his title that true freedom of speech for all requires suppressing the speech of some This is not technically an irony It is a paradox An irony would be the observation that an attempt to increase freedom for all often entails despite our best efforts a decrease in freedom for a few If Fiss had addressed the subject of free speech in this spirit as an irony he would undoubtedly have had some interesting things to say for he is a learned and temperate writer But he has instead chosen to address the issue as an advocate for specific groups he regards as politically disadvantaged women gays victims of racial hate speech the poor or at least the not rich and people who are critical of market capitalism and to design a constitutional theory that will enable those groups to enlist the state in efforts either to suppress speech they dislike or to subsidize speech they do like without running afoul of the First Amendment Embarked on this task the most learned and temperate writer in the world would have a hard time avoiding tendentiousness Fiss does not avoid it The Irony of Free Speech is a discussion of several speech issues campaign finance laws state funding for the arts pornography speech codes and equal time These discussions are not doctrinaire but their general inclination is to favor state intervention on political grounds in each of those areas that is to favor restrictions on campaign spending greater regulation of pornography and so on Fiss analyses of specific cases are presented against a lightly sketched historical argument Light though the sketching is the historical argument is almost the most objectionable thing about the book since it involves a distortion of the history of First Amendment law that is fairly plain even to someone who is not a professor at Yale Law School The argument is that the liberalism of the nineteenth century was defined by the claims of individual liberty and resulted in an unequivocal demand for liberal government while the liberalism of today embraces the value of equality as well as liberty The constitutional law of free speech says Fiss was shaped by the earlier type of liberalism he calls it libertarian which regarded free speech as a right of individual self expression it is now used to foil efforts to regulate speech in the name of the newer liberal value equality Contemporary liberals inheriting both these traditions find themselves in a bind They want let s say black students to be free from harassment at institutions where they are racially in a minority since liberals worry that black students cannot be equal if they feel intimidated But those same liberals get upset at the thought of outlawing hate speech since that would mean infringing upon the right of individuals to express themselves Fiss suggestion this is the chief theoretical proposal of his book is that liberals should stop thinking about this as a conflict between liberty and equality and start thinking about it as a conflict between two kinds of liberty social vs individual The First Amendment he says was intended to foster in William Brennan s words uninhibited robust and wide open debate in society as a whole speech that inhibits or monopolizes that debate should therefore fall outside the protection of the law We can maximize the total freedom of speech by silencing people who prevent others from speaking when they utter racial epithets represent women in degrading ways use their wealth to dominate the press and the political process or block the funding of unorthodox art The historical part of this analysis rests on a canard which is the assertion that the constitutional law of free speech emerged from 19 th century classical laissez faire liberalism It did not It emerged at the time of World War I and the principal figures in its creation Learned Hand Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr and Louis Brandeis were not classical liberals they were progressives They abhorred the doctrine of natural rights because in their time that doctrine was construed to cover not the right to self expression but the right to property Turn of the century courts did not display a libertarian attitude toward civil rights they displayed a libertarian attitude toward economic rights tending to throw out legislation aimed at regulating industry and protecting workers on the grounds that people had a constitutional right to enter into contracts and to use their own property as they saw fit Holmes Brandeis and their disciples consistently supported state intervention in economic affairs the passage of health and safety regulations the protection of unions the imposition of taxes and so on The post New Deal liberals whom Fiss associates with the value of equality are their heirs The heirs of the19 th century classical liberals are Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich Fiss two liberalisms are in fact almost entirely different political philosophies Hand Holmes and Brandeis based their First Amendment opinions not on some putative right to individual self expression an idea Holmes referred to as the right of the donkey to drool but on a democratic need for full and open political debate First Amendment law since their time has performed its balancing acts on precisely that social value the very value Fiss now proposes we need to insert into First Amendment jurisprudence We don t need to insert it because it was there from the start Why does Fiss portray the history of First Amendment jurisprudence in this perverted way Because he wants to line up his own free speech argument within the conventional academic view that our problems are mostly the consequences of an antiquated and discreditable ideology of liberal individualism and that they can mostly be solved by adopting a social constructionist or communitarian or intersubjective view of human nature instead The merits of liberal individualism vs communitarianism can await another occasion to be debated For since the law governing the freedom of speech does not emerge out of libertarianism the matter does not boil down to replacing an obsolete belief in self expression with a more up to date belief in robust debate as Fiss would like to think it does What it boils down to is whether we need to replace the Hand Holmes Brandeis way of maximizing the benefits of free speech in a democratic society which tries to push the state as far out of the picture as possible with a different way which tries to get the state farther into the picture Here assuming we want to try the interventionist approach it is hard to see how a one size theory can possibly fit all cases The issues underlying pornography hate speech arts grants campaign finance and equal time provisions are all different The ideological impetus behind judicial developments in the last two areas campaign finance and equal time provisions is related less to speech except as a kind of constitutional cover than to a revival of the old right to property that is the Supreme Court tends to disapprove of legislative and administrative efforts to require broadcasters to carry opposing viewpoints on the grounds that since it s their property owners of television stations should be able to broadcast what they like Fiss believes that the need for equal time laws is as urgent today as it was in the 1970s which is peculiar in light of the proliferation of media outlets But the state does arguably have an interest compatible with the First Amendment in stipulating the way those media are used and Fiss discussion of those issues is the least aggravating in his book Still that discussion like his discussions of the other issues rests on a claim long associated with the left the claim in a phrase that the minority is really the majority In the case of speech Fiss appears to believe that the reason the American public is less enlightened than he would wish it to be concerning matters such as feminism the rights of homosexuals and regulation of industry is that people are denied access to the opinions and information that would enlighten them The public is denied this access because the state in thrall to the ideology of individualism refuses either to interfere with speech bullies such as pornographers who silence women or to subsidize the speech of the unorthodox such as Robert Mapplethorpe Fiss analysis of the Mapplethorpe case offers a good example of the perils of his interventionist approach Arts policy is unquestionably a mess The solution usually proposed is divorce Either get the state out of the business altogether or invent some ironclad process for distributing the money using strictly artistic criteria Fiss rejects both solutions he wants the criteria to be political He thinks the NEA should subsidize art that will enhance the robustness of the debate and should therefore prefer unorthodox art though only of course if it represents a viewpoint the endowment considers by virtue of social need and a prior history of exclusion worthy of its megaphone No Nazi art in other words Mapplethorpe s photographs seem to Fiss to qualify under these guidelines since he says in the late 1980s the AIDS crisis confronted America in the starkest fashion and provoked urgent questions regarding the scope and direction of publicly funded medical research To address those issues the public represented by the casual museum visitor needed an understanding of the lives and practices of the gay community so long hidden from view This seems completely wrongheaded People for the most part didn t find Mapplethorpe s X Portfolio photographs objectionable because they depicted homosexuality They found them objectionable because they depicted sadomasochism The notion that it was what Fiss calls a source of empowerment for the members of the gay community to have homosexuality associated with snarling guys prancing around in leather jockstraps using bullwhips as sex toys and pissing in each other s mouths at a time when AIDS had become a national health problem and the issue of gays in the military was about to arise is ludicrous Any NEA chairperson who had the interests of the gay community at heart would have rushed to defund the exhibit Jesse Helms could not have demonized homosexuality more effectively which of course is why he was pleased to draw public attention to the pictures Now that is what we call an irony of free speech Awarding funding to the work of a gay artist because gay Americans need more political clout is an effort at cultural engineering and the problem with cultural engineering is the problem with social engineering raised to a higher power We have a hard enough time calculating the effects of the redistribution of wealth in our society How can we possibly calculate the effects of redistributing the right to speak of taking it away from people Professor Fiss feels have spoken long enough and mandating it for people he feels have not been adequately heard One thing that is plain from the brief unhappy history of campus speech codes is that you automatically raise the value of the speech you punish and depress the value of the speech you sponsor There are indeed many ironies here Maybe someone will write a book about them
