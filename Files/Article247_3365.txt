 Mr Big Stuff Dear Jim It was a pleasure to get your e mail about Daniel Bell s book The Coming of Post Industrial Society Like you I was put off by Bell s prose which hasn t aged well But I ll avoid dwelling on that for now and skip right to your request an explanation of what Daniel Bell means by the post industrial society Then we can get into what relevance this book may have in 1999 According to Bell the post industrial society has several distinct characteristics Since we live in an Age of Information I ll bullet point them for easier retrieval A shift from manufacturing to services The centrality of the new science based industries The rise of new technical elites and the advent of new principles of stratification A changeover from a goods producing society to an information or knowledge society A change in abstraction from empiricism or trial and error tinkering to theory and the codification of theoretical knowledge for directing innovation and the formulation of policy A change in reality from nature during agrarian times and technics during the Industrial Revolution to reality existing as the social world Society itself becomes a web of consciousness a form of imagination to be realized as a social construction That about sums it up So why read this book now Well I m reading it because Judith Shulevitz my editor at Slate asked me to My reasons aside why should anyone else read this book I can t say I recommend it Heading to the beach with Bell may lead to sudden extended bouts of deep sleep that if you re not wearing SPF 30 can cause second degree burns on exposed skin This book should be kept indoors and used primarily as a sleep aid What s most interesting about Bell s book in 1999 is its time capsule quality extended sections on Marxism the use of science to develop atomic bombs and multiple pages on the arrival of affirmative action in American society and how totally dated these arguments now seem Bell s world circa 1973 was one where Marxism seemed important the U S S R appeared powerful and group politics was poised to tear American democracy apart with tribalism women s rights black power hippies labor etc His vision of a post industrial society is one where science and scientists because they re the ultimate knowledge workers rise to prominence The rated power of a country no longer rests on its steel capacity but on the quality of its science and application through research and development to new technology For these obvious reasons the new relation of science to government completely affects the structure of science as charismatic community and as occupational society What becomes central therefore is the question Who speaks for science and for what ends That s a telling section both stylistically pretty dense and theoretically Bell believes in the helmsman model of directing society For Bell the post industrial society is one where science scientists and the scientific method become the dominant model Science and scientists through their work have the capacity to steer society It s similar to Norbert Weiner s thinking the originator of the term cybernetics from the Greek word for helmsman which postulated that society would be increasingly governed by feedback allowing elites to steer better Bell s post industrial society is one where Big Government Big Corporations and Big Thinkers do Big Things It s Top Down And looking back at the 1980s and 1990s we see how very off that thinking became This after all is the era of 27 year old billionaires of bottom up chaos theory complexity theory the Internet Nasdaq viral marketing tribal marketing niches fragmentation heterogeneous globalization the hive mind the noosphere and so on The U S S R What was that The atom bomb by that I take it you mean those crusty ICBMs somewhere in Nebraska what about smallpox Biohazard 4 subway sarin and anthrax The consumer centric long boom of the 1990s seems utterly distant from the dry post industrial world Bell describes full of references to Weber Rousseau Locke and Lenin Of course you can t fault someone for failing to predict or describe the future but you can compare Bell to authors who had a far better sense of it Most important circa 1970s would be Alvin Toffler The Third Wave and Stewart Brand who wrote a crucial article for Rolling Stone in 1970 about how the real legacy of the hippie cultural revolution was the computer hacker Authors like Brand and Toffler understood the rise of what today we call libertarianism with its cross pollination between cultural trends do it yourself rock and roll homebuilding computer building etc symbolized by the Whole Earth Catalog the Sex Pistols and the Apple II and economic trends the rise of the entrepreneur as hero the brand of me and ever lowering barriers to the flow of capital from market to market Go back and read their work from around the same time as Bell s and you have a totally different response At least these authors arguments fall somewhere on the map of 1999 and neither of them seem to pay much heed to the U S S R Bell s inability to see a world beyond the context of military and economic Big Stuff is what dates this book most of all Big centralized models are out Network externalities are in Which leaves the question what part of Bell s post industrial society has come to pass Any Big Thoughts on this Jim
