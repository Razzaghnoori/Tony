 Background DNA microarrays have proven to be a particularly effective tool for genome wide transcript profiling and they can generate information on the accumulation and disappearance of thousands of specific transcripts in a single experiment 1 2 3 4 5 Because such an array generates vast quantities of data it is desirable to improve the statistical reliability of the data through experimental repetitions Additionally it is useful to perform time course experiments involving multiple time points to enable the application of cluster analysis to classify groups of genes exhibiting similar temporal patterns of regulation in response to shifts in environmental conditions Therefore a robust experimental design may involve the consumption of many individual DNA microarrays Given these considerations it is important to have methods for improving the efficiency and economy of microarray production Since the bacterial genes are typically not cloned at a genome wide scale as non redundant ordered sets as with eukaryotic cDNA libraries it is not possible to use universal primers e g T3 T7 sequences and therefore PCR amplification requires design and synthesis of PCR primers for all target genes In this context the construction of bacterial DNA microarrays from genomic sequence data using a two stage approach is attractive because it allows the continued re amplification of DNA fragments and facilitates further utilization of the DNA fragments for additional uses e g over expression of protein 6 This approach involves the use of chimeric primers containing both gene specific and engineered sequences adaptamers These primers are used to synthesize PCR products directly from genomic DNA which serves as template during the first stage of PCR amplification This amplification can be performed for thousands of genes during a given production run using well established procedures that include microtiter plates and multichannel pipetting techniques to afford efficient parallel processing of the samples The products of this first stage of amplification are gene sequences flanked by the arbitrary adaptamer sequences engineered into the first stage PCR primers The adaptamer sequences become the basis for re amplification of the gene sequences in a second stage amplification During the second stage of amplification the first stage PCR products serve as template whereas a single pair of primers recognizing the flanking adaptamer sequence can be used to re amplify all products of the first stage PCR In this report we describe the procedures for the production and use of DNA microarrays for the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 This organism is a widely used experimental model for the study of gene expression and plant like oxygenic photosynthesis 7 Synechocystis PCC6803 was predicted to contain 3 168 open reading frames prior to May 2002 http www kazusa or jp cyano index html 8 Of these over 50 1700 ORFs have been characterized as hypothetical or having no similarity to known sequences Thus differential gene expression via microarray analysis will represent an important functional genomics approach and we describe the two stage PCR strategy that led to the successful production of full genome microarray for Synechocystis Methods Growth conditions and RNA isolation Synechocystis PCC6803 cultures were grown autotrophically in BG 11 medium essentially as described by Williams 9 Specifically 500 mL cultures were grown in flat 4 cm across the light path Bellco tissue culture flasks at 30 C under white light

the preparation of the full genome Synechocystis microarray Oligonucleotides synthesized by Sigma Genosys http www sigmagenosys com were designed to amplify the complete coding region of each open reading frame from the sequenced genome of Synechocystis PCC6803 The only exceptions were instances for genes with a predicted length extending beyond 2 kb Of the 3 168 open reading frames fewer than 10 261 of the genes were truncated at the 3 end to the 2 kb limit Each of the oligos is a chimeric sequence designed for first round synthesis and as such contained two components a 5 universal sequence and a 3 gene specific sequence as shown in Figure 2 The gene specific region of the oligonucleotides begins at the first or last base of the open reading frame and continues inside until the T m of the oligo was in the range of 58 62 C 25 45 nt including the universal sequence An algorithm Sigma Genosys based upon Primer3 Whitehead Institute was used for this purpose and resulted in a high frequency of successful amplification as discussed below Importantly the universal sequences were designed to include SapI restriction sites in order to facilitate downstream applications including cloning into an expression vector Aliquots of the oligonucleotides were transferred and mixed as primer pairs to separate locations of 96 well plates prior to delivery from the commercial source which facilitated amplification in the 96 well format The remaining products from the synthesis reaction were stored in individual tubes at 20 C First round amplifications were performed in 96

2 min After completion of all 35 cycles an additional extension period at 68 C for 20 min was added to polish the ends Five l of each sample was loaded into 0 7 agarose gels and analyzed as described above Oligonucleotides for unsuccessful products after the second round reaction were redesigned resynthesized and used for reamplification PCR fragments were compared to a known size marker Cat No 10068 013 Invitrogen Products were scored successful if their length as defined by gel analysis was 15 of their predicted length contained only a single band and were of adequate density Purification preparation and printing DNAs Upon verification of successful amplification by gel analysis each plate of second round PCR products was purified using Multiscreen PCR plates from Millipore according to the manufacturers specifications except that a pre wash was incorporated to remove potential surfactant type agents present in at least some batches of the filtration units The resulting products were resuspended in 50 l sterile deionized water at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 30 minutes The yield of each product was measured by calculating concentration from A 260 values using Corning Incorporated s Costar UV transparent 96 well plates with the Molecular Devices Spectramax 384 Plus spectrophotometer The products were then dried in a Savant DNA110 Speed Vac Using a Qiagen Bio Robot 3000 each product was resuspended in water to 1 0 g l 1 To each sample an equal volume of 2X Microspotting solution Cat No MSS 1 Telechem was added Ten microliter of each product was transferred to two sets of 384 Micro Array plates Cat No X7020 Genetix Limited Using a Omnigrid arrayer Gene Machines and 16 Microquill 2000 pins Majer Precision arrays were printed in triplicate on Superamine slides cat No SMM 25 Telechem using 250 micron spacing in 18 15 spot subgrids To improve spot morphology blotting was increased to 30 spots per dip and pins were re dipped into the sample after every 50 slides Cross contamination between successively spotted samples is a potentially severe problem and was found to be minimized by increasing the stringency of pin washing procedures beyond the manufacturer s recommendations by increasing sonication in the washing solution for 5 seconds at the highest power setting Relative humidity was maintained at 50 and temperature at 23 C throughout the arraying procedure Array process verification At the end of printing one or two slides were used to verify the quality of printing such as spot morphology and intensity Slides were baked at 80 C for one hour washed with 0 1 SDS and rinsed in deionized water The slide was then stained with 100 nanomole aqueous Syto 61 Molecular Probes solution washed twice with 0 1 SDS rinsed once in deionized water and scanned for fluorescence at 550 nm in the ScanArray 3000 Each wash or rinse was carried out at room temperature for 5 minutes The scanned images were analyzed for spot morphology and intensity and the results of the analysis were used to optimize the printing process during each run Labeled cDNA production Fluorescently labeled cDNA was produced using a two step procedure involving cDNA production from target RNA using a reverse transcriptase reaction incorporating aminoallyl modified deoxynucleotide aadUTP followed by the second step involving chemical coupling of fluorescent dye either Cy3 or Cy5 to the introduced amino moieties of the newly synthesized cDNA The cDNA was synthesized from 16 g total RNA using 5 g random 8 base oligonucleotides Sigma GenoSys and Superscript II reverse transcriptase Invitrogen RNA samples control and experimental were each mixed with random octamers in a total volume of 25 l DEPC diethylpyrocarbonate treated water heated to 65 C for 5 minutes and then transferred to 42 C Subsequently 25 l of a premix containing 2 l of 100 mM DTT dithiothreitol 10 l 5X Superscript II buffer 1 l 50X aadNTP mix 25 mM dA C and GTP 8 4 mM dTTP and 16 6 mM aadUTP Sigma Cat No A 5660 10 l DEPC treated water and 2 l Superscript II was added to each tube Following two hour incubation at 42 C 4 l 50 mM EDTA and 2 l 10 N NaOH was added to each tube and incubated at 65 C for 20 minutes to degrade RNA The reaction was neutralized by the addition of 4 l 5 M acetic acid The cDNA was purified using Millipore Microcon 30 centrifugal filter devices by diluting the reaction mix with sterile deionized water to a volume of 500 l according to the manufacturers specifications Each of the two samples was washed five times using 500 l deionized water and the final retentate adjusted to approximately 50 l to facilitate handling The resultant solutions were dried at room temperature in the Speed Vac and the pellets were resuspended in 20 l 0 1 M Na 2 CO 3 pH 9 0 and mixed with 10 l of previously prepared Cy3 or Cy5 dye Preparation of the dyes was performed in advance and involved dissolving one tube of powdered Cy3 or Cy5 dye from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Cat No PA23001 or PA 25001 respectively in 55 l dimethyl sulfoxide and storing at 20 C until use The coupling reaction was carried out at room temperature in the dark for 1 hour The reaction was quenched by the addition of 4 5 l 4 M hydroxylamine followed by incubation for an additional 5 min The Cy3 or Cy5 dye coupled cDNA samples were combined and purified using a Qiagen PCR product purification kit according to the manufacturer s specifications Samples were adjusted to 14 75 l using SpeedVac and remainder of the hybridization components containing 2 5 l of 10 g l salmon sperm DNA 8 75 l 20X SSC 0 25 l 10 SDS and 8 75 l formamide were added The mixture was then heated for 2 minutes at 99 C briefly centrifuged at high speed and maintained at 42 C until the hybridization with the DNA microarray was begun Hybridization and wash conditions Printed slides were baked at 80 C for 1 hour washed twice for 2 minutes each at room temperature in 0 1 SDS and once in deionized water to remove unbound material The slides were boiled in deionized water for 3 minutes to denature the printed DNA dried using low speed centrifugation in a specialized microscope slide accommodating rotor Telechem The DNA on the microarray was then subjected to a UV cross linking at a dose of 150 mJ cm 2 Prehybridization was performed by incubating the slide in a fresh mixture of 100 ml of 25 formamide 5X SSC 0 1 SDS and 1 BSA for 45 min at 42 C in a Coplin jar The slide was then rinsed under distilled water and dried using low speed centrifugation The slide was preheated at 42 C in a Telechem hybridization chamber by placing in a static 42 C incubator The pre warmed sample was pipetted and spread uniformly onto a 24 60 mm glass cover slip Fisher Scientific Cat No 12 548 5P and the pre warmed slide was inverted and placed with the arrayed surface contacting the sample on the cover slip surface Deionized water 10 l was added to each of the reservoirs of a Telechem Hybridization Chamber and the slide was transferred to and enclosed within the chamber The slide was incubated in a static incubator at 42 C for 12 16 h and washed by placing in a 250 ml solution of 2X SSC and 0 1 SDS at 42 C for 5 minutes with gentle agitation provided by rotation of a magnetic stir bar The slide was transferred quickly to a solution of 0 1X SSC and 0 1 SDS incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature with gentle agitation and washed 5 additional times in 0 1X SSC for 1 min at room temperature The slide was then rinsed briefly with deionized water and dried by low speed centrifugation The slides were stored in the dark until scanned Results and Discussion The goal of this project was to develop a DNA microarray as part of an overall strategy for functional genomics in the unicellular model cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803 The two stage amplification strategy 6 was adopted as a means to facilitate replication of the arrays as needs dictated Figure 1 In general terms the optimization of this technical approach required particular attention to the design of the adaptamers the choice and use of the thermostable DNA polymerase and the thermocycling conditions Other technical factors such as the array printing conditions were found to conform to observations that are well described in the literature Overall the rate limiting production steps following the reaction optimization were those involving the analysis of the products Figure 1outlines the main features of this successful construction project and Table 1highlights some of the key parameters that we tested during the array construction Critical design features of the chimeric first round primers were the inclusion of the directional cloning and expression features plus the inclusion of a good common template sequence for the subsequent second round amplification The adaptamers included the introduction of G C rich sequences at the 5 termini to stabilize the end structure of the first round PCR products Another important design aspect that proved critical according to our preliminary tests was incorporation of an additional five base G C rich overhang in the universal primers used for the second round PCR Figure 2 The absence of the additional sequences resulted in very poor PCR performance compared to the excellent performance observed with their inclusion Importantly the two stage amplification had the unanticipated advantage of normalizing the yield of PCR products across the entire set of genes such that lower than average yielding products from the 1 stround PCR using the gene specific sequence and chromosomal DNA as template often had a robust yield during the 2 ndround of amplification using the common adaptamer sequences Although the primers were deliberately designed in such a way that oligo T m s fell in narrow range it was determined after a number of trials that it was necessary to use touchdown PCR conditions for the first round amplification Nevertheless the percentage of successful products after the first round synthesis appeared quite low based on yield as visualized in the ethidium stained electrophoretic gels Some lanes showed little to no product or multiple products after the first round amplification with the chimeric primers However these products generally resulted in successful amplification after their use as template in the second round amplification when the universal sequences introduced as overhangs of the chimeric primers during the first round amplification were used Thus the universal primers in the second round amplification provided the additional benefit of generating consistent yields across most of the genes see Figure 3 Apparently the amount of correct template produced by the 1 stround PCR albeit often invisible during gel analysis was usually sufficient to give high yields during the 2 ndround of amplification using the common adaptamer sequences Thus 86 of the products were successfully amplified during our initial round of two stage PCR Primers for the 14 unsuccessful products were redesigned and synthesized so that essentially all of the annotated genes were successfully amplified Therefore we conclude that this two stage amplification strategy for the purpose of PCR amplifying multiple products for genome scale applications is highly successful robust and efficient The use of adaptamer sequences with identical T m s for the 2 ndround of amplification optimized the yields despite different product lengths and different template concentrations which were dependent on the yield from the first round reactions The enzyme and thermocycling conditions were also optimized The choice of Platinum Pfx Invitrogen as the polymerase was determined to be crucial as was its use in conjunction with the proprietary reaction enhancer solution supplied with the buffer Tests with alternatives including mixes of Taq and Pfu yielded less satisfactory results All the images for the analysis of the PCR amplification are available at http microbiology okstate edu faculty burnap index html Organization and quality control were emphasized throughout production of the microarrays to ensure uniformity and accuracy A semi automated gel analysis procedure scored products on the basis of size and absence of multiplicity All PCR products were documented by digital photography and the images quantitatively analyzed using Total Lab Phoretics gel analysis software Nonlinear Dynamics Durham North Carolina This application was found to be most accurate user friendly and efficiently handled dual tier gels Furthermore as with other packages it allowed simple export of the numerical results to Excel spreadsheets A database was developed to integrate information including gene sequences oligonucleotide design PCR product length etc In addition Excel macros were developed to transform the aforementioned information to produce lists for each plate which were then used to track and identify the location of the arrayed elements under any condition including the use of different array configurations The scoring system described in the Materials and Methods section was set up to identify successful PCR amplified products DNA purification was simply and efficiently performed using filtration type purification plates Early issues with variation in printed spot morphology were resolved by pre rinsing the filters apparently this removes material acting as a surfactant and effects the spot morphology and or drying characteristics Alternatives such as ethanol or isopropanol precipitations were explored but for the chosen PCR conditions produced less reliable results and appeared to cause the co precipitation of non DNA material that interfered with downstream operations The nature of this material remains undefined although it may be due to constituents of the PCR reaction proprietary enhancer that is supplied with the Pfx polymerase The concentrations of the purified DNA fragments were determined Molecular Devices Spectramax Plus and a Qiagen Bio Robot 3000 was used to dilute the DNA samples to 500 ng l in 2X spotting solution Tests showed that the combination of Superamine slides and MSP printing buffer solution from Telechem provided the best combination of spot morphology retention of DNA after processing of slides and signal to noise ratio after hybridization Alternately Clontech type II slides in combination with the Telechem spotting buffer also gave good results in terms of printing and hybridization results Tests with other buffer systems e g 6X SSC and 50 DMSO gave less satisfactory results under the specified printing conditions The synthesis and hybridization of the fluorescently labeled cDNA derived from sample RNA is outlined in Table 2 In order to generate uniform spot morphology and to maximize DNA concentration and consistency for each spot across the array all products were printed at the same concentration This was accomplished using the Qiagen Bio robot 3000 to resuspend each of the purified PCR products to the same concentration based on the results of the Spectramax UV analysis These products were then mixed with an equal volume of 2X MSP printing buffer from Telechem and two aliquots were transferred via the Bio robot to separate printing plates The use of this robotic transfer reduced the chance for human error increased the rate of transfer thus reducing the exposure of the products to desiccation and increased the reproducibility of the transfer Syto 61 staining was regularly used to maintain a high level of quality control during the printing process Several internal and external comparisons were analyzed to demonstrate the effective use of the arrays Internally the use of triplicate spotting of all array elements and distribution of the triplicate elements in different regions of the array allows the comparison of hybridization uniformity across the array as depicted in Figure 4 Initially we determined the effectiveness of printed slides by hybridization with total RNA from control and salt stressed cells The results were compared with that of the published report from Kanesaki et al 11 Similar patterns of regulation of specific transcripts were observed and several examples of the differentially regulated genes are indicated in Figure 4 Qualitatively similar results using a direct RNA dye coupling procedure can be achieved using the Micromax ASAP RNA Labeling Kit Perkin Elmer Life Sciences Inc cat No MPS544 following the manufacturer s suggested protocol While it is significantly quicker and requires less manipulation the direct chemical labeling kit is more expensive and produces a final RNA product which is less stable than the cDNA produced Significantly direct labeling has thus far not provided as high a hybridization signal to noise ratio compared to the chemical coupling to cDNA approach Substantial effort was devoted to ensure spot uniformity high signal to noise ratio and good statistical reproducibility We believe that we have met these objectives and these arrays relate favorably to the best of current prokaryotic and eukaryotic arrays The strengths of these Synechocystis arrays include 1 consistent and high DNA concentrations in each of over 11 000 spots per array 2 3 replicates per probe per slide and 3 high signal to noise ratio This last parameter is due both to the quality of the slides the hybridization procedures that we utilized and the quality of the products printed We have used these arrays to develop robust statistical tools for the analysis of the microarray data The analysis involves an ANOVA model that makes excellent use of the technical replicates designed into each slide and a loop design Singh McIntyre and Sherman unpublished results The availability of large quantities of DNA the ability to print many slides and the statistical tools will enable us to analyze transcriptional changes under many environmental conditions and for many mutants The two stage amplification procedure also provides full gene copies for techniques like PCR fusion mutagensis This will permit many comparisons among different conditions and should greatly facilitate functional genomics In conclusion the two stage PCR amplification strategy detailed here is
