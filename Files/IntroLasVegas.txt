 Las Vegas and Its People It is hard to believe that Las Vegas a city of mythic proportion started out as little more than a dusty railroad stop in the middle of a barren and unforgiving desert valley It is harder still to understand the dramatic changes that would occur in the valley over the course of the 20th century which created the city known today as the Entertainment Capital of the World Though initially settled in the mid 1800s Las Vegas struggled as a Mormon outpost for much of its early existence It was not recognized as an official town until 1905 On 15 May of that year railroad officials from the San Pedro Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad stood at the intersection of Main and Fremont streets where the Plaza Hotel now stands and auctioned 1200 lots of railroad land mapped from 40 square blocks of desert dust Within a year the city s population had grown to 1500 brave pioneers though the only visitors were train passengers on their way to a real city Nine decades later today s cascade of visitors is surrounded by the fastest growing most rapidly changing metropolis the American West has ever known They stroll wide eyed in the shadows of the landmarks of the world s greatest cities around them within walking distance of one another loom replicas of the Eiffel Tower a massive pyramid of Egypt and the palaces of ancient Rome In a testament to Las Vegas s relentless pursuit of illusion its modern visitors never recognize the landmarks that originally offered the city its shot at history its natural springs most of which have long since run empty Though water flows freely through the city s multitude of artificial lakes lush resort swimming areas and sprinklers quenching the famous golf courses it now arrives via a giant pipeline connected to the Colorado River Without that pipeline the city would most certainly dry up and crumble back into the desert Notable as the only major American city built in the twentieth century Las Vegas is particularly unfettered by any burden of history or preservation As old some would say historically significant buildings or resorts succumb to the pressures of age design or simple decline of attendance and therefore value the law of the city takes over The buildings are completely remodeled or at the extreme reinvented as the sites of grand implosions accompanied by fireworks parties and general street wide celebration Few will remember or perhaps even care thatthe Italian themed Venetian complete with Colorado fed canals is built upon the site of the Rat Pack s most famous haunt the Sands Hotel Casino Today Italy tomorrow who knows Las Vegas like every good gambler has worked hard to reinvent and renegotiate its future After more than a decade of conversion from an insider Mob town to a family friendly attraction for Middle America Las Vegas is again on the verge of its next phase top notch resort city Today s Las Vegas reigns as one of the world s most popular travel and vacation destinations World class accommodations five star dining and shopping opportunities that rival every major city have added immeasurably to the city s reputation for all night gambling drinking and adult oriented temptations Hotel casinos have repositioned themselves as complete resorts offering full service day spas huge shopping malls and attraction filled theme parks all in addition to the gambling golf courses and showrooms of the past New resorts such as the Bellagio are aimed at travelers attempting to recapture the glamour of the Rat Pack era while many others are following the lead of Caesars Palace which offers world class shopping facilities This trend toward building complete resorts is perhaps the best approach attempted in recent years since it offers something for everyone Always betting on the side of growth expansion and the power of positive cash flow Las Vegas has again transformed itself and emerged as much more than a water stop for thirsty pioneers Such rapid change and reinvention results in what many call a city without a soul But for its over one million residents and 30 million annual visitors it is this very characteristic namely the city s uncanny ability to sense the next big thing or failing that to create one that makes Las Vegas the city of their dreams In fact many of the 30 million annual visitors choose to stay For nearly a decade new residents have numbered almost four thousand per month pushing the recent population of the valley up near 1 3 million a nearly 1000 percent increase since that fateful railroad auction of 1905 Outside the resort corridors new suburban residential developments have swallowed the surrounding desert eagerly edging to the bases of the easterly and westerly mountain ranges Unlike the original American suburbs new master planned communities like Summerlin and Green Valley are cities within themselves in fact they boast more square miles and more amenities than Las Vegas itself New businesses spring up almost immediately built into the plan and ready to serve an already waiting group of customers Driving through these areas feels like traversing a movie set the homes sparkling and new the roadways smooth and wide the landscaping young and fragile There are those who leave the city as well For the four thousand a month who come to stay approximately two thousand others pack up their belongings and head elsewhere still searching for what brought them to Las Vegas in the first place The American Dream is alive and well here but it has little patience for losers This is part of the unrelenting psyche of the place Although the motto of Las Vegas is that everyone is a winner for the most part it is a city unforgiving of failure Still despite all this rapid growth incessant change and unsettling population turnover there certainly is a core city and there certainly are long time residents many who proudly call themselves natives Driving in the central city within a few miles of Downtown one passes the neighborhoods of Charleston Heights and the Huntridge where plaster walled and wood floored houses reign often still occupied by the original residents Not far from these modest areas are the city s first upscale developments Rancho Circle and the Scotch 80s Here just a short mile or so from Fremont Street and Glitter Gulch are quiet ranch style homes spread out over parcels of an acre about 1 2 hectare or more complete with swimming pools tennis courts horse corrals and lush mature landscaping These neighborhoods often overlooked as too Downtown by newcomers are what longer established cities would consider treasures It is here in neighborhoods like these that a sense of the need for continuity and community is emerging In many core neighborhoods of all income classes voices are being raised about the necessity of neighborhood preservation about community service and about offering broad based opportunities and experiences for children growing up in Sin City These concerns are not really new to Las Vegas they had simply been overshadowed by growth in recent years Today many long time residents as well as newcomers are seeking to regain a sense of security in the rapidly changing landscape a city in which one could leave the doors unlocked at night just thirty years ago Through civic organizations and neighborhood preservation groups they are working hard toward a renewal of that sense of community lost in the hustle Also beyond the Strip and Downtown lie other signs of a real living and breathing metropolis The University of Nevada Las Vegas boasts a student population over 23 000 though like most of the people in Las Vegas they are commuters Before its recent rapid expansion the city claimed to have more churches per capita than any other in the United States Apparently spiritual guidance was a necessity for those who dwelt among an excess of temptation And though today s Las Vegas is still dominated by the gambling industry non gaming business has flourished here as well thanks to the county s and state s favorable tax structure Much of the non gaming business resides in suburban business parks and master planned communities part of the city s effort to reinvent the nature of urban and suburban existence by offering multiple industrial and retail centers throughout the valley Credit card companies and banks mail order firms health care subsidiaries and high tech software developers all contribute to a healthy local economy helping to diversify Las Vegas in the face of an ever changing national gambling landscape Moreover Las Vegas has recently started to show signs of maturity in its cultural status as well Long dismissed as a gaudy playground of excess Las Vegas has seen recent spurts of cultural growth Local theater is healthy a first class public art museum recently opened and there are encouraging signs that a centrally located arts and retail district known as The Gateway will soon erupt from its upstart beginnings into a major draw for residents and tourists alike Likewise Las Vegas remains one of the few cities in the nation with two competing daily newspapers There are also dozens of smaller newspapers serving a variety of specific interests including two dueling alternative weeklies As Las Vegas embarks on the new millennium one can sense an attempt by the city to accept its disparities to come to grips with the nature of its own existence and place in America and to thoughtfully wrestle with the challenges of its future While it confronts the issues that all growing cities face crime growth challenges to its industry Las Vegas seems to know that it has within its grasp the chance to rank among the world s great cities to show what America s only 20th century metropolis can accomplish Las Vegas s transformation from a lowly watering hole to a gambling and prostitution stop to a desert retreat for Hollywood heavyweights and finally to an international resort city is part of an eternal metamorphosis A city living with one eye open to the future prevents life here from ever being boring and also attracts tourists by the millions to experience the Las Vegas life if only for a few glittering moments
