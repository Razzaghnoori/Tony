        so so what have you seen lately that um you think is worthwhile      um the last movie i saw was Regarding Regarding Henry have you seen that yet   no i i saw the previews   its really good i loved it um its um   does does he does it have a happy ending or   yeah really good ending um   uhhuh   um it was just its one of the best movies ive seen in a long time i generally dont get into movies that much but i saw that one and then before that one i saw um oh Naked Gun Two and a Half   oh that was funny wasnt it   yeah did you have you seen that one   yes and and and and the regular Naked Gun and Airport and you know   yeah its exactly like Airplane One and  but it was silly   yes right so now these are fairly two very different movies one one  absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly you know serious subject   yeah yeah   yeah i i guess i have similarly broad tastes um my most recent um movie that i that i liked a lot not my most recent movie was Henry the Fifth i only only rented it you know maybe a month ago and its been out for a couple of years but have you seen that   umhum i havent seen that yet umhum   well its its a its an adaptation of the of the Shakespeare play uh and it is beautifully done um i believe that all the language is is Shakespeare read it except its been shortened a little bit and there might be a word or two changed   right   uh but its its its a glorious movie  um and i like as you know these these these  silly silly movies   hm   and i also like just some strange strange movies do you do you have any   such as   well the the one that comes immediately to mind i um is The Cook the Thief His Wife Her Lover um  but there also these various um but David Lynch movies um i got i got hooked on Twin Peaks that made me go out and watch every David Lynch movie i could lay my hands on   umhum oh really i havent seen any of those   oh um well i dont i dont especially recommend i mean  you have you have to just sort of like this though you have to like did you see Twin Peaks   theyre really good huhuh no   no so okay so if you werent if you werent drawn to watch that you maybe wouldnt be drawn to these movies either   umhum   theyre theyre just strange yeah   are they i mean is it like mystery or   oh well it   suspense or   i think suspense is the right word um and and but but little bit strange and esoteric and um   in the case of Twin Peaks a little bit theres some elements of the supernatural in it too   oh really   that that was the television show   hm   um theres also a a a producer of of movies in Baltimore called um John Walters who who puts puts out even weirder movies he uh his most recent ones have actually been fairly fairly mainstream like Hairspray um but back in his early days he he he had things um um what are what are the titles i cant remember the titles anymore but but some really weird ones uh with quite a random crew of of characters um it wouldve made you know these Fellini movies look normal   right so do you like um movies a lot see i dont do i dont   i i do i do like movies a lot   really see i dont do that i dont go to movies that often but just recently ive been to a couple   do do you rent them or   um no we i just go to like the dollar movie theater around here generally but i dont know i just i usually fall asleep or  i get bored pretty easily so   yes yeah thats what my wife does too um i mean she falls asleep  so we have to we have to pick just the right kind of movie to to to to to appeal   umhum yeah right thats exactly how   well well it was good talking to you   yeah its good to talk to you too   take care uhhuh okay bye   uhhuh byebye
