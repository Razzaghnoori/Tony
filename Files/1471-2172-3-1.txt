 Background T lymphocytes expressing the T cell antigen receptor TCR consist of two major subsets T cells expressing the CD4 surface glycoprotein which are restricted by the major hystocompatibility complex MHC class II proteins and CD8 T cells which interact with antigen presented by MHC class I proteins 1 CD4 and CD8 molecules bind to monomorphic regions on class II and class I MHC proteins respectively thereby increasing the avidity in the interaction of the TCR with antigen presenting cells 2 An intriguing question concerns to the mechanism by which selection and tolerance to self components is mediated in developing lymphocytes This is particularly relevant to T Lymphocytes because of their ability to recognize antigen only if this is associated with the class I or the class II MHC molecules 3 and also because of the unique selection process which operates within the thymus during T cell development Early during T cell development in the thymic cortex thymocytes bear both of the T cell surface glycoproteins CD4 and CD8 and express the and heterodimer of the TCR 4 Compelling data have demonstrated that CD4 and CD8 molecules participate in the selection of MHC class I or class II restricted T cells in the thymus It is known that during clonal selection in the thymus immature CD4 CD8 double positive cells develop into single positive CD4 or CD8 cells according to the relative affinity of their TCR to class II or class I molecules respectively 5 6 These immature T cells are selected in the thymic epithelium on the basis of their TCR interaction with either class I or class II MHC molecules 7 8 thus generating two mutually exclusive subpopulations that are characterized by the expression of either CD4 or CD8 glycoproteins 9 Earlier studies in the murine system have demonstrated that PMA and cAMP can modulate the expression CD4 and CD8 on developing thymocytes 10 11 12 13 In keeping with these findings ex vivo experiments with human thymocytes previously reported by our group revealed that while phorbol esters can coordinately regulate the transcription of and TCR during intrathymic T cell differentiation 14 cAMP selectively affected the transcription of the and TCR 15 16 Together the murine data and our own findings support the hypothesis that in humans TCR expression and CD4 CD8 commitment and selection may be regulated by the same signal transduction pathways Since a it is generally accepted that CD4 or CD8 are physically associated to the TCR in the course of T cell activation 17 18 and b it is well known that mitogen activated protein MAP kinase signaling is involved in the selection of the T cell repertoire 19 20 the present study further proposes that the PKC and PKA mediated signaling which regulates TCR expression can coordinately modulate the selection of CD4 CD8 and CD4 CD8 T cells during human intrathymic differentiation Results The effect of the phorbol ester 12 tetradecanoylphorbol 13 acetate PMA and exogenous cAMP on the levels of mRNA encoding the CD4 and CD8 glycoproteins was examined in human thymocytes Total post Ficoll un fractionated thymocytes were incubated in the presence or the absence of 10 nM PMA and or 0 1 mM cAMP 1 mM of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylemthylxnthine IBMX The fundamental reasons for the design of our ex vivo experiments are three fold a The need to evaluate intrathymic differentiation as close as it could be physically possible to an in vivo model b We sought to perform the experiments on untouched cells with the least of manipulations In purifying thymocyte subsets there is a risk that the antibodies used for the selection of the DP subset can stimulate cells through a TCR like signaling thus masking the read out of the experimental stimuli and c At least 80 of thymocytes are double positive DP cells Therefore the contribution of single positive SP cannot be a concern After 3 0 h incubation RNA was extracted and analyzed for CD4 and CD8 expression by northern blot hybridizations As shown in Fig 1 PMA caused a marked decrease in the levels of both CD4 and CD8 mRNAs whose constitutive expression is high in developing thymocytes In contrast cAMP selectively decreased CD8 mRNA levels On the other hand apoptosis was ruled out as a mechanism to explain the differential down regulation of CD4 and CD8 by PMA and cAMP on the grounds of two independent observations a After a maximum of 4 0 hr incubation with either PMA or cAMP IBMX the cell viability was the same as the untreated controls usually between 90 95 b Treatment with dexamethasone which is a known pro apoptotic molecule did not have any effects on the expression of either CD4 or CD8 data not shown and c As demonstrated earlier in the murine system TCR engagement of CD4 CD8 induces positive selection but not apoptosis 12 To further investigate whether the effect of PMA on CD4 and CD8 expression is consistent with the activation of protein kinase C PKC we examined structurally distinct phorbol esters that either have or lack the capacity to activate PKC for their effectiveness to modulate the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNAs As shown in Fig 2 the configuration of the phorbol ester that lacks the ability to activate PKC 21 had no effect on the expression of CD4 and CD8 In contrast the configuration that has the capacity to activate PKC 21 decreased the levels of CD4 and CD8 mRNAs The water soluble phorbol 12 13 dibutyrate PDB had similar effects to those of PMA The specificity of the signals driven by PMA was further stressed by the up regulation of CD3 expression and by the unaltered mRNA levels of the proto oncogene c Ha ras On the other hand it has been previously demonstrated that direct activation of adenylate cyclase by Forskolin or cholera toxin inhibition of cAMP specific phosphodiesterase and treatment with a cell permeable cAMP analog induces a rise in intracellular cAMP 22 23 24 25 26 Since cAMP is known to modulate the expression of CD8 in mice 27 we sought to determine whether cAMP dependent protein kinase PKA mediated signaling plays a role in modulating the mRNA levels of CD3 CD4 and CD8 in ex vivo examined human thymocytes Fig 3shows that the signal which regulates the expression of human CD8 is cAMP mediated since direct activation of adenylate cyclase by cholera toxin produced the same effects as the di butiryl cAMP analog The requirement of phosphodiesterase inhibition by IBMX further supports this statement As it can also be observed cAMP coordinately regulated the expression of both the and chains of the CD8 molecule CD4 remained unchanged and CD3 was minimally affected thus stressing the selectivity of the cAMP dependent down regulation of CD8 expression Fig 3 To further investigate whether PMA and cAMP regulate CD4 and CD8 expression at the protein level surface detection of the CD3 CD4 and CD8 was also assessed As observed in Fig 4aPMA dropped the proportion of CD4 cells from 60 to zero produced a slight decrease from 71 to 64 in CD8 cells and did not affect the expression of CD3 cAMP on the other hand had little effect on the surface expression of the glycoproteins These findings are in contrast with the drastic down regulation of CD8 transcript levels exerted by cAMP However regulation gene expression is complex and engages numerous checkpoints that include transcription RNA processing nuclear cytosol transport translation and RNA and Protein stability Since the half lives of mRNA and protein can be dramatically different we hypothesize that an increased CD8 protein stability may result in a delay of CD8 surface disappearance thus favoring its transient selection As CD8 gene transcription has been turned off by cAMP mediated signaling surface CD8 subsequently fades with the concomitant emergence of CD4 cells In keeping with this rationale the kinetics of the PMA mediated down regulation of CD4 Fig 4b reveals a sharp and rapid decrease on CD4 surface expression as early as 15 min of incubation with PMA with a complete disappearance by 2 0 hr The relatively short kinetics of surface CD4 down regulation and the delayed CD8 surface disappearance can be interpreted as a PKC mediated selection signaling in favor of CD8 CD4 TCR cells that may operate during intrathymic T cell differentiation Binding of specific ligands to CD4 including phorbol esters results in internalization of the molecule by endocytosis which in turn is phosphorylated 28 and possibly immobilized It is conceivable that a similar mechanism might be used by extra cellular signals in the thymic epithelium during intrathymic differentiation Discussion An accepted scheme of the T cell development program 29 30 has demonstrated that as immature cells enter the thymus cycling CD4 CD8 precursors begin to rearrange and genes which generates CD4 CD8 and cells CD4 CD8 on the other hand rearrange and express the TCR heterodimer A few of these cells are selected through the specificity of their antigen receptor and mature into either CD4 CD8 or CD4 CD8 T cells which exit from the thymus Much progress has been accomplished in determining the molecular steps that lead to a better understanding of murine T cell progenitor commitment and selection of the functional repertoire which has gained important insights into mechanisms of CD4 CD8 lineage commitment reviewed in 31 For instance changes in expression of CD5 TCR Bcl 2 RAG and TdT genes can be induced by in vitro TCR engagement of DP thymocytes thus indicating that at least some aspects in the T cell maturation program are directly coupled to TCR signaling It is therefore accepted that positive selection are directly coupled to TCR signaling pathways in DP thymocytes However the signals that promote selective down regulation of CD4 and CD8 remain have not been that conclusive at least in humans Earlier again murine studies reviewed in 31 have suggested that a transitional phenotype of CD4 CD8 lowis not a signature of commitment towards the CD4 lineage The confirmation of such conclusion in the humans and the determination of the signals that lead to the phenotype remain to be assessed We have previously shown that PMA strongly induces the transcription of and TCR in human thymocytes whereas cAMP exclusively affected the transcription of TCR 15 16 The data reported herein suggest that following rearrangement protein kinase C activation mimicked by the phorbol esters induces the expression of the and TCR on CD4 CD8 precursor T cells Since only a proportion of developing thymocytes succeed in expressing the TCR heterodimer PKC activation also provides the signal to turning off the CD4 and CD8 genes on cells that failed to express the TCR which are non functional and potentially harmful On the other hand cAMP is known to participate in the growth and differentiation of varied cell types including thymocytes through the transcriptional regulation of specific genes 32 33 34 The unique cAMP signaling which specifically targets the expression of the CD8 mRNAs and suggests that PKA activation may result in the transduction of signals that determine the selection of T lymphocytes in favor of the CD4 CD8 lineage by down regulating and possibly turning off the expression of the CD8 transcripts In keeping with this notion regulatory elements within the CD4 and CD8 promoters have been identified an characterized including the presence of cAMP regulatory elements binding CREB sites 35 However it is also likely that the control of CD4 and CD8 expression and thus the selection of CD4 or CD8 lineage committed cells may also be controlled by the differences in mRNA and protein stability Lastly some of the TCR signaling pathways involved in positive selection have been identified in the mouse and there is some evidence that these may be different from those involved in negative selection It remains to be determined whether same interpretation applies to human T cell selection Conclusion In conclusion the results of the ex vivo experiments of human thymocytes reported in the present study are in complete agreement with the earlier studies in the murine system and strongly support the conclusions We further propose that the transduction of intracellular signals initiated by the activation of PKC and PKA by phorbol esters and cAMP respectively are not only critical for the differential regulation of CD4 and CD8 gene expression but more importantly in the commitment and selection of the functional T cell repertoire Materials and Methods
