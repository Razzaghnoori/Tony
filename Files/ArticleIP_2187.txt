 Do As We Say The Supreme Court the New York Times scolded in an editorial Wednesday is often too quick to dilute the Fourth Amendment s protections against unreasonable searches in the name of fighting drugs On this particular occasion however the Times congratulated the court for sending a welcome message that there are some searches the war on drugs cannot justify The message was an 8 to 1 decision this week throwing out a Georgia law that required political candidates to take a urine test The Times noted that there is no reason to suspect a drug problem among Georgia s politicians Those of us who rely on the New York Times for moral guidance on all important issues were deeply alarmed by this sermonette Not that we disagree of course Disagreement with the New York Times editorial page verges on logical fallacy One might as well disagree with Niagara Falls about the effect of gravity on large amounts of water But Wednesday s editorial therefore raises the troubling issue Is there reason to suspect a drug problem among staff members of the New York Times We ask because we happen to know that the New York Times requires its own new employees to take a urine test for drugs At least one recent hire was told that flunking the test once would eliminate any chance of being hired by the Times now or at any time in the future When this person attempted to wash up after providing the required sample it turned out the tester had removed the handles from the faucets apparently to prevent the applicant from diluting the product There must be some explanation It s true that the New York Times is not the government so its drug testing policy isn t unconstitutional But that alone doesn t make the policy any less unreasonable It s also true of course that a junior copy editor for the New York Times is obviously more vital to the nation than an elected official of the state of Georgia But it would be useful to have the Times editorial page spell out the exact difference here for employers who must decide between doing what the Times says and doing what it does Yellow Journalism Slate readers will naturally wonder what our own drug testing policy is It is very simple All Slate employees regular columnists free lance contributors artists and paying subscribers must produce a urine sample under the direct observation of a Microsoft official Colleagues family and friends often join in turning what could be and at the New York Times apparently is a grim ritual into a festive and sentimental occasion Photographs are taken and posted on the corporate Intranet For those who will be writing about software related subjects the ceremony is conducted once a month by Bill Gates himself in the ballroom of the Redmond Holiday Inn I used to do these individually in my office Gates says with a sigh but the company s gotten so darn large We don t know about the New York Times but at Slate we don t actually send any of these samples out for drug testing We just sorta like having them around Slate s 267 090 705 Most American Americans As our In Other Magazines column notes both Time and Newsweek chose this week to celebrate large numbers of allegedly remarkable Americans Time s cover story anoints America s 25 most influential people Newsweek perhaps foreseeing that Time would repeat this device from last year upped the ante with a list of 100 Americans for the Next Century We here at Slate wish to make it clear that three can play this game We have of course the long established tradition well dating back almost five months now of the Slate 60 our list of America s biggest givers to charity Our first quarterly report for 1997 is published in this issue But is that enough The Slate 60 we confess is discriminatory Many people who might like to make the list by giving 10 million to charity are unfairly handicapped by the lack of 10 million Furthermore something must be done to stop this insane competition between Time and Newsweek and many other magazines to come up with ever larger and less coherent lists of people The only solution is a pre emptive strike We at Slate have pondered the situation and concluded that every American is influential in his or her own way Some for example are bad influences but influential nevertheless And although we have not asked each one a random survey of Americans indicates that none of them is opposed to the next century Therefore we proudly announce that the entire population of the United States 267 090 705 wonderful Americans as of Thursday evening according to the Census Bureau s population clock is on the first annual list of Slate s Most Influential Americans With the Hottest Bods and Biggest CEO Salaries Not to Mention Intriguing Personalities and Best Restaurants Under 25 for the Next Century Our heartiest congratulations to each of you And we are confident that Slate s list contains more people who will make history in the next century than Newsweek s list does To find your name try the Internet White Pages WhoWhere or PC411 the North American Phone Book The last of these however includes Canadians among its 110 million listings tragically they do not qualify After all somebody has to be excluded or it isn t much of an honor is it Michael Kinsley
