 Background Glutamate is believed to be the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the retina 1 2 as it is in the rest of the central nervous system Glutamate receptors are characterized by their sensitivity to specific glutamate analogues and by specific features of the glutamate elicited currents Ionotropic glutamate receptors mediate fast synaptic transmission between neurons because the receptors and the ion channel form one complex Two types of ionotropic glutamate receptors have been classified 1 NMDA receptors which bind glutamate and the glutamate analogue N methyl D aspartate NMDA 2 non NMDA receptors which are stimulated by kainate AA amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid AMPA and quisqualate but not NMDA Glutamate binding to non NMDA receptors opens ion channels more permeable to sodium Na and potassium K than calcium Ca 2 In contrast to the non NMDA receptors the high conductance channel associated with the NMDA receptors is permeable to Ca 2 as well as to Na and K Also NMDA gated currents typically have slower kinetics than kainate and AMPA gated channels 3 NMDA receptors are heteromeric ion channels composed of one NR1 subunit with combination of other NR2 subunits 4 5 6 7 The NMDAR1 NR1 and the NMDAR2 NR2A D have been cloned 4 5 6 8 9 It has been shown that NR1 possesses all the properties characteristic of the NMDA receptor channel complex 4 7 9 10 11 12 whereas the NR2 subunit has no independent channel activity in its homomeric structure but potentiates the NMDA receptor activity when expressed in combination with the NR1 subunit 4 13 14 The expression of NR1 and the composition of the NR2 subunits are developmentally regulated Based on the electrophysiological data excitatory synaptic transmission is mediated in large part by NMDA receptors in immature neurons 15 16 17 18 19 whereas the activity of non NMDA receptors is increased following synaptic maturation 19 NMDA receptors containing NR2B subunits are present in the neonatal forebrain and over the course of development they are replaced or supplemented with NR2A containing receptors 13 20 Dynamic and environmentally driven changes in the NMDA receptor expression have been shown in the visual cortex 21 22 and LGN 23 where the expression is altered by visual activity For example dark rearing from birth attenuates the developmental increase in NR2A in the visual cortex 24 25 In contrast to previous observations that the AMPA receptor expression is relatively constant in glutamate sensitive neurons 26 recent studies have shown that the expression of AMPA receptor subunits especially GluR1 the major functional subunit of the AMPA receptor 11 is regulated developmentally at regional cellular and synaptic levels 27 28 29 30 It has been shown that the AMPA receptors can move in and out of synapses as synaptic connections are strengthened and weakened 31 32 33 These dynamic changes were blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists 33 However the molecular basis for this activity induced change in AMPA receptors remains unknown In the present study the prospect of a visual regulated expression and composition of NMDA receptor subunits NR1 and NR2A B in the retina is tested by using the rdta transgenic mouse in which the rod photoreceptors have been genetically ablated The expression of GluR1 is also examined because it is the major functional subunit of the AMPA receptors This receptor subunit is a substrate of calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II CaMKII which is up regulated in the retina of the rdta mice 34 Results Expression of actin is increased in the retinal synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the rdta transgenic mouse No differences could be detected in the levels of actin in retinal homogenates isolated from rdta mice and their littermate controls and therefore this molecule was previously used as an internal reference 34 In this study actin was assessed in the synaptic membrane fraction SPM Figure 1A A 90 increase of the antibody binding to actin was observed in western blots of the SPM fraction of the retinae from the rdta mice relative to their littermate controls Figure 1B Therefore the significant increase in the membrane associated pool seen here must represent an insignificant fraction of the homogenate associated pool observed in the previous study Experimentally induced changes in actin levels associated with forebrain synapses have been reported recently 35 and the increases observed here are most likely due to changes in the cytoskeletal structure of synapses in the retinae of the rdta mice This observation requires further investigation NR1 expression and NR2A B composition are altered in the rdta retina To determine if the expression of the NMDA receptor and or its composition was altered as a result of rod photoreceptor ablation immunoblots were analyzed for the NR1 Figure 2A the NR2A Figure 2B and the NR2B Figure 2C subunits The immunolabeled NR1 NR2A and NR2B subunits were increased by approximately 123 62 and 100 Figure 2D respectively in the membrane fractions isolated from the retinae of the rdta mice Phosphorylation of GluR1 is increased in the synaptic membrane fraction isolated from the retinae of rdta mice The level of GluR1 protein was also examined in immunoblots Figure 3A The protein level of the GluR1 subunit was 2 3 times greater in the rdta mice than in the wild type mice Figure 3B Because GluR1 is a known substrate of CaMKII in vitro and in vivo 34 36 37 38 39 40 and because CaMKII expression activity is up regulated in the retinae of the rdta mice 34 GluR1 phosphorylation might also be increased in the rodless retina To test this notion the SPM proteins isolated from the retinae of the rdta and their littermate controls mice were back phosphorylated in the presence of Ca 2 calmodulin and 32P ATP Figure 4A The bands densities in the rdta mice were low and a long film exposure was necessary to detect the signal Figure 4A The relative position of 32P ATP labeled GluR1 as indicated was confirmed by immunoblotting with GluR1 antibodies Figure 4B It was found that 32P ATP labeling of GluR1 by this procedure was greater in the retinae of control mice than in the retina of the rdta mice Figure 4A whereas the expression of GluR1 was increased in the rdta mice relative to their littermate controls Figure 4B These data indicate that GluR1 phosphorylation in vivo was enhanced in the rdta retinae relative to their littermate controls This result was confirmed using an additional technique GluR1 was immunoprecipitated with anti GluR1 antibody and then subjected to in vitro phosphorylation Figure 4C Together these data indicate that in vivo the amount of GluR1 and the phosphorylation of GluR1 are simultaneously enhanced in retinal synaptic fractions isolated from the retinae of rdta mice Discussion To our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate that the protein levels of NMDA and AMPA receptors are altered in the retina when the rod photoreceptors are absent Western blots analyses demonstrate that the amounts of NR1 NR2A B and actin are significantly increased in the retinae of rdta mice compared to their littermate controls Furthermore the amount of GluR1 expression and its phosphorylation are simultaneously increased in the retinae of the rdta mice As the retinal thickness of the rdta animals is reduced by as much as 30 relative to littermate control animals the estimated increases in synaptic relevant molecules as a percentage of total retinal protein could be over estimated by at least this amount Even accounting for such a correction the changes reported here remain significant A previous study using similar western blot demonstrations of an elevation in calcium calmodulin kinase II protein a molecule intimately related to those studied here was shown to be at least qualitatively correct using an independent immunohistochemical assessment 34 The results presented here are consistent with studies demonstrating activity based changes in receptors as reported for other parts of the nervous system 21 23 24 25 41 NR1 expression is not altered in the dark reared visual cortex 24 25 but contrarily an intraocular injection of tetrodotoxin TTX does increase NR1 antibody binding in layer IV of the cortical column driven by the blocked eye 41 The latter study supports the notion that neural activity is a regulating factor for NR1 expression It should not be surprising to find similarities and differences between the experimental paradigms of dark rearing visual cortex on the one hand and photoreceptor ablation retina on the other Electrophysiological and pharmacological studies have shown that different subunit configurations comprising the receptor confer different functional properties and selectivity to the NMDA receptors 7 11 13 42 43 For example the kinetics of the NMDA receptors are regulated by the combinatorial associations of the NR1 and NR2 subunits 44 Thus mature NMDA receptors which contain more NR2A subunit have a faster decay time than immature receptors which contain more NR2B subunits 20 44 In the present study the increase in the protein level of NR2B was much higher than NR2A in the rdta mice Therefore the increased expression of NR2B could be indicative of developmental functional delay due to the lack of rod input In the retina the visual information is transmitted vertically by glutamate containing cells photoreceptors bipolar and ganglion cells 45 46 47 48 49 and from the retina to the LGN and visual cortex The fact that expression of NMDA receptor subunits in the retina can be altered leads us to suggest that the activity dependent expression of NMDA receptors in the visual cortex or LGN could be co incident with or perhaps even dependent on the changes that occur in the retina The examination of NMDA receptor expression in the LGN and visual cortex of the rdta mouse could prove to be useful for future explorations of this point Increases in the amount of protein for ionotropic receptor subunits were observed in the membrane fraction isolated from retinae of the rdta mice These changes are most likely due to a dynamic structural reorganization in the retina This is supported for example by the co incident increase in the level of actin While this observation was not expected it is not necessarily surprising or without precedent Actin is involved in dynamic structural changes observed in synapses 50 The level of actin in particular is known to be altered through the stimulation of kainate receptors 35 With regard to the retina both structural and functional plasticity of retinal synapses have been shown to be affected by inhibiting actin turnover with cytochalasin 51 NMDA receptor clusters are present within the inner plexiform layer IPL of the retina and the receptor clusters are composed of different subunit combinations NR1 NR2A NR1 NR2B and a small number of clusters also contain NR1 NR2A NR2B 52 These localizations are observed at the synaptic sites between amacrine and ganglions cells with very little localization evident at the bipolar cell axon terminals Thus the changes observed in the present study most likely reflect changes that occur in the inner plexiform layer of the retina Changes in NMDA receptor expression are likely to affect neuronal function through regulation of intracellular events 53 We have previously reported that retinal CaMKII mRNA protein and enzyme activity localized in the somas of amacrine cells and ganglion cells and in the inner plexifom layer but not PKC localized in bipolar cells are increased in the rdta mouse 34 The NR2 subunits of the NMDA receptor contain serine residues that can be phosphorylated by either CaMKII or PKC 53 54 55 While stimulation of PKC activity may decrease CaMKII binding to the NMDA receptor complex 56 there is no change in the level of PKC in the rdta mice 34 Thus enhanced phosphorylation by CaMKII may be involved in the altered levels of NMDA receptor subunits observed here but this remains to be tested Regulation of neurotransmitter receptor function by protein phosphorylation plays a critical role in the modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity 57 58 59 60 It has been shown that AMPA receptor phosphorylation is critical for synaptic plasticity in the brain 61 and postsynaptically GluR1 is mainly regulated through changes in CaMKII phosphorylation 62 Because CaMKII expression activity is up regulated in the rdta retina 34 and because GluR1 is a substrate of CaMKII 36 37 38 39 40 the increased phosphorylation of GluR1 seen here in the retinal synapses of the rdta mice could indicate a synergy between CaMKII and GluR1 Together these data support the concept that there is an activity dependent synaptic modification in the retina of the rdta mice Some types of synaptic plasticity such as LTP require activation of the NMDA receptor postsynaptic Ca 2 ion influx with concomitant activation of CaMKII 63 The activation of CaMKII then catalyzes the phosphorylation of AMPA receptors and enhances AMPA receptor responsiveness 37 39 40 60 The demonstration that GluR1 expression is increased in the retina of the rdta mouse where a rod photoreceptor mediated visual input is missing is consistent with a previous report in which the level of GluR1 is increased in the deafferented tectum 64 65 These data indicate that rod photoreceptor mediated visual input may have a negative effect on GluR1 expression in normal retina during the course of development However changes in GluR1 gene expression are not evident in the retinae of rd mice 66 using the in situ hybridization method 67 Such studies support the possibility that the changes in GluR1 seen here may be due to a post transcriptional regulation However it remains to be tested if the increased amounts of GluR1 observed in this study are due to new protein synthesis or to a translocation from some intracellular compartment to the synaptic membrane 27 29 In the present study an increased synaptic expression of the NMDA receptors and GluR1 subunits is associated with changes in CaMKII It is postulated that CaMKII phosphorylation of GluR1 and NR2A B may play a role in increasing the presence of these receptors within retinal synapses Together these results from the rdta mice demonstrate that it is a useful model system for the study of receptor plasticity in the retina and possibly higher levels of the visual system The results are supportive of the concept of a plastic retina in which environmental stimuli may induce changes in the structure and chemistry of the retinal synapses although it is appreciated that the loss of photoreceptors is not quite the same thing as a loss of visual input This concept can now be tested in the retinae of normal animals using a more physiologically appropriate paradigm Materials and Methods Animal model the rdta transgenic mouse All animals experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and with the authorization of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee IACUC The rdta mouse has been previously described 68 Expression of an attenuated diphtheria toxin gene under the control of rhodopsin promoter results in the specific elimination of rod photoreceptors in the retina 34 The transgene was maintained in the heterozygous state by crossing the rdta mice to C57BL 6J mice Age matched littermate control and the rdta transgenic mice were housed under a cyclic regimen of 12 hours light 12 hours dark Each experimental group contains 4 5 animals Groups of the rdta and littermate control animals were sacrificed at postnatal day 40 P40 The animals were euthanized in the light period of the diurnal cycle by injection with sodium pentobarbital 40 mg ml 0 5 mg g body weight The retinae were used for immunocytochemistry back phosphorylation assays and immunoprecipitation assays Subcellular fractionation Subcellular fractionation was used to obtain a crude synaptic plasma membrane SPM fraction according to a modification 69 of a previously described method 70 Briefly retinae were isolated with homogenization buffer HB 0 32 mM sucrose 2 mM Hepes pH 7 4 1 mM EGTA 2 g ml leupeptin and 2 g mg Aprotinin and homogenized The homogenate was centrifuged at 900 g for 10 min to produce a pellet P1 and a supernatant S1 P1 was resuspended in HB and centrifuged again at 900 g for 10 min to obtain pellet P1 and supernatant S1 S1 and S1 were combined and centrifuged at 10 000 g for 20 min to produce pellet P2 and supernatant S2 P2 was resuspended in the lysing buffer LB 2 mM Hepes pH 7 4 1 mM EGTA 2 g ml leupeptin and 2 g mg Aprotinin and kept on ice for 15 min homogenized and centrifuged at 19 000 g for 20 min to obtain pellet P3 and supernatant S3 P3 is the fraction containing crude SPM and was resuspended in HB stored at 80 C prior to use All procedures were done at 4 C and the protein concentrations of samples were assayed using the Coomassie Blue method Different amounts of the crude SPM protein 2 4 6 8 and 12 g were used to obtain the standard curves for each antibody Unless otherwise stated six micrograms of SPM protein which is within the linear range of the standard curves data not shown was chosen for the comparative study between the rdta and their littermate mice Western blotting The SPM proteins were separated by 7 5 SDS PAGE gels and subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes The blots were first blocked with 5 non fat dry milk in TPBS buffer PBS with 0 5 Tween 20 at RT for 1 hr and then incubated with 1 3000 dilution of anti actin Sigma St Louis MO 0 75 g ml of anti NR1 Chemicon Temecula CA 1 1000 dilution of anti NR2A Chemicon 0 35 g ml of anti NR2B Chemicon and 1 g ml of anti GluR1 Chemicon antibodies respectively at 4 C overnight After washing the secondary antibody conjugated with peroxidase was applied for 1 hr at RT The bands were visualized using a chemiluminescent detection system ECL Amersham Life Science Arlinton IL Each blot was assayed with the four antibodies stripping the membranes in between each assay Images of immunoblots were analyzed with a computerized image analysis system Alpha Innotec Co San Leandro CA The area of each immunolabeled band was calculated as the integrated density value IDV SigmaStat and SigmaPlot programs Jandel Scientific Software San Rafael CA were used to aid the analyses Comparative studies of protein expression in the retinae of rdta mice and their littermate controls were performed with a minimum of three independent groups of animals Back phosphorylation assay for GluR1 in the rdta retina This experiment was performed with two different procedures The first procedure is to study the in vitro phosphorylation and to determine the level of 32P ATP labeling in fluorographs The second procedure is the use of an antiGluR1 antibody and western blotting to confirm that 32P labeling contains GluR1 To determine if GluR1 phosphorylation by CaMKII in vivo is altered in the rdta retina the SPM proteins of the rdta retina and their littermate controls are back phosphorylated by endogenous CaMKII in the presence of Ca 2 CaM 1 mM CaCl 2 and 0 02 mg ml calmodulin The reaction mixture contains 50 mM PIPES pH 7 5 0 2 mg ml BSA 20 mM MgCl 2 50 M cold ATP and 0 04 Ci l 32P ATP The reaction was performed at 37 C for 3 min Basically if the result shows that GluR1 has a lower amount of 32P ATP labeling on the film it indicates that GluR1 has already been phosphorylated in vivo 71 To confirm that the 32P labeled signal on the film is GluR1 the blots were incubated with anti GluR1 antibody The immunolabeled bands were visualized with alkaline phosphatase conjugated secondary antibody using NBT BCIP enzyme substrate Chemicon Immunoprecipitation of GluR1 To provide further evidence for the presence of in vivo phosphorylation a second procedure was used Immunoprecipitation of GluR1 was performed after the back phosphorylation of retinal SPM proteins described above using an immunoprecipitation kit Protein G Boehringer Mannheim Indianapolis IN In this case 40 g SPM retinal proteins from normal and rdta mice were used The phosphorylation reaction was stopped by addition of a final concentration of 2 mM EGTA to chelate Ca 2 To block endogenous phosphatase activity 20 mM NaPPi was added The SPM proteins

with 1 g of anti GluR1 antibody and incubated at 4 C for 1 hour Five microliter of the protein G agarose was then added to each sample and incubated at 4 C overnight on a rocking platform The samples were washed two times with buffer 1 two times with buffer 2 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 5 500 mM NaCl 0 1 Nonidet P40 and 0 05 sodium deoxycholate and one time with buffer 3 50 mM Tris HCl pH 7 5 0 1 Nonidet P40 and 0 05 sodium deoxycholate After removing the last traces of the final wash from the agarose pellet 30 l of the sample buffer 0 125 M Tris 2 SDS 10 sucrose 5 2 mercaptoethanol and 0 02 bromophenol blue at a pH of 8 0 was added to each tube and the tubes were heated at 95 C for 5 minutes The supernatants were collected and subjected to a 7 5 SDS PAGE The gels were dried by vacuum at
