 Speech and Spillover The Supreme Court probably will overturn the notorious Communications Decency Act But the issues are not as cut and dried as some might suggest By Eugene Volokh 1 777 words posted Thursday July 18 to be composted Thursday July 25 One of the great recurring problems in free speech law is spillover Free speech the Supreme Court has held has limits Some speech is so harmful and so lacking in redeeming value that it may be restricted Threats blackmail and false advertising are obvious examples There s no right to say Your money or your life to a stranger in a dark alley there s no right to spread intentional falsehoods about your product or your enemy s character The Supreme Court likewise has held rightly or wrongly that minors have no right to see very sexually explicit material and that people except perhaps the minors parents have no right to distribute such material to them Psychologists and philosophers can debate this but as a constitutional matter the question is settled But it s often impossible to keep such materials from children without also denying them to adults Bookstores can check customers ages but TV broadcasters muralists or people who post things on the Internet can t The law can allow public display of this material protecting adults access but also making it available to children or the law can prohibit public display insulating children but also restricting adults Either way there s spillover Either the restriction spills over onto speech that should be free or the freedom spills over onto speech that in the judgment of most legislators voters and judges should be restricted This spillover problem is a recurring question in First Amendment law The law cannot restrict all harmful valueless speech and at the same time protect all valuable speech A classic illustration of the spillover problem is the Communications Decency Act passed earlier this year in an attempt to stop indecency on the Internet A three judge federal court was probably correct in striking down the CDA June 11 But the judges opinions don t squarely face the spillover problem Perhaps contrary to the suggestions of some Supreme Court cases spillover questions should always be resolved in favor of free speech Perhaps children s increased vulnerability is a price worth paying for extra freedom for adults But it s important to confront honestly both what s being lost and gained in the process The most controversial part of the CDA prohibits anyone from us ing an interactive computer service to display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age any comment request suggestion proposal image or other communication that in context depicts or describes in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards sexual or excretory activities or organs Virtually any sort of speech in the public areas of cyberspace is available to minors so the law really applies to all such areas including Web sites Internet newsgroups e mail discussion lists chat rooms and bulletin boards And patently offensive can cover a lot of territory Many profanities might be considered patently offensive descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs especially under the standards of some conservative communities Putting a David Mamet play on your Web site thus might be a crime The term patently offensive is vague enough that no one knows for sure but the wise user will take a conservative approach Given some recent Supreme Court decisions it seems unlikely that the vagueness alone would make the act unconstitutional But there s no doubt that the law s vagueness does indeed make it more likely to stifle someone s freedom of expression The CDA though ostensibly intended to protect children clearly has a spillover effect on adults Adults generally have the right to see material that s patently offensive There are two exceptions to this child pornography sexually explicit pictures made using child models and obscenity but both are much smaller categories than the CDA s indecency May the government in its quest to shield children restrict the online choices of grownups Or to look at it the other way Must the courts in order to protect the freedom of grownups restrict the government s ability to shield children The Supreme Court precedents are unclear In a 1957 case called Butler vs Michigan a state law barred distribution of material that might be unsuitable for minors The court concluded that such a ban was unconstitutional The law it said reduce d the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children Surely this is to burn the house to roast the pig The court agreed that the state could bar distribution of such stuff directly to children But clearly such limited restrictions don t work as well as a total ban The court apparently was willing to tolerate some perceived harm to children in order to protect the freedom of adults But in some recent cases the court has taken a different approach One such case is the oft criticized FCC vs Pacifica Foundation 1978 The Pacifica court upheld a ban on indecency George Carlin s Seven Dirty Words monologue on radio and television broadcasts when there is a reasonable risk that children may be in the audience The spillover was clear Adults were deprived of access to certain materials on certain media radio and television during most hours But the justices were willing to allow such a restriction of adults access to speech in order to shield children Pacifica is a narrow decision and there s language in it suggesting that it only applies to over the air broadcasting But in this year s cable indecency case known as Denver Consortium four Supreme Court justices were willing to use Pacifica as a guide for cable television as well as over the air broadcasting The CDA court s decision was written before Denver Consortium was handed down And during the last 10 years some lower courts have upheld bans on public display of sexually explicit material that s not technically obscene on the grounds that the law may shield children even if this keeps say a would be muralist from communicating to adults The Supreme Court hasn t spoken on these specific statutes Another important though somewhat ambiguous precedent is Sable Communications vs FCC 1990 in which the court struck down a ban on dial a porn The government argued the ban was needed to protect children But the court pointed out that there might be less restrictive alternatives that would insulate children without entirely banning the medium For example the court said the government could require services to take credit card numbers or require phone companies to let parents block area code 900 phone calls Still the court was willing to tolerate some spillover after all even the alternatives it suggested would deny access to some adults And it also hinted that it might even allow a total ban if such alternatives could be shown to be inadequate Denver Consortium followed the same pattern It struck down a restriction on indecent speech because there were other effective alternatives available but it suggested that such a restriction might be constitutional if it were in fact the only effective way to shield children Sable and Denver Consortium make clear that the court won t tolerate unnecessary spillover onto adults But on the tough question what happens if it s impossible to shield minors without burdening adults there s an unresolved tension Butler says that the speech must be allowed Pacifica Sable and now Denver Consortium suggest that the speech may be restricted On the Internet is it possible to shield children without restricting adults Parents can get software SurfWatch is one popular brand that keeps their computers from accessing any place that s on a list of dirty locations a list selected and frequently updated by the software designers If the government wanted to it could buy SurfWatch for a fraction of what it would cost to enforce the CDA and give it away to parents Could this be the less restrictive alternative that the government could use instead of CDA s total ban Well it depends on how much shielding of children you re willing to sacrifice The SurfWatch solution is limited by the software designers ability to keep up with the latest dirty places Dozens of Web sites are being added daily and you never know what will get posted tomorrow even on existing sites or newsgroups Some things will inevitably be missed The purely technological fix then is less restrictive than the CDA but it s also less effective The CDA of course won t be perfect either many will flout it and Web sites in other countries won t be bound by it but the ban plus the technological fix probably will shield children better than the technological fix alone Does this extra protection justify the considerable spillover The precedents don t answer this There s a hybrid technological and legal approach that might be more effective and thus more likely to be the sort of less restrictive alternative that would make the total ban invalid The law might demand that online material be rated that any sufficiently sexually explicit text or image be marked dirty in a way that computers can easily recognize Parents could then set up their children s computers to block access to these pages Alternatively the software could assume that any page is dirty unless it s labeled clean with the law making it illegal to falsely mark clean a page that s actually dirty Many people of course might misrate their material intentionally or accidentally But the CDA will be intentionally or accidentally violated too In fact a rating requirement might be more effective than a total ban People may be more willing to comply with the rating law since it would let them continue selling their wares or expressing their views Still ratings won t shield children using computers that don t have the rating software turned on And no one knows how often this will happen The CDA is now in the hands of the Supreme Court Some say the justices should simply rule that sexually explicit material isn t as dangerous for children as it s cracked up to be and therefore free speech should prevail But many people probably including the justices are willing to accept that sexually explicit material is indeed harmful to children Other CDA critics assert that the technological alternatives will shield children every bit as well as a total ban would and that the CDA therefore is entirely unnecessary But that too will be hard to prove Ultimately then the justices will have to make a hard choice sacrifice some shielding of children in order to protect the freedom of grownups or sacrifice some access by grownups in order to shield children My guess is that the marginal benefit of the CDA over the technological alternatives is small enough and the burden that the law creates is large enough that the CDA will be overturned But it s a closer question than many might think
