 Introduction Most primary malignancies spread systemically via lymphatic dissemination 1 For example the finding of axillary nodal metastases predicts a much shorter disease free survival in breast cancer 2 The total nodal tumor burden number of affected nodes and metastatic tumor volume affects prognosis even more severely 3 Accurate lymph node staging also remains a cornerstone in choosing the most appropriate therapy for a given stage Therapeutic intervention of metastatic lymph nodes 4 prophylactic radiation of frequently affected drainage routes 5 and systemic therapies 6 all have been shown to improve survival Genetic profiles identifying metastatic tumors 7 serum biomarkers and proteomic profiles are currently being developed to identify patients at risk 8 9 No direct genetic profile however has been demonstrated to date to accurately predict the presence of human nodal metastases in a given patient Rather surgical approaches such as sentinel lymph node biopsy or lymph node dissection are still commonly used Careful histological analysis includes mapping bisectioning and rapid staining in the frozen tissue laboratory Higher diagnostic accuracies can be achieved by serial sectioning 50 m and by immunohistochemical staining 10 11 Noninvasive imaging studies are commonly used during the workup of primary malignancies Typically lymph nodes are diagnosed by tomographic techniques computed tomography CT magnetic resonance imaging MRI as malignant when their short axis is 10 mm in size 12 Such size criteria however have been shown to be unreliable 13 Similarly the detection of cancer in nonenlarged occult nodes is often quite low by positron emission tomography PET and single photon emission computed tomography imaging For example small nodal metastases 5 mm are often missed by PET imaging in patients with breast cancer 14 More recently it has become possible to image anatomic regions at submillimeter resolutions by MRI with excellent spatial coverage and reduced motion artifacts The development 15 16 and clinical introduction of lymphotropic magnetic nanoparticles has been shown to significantly improve diagnostic accuracies of MRI for nodal staging LMRI in prostate cancer 17 These nanoparticles serve as probes for lymphatic anatomy and function and enhance tumor detection through abnormal distribution patterns in malignant nodes 17 18 Despite the advances of LMRI for cancer staging image analysis has been challenging and occasionally controversial Traditional analysis has been based on a reader s identification of certain structural abnormalities that can be variable given differences in acquisition parameters and interpretation criteria 19 20 21 Furthermore it has been challenging to quickly and accurately analyze large datasets generated by LMRI The goal of the current study was to develop and test technologies that would vastly improve the accuracy of current LMRI nodal staging Specifically we set out to a determine whether unique magnetic parameters existed and could be used for semiautomated image analysis and b whether the technique could be applied to different primary cancers Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis of tissue parameters validated against histopathology as an end point Methods Study Design The Institutional Review Board approved the current study and all patients signed informed consent The study was divided into a learning n 97 lymph nodes with known histopathology and a test dataset n 216 lymph nodes with known histopathology Table 1 Assignment into datasets was done in temporal fashion The learning dataset represented retrospective cases at outset of the study and the test dataset represented prospective cases collected during a 1 y interval In the learning set 55 of the nodes were benign and 45 of the nodes were malignant The learning dataset was obtained from 36 patients 24 male 12 female age 28 85 y mean 59 7 y with histologically proven primary genitourinary malignancies prostate 21 bladder 9 testes 5 ureter 1 All patients completed the MRI study and then underwent surgical resection n 26 and or nodal biopsy n 10 The investigated nodes had a mean short axis diameter of 10 5 mm range 3 39 mm The test dataset was obtained from 34 patients 25 male nine female age 30 82 y mean 58 9 y with histologically proven malignancies from different primaries Table 1 including prostate n 18 breast n 7 penile n 4 bladder n 2 testes n 2 and colon n 1 Seventy nine percent of the nodes were benign and 21 of the nodes were malignant The nodes in the test dataset had a mean short axis diameter of 10 0 mm range 3 39 mm Both datasets included the full spectrum of normal nodes to completely replaced nodes MRI MRI was performed at 1 5 T System 9X General Electric Medical Systems Milwaukee Wisconsin United States using phased array coils All images were archived on DICOM PACS servers MIPortal CMIR and Siemens Medical Systems Erlangen Germany and Impax RS 3000 AGFA Technical Imaging Systems Richfield Park New Jersey United States for subsequent analysis Images of the pelvis n 56 extended from the pubic symphysis to just above the level of aortic bifurcation In patients with primary testicular cancers n 7 imaging was extended superiorly to include the renal hilum and retroperitoneum In patients with breast cancer n 7 we obtained MR images of the bilateral axillae including the internal mammary and supraclavicular regions All patients were imaged with identical pulse sequences and timing parameters Imaging was performed before and 24 h after intravenous ferumoxtran 10 administration Combidex Advanced Magnetics Cambridge Massachusetts United States 2 6 mg Fe kg diluted in normal saline and infused over a 20

mm The above listed imaging sequences and parameters had previously been optimized to reduce motion artifacts maximize signal to noise ratio SNR and provide diagnostically useful images of the pelvis abdomen and chest within clinically acceptable time limits The T2 weighted fast spin echo sequence in a above was primarily used for qualitative nodal detection and hence a square pixel with more than one acquisition was obtained The two dimensional axial T1 weighted gradient echo sequence in b above was chosen to achieve adequate anatomical coverage within a short imaging time The axial dual echo gradient echo sequence in c above was developed specifically for this project to provide artifact free datasets for quantitative image analysis A matrix size of 160 256 was chosen for this sequence to achieve a balance between the upper limits for imaging time while reducing image noise Finally a 3D T1 weighted sequence was obtained in d above to provide a dataset for vascular maximum intensity projection MIP reconstructions Quantitative Image Analysis All image analysis was performed on archived DICOM images using different software packages e g custom built software such as CMIR Image MGH Boston Massachusetts United States Syngo Siemens Medical Systems Advantage Windows General Electric Medical Systems Lymph nodes were identified by readers who manually placed kernels onto each node for automated boundary detection and calculation of nodal dimensions and volumes The thus identified regions of interest ROIs encompassed the entire lymph node not only portions of it and were used for quantitative signal intensity SI measurements see Table 2 Serial measurements of nodal dimensions on different pulse sequences or time points varied less than 2 A number of quantitative tissue parameters were calculated either as differences between pre and postcontrast scans or as single value analysis on postcontrast scans see Table 2 The lymph node muscle LNM ratio was calculated by dividing signal intensities of an entire lymph node by that of adjacent muscle using a similar sized ROI drawn manually The nodal SI change was calculated by obtaining SI before and after contrast administration The nodal SNR was calculated by obtaining SD SD noise The T2 was calculated in nodal ROIs on dual TE images using CMIR Image T2 maps were constructed by performing fits of a standard exponential relaxation model S Ke TE T2 to the data on a pixel by pixel basis Only pixels with intensity greater than a threshold level 2X of noise were considered during the fitting process Pixel variance was obtained from post MR images Comparative visual analysis included short axis measurements and identification of heterogeneity large focal defects and central hyperintensity according to criteria previously established 12 17 To determine the diagnostic accuracy of the different tissue parameters in the learning dataset we determined sensitivity specificity and predictive values for each parameter alone and in combination Table 3 The most discriminatory parameters were then applied to the test dataset Table 4 In the final set of semiautomated image analysis 3D reconstructions were obtained for nodal mapping onto vascular anatomy using MIP projections While the MIP projections do not aid in the differentiation between malignant and benign lymph nodes they are invaluable in providing anatomic content to the dozens of lymph nodes identified In particular MIP images were generated interactively from postcontrast fat saturated volumetric interpolated breath hold images to outline vascular anatomy The evaluated lymph nodes characterized as benign or malignant by T2 variance analysis were then superimposed on the volumetric 3D images using customized software Advantage Windows General Electric Medical Systems Statistical Analysis Data were expressed as mean standard deviations SD and medians All statistical testing was performed using GraphPad Prism GraphPad Software San Diego California United States The significance between two individual groups was determined using the nonpaired Student s t test e g benign and malignant datasets in Figure 1 For the more discriminatory datasets alternative free response receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted Ratios for cut off single value parameters were defined to yield highest sensitivity and specificity Accuracy for a given parameter was expressed as the area under the curve A z and values are summarized in Table 4 Histology All lymph nodes were sampled histologically within 2 wk of the MRI mean 6 d range 2 14 d The analysis was done in surgically resected lymph nodes n 55 both benign and malignant nodes or in fine needle aspirates and core biopsies n 15 malignant nodes only implementing careful mapping procedures to correlate nodes Surgically excised nodes were sectioned at 10 20 m intervals after bihalving and were stained with hematoxylin eosin Results Learning Dataset The learning dataset consisted of 97 histologically validated lymph nodes from 36 patients with different primary malignancies see Table 1 The mean short axis diameter was 10 5 mm range 3 39 mm with 56 of the 97 nodes 58 3 measuring less than 10 mm that is below the traditional imaging cutoff for malignancy occult nodes Table 2 summarizes the incidence of different visual comparative before and after contrast administration and semiautomated postcontrast administration only parameters in the two different groups Figure 1 is a graphical representation of overlaps between malignant and benign groups for different parameters listed in Table 2 Table 3 summarizes sensitivities specificities and predictive values for the different quantitative imaging parameters Sensitivities of metastasis detection by visual image analysis ranged from 50 94 however often with lower specificities Volumetric measurements in particular were insensitive markers of malignancy in nonenlarged nodes see Table 3 In contradistinction image analysis of pre and postcontrast image sequences resulted in higher specificities and sensitivities see Table 3 Comparative differences between benign and malignant nodal groups were highest for T2 and pixel variance measurements see Table 3 Of all the semiautomated parameters tested alone T2 measurements showed the highest sensitivity 93 95 confidence interval 82 98 and specificity 94 95 confidence interval 84 99 in the learning dataset see Figure 1 and Table 3 Of all the semiautomated parameters tested in combination T2 measurements combined with pixel variance analyses postcontrast showed the highest sensitivity 98 95 confidence interval 88 99 and specificity 94 95 confidence interval 82 98 in the learning dataset Figure 1E Using the dual value analysis there was one malignant outlier in the benign dataset the lymph node was 3 mm in overall size with few malignant cells seen on histology and probably too small for analysis and two benign outliers in the malignant dataset both these nodes showed hyalinosis replacing more than 50 of the nodal architecture Test Dataset To determine whether feature extraction would be accurate for prospective nodal staging we utilized the above criteria against a larger test dataset encompassing 216 validated lymph nodes from 34 patients including different primaries see Table 1 The sensitivity specificity and predictive values of the most discriminatory parameters of this prospective analysis are summarized in Table 4 We primarily focused on semiautomated image analysis of postcontrast scans because of the high sensitivity and specificity determined in the learning dataset T2 measurements showed a sensitivity of 93 95 confidence interval 82 99 and a specificity of 91 95 confidence interval 85 96 Combined T2 and pixel variance analysis achieved a sensitivity of 98 95 confidence interval 88 99 and a specificity of 92 95 confidence interval 87 96 comparable to that of the learning set and much superior to currently used size criteria Using the dual value analysis there were two malignant outliers in the benign dataset both of these nodes were less than 3 mm in overall size and probably too small for analysis similar to the learning dataset and three benign outliers in the malignant dataset two of these nodes had hyalinosis replacing more than 50 of the nodal architecture and one had macrocalcifications More important all the misclassified nodes occurred in individual patients rather than in the same patient and hence did not affect the overall nodal staging on a patient by patient basis in this dataset Image Reconstruction Utilizing semiautomated feature extraction to identify lymph nodes and image analysis based on T2 and pixel variance we subsequently proceeded to map individual lymph nodes onto vascular anatomy in the different anatomic drainage patterns Figure 2 summarizes the different steps in image analysis Figure 3 and Video 1 shows an example of a 45 y old patient with colorectal cancer undergoing semiautomated nodal staging In this particular patient MRI identified six positive lymph nodes 10 mm each reconstructed as a 3D dataset whereas all positive lymph nodes were missed by PET scans Figure 4 and Video 2 show reconstructions and analyses from a patient with a breast cancer primary with bilateral nodal metastases Note the high spatial resolution allowing the detection of a 3 mm nodal metastasis Discussion We show that it is feasible to extract various quantitative tissue parameters to predict the likelihood of nodal metastases in vivo These results are highly relevant in cancer staging because they provide evidence that a quantitative tissue parameters enable diagnosis of lymph node metastases while reducing interobserver variability and b that semiautomated reconstructions allow spatially more extensive mapping than is currently possible Metastases to lymph nodes occur during growth of most primary malignancies and their presence mandates the need for more extensive and systemic therapy Nodal cancer staging currently relies on invasive procedures surgical lymph node dissection sentinel lymph node resection biopsy with significant morbidity and cost 22 23 or insensitive tomographic imaging methods 24 For example detection sensitivities using size criteria with state of the art multislice CT are as low as 50 whereas PET imaging of nonenlarged nodes has equally low sensitivities 14 Based on the observation that nanoparticulate solutions accumulate in nodal macrophages upon systemic injections 25 26 lymphotropic superparamagnetic preparations have been developed 16 In earlier clinical trials using lower spatial resolution sequences metastases of 1 2 mm have been detected 17 whereas as few as 1 000 tumor cells have been detected in nodes in experimental mouse models 18 Despite these advances it has been difficult to acquire images of sufficiently high resolution and to derive parameters to automate diagnosis The data presented here indicate that unique magnetic parameters allow identification of nodal metastases and accurate 3D reconstructions including surgically inaccessible lymph nodes The significance of the above findings is 3 fold First the ability to directly and noninvasively monitor nodal tumor involvement represents a powerful diagnostic tool for cancer Accurate staging represents the cornerstone for triaging patients to either localized or to more aggressive and systemic therapies Second the method described here was sensitive for the limited subsets of primary cancers tested It is reasonable to hypothesize that such analysis could be applied to staging of other common primaries In particular lung colorectal genitourinary and head and neck cancers could benefit from this staging procedure In addition to nodal staging the nanoparticle enhanced MRI can also be used to measure microvascularity in primary tumors 27 and to improve the detection of liver metastases 28 Third our results are significant because the semiautomated staging method is highly accurate and reduces variability in visual image analyses between different observers The LMRI staging technique is believed to be clinically relevant in several key areas First LMRI may play a significant role in avoiding unnecessary surgeries that is those in node positive patients Second since LMRI can detect lymph nodes outside traditional surgical fields this information may influence surgical approaches In colorectal cancer LMRI may provide a sentinel node like guide to staging Third it is likely that LMRI would be useful to identify appropriate patients to receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgery Currently neoadjuvant therapy is often reserved for postoperative patients once the nodal status has been determined Fourth LMRI may be particularly useful to guide radiation therapy by mapping the complete nodal status onto bony and vascular landmarks Finally LMRI could be used to avoid invasive diagnostic procedures which are not part of therapy For example LMRI could replace lymphangiography mediastinoscopy or endoscopic ultrasound for nodal staging Our findings have a number of direct implications for technology development and in clinical care Accurate measurements of T2 relies on motion artifact free multiecho pulse sequences that are not routinely available on clinical scanners at spatial resolutions required for nodal staging Such sequences will have to be implemented and combined with postprocessing tools to simplify and semiautomate analysis Similar software approaches are already used routinely in lung nodule characterization 29 or screening for breast cancers 30 We predict that in the case of LMRI such automation routines will be highly specific given the unique mechanism of image contrast As a proof of principle we implemented approaches to identify segment analyze and display nodal information While the current technology is already highly accurate we anticipate further improvements with hardware and software advances We hope that this will ultimately translate into clinical practice and replace unnecessary intervention
