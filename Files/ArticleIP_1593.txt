 The Nikes Jumped Over the Moon Cow produced by Jim Riswold Alice Chevalier and John Jay of Wieden Kennedy with animation assistance from Gordon Clark and Peter DeSeve of Wildbrain Animation House Cow is an animated fairy tale that targets the subteen who still responds to the child within But it is just as likely to engage the old folks of the athletic shoe market Gen Xers and the thirtysomethings As far as Nike is concerned anyone past these demographics is a retired consumer Naturally we never see a real shoe in this animated spot that would break its tone It opens instead with a cow grazing in a bucolic field Out of shape and shoeless this one is an eater not an exerciser Responding to the whistles and taunts of Old Man Moon she attempts to re enact the fairy tale and jump over the moon Leaping then falling Ooh says the moon she lies splayed on her feeding ground The fallen creature now responds to the strains of Destination Moon on the soundtrack Come and take a trip in my rocket ship And what is the rocket A Nike swoosh logo appears in a thought balloon over the animal s head The brand doesn t have to be mentioned In the age of the advertised image where television often seems more real than real life the Nike swoosh is ubiquitous The cow squeezes into the barn then races outside wearing Nikes We ll travel fast and light the song goes as the animal soars over Old Man Moon punching him so hard that he sees stars Cow s message isn t that Nikes are a substitute for working out Rather the spot tells you that if you wear the shoes and just do the rest you ll soar whether your moon be the NBA a three mile jogging path or a playground The high jumping bovine also reinforces Nike s core identification with basketball and the Bulls Michael Jordan And because the spot uses an animal excluding all references to race gender or a particular sport soccer kids in Beverly Hills are as likely to embrace it and the product as hoop shooters in Harlem The spot ends with the Nike slogan that is now as familiar as the swoosh Evoking freedom a safe rebellion Just Do It is the life affirming bookend to Nancy Reagan s Just Say No Cow recruits the next generation of Nike wearers by building a bridge between young people s innate sense of play and the next stage competition Shoes signify more than sports these days They stand for self image If young people do it now Nike knows they ll keep doing it later The fairy tale goes on Buy the shoes and jump the moon And it doesn t matter if it s all bull Robert Shrum
