 These Boots Are Made for Measuring Snowfall Hey Johnette Oh man you re going to get me started on those money grubbing old geezers from the IOC aren t you Oh well here goes I cringe when I hear someone refer to the Salt Lake City scandal because while the people from SLC weren t right the real culprits were the IOC members with their hands out palms up As you know I ve written at least a half dozen times that Juan Antonio Samaranch should resign Obviously he disagrees I can t believe that the sponsors and athletes are letting the IOC get away with this recent charade on ah hem reform Those new gadgets and gimmicks the IOC put into place so a scandal like last year s doesn t occur again are so much smoke and mirrors The IOC still runs everything even its new ethics commission The outside influence is minimal And yet the sponsors don t scream and stomp their feet they simply want it to go away and maybe in our hearts all of us do too For even as I cover the reform package and rant and rave about the IOC deception I say Get me to Sydney Get me to the Olympic trials Get me to the athletes and to their remarkable and emotional stories It s kind of like getting all worked up about what George Pataki is doing if you love Doug Flutie and the Buffalo Bills Pataki is to Flutie what Samaranch is to say Marion Jones A bureaucrat figurehead political guy But invisible on the field of play And of no interest to us whatsoever once the game or race begins This scandal did produce one of my favorite anecdotes of 1999 The IOC s crack investigator of all the bribe taking and other nonsense was Dick Pound IOC vice president from Canada One guy who got into big trouble on the bribe front was Phil Coles an IOC member from Australia And I might add a very good friend of Dick Pound s So Pound has to interrogate Coles to find out what he did and ultimately whether he stays or goes The question and answer session occurs in Lausanne Switzerland one afternoon When it ends everyone heads off to dinner And who does Pound go to dinner with Phil Coles I know it will shock you to find out that even as we speak Phil Coles is a member in good standing of the venerable International Olympic Committee Yeah the O J trial was bizarre but as far as I know Marcia Clark Judge Ito and Simpson never ever fought over a check at the dinner table As I said get me to Sydney get me to the opening ceremony and the torch and the hymns and I ll be fine Before I go I must share this Snowstorm of the Century media story A TV reporter standing in a suburban neighborhood yesterday Some people use yardsticks to measure how much snow we ve had I use little children Come here Michael This is Michael Here Michael hold this microphone Five year old kid takes microphone reporter picks up kid and plunks him down softly in the snow Then pulls kid right out and examines his boots According to Michael s boots we ve had about six inches Cheers Chris
