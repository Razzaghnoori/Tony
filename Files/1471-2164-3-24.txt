 Background High resolution genetic maps are essential to identifying and characterizing the gene s contributing to diseases that is they are essential for making the transition from positional cloning to the positional candidate approach If the physical order of markers used for linkage analysis is incorrect the position of the putative locus may at best be incorrect and at worst be found not to exist in the true interval We were hampered in our efforts to fine map the gene for the Blau syndrome because we were faced with an uncertain marker order in maps that had many inconsistencies The Blau syndrome MIM 186580 an autosomal dominant granulomatous disease of childhood is a rare familial granulomatous disease 1 Affected individuals typically display one or more of the following granulomatous inflammations that have variable age at onset acute anterior uveitis arthritis and skin rash The phenotype of the Blau syndrome resembles another multisystem granulomatous disorder Crohn s disease MIM 266600 and another autoimmune disease psoriasis MIM 177900 These three inflammatory diseases not only share phenotypic features but a subset of putative risk loci mapped to an overlapping region on chromosome 16 Of the several putative susceptibility loci for Crohn s disease 2 3 4 5 6 7 and psoriasis 8 the Crohn s locus on 16q between markers D16S409 and D16S419 56 1 65 6 cM from p terminus 5 and the psoriasis locus on 16q near D16S3110 8 overlap with the locus for the Blau syndrome Interestingly another autoimmune disease ankylosing spondylitis MIM 106300 also maps to chromosome 16q however it appears to map telomeric to the Blau syndrome interval 9 10 While our studies were in progress other groups detected mutations in the CARD15 gene for a subset of Crohn s disease patients and in three small Blau syndrome families 11 12 The lack of accurate maps is reflected in the position assigned to CARD15 in consecutive genome builds in that CARD15 should map to the 16q13 interval for Blau and Crohn s yet in build 27 it was mapped close to the p telomere of chromosome 16 In the current build 29 it is located correctly see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf Until the draft human genome is truly complete detailed regional physical maps will be indispensable for genetic studies Additional files 1 Physical map of the Blau syndrome interval showing BAC clone

indicate the three gaps in the BAC contig Click here for file We have previously reported that the Blau syndrome susceptibility region resided between D16S298 and D16S408 13 Here we generated a high resolution map extending from D16S3080 near D16S409 to D16S408 and placed four plausible candidate genes CES1 MMP2 MMP15 and SCYA17 in the map We also excluded the four candidate genes as the genes harbouring mutations causing the Blau syndrome Results High resolution RH map To generate a framework order of markers we used three RH panels Table 1 and the RHMAP program package We typed the GeneBridge 4 panel for 54 markers to verify that they occurred near or in the interval between D16S409 and D16S408 The G3 panel was typed for a total of 77 markers and the TNG panel for 83 markers The markers were clustered into linkage groups by two point analyses using RH2PT and a criterion of a lod score greater than or equal to 4 Multipoint analyses were performed on linkage groups as well as sparse linkage groups together with markers from other linkage groups Several multipoint maximum likelihood framework maps were constructed using the RHMAXLIK program of the RHMAP package and equal retention probabilities and the branch ordering scheme options which gives the highest probability of finding the correct order 14 The G3 RH map see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf provided an order for the construction of the BAC contigs Although the TNG panel generated a useful map there were unresolved regions where it appeared that the panel did not provide sufficient data to differentiate between alternative marker orders We merged the G3 and TNG data by establishing a G3 framework map that fixed the order of a subset of markers Clusters of close markers containing at least two G3 mapped markers were then mapped relative to one another using the TNG data By integrating the G3 and the TNG maps an overall contiguous RH map of the region between the markers D16S411 and D16S415 was constructed in which the marker order of most loci could be determined with a likelihood ratio of greater than 300 1 over the next most likely order data not shown BAC contig construction We carefully selected STSs from within or around the Blau candidate interval to screen two BAC libraries More than 130 STSs were chosen from those in known genes ESTs polymorphic microsatellite markers random genomic sequences and BAC end sequences present in databases Construction of a BAC clone contig was initiated by screening the CITB library with all the STS markers The clone contigs were constructed based on the common BACs identified by two or more markers using the RH map described above and the existing framework map resources as reference for ordering We initially identified 377 unique CITB clones with one or more STS hits from which a subset of 41 clones that contained at least two markers was used to construct 17 contig clusters see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf These 41 non redundant CITB clones in the contigs covered less than 50 of the broad Blau syndrome interval The remaining 336 CITB clones were redundant in that they either were identified by a single marker or were identified by the same markers as the 41 non redundant clones Gaps in the contigs were closed by a combination of DNA sequence alignments of BESs with HTGS data clone walking using RNA probes from end clones to hybridize to the RPCI 11 gridded filters and verification of clone positions by PCR for STSs From the BAC contigs eight clones from both ends of the contig clusters were selected for sequencing using T7 and SP6 primers Sequence alignments with these 16 end sequences revealed that two sequences CITB_361N2 T7 and CITB_520M7 SP6 identified one common clone from the online HTGS which was RPCI 11_147B17 Figure 1 BES alignment was a very feasible and practical technique for filling in the gaps with the availability of an ever increasing number of BAC clone sequences in online databases Using this approach one gap between marker D16S2986 and Cda11d08 was closed STS marker D16S2986 was initially used to search the HTGS data and one clone RPCI 11_357N13 was retrieved with 100 identity BES from clone 357N13 was then used to repeat the alignment searches and identified another clone RPCI 11_488J11 which overlapped STS markers Cda11d08 and WI 16741 Two rounds of clone walking were carried out in order to either close the gaps or verify the order of the clone contigs All the plasmid DNAs from these clones were isolated and completely digested by Hind III into linear fragments for run off transcription Since RNA probes were directly transcribed from human genomic sequence it was necessary to test the probes for repetitive sequences The presence of repetitive sequences can hinder the specific identification of BAC clones from the library filters Of 44 probes tested three probes produced multiple bands with the genomic DNA indicating that they contained repetitive sequences and were therefore excluded from further analyses We identified more than 400 clones from the RPCI 11 library of which 83 were incorporated see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf After one round of clone walking the physical map covered more than 80 of the broad Blau syndrome interval A second round increased coverage to greater than 90 Three unresolved gaps remain in the physical map see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf Comparison of BAC contig to other maps We compared our map to the current July 1 2002 contigs generated by fingerprinting and available from the FPC database at Washington University Genome Sequencing Center The FPC database has few clones from the CITB library and none that corresponded to the clones on our map see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf Of 83 RPCI 11 clones in our contigs 63 were present in the FPC database 1 was not placed on a contig 6 were placed on contigs of different chromosomes and 56 in three chromosome 16 contigs ctg16020 ctg16021 and ctg16024 The gap between ctg16020 and ctg16021 corresponds to gap 1 see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf FPC contig ctg16020 is oriented q telomere to centromere i e reversed with respect to our map One clone 420D3 was placed in ctg16020 however our data suggest it should be in ctg16020 close to 122K22 and 444I18 Our data also reversed the order of clones 380E14 210K18 and 535L14 in ctg16020 Aside from one minor difference with respect to clone 444I18 that our data place slightly closer to the q telomere the remaining 37 clones of contig ctg16021 that were common to both maps agreed very well There was a single clone in ctg16024 463J22 that our data place in ctg16021 near 228I15 Interestingly one of the clones 327F22 that was placed on a contig from a different chromosome was the clone that contains all or part of CARD15 The NCBI build current at the time our map was being finalized was build 25 see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf There were a large number of discrepancies between our map and the build 25 map The gene subsequently characterized as having mutations in Blau syndrome families was not in the interval The discrepancies largely remained until builds 28 and 29 Build 29 the current build of NCBI agrees very well with our map see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf Candidate genes Four genes CES1 MMP2 MMP15 and SCYA17 with relevant biochemical functions based on the literature and with map locations in the broad Blau susceptibility region as defined by our initial DNA linkage study for the Blau syndrome 13 were considered as candidates CES1 is expressed in mature monocytes and macrophages and is involved in the degradation of xenobiotics 15 MMP2 or MMP15 or both are connective tissue degrading enzymes 16 A hypothetical role for MMP2 and MMP15 in the Blau syndrome is that aberrant expression of MMP2 and MMP15 could inappropriately degrade connective tissue which in turn could release stored cytokines and inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukins and potentially expose neo epitopes SCYA17 is a member of the CC group of chemokines that is involved in immunoregulatory and inflammatory processes 17 18 19 It is a chemoattractant for T lymphocytes and is expressed constitutively in thymus and transiently in stimulated peripheral blood monocytes 20 Interestingly high levels of expression of SCYA17 were observed in lipopolysaccharide stimulated human monocytes 21 Sekiya et al 22 showed that SCYA17 potentially played a role via a paracrine mechanism in the development of allergic respiratory diseases Thus inappropriate topical expression of SCYA17 could induce a localized immune or auto immune response A total of 13 sequence variants were identified in the promoter region of the CES1 gene Table 2 by sequencing 33 members from the Blau families Seven thirteen marker haplotypes could be assigned unambiguously Table 3 using extended pedigree structures data not shown however none of them was associated with the Blau syndrome phenotype The CES1 gene was therefore excluded as a candidate for the Blau syndrome RH mapping of CES1 and MMP2 placed them close and centromeric to D16S408 see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf whereas MMP15 and SCYA17 mapped telomeric to D16S408 The MMP15 locus was placed between D16S408 and D16S494 using the GeneBridge 4 RH panel CES1 and MMP2 were mapped to clones in the BAC contigs see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf whereas SCYA17 and the markers Cda1jb12 and R55777 were mapped to the BAC clones CITB_387I12 CITB_437K19 and CITB_229H3 which map 1 1 Mbp telomeric to D16S408 according to the NCBI human genomic data data not shown Our own RH distance estimates also place these markers more than 1 Mbp telomeric to D16S408 In our G3 RH map CES1 was located outside a subsequently refined Blau syndrome interval that excluded several cM centromeric to D16S408 thus confirming the lack of association between CES1 haplotypes and the disease phenotype Mutations were characterized in the gene CARD15 for a few small families with the Blau syndrome 11 12 We have characterized additional mutations in Blau syndrome families however only five of ten families had mutations in the exons and flanking sequences X Wang H Kuivaniemi G Bonavita L Mutkus U Mau E Blau N Inohara G Nunez G Tromp and C J Williams in press The gene was located in the approximate interval both cytologically and on the Santa Cruz map http genome ucsc edu cgi bin hgGateway db hg10 but was located on chromosome 16p on the NCBI map builds 25 to 28 We verified the location of CARD15 on our map by amplifying a 444 bp fragment of exon 4 from clone 327F22 in our map see additional data file 1 blau_map pdf Discussion Correct marker order and intermarker distance are essential for linkage analysis and therefore require construction of accurate physical and genetic maps Here we employed BAC contig and RH mapping to construct a high resolution physical map which spans approximately 7 5 Mbp of chromosome 16 between markers D16S3080 and D16S408 This map will definitely assist in the refinement of the Blau syndrome locus as well as other loci mapping to this region such as Crohn s disease 5 psoriasis 8 and possibly ankylosing spondylitis 9 10 We constructed a high resolution RH map likelihood ratio of greater than 300 1 over the next likely order with the medium resolution G3 and high resolution TNG whole genome RH panels Figure 1 This map allowed ordering of the polymorphic markers and estimation of the distances between them The marker order provided the basis for construction of the BAC contig The intermarker distances estimated from RH data were substantiated by the BAC contig data when the average length of the BAC inserts was used to estimate intermarker distances Our BAC contig provides more than 90 coverage of the entire Blau susceptibility region The STS based high resolution physical contig consists of 124 BACs and spans approximately 7 5 Mb as estimated from the number of BACs in the shortest tiling path and the average insert length of the BACs We have used our map to refine the Blau syndrome interval X Wang H Kuivaniemi G Bonavita L Mutkus U Mau E Blau N Inohara G Nunez G Tromp and C J Williams in press Another BAC contig map of chromosome 16q constructed by two dimensional overlapping oligonucleotide overgo hybridization on high density BAC filters has been published 23 This map consists of 828 overgo markers and 3 363 BACs providing 85 coverage of the long arm of chromosome 16 This contig map however does not cover the entire Blau syndrome region it ends at the site of marker D16S2758 in our physical contig see additional data file 1 The order for most of the markers is the same on the two independently generated maps Nevertheless there are a few differences For example Han et al 23 mapped the marker D16S2950 in the order of D16S2623 D16S2950 and D16S744 with the markers equidistant at approximately 130 kbp We found the order to be D16S2623 D16S744 and D16S2950 with interval of approximately 130 kbp and 500 kbp respectively Also the Han et al 23 map has six regions in the Blau susceptibility interval which are either spanned with tenuous support or none at all Two are real gaps with no overlapping clones and the other four are spanned by few clones that have either unusually long inserts or are missing some of the markers in the interval or both Our contig also contains three gaps that we were unable to close by clone walking One of them corresponds to one of the six gaps in the Han et al 23 map The other two are located in the region between markers D16S2758 and D16S408 which is not covered by Han et al 23 The common gap in both physical contigs indicates either a lack of STS markers in this region or an under representation of clones even though two libraries were used in our study or both We estimate from RH data that the three gaps are only 425 530 and 375 kbp in size and will not substantially affect DNA linkage analyses The first gap see additional data file 1 is also present in the FPC contigs between ctg16020 and ctg16021 whereas the other two have been filled in Conclusions We generated a high resolution physical map from D16S3080 near D16S409 and D16S408 16q12 1 to 16q13 because the correct marker order was required for further linkage studies with Blau syndrome families A physical map was also necessary to locate or verify the location of candidate genes Although there were substantial discrepancies as to the location of markers and genes at the time we initiated our mapping project and even when this physical map was assembled into a final draft the current NCBI map based on build 29 the FPC contigs and the map produced here agree remarkably well The convergence of three independently constructed maps based on different approaches suggests that the current maps are reliable will perhaps undergo minor changes and will be useful for mapping of disease loci to the interval Materials and Methods PCR of STS markers Primer pairs for most of the STS markers were purchased from Research Genetics and some primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc All test PCRs were carried out using 30 ng of template DNA with 1 5 l GeneAmp 10 PCR buffer II Roche Molecular Systems Inc either 1 5 mM or 3 0 mM Mg 2 200 M dNTPs 0 2 M each forward and reverse primer and 0 375 units of AmpliTaq Gold Polymerase Roche Molecular Systems Inc in a 15 l final volume PCRs were performed in a model 9600 Thermocycler Perkin Elmer Cetus using the following cycling protocol initial denaturation at 94 C for 10 min 94 5 C for 1 min 55 60 C for 1 min 72 C for 40 s for 35 cycles followed by a final extension at 72 C for 3 min PCR products were analyzed on 2 agarose gels Genotyping with polymorphic di tri or tetranucleotide repeat markers was performed by PCR according to the conditions used in the test PCRs above except that one of the primers was 32P labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase Products were separated on 7 denaturing polyacrylamide gels with or without 50 formamide Sequagel 6 or Accugel 19 1 National Diagnostics Construction of a RH map The Whitehead Institute GeneBridge 4 and Stanford G3 and TNG whole genome RH panels Research Genetics were used to construct a RH map Before typing the hybrid panels the PCR conditions for STS markers were determined using hamster and human genomic DNA as control templates PCR products were separated on agarose gels PCRs with a band of appropriate size were considered positive and scored as 1 negative PCRs as 0 and ambiguous PCRs with bands of unexpected size as 2 The GeneBridge 4 RH map was constructed using a publicly available server at the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology The G3 and TNG maps were generated using the RHMAP 3 0 program package 14 The RH2PT program was used initially to determine two point lod scores and all the markers were divided into different linkage groups Markers in different linkage groups were used to carry out maximum likelihood calculations to estimate breakage probabilities and distances between markers using another program RHMAXLIK We established a G3 framework map of a subset of approximately evenly spaced markers Additional markers were mapped in overlapping sets with G3 panel data until the likelihood ratio dropped below threshold Clusters of closely spaced markers around framework markers were then mapped using the TNG data and RHMAXLIK Map orders were verified by performing independent estimations of likelihood but including markers from adjacent clusters Screening of BAC libraries A BAC library CITB which was generated at the California Institute of Technology in the form of DNA pools arranged in microtiter plates was purchased Research Genetics This library offers approximately six fold coverage of the whole genome with an average insert size of 130 kbp The library is comprised of 147 456 distinct recombinants For rapid screening DNAs from the clones had been pooled into 48 superpools each representing eight 384 well plates that were pooled into eight plate pools 16 row pools and 24 column pools PCR based screening consisted of identifying positive superpools followed by screening of the appropriate plate row and column pools Typically the three dimensional screening identified one or more unique BAC clones from the 3 072 BAC clones in a superpool Occasionally multiple positives in a single plate plate row column resulted in non unique positives these also generated false positives PCRs were performed as described above except that 1 l of pooled BAC library DNA was used as template and the annealing temperature for most markers was raised to 60 C to achieve greater specificity High density filters of the Roswell Park Cancer Institute human RPCI 11 BAC clones were purchased from BACPAC Resource Center at the Children s Hospital Oakland Research Institute in Oakland CA Segments 1 and 2 of RPCI 11 with a total of 218 995 colonies corresponding to approximately twelve fold genomic coverage were used The filters were screened iteratively by hybridization with pools of RNA probes prepared from the ends of BAC clones identified either by PCR screening or prior rounds of hybridization Hybridizations were performed using ULTRAhyb buffer Ambion and components of the Strip EZ RNA kit Ambion Prior to pooling the probes were tested individually for the presence of repetitive elements by Southern hybridization to the parent BAC DNA and complete Hin d III digests of human DNA Probes that demonstrated a pattern consistent with the presence of repetitive elements were excluded Field inversion gel electrophoresis FIGE To determine the size of important BAC inserts 2 g of BAC DNA was first digested with 10 units of Not I New England Biolabs DNA fragments were then separated on 1 pulsed field certified agarose gel Bio Rad in 0 5 GTBE buffer 0 5 TBE 0 1 M glycine by FIGE with a PC 750 Pulse Controller Hoefer Scientific Instruments The samples were prerun at 12 C and 8 V cm for 1 h and then run continuously for 17 h with forward pulse 1 2 s reverse pulse 0 4 s and timing ramp 0 8 h A Low Range PFG Marker 0 13 194 kbp New England Biolabs was used for estimation of BAC insert sizes After electrophoresis the gel was stained with ethidium bromide visualized and photographed with a GelPrint2000i system BioPhotonics Verification of positive BAC clones Screening for BAC clones either by PCR of pooled DNA or by hybridisation produced a wide range of signal intensities Although differences in signal intensity may be considered as a measure of the evidence for the clones positions in the contig the variability of input target DNA made the conclusions unreliable Positive clones were therefore rescreened by PCR with STS markers in the vicinity to eliminate false positive Positive clones were purchased from Research Genetics and colony blot filters were prepared using a Biomek 1000 Automated Laboratory Workstation with a 96 pin replicator Beckman Coulter The gridded colony blots were screened with individual RNA probes from the pools above All positive clones were confirmed by PCR with appropriate primer pairs Preparation of RNA probes from the ends of BAC clones BAC DNAs from standard alkaline lysis preparations 24 were completely digested with Hin d III RNA probes were synthesized from the ends of clones by run off transcription using the Strip EZ RNA kit Ambion and 32P UTP ICN Radiochemicals Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by size exclusion chromatography on RNase free Sephadex G 50 Sigma spin columns Candidate genes Four genes namely CES1 MMP2 MMP15 and SCYA17 were selected based on their biochemical function and physical map locations prior to completion of our high resolution map DNA sequences for the four genes were obtained from GenBank accession numbers for CES1 D21077 MMP2 U96098 MMP15 Z48482 SCYA17 AC004382 Primers to be used in PCR for each gene were designed using the Wisconsin Package Version 10 0 Genetics Computer Group and synthesized by Operon Technologies Inc PCR conditions other than annealing temperature used were the same as described above The physical locations of the four genes studied were verified by using RH panels as described below Their locations were further refined by screening a BAC library as discussed below using gene specific PCR primers MMP15 and SCYA17 were located telomeric to D16S408 and thus outside the Blau syndrome interval and were excluded from further studies MMP2 was placed outside of a refined Blau syndrome interval that excluded several cM centromeric from D16S408 A 755
