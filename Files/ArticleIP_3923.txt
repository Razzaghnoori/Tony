Alfred Gingold s July 10 article Onward Christian Clothiers my first reaction was that ol Alfie should take a breath Who doesn t go through everyday life and see things that disturb one s aesthetic sense Our culture is a sloganeering one Why should Christianity be any different Every company s marketing strategy has an underlying secondary message drink Mountain Dew and you re extreme buy Tommy Hilfiger Gingold s example and you re young attractive and not afraid to look like every other frat boy in the country My guess is that Gingold doesn t get out of New York much Here in the Bible Belt we ve learned to desensitize ourselves to the crass underbelly of organized religion My daughter comes home from school and tells me that other kids have come up with alternative meanings to the WWJD acronym We Want Jelly Doughnuts Willy Wonka Just Died etc There will always be people who wear this crap and others who get to make fun of them Fair trade Edward Goggin Tulsa Okla I ll Take the Bait I was offended by the article Onward Christian Clothiers even though I am not religious The idea that someone wearing their religion on their sleeve is someone to be looked down upon is anti American at best I am happy that people of faith are finally coming out of the closet so to speak Articles like this one invite reactionism which is I suppose what the writer wants Too bad Matt Denny Double Standards I find it interesting that Alfred Gingold in Onward Christian Clothiers doesn t have a problem with pro abortion T shirts or vulgar T shirts shit happens coed nude basketball bitch on wheels etc but finds it necessary to tee off on evangelical Christian apparel Why do overtly Christian messages bother him so much Could it be that the claims of Christ make him uncomfortable It seems that the only time liberals get excited about censorship is when it comes to preaching Jesus Hmm Jim Ost Get With It Ye of Little Faith Regarding Onward Christian Clothiers I often wonder if the peddlers of religious schlock have actually read any Scripture beyond the gory here s hell in your face passages But please The Christians are at it again There is more to Christianity than the Christian right both Roman Catholic and evangelical fundamentalist The broad brush paints a picture of self righteousness whoever wields it A great many of us witness to a faith of grace not judgment and do it with grace not judgment The Rev Paul W Sundberg Who Gives a F About Tina Brown Now I m well aware that it s Tina Brown s world and the rest of us are just living in it but really folks enough s enough Slate s coverage of Brown s departure to La La Land has been a tad shall we say excessive It was bad enough that the subject was covered ad nauseam and I mean ad nauseam in The Breakfast Table this week and treated as a serious news development in Culturebox But when I saw this morning s teaser Slate s Tina Brown Roundup I had to wonder whether you people have lost all perspective Perhaps I m wrong and other readers are as endlessly fascinated with Brown as Slate itself is But I suspect many agree with me that Brown s job change is essentially an industry insider story that holds little interest for those of who 1 don t work in the magazine trade and 2 don t hang in New York s trendier circles L affaire Brown was worth maybe one story in Slate When you reach the point of needing a roundup you might want to re examine your editorial priorities Justin McGuire Washington And Who Gives a F About Linda Tripp s Motives I am at a loss to explain the media s and public s desire to understand the motives behind Linda Tripp s tape recordings as exemplified in the Linda Tripp Victimized or Vicious dialogue between Jonah Goldberg and Margaret Carlson What do her motives matter in the context of either the investigation of the president or the investigation into her own taping The importance of Tripp s motives is not the same as for say Paula Jones because Tripp is not the president s accuser She has passed along tape recordings that allegedly implicate the president by the words of a third party Now whether Lewinsky s words are truth and whether they were drawn out through Tripp s entrapment which would also be on the tapes are valid issues But not Tripp s motives in making the recordings Maybe she s good and maybe she s bad Maybe you or I would not tape a friend or maybe we think that Tripp s friendship is not what we would call friendship but her motives in making the tapes are irrelevant to the charges against the president While I have been a staunch Clinton supporter and to some extent defender the fact that we are allowing our debate over Tripp s character and motives to enter into our debate over whether the president perjured himself or encouraged others to do so shows the effectiveness of the White House spin doctors Please stop worrying about Tripp s motives if there is a debate over this it is a debate over the limits of friendship when confronted with potentially criminal acts on the part of the friend This is a valid question but Tripp s morals per se are irrelevant Stop wasting your editorial bandwidth and reporters time on this Phil Gilbert Austin Texas Proto Nerds In his July 11 piece Nerd vs Nebbish Franklin Foer presents a few alternative explanations for the origin of the word nerd When I was an undergraduate at Rennselaer Polytechnic Institute about 30 years ago it was widely believed that knurd the pronunciation was the same was simply drunk spelled backward The usage was similar to current usage A knurd was someone who spent too much time studying and not enough time socializing This was in sharp contrast to the stereotypical frat boys who in a time when the word party was exclusively a noun would consume excessive amounts of alcohol as part of their recreational activities The two campus archetypes were considered to be such polar opposites that the word knurd emerged In those days in addition to the ill fitting permanent press clothes that didn t seem to work the pocket protector and the thick glasses held together with electrical tape the proto knurd wore a slide rule on his belt The stereotype was so pervasive and pejorative that even at RPI one seldom actually saw a belt mounted slide rule a pocket protector or glasses repaired with tape I have seen evidence of this usage and spelling in old campus humor magazines dating back to the 40s and 50s I don t have any explanation for the current spelling Eugene Bryton Los Angeles Blond Roots Anne Hollander who wrote Clothes Sense must be either very young or very something to miss the roots so to speak of the not quite blond bombshell phenomenon You don t have to go back to the 15 th century although I m sure some people find that stuff amusing or to Dennis Rodman whom nobody finds amusing The modern origin of this look is none other than Debbie Harry Blondie For Christ s sake Look it up Pete Ostle Trashing Recycled Maybe William Saletan could do a spin analysis of how Slate reposts Recycled stories and labels them new While it s true that recycling generally means finding a new use for something previously used to slap a new label on a story written a year or more ago takes a certain bending of reality Is this a low cost means for creating the appearance of beefed up content I would much prefer that Slate cough up the dough for one more new new story each week Michael Page English Oak Harbor Wash Combat Readiness I read with interest Lawrence Korb s July 10 statement in The 21st Century Military that Reserve ground combat units at the brigade level and above cannot be maintained at any reasonable level of readiness on a part time basis because of the complexity of combined arms He accurately states the current situation for U S Reserve and National Guard combat units He also implies that it would be impossible to maintain combat readiness in such units I believe this is wrong The current Army Reserve and guard units typically conduct their training one weekend each month and two weeks each year For combat and combat support units the weekend training is usually a waste of time In my six years as a member of a U S Army Reserve military intelligence battalion in the 1980s we did useful field training on at most a dozen of the more than 60 weekend drills I attended Even on those occasions most of the time was spent traveling to and from the training areas The two weeks annual training was much more useful but even that gave us at most a week of field training since there were several days of preparations for the move to the training site and several more days of equipment cleanup after training I believe that reserve and guard combat and combat support units should eliminate the weekend drills and instead have a single one month annual training AT The benefits of this would be to Increase the number of effective field training days from seven to 23 This assumes that the number of preparation and cleanup days could be kept the same Reduce the effect of personnel turnover In a 12 man unit about every four months we lost a person due to enlistment expiration and gained a person There was no way to set up a stable team to build skills because we constantly had to train someone new in the basic tasks During AT the teams could be restructured once at the beginning and then remain stable through the remaining portion of training Reduce the geographic dependence of units Since unit members must go to weekend drills every month they must be close enough to the reserve center With a single AT even personnel from across the state or country could be flown out and back once a year to the reserve center Estimated cost to fly 400 000 reservists at 500 each is 200 million The cost could be even less if Air Force Reserve units transported the Army reservists and not every reservist would have to be flown The cost would also be offset by the lower personnel costs 30 days pay instead of the 60 days pay the typical reservist receives each year Please note that I am not advocating a change to the training for combat service support maintenance personnel and logistics units Many of these units are able to conduct meaningful training on weekend drills since their training does not rely as heavily on being in the field
