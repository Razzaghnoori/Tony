 A Preliminary Version of this Paper was Presented at The Evolving Structure of Postal and Delivery Industries June 11 14 1997 Helsing r Denmark Sponsored by Center for Research in Regulated Industries at Rutgers University AN ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL FOR CREAM SKIMMING IN THE U S RESIDENTIAL DELIVERY MARKET Robert H Cohen William W Ferguson John D Waller Spyros S Xenakis Office of Rates Analysis and Planning U S Postal Rate Commission October 1998 Published in Emerging Competition in Postal and Delivery Systems edited by M A Crew and P R Kleindorfer Boston Kluwer Academic Publishers 1999 An Analysis of the Potential for Cream Skimming in the U S Residential Delivery Market A Introduction Postal administrations often claim that without a legal monopoly1 to protect them from cream skimming they would not be able to continue providing universal service at uniform and affordable prices Because they serve delivery points with a range of profitability postal administrations fear that without monopoly protection cream skimmers would capture their high profit routes leaving them with their less profitable routes The question is would cream skimming divert so much volume that universal service at affordable prices becomes infeasible Sweden is the only industrial nation which actually has had competition in its letter mail market after abolishing its monopoly 2 A competitor City Mail has served selected portions of the country but was twice forced into bankruptcy 3 City Mail has again emerged from bankruptcy and is competing with Sweden Post Perhaps on City Mail s third attempt we will finally have a valid test of whether Sweden Post actually needs monopoly protection in order to provide universal service at reasonable prices As far as the authors know the economics of the competition between Sweden Post and its competitor has not been studied If City Mail finally succeeds in avoiding bankruptcy such a study might determine the reasons why Sweden Post was vulnerable to cream skimming In addition it might describe the impact that a viable competitor has had on 1 In the U S as in most industrial nations the postal monopoly extends only to letter mail including addressed advertising 2 Finland has abolished its monopoly and in so doing created a licensing system for competitors to Finland Post No other operator has yet begun to offer service in competition with Finland Post New Zealand has also just recently abolished its monopoly but it is too early to know if competitors will emerge and be successful 3 A recent study found that the Swedish Postal Service had engaged in a variety of anti competitive practices with respect to its competitor See Deregulation of the Postal Service s Market report on the abuse by the Postal Office of Its dominant market position and on the Competition Authority s handling of the question of competition in relation to the Post Office Professor Erik Nerep Stockholm School of Economics February 1995 the dominant provider It should be noted that the presence of City Mail has already prompted Sweden Post to lower prices for large volume mailers in areas served by its competitor 4 Cream skimmers take advantage of an incumbent s price when it is based on an average of heterogeneous costs They serve the low cost portion of the market and price below the incumbent Conceptually cream skimming has two basic dimensions product and geography Product cream skimming is where a competitor tries to capture the most profitable portion of the market for a product with heterogeneous costs Geographic cream skimming is where a competitor tries to provide a service only to selected low cost areas 5 City Mail is an example of geographic cream skimming Its carriers provide twice weekly delivery to various areas in Sweden for large volume customers 6 This paper addresses only geographic cream skimming 7 Postal monopolies like most other legal monopolies are thought by many observers 1 to be technically inefficient and 2 to have delivery functions which exhibit economies of scale 8 This paper addresses several questions which arise from these two points under the assumption that the monopoly and any other barriers to entry were to be removed It asks how much more efficient would a potential competitor have to be to overcome the scale economies of the U S Postal Service Assuming potential competitors are able to achieve the necessary level of efficiency it then asks how much volume might they be able to capture and in which markets Finally it asks what effect 4 It would be interesting to learn How much it cost Sweden Post to serve the areas where it lowered prices relative to its average cost how important the abandonment of universal pricing is to Sweden Post s competitive position and are the circumstances in Sweden applicable to the U S Section J of this paper examines this issue further 5 Cream skimming may have a third dimension having to do with transactions costs In practice cream skimmers may restrict themselves to large volume customers since the transaction costs of dealing with smaller volume customers and individuals may be prohibitive 6 Sweden Post delivers five days per week 7 A report by the General Accounting Office GAO at least partially analyzed the effect product cream skimming would have on the U S Postal Service Its assessment was as follows Priority Mail First Class over 11 ounces high risk of loss of significant volumes but a low financial impact if it did occur First Class low risk of loss of significant volumes but a high financial impact if it did occur Advertising Mail low risk of loss and a medium financial impact if it did occur See Postal Service Reform Issues Relevant to Changing Restrictions on Private Letter Delivery General Accounting Office September 1996 8 In the U S legal monopolies include the local delivery of electricity gas water and until recently telephone would the loss of volume to cream skimmers have on the resulting prices the Postal Service would have to charge in order to maintain universal service Many observers believe that cream skimmers in the United States would serve cities and leave rural areas to the universal service provider because they assume that the cost of delivery to rural areas is much higher than the cost of delivery to cities An earlier study9 challenged that assumption It estimated that in 1989 city delivery cost per piece was only 8 percent lower than rural delivery but that city delivery cost per delivery point was actually 7 percent higher than rural delivery cost It concluded that there was no cross subsidy of rural delivery by city delivery In theory cream skimming of residential service could occur in either city or rural areas This paper focuses on city delivery because of the more detailed data available on this type of delivery We first provide a brief description of the current competition in delivery We then describe the data used in our analysis and the costs and profitability of the Postal Service s city residential delivery routes We next examine the volume vulnerable to capture by potential cream skimmers We describe characteristics of routes most likely to be profitable to competitors and provide a range of estimates for the cost of cream skimmers After examining the consequences of successful cream skimming on Postal Service rates we explain why cream skimming is not likely to be successful on business routes in the U S Finally we provide some observations on the relevance this analysis may have for other countries B Current Competition In Delivery Competitors of the U S Postal Service may legally deliver only periodicals catalogues over 24 pages parcels and unaddressed letters 10 Alternative delivery is particularly difficult because of the so called mail box law which prohibits any one but the 9 See Cohen Ferguson Xenakis Rural Delivery and the Universal Service Obligation A Quantitative Investigation Regulation and the Nature of Postal Delivery Services Ed Crew Kleindorfer Kluwer Academic Publishers 1993 Technically the U S monopoly is primarily a revenue monopoly A third party may deliver a letter if proper postage is affixed and canceled The monopoly also has an urgent mail exception for letters which are charged twice normal First Class postage with a minimum of 3 00 Unlike most industrial nations there is no exemption from the monopoly based on weight or price Postal Service from accessing a private mail box 11 The U S Postal Service broadly interprets letter to include any addressed information recorded on a physical object Thus for example it considers an addressed grocery store advertisement to be a letter In 1989 Publishers Express was founded by Time Inc Meredith Corp American Express Publishing New York Times Co Times Mirror Co and R R Donnelley among others to provide alternative delivery 12 In spite of its prestigious sponsorship the company ceased operations in 1996 Many other small entrepreneurs provide alternative delivery but they have a very small share of the market They are scattered around the country and mostly deliver unaddressed saturation advertisements and small quantities of periodicals and small parcels The real alternative delivery system in the United States is the newspaper industry which delivers advertising preprints or inserts 13 The Postal Service has the advantage of being able to deliver these advertisements to all addresses while newspapers usually but not always deliver inserts just to their subscribers A typical newspaper in the U S has less than 50 percent coverage in its service area This puts it at a disadvantage vis a vis the Postal Service which delivers to all households Newspapers on the other hand have the advantage of charging lower prices Because marginal costs are very low a newspaper price for preprints might be as low as 5 or 6 cents per piece The lowest rate currently charged by the Postal Service is 11 0 to 11 4 cents for saturation mail weighing up to 3 3 ounces and drop shipped at the delivery office 14 Newspapers deliver about 86 billion inserts annually 15 while the U S Postal Service delivers at least 11 billion competing items 16 11 As far as we know the U S is the only country that has a mail box rule 12 For a more comprehensive discussion of alternative delivery in the United States see the General Accounting Office Study n 7 supra 13 Newspapers also deliver product samples 14 The Postal Service has an additional disadvantage because city carriers deliver only addressed advertising mail This requires the mailer to have an address list kept in delivery sequence and to have address labels for each piece 15 Newspaper Association of America s WEB Site www naa org marketscope databank preppriyr htm 16 This was the saturation and 125 piece walk sequence Enhanced Carrier Route mail volume in 1996 Many of these items are so called marriage mail pieces which contain several individual advertisements combined into a single piece These individual advertisements could each be a stand alone insert Thus 11 billion pieces is an extreme lower bound on the number of preprints carried by the Postal Service C City Carrier Data Each year the Postal Service conducts a City Carrier Survey CCS of delivered mail volume by route Between 1993 and 1996 the Postal Service conducted the survey using a relatively small panel of about 400 routes 17 Prior to that the Postal Service randomly sampled a much larger cross section of its routes over the course of a year The last set of cross sectional data filed with the Postal Rate Commission in 1989 consisted of a sample of 16 092 different routes 18 Because of the large sample size these data are far more useful for our analysis than the subsequent panel data 19 Each record in the 1989 CCS contains the date of the observation the 5 Digit ZIP Code in which the route is located the route type 20 the number of pieces by subclass and by shape per stop the number of possible deliveries and actual deliveries per stop and the stop type single delivery residential multi delivery residential and business and mixed Generally data are recorded for every tenth stop on a route The authors were able to make use of the records for 14 884 routes 21 This analysis is based on the data set of 13 212 usable residential routes22 and 476 953 stops 23 About 89 percent of all city routes are residential routes The rest are business or mixed residential and business D Postal Service Delivery Cost And Profitability This analysis uses delivery data from 1989 but uses 1996 cost levels for wages fringe benefits and other associated delivery costs Total volume grew 13 5 percent 17 A panel survey collects data repeatedly from the same sample 18 There were 157 thousand city delivery routes in FY 1989 There were also 46 thousand rural routes most of which had costs comparable to city delivery routes See Cohen Ferguson Xenakis n 9 supra 19 The 1997 CCS data were not available when the analysis for this paper was conducted 20 Business foot business motorized residential foot residential park and loop residential curb mixed foot mixed park and loop and mixed curb 21 The data are organized by the 26 pay periods in a year Portions of the data from a few pay periods were not usable Comparisons with previously published summaries indicate that the missing data did not bias our results 22 To a much lesser extent this analysis makes use of data from 717 business routes 23 Ninety four percent 94 of these stops are residential while six percent 6 are either business or mixed business and residential stops Not all stops on a residential route are residences Some are business stops and some are mixed business and residential between 1989 and 1996 and the number of routes increased 7 percent We make no attempt to adjust for these increases When calculating city delivery cost we include the entire fixed and volume variable in office and out of office cost24 for all city routes plus the cost of overtime supervision space and vehicles Starting with a productive hourly rate of 25 25 for city carriers we calculate a cost per residential delivery route of 266 per delivery day 25 The cost we calculate can be considered to be the avoided cost or the incremental cost of the city delivery function Alternatively it can be considered a lower bound on the stand alone cost of city delivery 26 We calculate the daily profit of residential delivery routes for the Postal Service by totaling the revenue minus collection processing and transportation costs of the mail delivered on each route and subtracting the delivery cost of 266 Table 1 displays a variety of mean route statistics for residential routes separated into quartiles based on their profit less As can be seen the mean daily profit of each quartile ranges from positive 248 to negative 110 The average profit for all residential routes is 41 with 46 5 percent of the routes operating at a loss The route cost per piece ranges from 7 6 cents to 23 5 cents and averages 12 5 cents Route volume ranges from 3 485 pieces to 1 131 pieces and averages 2 128 pieces The number of possible deliveries which ranges from 670 to 411 is dependent on route terrain 27 All the statistics presented are monotonic across28 quartiles except for route type This is because of the close relationship between cost per piece delivery and stop volume 24 In office refers to the in the office activity of a letter carrier primarily sequencing mail to be delivered out of office refers to the activity of the carrier while on the street 25 This is based on the city delivery carrier total cost of 33 20 per hour This in turn is based on a productive hourly rate pay overtime pay and benefits for hours worked increased to account for other costs that can be associated with carriers These other costs include systemwide labor related costs e g worker s compensation civil service retirement unfunded liability indirect labor such as carrier supervision vehicle costs and space related costs rents fuel utilities custodial maintenance The standard work day for a city carrier is eight hours 26 It is a lower bound because the cost includes no marketing or administrative costs which a stand alone firm would normally incur 27 By physical terrain we mean the physical proximity of the delivery points and whether they are most advantageously served by a curb park loop or foot route 28 A monotonic series is one whose every term is greater than less than or equal to the previous term 6 per piece delivery and stop and the number of deliveries stops on a route With respect to route type we see that the percentage of curb routes is greatest in the most profitable quartile 29 These routes are largely a suburban phenomenon they reach more stops in a day and hence have more volume The appendix Table A1 presents demographic characteristics related to the quartiles in Table 1 Table 1 SELECTED AVERAGES FOR RESIDENTIAL ROUTES WHEN ROUTES ARE SORTED BY PROFIT PER ROUTE Profit Cost cents Per possible Volume Pieces Per possible Quartile dollars Piece Delivery Stop pieces Deliverya Stop a In the paper referenced in n 9 supra pieces per possible delivery were weighed by stop and produced a slightly higher pieces per delivery Here they are unweighted The revenue for 46 5 percent of the routes all of quartile 4 and most of quartile 3 is not enough to cover the costs of the mail delivered on those routes Thus it might be argued that a monopoly is necessary to ensure service to those households For several reasons it would seem the burden of proof for this position should fall on its proponents The routes which are unprofitable are dispersed across the country in a great number of cities A competitive postal service that refused to serve households on unprofitable Curb routes deliver directly from the vehicle to a curbside mail receptacle Park and loop routes involve parking covering an area by foot then parking the vehicle in a new area routes would impose large transaction costs on its customers to separate mail and to secure suppliers to deliver its remaining mail Such firms would be at a considerable disadvantage to those providing universal service Larger transaction networks be they mail packages overnight or telephone are more valuable to customers and providers than smaller networks It is for sound business reasons that Federal Express and United Parcel Service provide universal delivery service A major business asset of the U S Postal Service and all other national posts is that they provide service to every address in the countries they serve Thus there is a business incentive for any postal provider who is not simply a cream skimmer to offer universal service within the territories it serves Routes which are unprofitable when serviced six days per week would become profitable when serviced less frequently In a competitive environment the Postal Service could easily retain universal service but perhaps not a universal service standard 30 Delivery less than six days per week would certainly be preferable to abandoning delivery altogether Of course if the Postal Service were to simply abandon delivery to unprofitable routes it would not have to refuse return or destroy mail destined to these routes Delivery firms with lower costs than the Postal Service would emerge to serve them and the Postal Service could hand off its unprofitable mail to them 31 Under any foreseeable circumstances universal delivery would not cease 32 E Volume Available For Cream Skimmers It is unlikely that cream skimmers would base their selection of areas to serve on the Postal Service s delivery profits Postal Service delivery profitability depends on the revenue for all mail delivered and it is not likely that cream skimmers could capture all categories of mail 30 It is interesting to note that United Parcel Service recently began delivery less frequently than daily to certain residential areas 31 Costs would be lower by dint of lower wages and or less frequent delivery 32 The concept of a universal service obligation may really mean more frequent delivery than economically warranted for households living on unprofitable routes This of course is in addition to providing retail services to rural communities Residential cream skimmers would serve bulk mailers with sufficient volumes of mail for the areas they serve We assume that only mail that is presorted to the carrier route level would be vulnerable to cream skimming If a bulk mailer did not have sufficient volume to sort to the carrier route level the transaction costs for both mailer and cream skimmer would be prohibitive Of course third parties might become intermediaries between these bulk mailers and cream skimmers Such parties would have to engage in processing and transportation They would in effect be a parallel postal system for bulk mailers An analysis of separate postal systems for bulk mailers is beyond the scope of this paper The U S Postal Service requires First Class and advertising mail to have at least ten pieces for a carrier to qualify for a carrier route discount Publications may qualify with as few as six pieces for a carrier route The amounts being presorted to the carrier route level in 1996 are shown in the right hand column First Class Mail is unzoned and receives no discount for being deposited near its destination Most First Class carrier route volume is prepared by utilities and may be local depending on the billing operations of the utility For purposes of this analysis we assume that all First Class carrier route mail is available to local cream skimmers Publications Mail While only 3 2 billion pieces of the carrier route volume is entered locally or entered close enough to its destination to be available to cream skimmers we assume that all 4 5 billion pieces are available to cream skimmers Advertising Mail Eight five 85 percent or 25 2 billion pieces of carrier route advertising mail are drop shipped or entered locally Notwithstanding we assume here that all carrier route advertising mail would be available to cream skimmers To summarize 37 7 billion pieces of carrier route volume are potentially available to cream skimmers 33 This represents 20 6 percent of the total volume of 182 7 billion pieces in 1996 Geographic cream skimmers would concentrate on areas with the most carrier route volume because their cost per piece would be lowest and their potential profit would be the greatest Table 2 displays mean daily route statistics for routes when divided into quartiles reflecting their volumes of carrier route mail We see a wide divergence in carrier route volume among the quartiles The range is from 1 263 pieces to 87 pieces with an average of 551 The first quartile routes have more than twice the volume of carrier route mail as the second quartile In fact the first quartile has more than half of all carrier route volume delivered on residential routes Thus the first quartile of routes are much more attractive targets for cream skimmers than the other routes We again see a monotonic behavior of the other variables across quartiles 34 Route profitability by quartile in Table 2 changes by a sizable amount as compared to route profitability in Table 1 Less than half the routes in quartile 1 Table 1 are also in quartile 1 Table 2 The appendix Table A2 presents demographic characteristics related to the quartiles in Table 2 33 Some of this mail is delivered by rural carriers For purpose of this analysis we assume that rural delivery is subject to the same degree of cream skimming as city delivery However some carrier route mail is delivered on business routes and some is delivered via post office boxes and thus would not be available to cream skimmers Consequently 37 7 billion represents an upper bound of the volume available to cream skimmers 34 The only deviation from the monotonic behavior in Table 2 occurs for deliveries per route between quartiles 2 and 3 Table 2 SELECTED AVERAGES FOR RESIDENTIAL ROUTES WHEN ROUTES ARE SORTED BY VOLUME OF CARRIER ROUTE MAIL PER ROUTE Profit Cost cents Per possible Quartile dollars Piece Delivery Stop Volume pieces All Carrier Pieces Per possible Mail Route Delivery Stop F Estimating The Delivery Cost For Cream Skimmers Cream skimmers undercut prices charged by an incumbent that has heterogeneous costs but averaged prices Cream skimmers profit by selling low cost items at below the incumbents average price Delivery cream skimmers would attempt to serve those areas where the cost to deliver carrier route pieces is the lowest i e where the volume of carrier route pieces is the highest The first quartile of routes in Table 2 would make the best targets It is this case we examine In an important sense this is an unrealistic case since quartile 1 represents 40 000 routes which are scattered over more than half the 30 000 5 Digit ZIP Code areas in the U S It is extremely unlikely that they constitute all the residential routes in any 5 Digit ZIP Code nor is it likely that they make up the entire suburban ring around cities It is unrealistic for cream skimmers to serve such a fragmented market From both an operational and marketing standpoint cream skimmers would have to serve markets with at best a large proportion of routes in quartile 1 Their markets would undoubtedly contain a large number of routes in the other quartiles Notwithstanding for analytical purposes we assume the best possible case for cream skimmers that they would be able to serve only routes that fall within quartile 1 A potential competitor must decide the level of service to provide and this decision would affect the amount of volume that it could actually capture Many magazines newspapers and advertisements must be delivered within a one two or three day window A competitor delivering only one day a week would have to forego much potential volume On the other hand delivery six days a week would certainly raise the cost per delivered piece and make it less likely that a cream skimmer would be viable 35 City Mail in Sweden chose to deliver two days per week Monday Thursday in some areas and Tuesday Friday in other areas In all probability a cream skimmer could not prosper unless it could deliver mail at a price less than the incumbent postal administration Its cost per delivered piece would be a function of its cost of labor and productivity It would be expected that a cream skimmer would have a significant labor cost advantage Its productivity would be influenced by the in office and out of office technology it employed In 1989 Postal Service carriers spent more than 40 percent of their time in office preparing for delivery on the street Many mailstreams must be merged and sorted into delivery sequence 36 It is not clear what technology cream skimmers would use Moreover we do not know whether the personnel of a cream skimmer would be more productive on the street than U S Postal Service carriers This analysis will combine these variables labor cost technology in office and out of office productivity into a single efficiency parameter 35 In a sense each piece of advertising mail competes with other advertising mail for the recipient s attention If a cream skimmer could capture a large portion of the available carrier route volume its customers might prefer more frequent delivery to minimize this type of competition 36 This function is rapidly being automated for letter size mail in the U S Delivery point barcoded mail is increasingly being sequenced on sorting machines saving significant in office delivery time From 1989 to 1996 the percentage of in office time for city carriers has declined from 41 percent to 34 percent It is expected that this trend will continue Unless a potential cream skimmer had enough capital to employ sequencing automation the Postal Service might have a significant advantage in sequencing and merging letter shaped mail First Class is almost all letter shaped publications are almost all flat shaped and carrier route advertising is 43 percent letter shaped G Cream Skimmers Cost Per Piece Table 3 has four matrices each reflecting a different percentage of available volume assumed to be captured by cream skimmers Each matrix presents cream skimmer unit or per piece costs based on frequency of delivery and relative efficiency of the cream skimmer We measure relative efficiency in terms of cream skimmers cost relative to the Postal Service s cost The shaded cell in the top matrix 13 1 cents is the Postal Service cost per piece for delivering only carrier route presorted mail in the least expensive quartile This number is derived from the 8 7 cent cost of the Postal Service delivering all mail in the least expensive quartile shown in Table 2 If only the carrier route mail is delivered the average delivered volume decreases from 3 051 to 1 263 in this quartile The variable costs drop as the volume drops but the fixed costs are spread over less volume which increases the fixed costs proportionately The result is an increase in the unit costs to 13 1 cents shown in Table 3 Going down that column the costs per piece are displayed assuming a cream skimmer had the same cost as the U S Postal Service but delivers fewer days per week The costs decrease by the amount of fixed costs in delivery The variable cost remains the same because the volume does not change Most other national postal administrations would have a greater percentage of fixed costs because they have fewer pieces per possible delivery 37 The columns display cream skimmers costs as a function of U S Postal Service efficiency expressed as a percentage of the Postal Service s delivery cost per piece The 120 percent column displays the cream skimmer s per piece cost if its cost were 120 percent of the U S Postal Service 38 The 60 percent column displays the cream skimmer s per piece cost if its cost were 60 percent of the U S Postal Service Table 3 CREAM SKIMMER S COST PER PIECE IN CENTS AS A FUNCTION OF EFFICIENCY RELATIVE TO POSTAL SERVICE DAYS OF DELIVERY AND PERCENT OF CARRIER ROUTE MAIL 100 OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED 75 OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED 50 OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED 25 OF CARRIER ROUTE VOLUME CAPTURED For all mail the Postal Service city carrier cost fixed and variable is 12 5 cents per piece See Tables 1 and 2 cost per piece all routes This is the cost for the delivery function Each postal product has a variable cost for mail processing transportation and delivery Each product also has an average incremental avoidable cost In the case of advertising carrier route mail the average incremental cost is about 7 cents 39 If threatened by cream skimmers the Postal Service could respond by lowering its price towards average incremental costs If the Postal Service maintained uniform prices but had competition only in selected areas it would sacrifice revenue in those areas without competition These circumstances would probably call for selective discounts with average incremental costs as a floor to large volume mailers40 who would otherwise become customers of cream skimmers Thus cream skimmers would most likely have to have costs no higher than approximately 7 cents per piece in order to compete on a cost basis alone 41 The Postal Service s productive hourly wage of more than 25 may make it likely that cream skimmers could obtain some cost advantage on that basis alone We do not know how reducing the frequency of delivery would affect demand for alternative delivery A two day frequency could satisfy a three day window but would miss many delivery dates for time value publications It should also be noted that some customers may not be willing to leave the Postal Service for a variety of reasons including the sense of security of dealing with a government agency If a cream skimmer were to capture only 25 percent of the available market it would have difficulty succeeding At that level of market penetration its costs would have to be 40 percent of the Postal Service s at a two day frequency in order to be below Postal Service incremental costs With 50 percent of the average volume at a two day frequency a cream skimmer s costs would have to be 60 percent or less of the Postal Service s in order to remain below the Service s average incremental costs 39 The variable cost of carrier route advertising mail comes predominantly from the delivery function in office and out of office The delivery function is about 50 percent variable Thus the variable cost of the advertising carrier route mail product can be much lower than the average fixed and variable cost of delivery The average incremental cost of advertising carrier route mail is only slightly higher than the variable cost since we estimate it here to consist of variable costs plus single subclass stop costs for 1996 40 Except for a customer with a very high elasticity of demand there is no reason for a monopoly to grant volume based discounts since customers have no alternative supplier We understand this was the case with UPS which had a virtual monopoly in surface parcel delivery in the U S and did not give discounts to surface parcel customers until Roadway Package Service began to target its most lucrative customers in the 1980s UPS then began offering discounts to certain large volume customers 41 Some mailers currently use cream skimmers because of service considerations H Consequences Of Successful Cream Skimming Table 4 shows the required increase in the U S Postal Service rates based on the percentage of carrier route volume that would be captured by cream skimmers targeting mail in quartile 1 Table 2 42 The maximum effect is an increase of about 1 2 cents in the First Class rate with corresponding increases in the other classes This would be an increase of nearly 4 percent a significant but limited effect Lifting the letter mail monopoly and allowing cream skimming would likely have an important impact on rate setting for the Postal Service s large volume carrier route customers if our assumptions are correct concerning the amount of volume available for capture by cream skimmers The maximum impact on overall postal rates is however likely to be limited The negative impact on Postal Service s finances would likely be offset to a great extent by the effect of limited competition on the Postal Service s efficiency service performance and product innovation Table 4 IMPACT OF CREAM SKIMMING ON I Comparison Of Business And Residential Routes We do not analyze cream skimming on business routes because only 7 percent of mail volume delivered on them is carrier route as compared to 26 percent on residential routes This makes them unlikely candidates for cream skimming based on our analysis We compare several statistics for city residential and business routes in Table 5 Table 5 COSTS BY TYPE OF CITY DELIVERY ROUTE It can be seen that business routes have slightly more pieces per route with slightly higher cost per piece 43 The cost per delivery point and stop on business routes is much higher but the profit per piece remains higher 44 We are not aware of any study that has identified the reasons why business routes have a higher cost per piece and much higher cost per stop than residential routes Several factors may contribute including the high cost of serving each individual business in office buildings In contrast residential apartment houses generally have mail boxes in one central and convenient location for carriers Other factors include the larger proportion of business mail requiring signatures and the greater difficulty of getting around in congested business areas as opposed to residential and suburban neighborhoods Because business routes have much higher cost per delivery point they 43 Business routes get much more assistance from routers who sequence the mail in the office thus saving in office time for the carrier The cost per piece and per delivery point reflects these extra costs 44 Profit is higher on business routes than on residential routes because of greater volumes of high profit mail such as on Priority and Express Cream skimming delivery networks might be developed for such mail in business areas but are beyond the scope of this paper are unlikely candidates for geographic cream skimmers who could be expected to have far fewer pieces over which to spread the cost per delivery point 45 J Some Differences Between the U S and Other Countries The classification structures in industrial countries have varying degrees of efficiency defined as adherence to cost 46 Efficient classification discourages cream skimmers because it leaves less cream to skim The less efficient the classification structure the more the administration needs monopoly protection The U S Postal Service s classification structure contains several score of cost based discounts and rate differentials probably more than any other administration 47 This should tend to make the U S less vulnerable to cream skimming Moreover the U S has more pieces per capita than virtually any other country Because the delivery function has important economies of scale ceteris paribus the U S should have lower per piece costs than virtually every other country This factor also makes the U S less vulnerable to cream skimming In addition the proportion of fixed cost in the delivery network is largely a function of volume per capita per delivery The larger the volume per capita the larger the proportion of variable costs and the smaller the proportion of fixed costs Since virtually every other postal administration has less volume per capita than the U S a larger proportion of their delivery costs are fixed relative to the U S A cream skimmer can reduce its fixed cost relative to an incumbent simply by reducing the number of days of delivery Thus a cream skimmer would obtain less cost advantage by cutting delivery frequency in the U S than in countries with less per capita volume This also tends to make the U S less vulnerable to cream skimming than other countries 48 45 Of course messenger services are common in central business districts but this is for reasons of service and not cost 46 The most efficient classification structure would be based on costs alone and would offer worksharing discounts wherever practical These discounts would equal the cost savings No postal administration meets this standard nor do the authors recommend that they do 47 Advertising mail alone has over 60 different rate categories with rate differentials based on shape and discounts for presorting barcoding and drop shipping 48 A consequence of this is that an administration which delivers five days per week ceteris paribus is a more difficult target for cream skimmers than one which delivers six days per week On the other hand some factors appear to make the U S Postal Service more vulnerable than other postal administrations to cream skimming Few if any countries have as large a proportion of carrier route volume as does the U S This is the mail most susceptible to diversion In addition few postal administrations pay their employees as large a wage premium as does the U S Postal Service 49 A wage premium allows cream skimmers to obtain an efficiency cost advantage simply by paying the prevailing wage 49 See Cohen Chu Ferguson Xenakis A Cross Sectional Comparison and Analysis of Productivity for 21 National Postal Administrations Managing Change in the Postal and Delivery Industries Ed Crew Kleindorfer Kluwer Academic Publishers 1997 APPENDIX This paper s analysis is based on volume and delivery statistics from 13 212 residential carrier routes These routes were extracted from the Carrier Cost Survey CCS conducted by the U S Postal Service in 1989 In addition to the volume and delivery statistics for each of the 13 212 residential routes CCS provides the associated 5 Digit ZIP Code served by each route A ZIP Code may be served by many routes The data presented in this appendix are based on the demographic data for the 5 Digit ZIP Code for each route in a quartile Thus the demographic data for the same 5 Digit ZIP Code could be averaged into the totals for two different quartiles This would happen if two routes from the same 5 Digit ZIP Code were in separate quartiles The United States Bureau of the Census has grouped the 1990 Census of Population and Housing data using 5 Digit ZIP Codes The file STF 3B is available in three CDs of about 1 4 gigabytes GBs and contains socio economic data for 29 467 5 Digit ZIP Codes served by the U S Postal Service The Puerto Rico ZIP Codes are not included in STF
