 Man of the Year A visionary has the power to imagine what the world can be and a revolutionary has the power to make it so Very few men are either Our 1997 Man of the Year is both Ideas have consequences and it is in 1997 that we have seen the consequences of his With his pinwheeling hopscotch creativity he has changed the nation s center of gravity reinventing commerce art science technology and faith His animating spirit a pragmatic idealistic humanitarianism is rapidly becoming the ethos of the age His passing comments roil financial markets from Bangkok to Bond Street Hollywood moguls make pilgrimages to his seaside home Bill Gates seeks his counsel So does Stephen Hawking He is it is said the only man who plays golf with Bill Clinton and doesn t let him cheat Still he is not yet a household name and may not be for some time He is an unassuming man a thatch of sandy hair a pair of inquisitive brown eyes a slight shadow of beard at all hours of the day In a year of spectacular emotion his was a quiet triumph He lacks the press savvy of Clinton He doesn t touch the heart as Princess Diana did or the conscience as Mother Teresa did or the pocketbook as Alan Greenspan does But while other people make headlines he is making history When they chronicle our time it should be his name that appears on the roll of honor But only if His vision and his revolution are high risk gambles If they fail and no one can predict if they will our world will be a more dangerous place a darker poorer place a world untethered from the kind of stability we have come to cherish And if he succeeds Every so often God blesses us says his close friend and confidant the Dalai Lama and he is such a blessing To understand him to understand both his leathery toughness and his gentle soul follow U S Route 44 west from Lubbock Texas for 50 miles Here 50 miles from Lubbock and 50 miles from nowhere is a one stoplight town called Poseyville And here up the block from the River Diner though there s no river for miles is a three room cabin It is in this cabin five decades ago that his mother came alone a young widow trying to start over with her 2 year old boy That little house was his crucible They grew up together mother and son They studied together on the oilcloth covered kitchen table beneath the only electric light in the house He learned his ABCs she slowly slowly earned her degree via correspondence And when the lessons were over she instilled in him the homespun wisdom that her parents had instilled in her The power is the word not the sword There is no difficulty so great that it cannot be overcome no triumph so great that it cannot be destroyed His mother still lives in the same house but electric lights are everywhere now He phones her every day at noon sharp Once he excused himself from an audience with the pope to call From the time he was a boy she confides I knew that destiny had reserved him a seat If destiny had indeed reserved him a seat it was in the very front of the classroom He was an A student at Poseyville High He was also a three sport star and the most ferocious competitor I ve ever seen his coach says today Even as a teen ager he showed signs of his independent mindedness His friends mowed lawns he climbed mountains They took piano lessons he taught himself the trombone and busked for dimes on Main Street Adversity wrote the poet Rainer Maria Rilke is the seedling of courage And adversity came He headed east for college on scholarship His mother alone again fell ill School was a struggle Midway through his freshman year he gave up hitchhiked home and told his mother he was back for good to take care of her That night they went out for a walk on the plains It was he says a clear moonlit night We walked by an old ranch house and I could see the barbed wire and the old brands glinting in the moonlight All of a sudden I thought of when the world was young and growing and full of hope And I wanted to make it so again The next morning he hitchhiked back East His mind burns with a bright clear flame and his professors soon recognized his genius He earned his degree in three years and went to work He astonished He could see around corners says an old colleague He overturned conventional wisdom and preached heresy In the beginning he was dismissed as a crackpot at best an eccentric at worst a threat But steadily his fame and power and influence grew He was not an intellectual and he had no time for ideology but he had the American genius for common sense His own powerful ideas rooted themselves in society s cracks and began to sprout in all directions And sprout And sprout Today despite his fame he remains a startlingly humble man Every morning while he s in the bath he tries to answer his dozens of personal letters He s never missed a high school reunion and he still finds time to eat dinner with childhood friends twice a week When he got famous I was sure he d forget us says one old playmate but he hasn t His charm is legendary So is his equanimity When his aides panic over some nugget of bad news he calms them down by quoting his sages Lao Tzu Euripedes Toynbee Covey Every day he says he receives a letter or two urging him to run for president He laughs the idea off The president is a captive He is a free man and in freedom is true power This is he says only the beginning of his crusade In the third century after the invention of the fulcrum and lever Archimedes wrote Give me where to stand and I will move the earth It is now the cusp of the millennium The Man of the Year has two feet planted squarely on the ground And the earth is moving
