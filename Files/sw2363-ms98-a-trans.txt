 i i like our benefits okay i m pretty satisfied with them uh the only thing that i think i would change is the network the hospital networking i have Aetna Insurance um hum you know the company insurance and and um hum i would i just think i should would like to go to my own hospital where my doctor is rather than have to go to a hospital on a list that s the only thing i have against it well i i can see both sides of that issue and i think that uh it s just a necessary evil is basically what it comes down to what is that what is it because of because of expense is that the uh costs are just going out of sight and and uh you know it s either increase the premiums or try to uh everybody work together to try to curtail the cost that s the way i see it yeah do you do you use Aetna yes i do yeah you know it s pretty good they re really fast on paying uh all my claims you know i don t use it that much to be real honest with you i m alone and and you know it s hard for me i don t go to the doctor unless i m really sick and i don t get sick that much so you know sometimes i don t even come up with the deductible we ve used it quite a bit in the past when our kids were smaller but uh in a year i don t use it that much either uh of course i m using it right now i had a little skiing accident here in this last month and so i m taking advantage of it right now you oh no are you did you break something yeah i cracked a collarbone separated the shoulder a little bit oh my God nothing too major oh did you are you on L O A no no i didn t even miss work just sling stick it in a sling and go on you didn t um oh my gosh well some guy killed himself today or yesterday in a skiing accident somebody up here he s head of oh welfare not welfare but probations or something on i can t think of what he s the head of uh he skied into a tree huh uh and killed himself forty one years old um so i tell you getting back to the benefits okay i was just thinking about uh something uh uh kind of close to one of our guys in H R D their personnel and they uh he s been talking about this thing called flex benefits for quite a while and uh i think that s a interesting concept ever heard of that uh huh uh be kind of like smorgasbord of benefits where you could uh tailor your benefit package to your own individual needs and so forth in other words if you were uh interested in having more vacation you could do that and then take cutback a little bit on some uh other area huh or uh you know increase your hospital benefits if you were in had a lot kids or something like that or yeah or in your case you might want to cut the hospital back a little bit and have more vacation yeah whatever i mean it s uh you know across the board huh i hadn t heard of that it s a yeah it s something they talked about for several years now i don t know if that he are getting any closer the problem is that some people might go a little bit overboard in picking out what they want and leave themselves too short in other areas i guess yeah yeah well uh i think TI has good benefits well in most cases i d have to agree with you i think the uh profit sharing is a little uh think we have a little lacking right now oh yeah well and for the past few years yeah but like they always say you know got a good profit sharing plan just no profit but no profits right now i think when when we when we start showing profit which i hope we do pretty soon um that you know because at one time they had good profit sharing from what i understand i i didn t get in on it unfortunately um hum yeah but well i ve had a few good years but not too many in the fifteen i ve been here see i ve only been here four um so i m just trying to hang on to my job yeah right yeah all these cutbacks and stuff this is pretty scary oh yeah yeah but but i really like working for their TI i think yeah it s a good company i don t know what division your in but we uh uh i hate to tell you i m in payroll oh really but uh i i got a i got a bone to pick with the programmer on that new time program i love it you don t like it well i think it s a great concept but i think you ve uh you ve left too many uh uh i m a supervisor and i approve i approve the uh the thing it it just doesn t make logical sense you know in other words it always keep jumping back up to the person you know where you enter your own number ID number huh the logical thing would have been had to go had it go to the the employee number so that s the one you re going to do the next action on the change you know and there s a lot of little things like that in there but it it could probably be corrected easily i don t know if anybody s griped about it or not oh we get gripes but all in all it it works pretty good for everybody you know yeah i think the concept s great you know and it and i m sure there are some bugs in it and eventually maybe they ll work them out it it s been a tough year to get this all done and get everybody on it and um hum i ll bet yeah it s uh but it s showing it s rewards now i think uh oh the stop pays and people coming off of L O A and everything people are really getting the hang of it now yeah yes boy in the beginning what division are you in fourteen oh fourteen well okay division one was worse because that s the biggest division and boy when we put them on oh my God the phone you d hang up and it would ring it was just bad yeah but they ve kept you hopping there yeah yeah but it s it s doing pretty well now i think everybody s oh yeah i think it s uh definitely got good definitely got a right idea see i don t have to go in and app rove time okay so i i really um hum don t know what y all are going through to be honest with you to sit there in option one and approve everybody s time i didn t do it before and i don t do it now so i don t have anything to compare that with for us in communicating with people with everybody um hum and and being able to see what you are doing and everything it s really been a a a godsend it s been wonderful getting everybody on the same system it s been great and an easy system that everybody seems to be able to learn you know it s been really good yeah yeah um hum yeah well that s that s one of the benefits that i uh that s a TI benefit new you know question well you know knowing a little bit about programming and a little bit about the time system and the way it was before and everything i just could see where he could made it so much better you know just by a few little more i don t know what you d say attention to the to the right detail and stuff now i don t know who planned it all or how i don t even know how they came about uh agreeing on what all to do and with i know they re were programmers involved and i know the manager and the two managers and uh payroll were involved in supervisors and all but uh i came in last year out of one of the shops so uh it was all new to me i had to learn the old system and the new system that was fun hum that was fun and then after i had finally got it all down they said now forget the old system oh yeah sure thanks a lot so so for me the new system really was uh too bad was easier you know it really it really was is easier to work i think yeah so but that s just from my point of view like i said i don t have to sit down and depending depending on how many work rooms you have and everything you know it could be a real problem maybe to approve everybody well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just especially if it s standard week they can just don t even have to get in hardly to log on to it just to put the initial command and then their employee number and away it goes yeah yeah but you have to go in and and individually check everybody yeah working with it it s uh you can see some areas that could be improved yeah i think they must have worked on it because i ve noticed one correction come through already it looks like they re several things that have uh changed already on it and now you re going to ask me what and i can t tell you offhand i just know we ve had several changes it just man that s all right no i m not the i only worry with it one time a week when i m well twice really when i m approving and then it s uh yeah yeah well i ve had a chance to i had a chance to terminate and uh L O A and back to L O A that i think that was the most difficult thing for people to pick up on was stopping and starting people s pay mainly because you can do it now and it s easy and it s so easy that people go um hum um hum was that all i have to do it you know there s got to be something else i have to do and i m no it s just really easy and setting up your own cost your own uh work groups now too where as we had to do it before yeah right just um hum for you and now all you have to do is go in and put in a number and you got it you know so uh just put people in pick a number and put people in it and it s a work group so you know i think uh it s really a lot simpler than the old one yeah speaking of uh let s see big corporate benefits i wonder if uh i wonder if they looked uh have you ever heard of this administaff type thing this staff leasing that a lot of companies do hum um they uh that s kind of uh new thing that come along and uh benefit well they uh what they do is uh well i guess it s basically for smaller companies that don t want to have all the payroll hassle and everything uh huh you fire all your people and they uh they hire them then they lease them back to you and they do all the paperwork and provide the benefit of course they have
