 We appreciate the note from Drs Koudinov and Berezov 1 In our opinion no model has yet been presented that plausibly accounts for all the data on statins cholesterol amyloid protein A and Alzheimer disease In our paper 2 we present evidence that the isoprenoid pathway contributes to statin activated shedding of the APP ectodomain in cultured cells We do not yet know which if any other cholesterol related Alzheimer phenomena are also attributable to modulation of isoprenoids Rho or ROCK Previously conventional wisdom held that A load and hypercholesterolemia were directly related based on observations that high fat diet aggravated amyloid pathology in plaque forming mice 3 4 5 More recently however the formulation that statins act simply via cholesterol lowering fails to account for several observations that cannot immediately be reconciled either with the original dogma or with each other First Fagan et al 6 questioned the role of cholesterol as the final common pathway in A load specification since in their experiments low cholesterol per se apparently had no impact on brain A load in plaque forming transgenic mice Then equally puzzling pharmacological data emerged Atorvastatin was shown to lower brain amyloid load and A levels but brain cholesterol levels were unaffected by the drug 7 In an apparent complete contradiction with the original observations now some investigators have been able to devise circumstances under which there is an inverse relationship between cholesterol and A with low neuronal cholesterol increasing A generation 8 and vice versa 9 These newer observations are unexpected and extremely puzzling and no comprehensive explanation has yet emerged For those readers seeking an update on this challenging area we would direct your attention to the Alzheimer Research Forum Web page http www alzforum org new detailprint asp id 1135 where you will find an excellent review of the literature as well as a series of evaluations of how our data fit into existing scenarios and models regarding cholesterol statins cerebral amyloidosis and the cognitive failure of Alzheimer disease
