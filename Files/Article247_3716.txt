 Gore Finally Makes Moving Speech The New York Times and Washington Post lead with and everybody else fronts Al Gore s announcement that he is moving his campaign headquarters to Tennessee a move designed to symbolize a break from inside the Beltway politics and a too close association with President Clinton It is largely perceived by the papers as a sign of distress in the Gore campaign which the NYT calls lagging and the Post calls troubled references to a fund crunch and Bill Bradley s much improved polls The Los Angeles Times leads with a California appeals court ruling that gun manufacturers can be sued for negligence for promoting weapons in such a way that they would appeal to criminals The unprecedented decision is stuffed elsewhere USA Today leads with STATES TO TIE TEACHER PAY TO RESULTS about how today at a national education summit Bill Clinton in attendance at least 10 states will agree to test a program in which faculty checks and student grades go hand in hand With the federal government having just given itself pay raises across the board without having produced a budget for the fiscal year that starts tomorrow one looks in vain for the alternative headline STATES TO TIE POLITICIAN PAY TO RESULTS Oh well Some of the papers seem way too caught up in the Gore move True the WP calls it largely symbolic but not until the 10th paragraph after first calling it a dramatic upheaval and part of a broad make over And high up the Post reports without breaking stride that the campaign s other new changes include an updated wardrobe There s also the pseudo drama of the WP describing how Gore summoned two top aides to his house Monday night to tell them of his decision to move and asking them if they would move with him Both replied yes although throbs the Post other stunned aides were uncertain what to do USAT says of Gore s announcement The air of nervousness and tension in the room was palpable giving as evidence hold the front page that

the U S government s warning that parents should not sleep in the same bed with a child less than 2 years old because of the danger of accidental smothering or strangling The WP puts the story inside The Times notes that the recommendation was met with outrage from many pediatricians and parents on the grounds that bed sharing provides many benefits such as bonding and the promotion of breast feeding The Wall Street Journal runs a commentary by Donald Trump saying that yes he is seriously considering a run for president and will make his mind up later this year He states that he has been
