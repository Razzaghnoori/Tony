 Background Mulberry Morus spp is the most important crop plant in sericulture as the mulberry silkworms Bombyx mori L are reared on them Mulberries are a group of small trees or shrubs belonging to the family Moraceae distributed in the temperate and subtropical regions in the northern hemisphere In India six species are generally found namely M alba L 2x 2n 28 M indica L M atropurpurea Roxb M nigra L M serrata Roxb 6x 2n 84 and M laevigata Wall 4x 2n 56 1 2 There is however some confusion over the species identification and according to Dandin 3 the first three species should be treated as synonyms or varieties of M alba L while the other three should be retained as distinct species Some species have also been introduced into India from China and Japan mainly for rearing silkworms during the past four decades Mulberry bears different sex types i e male female and bisexual flowers on the same plant monoecious or on different plants dioecious with expression of sex often depending on several physiological and biochemical factors 4 Mulberry genotypes have been evaluated with respect to many parameters but very little work has been done on characterization of mulberry DNA The genetic identities and relationships of mulberry plants including cultivars diploids and polyploids have been determined using RAPD technology 5 6 7 Xiang et al 8 also applied RAPD technique in systematics of the genus Morus L While these studies focused on variation among different species of Morus very little is known about the intra species genetic variation existing in mulberry Furthermore no molecular work has been reported on the genetic diversity amongst the mulberry plants grown in India In recent years DNA based markers allowing direct comparison of the genetic material of two individual plants have been used quite extensively The RAPD technique 9 10 provides a convenient and rapid assessment of the differences in the genetic composition of the related individuals and has been employed in a large number of plants for the determination and assessment of genetic diversity The other technique Directed Amplification of Minisatellite DNA DAMD has been developed by Heath et al 11 and reveals polymorphism due to minisatellites Since this technique is carried out at higher PCR stringencies the patterns produced have a greater reproducibility than RAPD In this paper we report the results from the application of both RAPD as well as DAMD PCR profiling for the determination of differences amongst nine varieties of mulberry These included triploids and selected diploid varieties of importance to moriculture Results The DNAs isolated from nine varieties were found to be of high molecular weight as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis These DNAs were used for the RAPD and DAMD reactions RAPD conditions were optimized in a pilot experiment varying concentrations of Mg 2 ions primer and DNA data not shown Similarly in case of three DAMD primers annealing temperature was varied between 50 C and 55 C so as to determine the optimum temperature data not shown For Mg 2 titration 0 mM 1 5 mM 2 5 mM 3 5 mM and 4 5 mM MgCl 2 were included in each reaction Similarly 0 5 10 15 and 20 pMoles of primers and 0 12 5 25 50 100 and 200 ng of DNA templates were also tested for amplification Typically in case of Mg 2 ions a decrease in the concentration resulted in few or no bands due to the increase in stringency of the reaction An increase in primer concentration resulted in an increased number of bands However variation in DNA concentration at least up to 200 ng of DNA used per reaction did not result in differences in the profiles On the basis of these results 1 5 mM MgCl 2 10 pMoles primer and 50 ng of template DNA were considered to be optimal for generation of consistent RAPD profiles in mulberry and were therefore used in all the subsequent reactions with all the RAPD primers In case of the DAMD PCR annealing temperature of 50 C was found to be optimum for generating distinct profiles with all three primers In order to have a comprehensive idea of the variability amongst the varieties of mulberry RAPD and DAMD analysis was carried out For RAPD reactions 40 arbitrary sequence decamers were used as primers Of these three primers did not give any profile at all while 23 primers Table 1 gave consistent when the profiles with these primers were reproduced with at least three different preparations of the genomic DNAs profiles The RAPD data obtained with 23 primers and the DAMD data for three primers were considered separately for the analysis of the relationship amongst the different varieties The profiles obtained with the RAPD primers OP G16 and OP G5 and the profiles with DAMD primers 33 6 and HVR in case of all nine mulberry DNAs are shown in Fig 1 a d respectively The fragments produced by these primers varied in size from 500 4200 bp A total of 177 bands were scored in RAPD profiles of which 26 or 44 bands were monomorphic while 23 bands were scored in DAMD profiles of which 9 or 2 bands were monomorphic Bands were considered monomorphic since the same sized fragments were produced in all the varieties as indicated by small arrows in Fig 1a c d The pair wise distances were computed from the RAPD and DAMD band data and these values are given in Table 2 In RAPD method maximum distance 0 44 was found between the varieties CW and S34 and the least distance 0 24 was between the triploid varieties TR8 and TR10 Similarly in DAMD method the maximum distance 0 78 was found between S146 and two varieties namely S13 and S34 while the least distance 0 13 was between S34 and S13 The distance data were used to generate the NJ trees for both methods after carrying out 500 replicate bootstrap test The NJ tree for RAPD method is given in Fig 2awhile that for the DAMD method is given in Fig 2b In both cases the varieties were grouped into clusters such that the topologies of the trees were broadly similar for some of the clusters of varieties In the RAPD method NJ tree revealed that the two triploid varieties TR8 and TR10 were the closest to each other while K2 was in general the most distant from all other varieties Fig 2a When the RAPD data were subjected to a bootstrap test with 500 replicates it resulted in 432 possible trees The most frequently occurring tree amongst these grouped the indigenous variety K2 exotic introduced varieties CW and MAN triploid varieties TR8 and TR10 and the selection varieties S13 S34 S146 and S1531 as separate clusters The RAPD method was thus found to have a good resolution to distinguish between the varieties The NJ tree generated from the DAMD data was different from that for the RAPD data In the DAMD data the varieties S13 and S34 were found to be the closest to each other while the triploid varieties grouped differently The bootstrap test with 500 replicates resulted in 374 possible trees The most frequently occurring tree amongst these clearly showed the above clustering of the varieties Fig 2b Discussion A large number of mulberry varieties are grown in several geographical regions of India both for their edible fruit and for the silk industry The identification of elite varieties or promising varieties of mulberry is important because it can ultimately have a direct effect on silk production and quality One of the important ways by which these can be identified is to screen the mulberry germplasm for range and extent of genetic diversity present in it In the recent times such an analysis of the germplasm has also been carried out using molecular techniques including RAPD and other PCR based screening techniques such as DAMD With the help of RAPD genetic variations have been detected both within and between species of plants 12 13 14 DAMD PCR has been applied for the fingerprinting of several plants including yeasts and fungi 15 16 17 18 wheat 19 20 rice 21 common bean 22 and neem 23 In view of this it was decided to employ the RAPD and DAMD techniques for the analysis of genetic variation in case of an important plant like mulberry The nine varieties used in this study included two indigenous triploids TR8 TR10 four indigenous selections S13 S34 S146 and S1531 the prominent indigenous variety Kanva 2 K2 and two exotic varieties China White CW and Mandalay MAN The NJ tree after bootstrap test of RAPD data Fig 2a clearly indicates the closeness of the varieties TR8 and TR10 Further the varieties MAN and CW were also closer to both the triploid varieties than to the other varieties while all the selection varieties grouped together Fig 2a On the other hand the NJ tree after bootstrap test for the DAMD data revealed that the varieties S13 S34 and TR8 were least distant to each other while the four selection varieties were grouped differently relative to that in RAPD analysis These groupings of the varieties reflect the relative similarities of their genomic regions responsible for the RAPD or DAMD profiles Of the two the latter DAMD profiles were obtained with higher stringency PCR conditions than the RAPD profiles and therefore the closeness of the varieties to each other in DAMD profiles is attributable to the similarities of their minisatellite sequence families The RAPD profiles revealed that the varieties could be distinguished broadly into groups of the selection varieties S13 S34 S146 S1531 the triploids TR8 TR10 the two exotic varieties CW MAN and the indigenous variety K2 The DAMD profiles on the other hand resulted in a different clustering The two techniques however did not reveal any specific bias in the clustering of the varieties with reference to their geographical origins This shows that the geographical divergence of the varieties is not reflected in their RAPD and DAMD profiles It has been shown earlier also on the basis of multivariate analysis of nine different parameters that geographic diversity was not necessarily the direct cause of genetic diversity in mulberry 24 RAPD profiles of the triploids were different from those of all the diploid varieties Of these however the profiles in MAN and the triploid varieties TR8 and TR10 were relatively more similar The distances of the two triploid varieties to MAN were 0 27 and 0 31 while amongst themselves the distance was only 0 24 Table 2 Fig 2a To the other diploid varieties the distances of the triploids were in the range 0 28 to 0 41 The number of bands found in the triploids was not particularly large as compared to that in the diploids even though they had one additional set of chromosomes On the contrary in case of primer OP G5 it was observed that the triploid variety DNAs specifically lacked a band that was present in all other diploid varieties as indicated by a small arrowhead in Fig 1b In case of sugarcanes also Harvey and Botha 25 did not observe any greater number of RAPD bands in polyploids relative to the diploids In the case of the four indigenous selections the clustering of the varieties by both methods indicates that S34 and S13 are most similar to each other least distance 0 13 by DAMD method The varieties CW and K2 seemed to be more distant from the other varieties and were clustered differently relative to them by both the methods RAPD and DAMD Conclusions The overall extent of polymorphism was very high and the RAPD and DAMD data were useful in distinguishing between the nine varieties despite including apparently diverse elements such as triploids and exotic varieties As many as five RAPD primers and one DAMD primer generated profiles that can together differentiate all the nine varieties in terms of unique bands These results are consistent with the fact that mulberry is known to have highly heterozygous varieties with large numbers of natural hybrids between unisexual mulberry parents 26 Supporting this genetic divergence amongst as many as 58 varieties of mulberry was found to be high as determined by D 2statistics of multivariate analyses 27 The greatest distance 0 78 and the smallest distance 0 13 observed by the two methods in the present studies Table 2 indicated that the varieties are between 22 and 87 similar The two methods individually revealed that 85 RAPD and 91 DAMD bands were polymorphic For a plant with extensive natural hybridization amongst varieties and the reportedly high genetic divergence these values are thus indicative of the wide range of diversity An alternative interpretation is that mulberry has only recently split from its ancestral taxonomic group The present data on only nine varieties are however inadequate to really shed light on these two possibilities Nonetheless an important outcome of this study is the ability to distinguish between diverse varieties of mulberry using only a small number of RAPD and DAMD primers Clearly there is considerable scope for applying these techniques on a larger scale for the analysis of the entire mulberry germplasm Material and methods Plant material Mulberry plants of nine different varieties namely China White CW Kanwa2 K2 Mandalay MAN S1531 S146 S34 S13 Triploid 8 TR8 and Triploid 10 TR10 were
