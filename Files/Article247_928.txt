 Crying Wolf Republican representatives girding themselves for the labor of impeaching a popular president would have had reason to feel proud if they happened to read the Wall Street Journal s opinion page last Friday There in an elevated style more common to Roman public address than to newspaperese was the argument for voting one s conscience rather than one s poll numbers Greatness and transcendence are why people join political parties and why they go to war It is why they risk and sacrifice and engage in political argument Ultimately they are moved by principle and will for its sake throw aside or forgo the material things that scoundrel politicians think they hold above all else The editorial was written by Mark Helprin the conservatives answer to Toni Morrison Helprin is a leading American novelist Memoir from Antproof Case A Soldier of the Great War whose great theme is the nobility of the warrior and his worldview He is also a member of the Journal s editorial board and a cowriter of Bob Dole s famous Senate resignation speech Helprin has called for Clinton s impeachment since the first days of the Lewinsky affair His arguments have a real resonance to this reader anyway since they go to the heart of the matter at least as high school English classes teach us to define it that a man s character shapes his actions Citing the long record of the president s boldness and mendacity not just the Lewinsky case but the Travel Office and FBI file coverups etc Helprin compares the fibbing Clinton to the model of the self sacrificing statesman As others move in the light he will move in the darkness so that as others move in darkness he may move in the light A statesman must have a temperament that is suited for the Medal of Honor in a soul that is unafraid to die Helprin in short is a militant idealist the Steven Spielberg of political argument So what are we to make of the discrepancy between Helprin s ideals and his actions Helprin has an even worse track record than the president when it comes to stretching the truth so fine it can t be distinguished from a lie A 1991 profile in the New York Times Magazine whose accuracy it should be noted Helprin has challenged depicted him as a man who cheerfully admitted that he couldn t help but spin tall tales but had learned from hard experience the downside of doing so In my first radio interview the announcer said Tell me about your life So I began telling him about how I was a mercenary in Africa in a country where I became close to the President Then there was a coup and I left with sacks of diamonds I told the story in such a way that it sounded plausible and the announcer kept on saying You re kidding I can t believe this Is this really true and I d say Yes yes yes it s true Of course it s true Among stories the Times writer said Helprin fabricated in his presence even after making that admission that his mother was sold into slavery how when he was a teenager he was attacked by a Pakistani immigrant to Jamaica and received 60 stitches without anesthesia The fact of the attack is probably true but as the Times writer said the details surrounding it have changed frequently Accounts of Helprin s penchant for amusing or self aggrandizing exaggeration are legendary in the literary world Even his recent political articles are filled with yarns that make one long for a little good old fashioned fact checking Take a story he published this year in Forbes ASAP the tale of how he a young and lowly private in the Israeli army just before the Yom Kippur War understood how unready the army was for a surprise attack and managed to convey his concerns to Golda Meir and Moshe Dayan His advice of course was tragically ignored It would be na ve to criticize a fiction writer for fabricating fictions that s what a novelist does for a living But what about when the prevaricator becomes a political columnist and tries convince politicians to impeach other politicians for prevaricating As Helprin would surely ask should a man like that sit on the editorial board of a major American newspaper Judith Shulevitz
