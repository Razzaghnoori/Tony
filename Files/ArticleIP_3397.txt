 Eros Turannos posted Wednesday Oct 22 To hear Robert Pinsky read Eros Turannos click The woman Robinson writes about in this poem must choose between a disastrous love affair and no love affair at all She chooses the calamity The material is like that of much American country music this is a cheatin song in its way and also a song about small town life the way gossip about an extraordinary person can somehow elevate both the locale and that heroic figure Story becomes myth in that communal whispering an effect Robinson imitates with his amazing rhymes a kind of hyper ballad It s worth noting that Robinson knew small town life and also suffering he was destitute until President Theodore Roosevelt directed by one of the Roosevelt children to a book of Robinson s created a government job for the poet Robert Pinsky She fears him and will always ask What fated her to choose him She meets in his engaging mask All reasons to refuse him But what she meets and what she fearsAre less than are the downward yearsDrawn slowly to the foamless weirs Of age were she to lose him Between a blurred sagacity That once had power to sound him And Love that will not let him be The Judas that she found him Her pride assuages her almost As if it were alone the cost He sees that he will not be lost And waits and looks around him A sense of ocean and old trees Envelops and allures him Tradition touching all he sees Beguiles and reassures him And all her doubts of what he saysAre dimmed with what she knows of days Till even prejudice delays And fades and she secures him The falling leaf inaugurates The reign of her confusion The pounding wave reverberates The dirge of her illusion And home where passion lived and died Becomes a place where she can hide While all the town and harbor side Vibrate with her seclusion We tell you tapping on our brows The story as it should be As if the story of a house Were told or ever could be We ll have no kindly veil betweenHer visions and those we have seen As if we guessed what hers have been Or what they are or would be Meanwhile we do no harm for they That with a god have striven Not hearing much of what we say Take what the god has given Though like waves breaking it may be Or like a changed familiar tree Or like a stairway to the sea Where down the blind are driven
