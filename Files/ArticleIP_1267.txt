of women and the profound changes brought by the women s movement than a dozen tomes filled with psychological jargon Others are drawn to the gossipy details did Graham really sleep with Adlai Stevenson the night before he died and her candor on such subjects as her husband s suicide Time s Richard Zoglin says Graham chronicles her life with more honest self analysis than probably any other media mogul ever Random House touts the book at its site What It Means to Be a Libertarian A Personal Interpretation by Charles Murray Broadway Books Has Charles Murray persuasively reconciled the two conflicting traditions in American conservatism faith in the free market and faith in tradition In the Washington Post Charles Krauthammer says yes Subsequent reviewers disagree N o editor has asked Murray to address the tricky questions that are customarily lobbed at the high school junior who reads his first Ayn Rand novel says James Ledbetter in the Village Voice Libertarianism of Murray s variety is a philosophy for winners for the same reason that Born Free is a song about lions not the animals they prey on says Louis Menand in the New York Review of Books also savaging Murray s facts and his logic Even the conservative Weekly Standard is skeptical The sheer magnitude of the problems that government now fumbles with may militate against Murray s vision of private efforts filling
