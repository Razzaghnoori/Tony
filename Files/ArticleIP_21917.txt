 Sunday To hear Rita Dove read Sunday click Their father was a hunting man Each spring the Easter rabbit sprung open above the bathroom sink drip slowed by the split pink pods of its ears to an intravenous trickle There was the occasional deer though he had no particular taste for venison too stringy he said but made mother smoke it up just in case all four haunches and the ribs Summer always ended with a catfish large as a grown man s thigh severed at the hip thrashing in a tin washtub a mean fish a fish who knew the world was to be endured between mud and the shining hook He avoided easy quarry possum and squirrel complacent carp He wouldn t be caught dead bagging coon coon he said was fickle meat tasted like chicken one night the next like poor man s lobster He d never admit being reduced to eating coon to be called out of his name and into that cartoon It s not surprising they could eat the mess he made of their playground They watched the October hog gutted with grim fury a kind of love gone wrong but oh they adored each whiskery hock each ham slice brushed subterranean green They were eating his misery like bad medicine meant to help them grow They would have done anything not to see his hand jerk like that his belt hissing through the loops and around that fist working inside the coils like an animal gnawing an animal who knows freedom s worth anything you need to leave behind to get to it even your own flesh and blood
