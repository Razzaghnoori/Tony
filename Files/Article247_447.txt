 The Great Stonewall of China Jiang at Harvard is the big story It s the national lead at the New York Times and leads the Los Angeles Times The Washington Post leads with the news that the Republicans have a huge money raising and spending edge over the Democrats for the elections coming up but also gives Jiang plenty of top front coverage The Jiang headlines at both the WP and LAT emphasize his reference to past mistakes while the NYT headline focuses instead on the applause he received during his speech The applause and laughter NYT or cheers WP came when Jiang said his current trip to the U S gave him a more specific understanding of American democracy than he d had previously The protests at Harvard yesterday were the largest there since Vietnam The mistakes came in this way when Jiang was asked why the Communist Party had chosen confrontation over dialogue in 1989 he replied It goes without saying that naturally we may have shortcomings and even make some mistakes in our work however we ve been working on a constant basis to improve our work The Times seems to take the applause as crowd approval of Jiang but isn t it more likely that the crowd was applauding the power of raucous American protest instead Similarly the Post and LAT make much of how Jiang s mention of mistakes was an unprecedented policy concession but since he didn t say anything at all about Tiananmen square or political prisoners when he used the phrase why couldn t it be taken to be no more than the Chinese version of Ronald Reagan s Iran Contra mistakes were made in other words merely a simulated apology not a real one After all within minutes of speaking of mistakes Jiang was adamant in his defense of his country s actions in Tibet Interestingly the NYT doesn t even mention the mistake line According to the papers here s what academic freedom means at Harvard where the president of China is involved The questions asked of Jiang were chosen by a committee of four scholars The Chinese insisted that there be no questions from the floor although Jiang ended up taking two anyway one of the people he called on turned out to be a Newsweek reporter The WP says that the professor moderating all this was almost apologetic when repeating non softball questions A NYT editorial includes a list of former political bigshots who are now against soft money Gerald Ford Jimmy Carter George Bush Bob Dole Howard Baker Bob Michel Bill Brock Alan Simpson and Nancy Kassebaum Baker Isn t it amazing that they all waited to retire before telling us how they really feel The WP reports that the Supreme Court has agreed to address for the first time ever the validity of polygraph evidence The argument isn t coming from prosecutors but from a defendant who claims a polygraph result would have cleared him and hence the current prohibition violates his right to present favorable evidence A front page NYT piece reports an attempt by family farms to create new revenue streams by staging for an admissions fee demonstrations of various farm activities from branding cattle to making cane syrup The Times calls the trend agritainment The NYT reports that a certain segment of the population is furious about the case of the 19 year old woman convicted of killing the baby in her charge and wants to do something about it The International Nanny Association says the Times issued a press release recently with the headline Journalists Make Horrendous Mistake Hurts Entire Multi Million Dollar Industry It s an Au Pair Not Nanny on Trial
