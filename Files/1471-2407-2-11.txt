 Background With breakthroughs in molecular biology basic immunology and biotechnology great progress has been made in the field of tumor immunology An increasing number of tumor antigens have been identified 1 Tumor vaccines have been successful in eliciting tumor specific CD4 and or CD8 T cell responses However when T cells reactive against tumor antigens are expanded ex vivo and then transferred back into tumor bearing hosts results have been mixed in treating both melanoma 2 3 4 and lymphoma 5 6 7 Several explanations for these variable results have been suggested by studies of T cell immunity in mice involving experimental tumors derived from inoculation of cell lines In some circumstances CD4 and CD8 T cells were rendered inactive in tumor bearing hosts 8 The inactivation of CD4 T cells has been attributed either to the tumor cells themselves or to bone marrow derived cells 9 10 11 whereas antigen ignorance or loss of memory have been postulated to underlay that of CD8 T cells 12 13 Other studies have suggested that tumor cells can secrete immunosuppressive factors such as TGF or express Fas ligand to induce apoptosis of infiltrating lymphocytes 14 15 16 Furthermore the tumor vasculature appears to be quite different from normal blood vessels in terms of structural organization interstitial pressure and flow patterns 17 and in reduced lymphocyte and natural killer cell homing and adhesion 18 19 20 21 The existence of significant barriers to effective immunological destruction is further illustrated by a mouse model of concurrent multistage tumorigenesis and anti oncogene autoimmunity wherein progenitor dysplastic lesions are infiltrated and disrupted while solid tumors are not 22 The hypothesis is that the microenvironment of certain types of solid tumor can serve to locally suppress T cell infiltration In such cases one of the challenges for tumor immunology is to find effective means to overcome these barriers to productive efficacious anti tumor immunity Herein we sought to modulate anti tumor immunity in a transgenic mouse tumor model in which an oncogene SV40 large T antigen Tag is expressed in islet beta cells under the control of the rat insulin promoter Rip1 23 Several lines of Rip1 Tag mice have been generated and characterized Depending on the temporal and spatial order of Tag expression the Rip1 Tag mice are either immunologically tolerant or responsive to Tag 24 25 Mice in the Rip1 Tag2 line begin to express Tag during embryogenesis The mice show systemic tolerance to Tag mounting neither humoral nor cellular immune responses to Tag upon immunization of purified protein 25 26 Rip1 Tag2 mice display a reproducible pattern of multistage tumor development from normal islets to hyperplastic dysplastic islets to angiogenic islets to varying grades of solid tumor with a well defined angiogenic progression 27 All Rip1 Tag2 mice succumb to hypoglycemia and tumor burden by 13 16 weeks Mice with transgenes encoding T cell receptors from H 2k restricted CD4 and CD8 T cell clones specific for Tag have been generated 28 29 When Rip1 Tag2 was crossed to TCR transgenic mice TCR1 carrying Tag specific CD4 T cells temporal induction of T cell tolerance to Tag was detected in the pancreatic draining lymph nodes in the double transgenic mice 30 The T cell tolerance is manifested in reductions both of idiotypic CD4 T cell abundance and of the T cell proliferation response to Tag in vitro Another line of Rip Tag mice Rip1 Tag5 has a different spatial and temporal order of Tag expression 24 Tag expression begins at approximately 10 weeks of age Several weeks later a spontaneous autoimmune response to Tag is readily detectable with significant lymphocyte infiltration of hyperplastic dysplastic islets Mice in this line readily mount a humoral and CTL response to Tag and as such are non tolerant Infiltration of premalignant lesions is variable and occasionally intense but is minimal in solid tumors Crosses of Rip1 Tag5 mice to transgenic mice that either increased the abundance of anti Tag CD4 T cells TCR1 28 or rendered the tumor cells co stimulatory Rip B7 1 31 dramatically enhanced the infiltration of premalignant lesions but not of solid tumors 22 Additionally ex vivo stimulated Tag specific CD4 T cells were transferred into Rip1 Tag5 Like many of the adoptive transfers of tumor specific T cells in clinical cases 2 3 4 5 6 7 no significant lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumor was detected 22 If however Rip1 Tag5 mice were treated with lethal radiation and subsequent reconstitution with bone marrow from RAG1 deficient mice prior to T cell transfer modest lymphocyte infiltration into solid tumors was noted 22 however this study did not assess the efficacy of that response Sub lethal irradiation has been successfully used to decrease tumor burden in combination with a cytokine producing tumor vaccine in a murine renal cell carcinoma lung metastases model 32 In the current study we sought to achieve efficacious anti tumor immunity by disrupting the evident barriers presented by solid tumors in the Rip Tag model We chose the Rip1 Tag2 line for its phenotype of rapid largely synchronous tumorigenesis and its systemic tolerance reasoning that effects of experimental manipulations could be readily distinguished Lethal dose radiation followed by bone marrow transplant can significantly impair the responsiveness of anti tumor CD8 T cells dendritic cells eosinophiles and macrophages 8 and is a clinically undesirable therapeutic modality Therefore we hypothesized that sub lethal radiation might be more effective and clinically acceptable in promoting anti tumor immunity The results presented in this study suggest that sub lethal radiation is effective in augmenting adoptive anti tumor immunity in the Rip1 Tag2 model underscoring the potential value of perturbing the tumor microenvironment as well as the lymphoid compartment to enhance anti tumor immunity Materials and methods Mice Rip1 Tag2 mice carry the SV40 early region under control of rat insulin II promoter 23 The transgenic mice were maintained on C3HeBFe background with 39 40 generations of backcross Rip1 Tag2 mice have 100 incidence of spontaneous insulinoma Tag TCR1 referred to hereafter as TCR transgenic mice expressing a T cell receptor transgene with specificity to Tag were generated in the B6D2F1 background and backcrossed to C3HeBFe for 20 generations 28 About 10 of the splenic CD4 T cells in this transgenic line express the TCR transgene 28 All Rip1 Tag2 in all treatment groups received the same diet throughout the experiment All experimental procedures were conducted in accordance with NIH and University of California San Francisco guidelines Intervention and regression trials The Intervention trial was initiated when Rip1 Tag2 mice reached the age of 10 weeks Mice were sacrificed at 13 weeks of age for the determination of tumor burden The Regression Trial started at the age of 12 6 weeks about 88 days after birth The end point was at 16 weeks of age In both cases cohorts of Rip1 Tag2 mice were set up for survival study Mice were euthanized when they became moribund Radiation of mice Rip1 Tag2 mice at the specifically defined age were irradiated in the Mark I model 68A cesium 137 irradiator J L Shepherd Associates San Fernando CA The dosage used was 600R 6 Gy Adoptive transfer of cells Splenocytes from TCR or non transgenic C3H mice were isolated The cells were briefly hemolyzed washed extensively in DMEM containing 10 FBS filtered through a 100 M sterile nylon filter counted by hemacytometer and suspended in complete medium The cells were adjusted to a density of 1 10 8cells ml and injected into the intraperitoneal space of Rip1 Tag2 mice Each mouse in the treatment received 1 ml of splenocytes 1 10 8cells In the group that received both radiation and splenocyte transfer mice were irradiated at 600R one day prior to splenocyte transfer Calculation of tumor burden Rip1 Tag2 mice in each treatment were sacrificed at the defined end points Solid tumors were isolated photographed and measured The tumor volume was calculated using the following formula volume 0 52 width 2 length Tumor burden per mouse was defined as the sum of the volume of all macroscopic tumors Intestinal carcinoid tumors appear occasionally in Rip1 Tag2 mice Such tumors are associated with this particular line of Rip Tag transgenic mice but not others and were not the result of any of the treatments in the study Thus these extra pancreatic tumors were recorded but not included in the calculations in the current study Tissue preparation and immunohistochemistry All histological analyses were done on frozen sections Samples were fresh frozen in Tissue Tek O C T compound Sakura Finetek Torrance CA USA and sectioned at 10 M thickness For immunohistochemistry sections were briefly fixed in cold acetone They were then blocked for 1 h in PBS with 5 normal goat serum Slides were incubated at room temperature for 1 h with the primary antibodies The samples were washed extensively in PBS and then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies Vector Laboratories Burlingame CA Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched with 0 6 H 2 O 2 methanol for 4 minutes Color on sections was developed with ABC horseradish peroxidase Vector Laboratories and 3 3 diaminobenzidine substrate Sigma St Louis MO H E staining was performed with hamatoxylin Gill 3 and eosin Y Sigma The following

Statistical analysis Tumor burden was analyzed using the Mann Whitney test InStat version 1 12 GraphPad Software Survival data was analyzed with a log rank test Prizm 3 0 A GraphPad software Results Combinatorial efficacy of adoptive transfer and sub lethal radiation We used two distinctive therapeutic trial designs for the treatment of tumors Rip1 Tag2 mice intervention and regression 33 In each trial we used three experimental arms as well as an untreated control group the treatment arms were adoptive transfer of tumor antigen specific T cells a sub lethal dose of radiation 600R or radiation followed by adoptive transfer In the intervention trial treatment occurred at a time when small encapsulated adenomas are forming week 10 for Rip1 Tag2 mice The data are summarized in Figure 1 The mean tumor volume at the start of the trial was 3 mm 3 The average number of tumors was 2 4 At the end of the study the mean tumor burden in the untreated control group was about 34 mm 3in volume and 7 6 in tumor number Adoptive transfer of splenocytes from TCR transgenic mice into Rip1 Tag2 mice produced a modest but not statistically significant reduction in tumor volume 35 and no change in tumor number Sub lethal radiation alone significantly reduced tumor volume 53 p 0 03 but the mice had a similar number of tumors 6 4 With the combination treatment a significant reduction in both tumor volume 87 p 0 0004 and tumor number was observed It is notable that the mice receiving the combination treatment had a mean tumor volume of 4 6 mm 3 p 0 0004 and an average tumor number of 2 3 comparable to the situation at the beginning of the trial Thus a condition of stable disease was achieved in the group that received the combinatorial therapy In the regression trial RIP1 Tag2 mice with substantial tumor burden and minimal life expectancy were treated beginning at week 13 33 The average tumor volume was around 22 mm 3at the start of the treatment Figure 2 The tumor burden of the untreated control group at the end of the study was 146 mm 3 No reduction in tumor burden was observed following adoptive transfer of non transgenic splenocytes alone 132 of controls In contrast sub lethal radiation alone resulted in a significant reduction of tumor burden 63 p 0 01 The combinatorial treatment produced an even greater reduction in tumor burden 80 p 0 0009 The average tumor number in all groups was similar about 8 As observed in the intervention trial tumor burden in the group receiving the combinatorial treatment had remained virtually unchanged Thus even with substantial tumor burden the combination of sub lethal radiation and splenocyte transfer could stop tumor growth during the course of the study Sub lethal radiation increases lymphocyte infiltration of tumors Because the combination of sub lethal radiation and TCR splenocyte transfer lead to significant reduction in tumor burden in both intervention and regression trials we asked whether the radiation had increased the number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes Tissue samples were collected three weeks after treatment in the regression trial Immunohistochemistry was used to detect CD4 CD8 and CD11c cell infiltration into the tumors Because Rip1 Tag2 mice are inherently tolerant to Tag little infiltration by either T lymphocytes or dendritic cells was observed in the untreated control group Figure 3 In agreement with previous observations little infiltration was detected in Rip1 Tag2 mice receiving TCR splenocyte transfer Figure 3 Nor did radiation alone elicit T cell infiltration although a modest increase in CD11c dendritic cell infiltration was observed However in both intervention and regression trials significant CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell infiltration into hyperplastic dysplastic islets and tumors was noted in Rip1 Tag2 mice that had received the combination of sub lethal radiation and adoptive transfer of TCR splenocytes A modest increase in CD11c dendritic cell infiltration was observed in the mice receiving the combination therapy One should recall that the TCR mice express a CD4 restricted TCR and thus produce increased numbers of anti Tag CD4 T cells and thus we anticipated a bias in numbers toward this T cell type Indeed one week after treatment little CD8 T infiltration of premalignant or malignant lesions was detected in Rip1 Tag2 mice receiving the combinatorial treatment data not shown However three weeks after combinatorial treatment in the regression trial significant CD8 T cell infiltration was observed in solid tumors suggesting a broadening of the T cell response from that contained in the adoptive transfer Combining adoptive transfer and sub lethal radiation prolongs survival The trials above used defined endpoints 12 6 week and 16 week to allow comparison of cumulative tumor volume and number To evaluate the effects of the various treatments on survival we performed intervention and regression trials on cohorts of Rip1 Tag2 mice in which groups received no treatment radiation alone or the combinatorial treatment in which the endpoint was survival Because splenocyte transfer alone had resulted in no significant reduction in tumor burden this group was not tested for survival benefit for logistical reasons All Rip1 Tag2 mice in the study eventually succumbed to their cancers Although radiation treatment alone impaired tumor growth in both intervention and regression trials it produced no significant extension of survival time in either trial Figure 4 In contrast there was a significant extension of survival of cohorts receiving the combinatorial treatment in the intervention and regression trials The effect was pronounced in the intervention trial with an extension of survival of 5 weeks p 0 0001 log rank In the regression trial the extension of survival time was about 3 weeks p 0 001 log rank No extension of survival time was observed in mice treated with 600R and syngeneic C3H splenocytes p 0 6893 log rank Thus the observed reduction of tumor burden produced by the combinatorial treatment translated into significant survival advantage and the effect was dependent on the increased frequency of tumor antigen specific T cells from the TCR transgenic Because the single combination treatment lead to clear therapeutic benefits and yet did not eradicate established tumors we asked whether mice would benefit from repeated treatments Both intervention and regression trials were conducted Rip1 Tag2 mice were given the combination treatment at 10 weeks and again at 13 weeks of age for an intervention trial or at 13 and 16 weeks for a regression trial Survival was monitored over time The results show no added survival benefit when the treatment regimen was repeated Figure 4 The mean survival time was statistically equivalent to that observed in the groups given a single combinatorial treatment in the intervention trial and in the regression trial the cohort given a double combinatorial treatment showed no significant extension of survival time as compared to untreated controls p 0 07 log rank Discussion Previous studies using lethal dose radiation and bone marrow transplant prior to CD4 T cell transfer in another Rip Tag line of mice indicated that such treatment could produce a modest increase in the number of tumor infiltrating T cells 22 The current study extends the thesis by focusing on the use of sub lethal radiation to enhance the anti tumor immunity of adoptively transferred tumor antigen specific lymphocytes in Rip1 Tag2 mice The splenocytes were derived from T cell receptor transgenic mice that preferentially enhanced development of CD4 T cells recognizing a peptide within the SV40 large T oncoprotein 28 While the transfer of naive splenocytes from the TCR transgenic mice had no effect on tumor development sub lethal radiation prior to lymphocyte transfer resulted in significant reduction in tumor burden in both intervention and regression trials In addition Rip1 Tag2 mice receiving the combinatorial treatment had significantly longer survival time than those receiving single treatment Immunohistochemical analysis indicates that the combinatorial treatment dramatically increased the level of infiltration by CD4 lymphocytes and CD11c dendritic cells into solid tumors Due to the nature of this line of TCR transgenic mice only about 10 of splenic CD4 T cells are Tag specific Thus it is possible that some of the tumor infiltrating CD4 T cells may recognize targets other than Tag This may be the result of the bystander effects induced by the tumor infiltrating Tag specific CD4 T cells The elucidation of this phenomenon with idiotype specific antibodies or tetramers in future experiments would clarify the extent of bystander effects in this model Although delayed when compared to CD4 T cell infiltration CD8 T cell infiltration became more extensive over time We speculate that the tumor infiltrating CD4 T cells would induce the activation and tumor infiltration of CD8 T cells present in the transferred transgenic splenocytes This pattern as well as the origin of the splenocytes suggests that CD4 T cells can play a predominant and effective role in controlling tumor growth Previous studies have indicated that solid tumors can be resistant to the infiltration of tumor specific T cells The data presented here suggest that such resistance can be disrupted by sub lethal radiation Several possible mechanisms for the enhancing effects of sub lethal radiation on anti tumor immunity can be envisioned as discussed below First sub lethal radiation may reduce antigen specific immune tolerance mediated by bone marrow derived cells including regulatory T cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes Previous studies have shown that adoptively transferred tumor antigen specific CD4 T cells can be tolerized in the secondary lymphoid organs 9 34 including the RIP Tag2 model 30 Radiation may kill or disable regulatory T cells 35 36 or other bone marrow derived tolerizing cells and prevent the induction of tolerance in adoptively transferred tumor specific T cells 9 Additionally the high but sub lethal dose of radiation used leads to significant lymphopenia 37 The sudden reduction in lymphocyte number may create the spatial allowance in spleen and lymph nodes necessary for the homing activation and expansion of he adoptively transferred T cells The increase of tumor specific CD4 T cells in the tumor draining lymph nodes could then enhance the infiltration of T cells inside the solid tumors Second radiation induced damage or abnormality may induce a tissue damage signal in the solid tumors through radiation mediated apoptosis 38 There is mounting evidence that apoptotic cell death is not immunologically benign but can trigger immune responses 39 40 For example cells treated with ultraviolet radiation can provide potent adjuvant function in vivo 41 Sub lethal radiation could result in altered expression of pro or anti inflammatory chemokines 42 43 44 or increased expression of T cell co stimlulatory molecules i e B7 1 on tumor cells 45 Radiation has been shown to increase the expression of MHC class I and II molecules in tumor cell lines 46 47 Thus the tissue damage signals evoked by ionizing radiation may trigger the activation and infiltration of antigen presenting cells in particular dendritic cells 38 48 49 50 Indeed in the regression study we observe some increase of tumor infiltrating dendritic cells in the group receiving the single radiation treatment It is possible that radiation induced tumor infiltrating dendritic cells may facilitate sustained activation and infiltration of the adoptively transferred CD4 T cells in solid tumors in the combination group Third radiation may alter the biophysical structures of tumors which in some tumors has the capability to impair the infiltration or function of tumor specific T cells For example in the related Rip1 Tag5 model the vascular addressins GlyCAM 1 and MAdCAM 1 are expressed in pre malignant islets but down regulated in solid tumors their downregulation coincides with lack of infiltration in this model of spontaneous anti tumor immunity 19 It is possible that sub lethal radiation is altering the expression of endothelial adhesion molecules allowing binding and extravasation of activated tumor specific lymphocytes Another study suggested that liver endothelial cells can induce antigen specific tolerance of CD8 T cells 51 Perhaps RIP Tag tumor endothelium develops a similar capability to induce tolerance to extravasating CD4 T cells a capability disrupted by radiation Finally it is worth noting that the tumors in Rip1 Tag2 mice are not only highly vascularized but also visibly and histologically hemorraghic The hemorraghic phenotype persisted in all single agent trials but the combination trial was distinct The mice in the combination treatment group typically had white tumors that lacked visible microhemorrhaging A recent study has suggested that tumor specific CD4 T cells can exert anti tumor effects by inhibiting angiogenesis via release of IFN 11 Thus the white tumors noted in the current study may be indicative of angiogenic inhibition by the infiltrating tumor specific CD4 T cells and such inhibition may be relevant to the observed efficacy An analysis of the tumor vasculature in the combination trial by immunohistochemical staining for the endothelial cell marker CD31 revealed no obvious structural or density changes in tumor blood vessels data not shown Future analysis of molecular markers of the tumor vasculature during and after the combinatorial treatment will explore the possibility that more subtle vascular changes are responsible for the observed efficacy While the underlying mechanisms remain unknown it is evident that a combination of sub lethal radiation and the transfer of tumor specific CD4 lymphocytes can have a synergistic effect on tumor regression While the anti tumor effect of the combinatorial treatment does not completely resolve tumor burden and the mice eventually succumb it is important to recognize that the Rip1 Tag2 mice are a very stringent system for assaying immunotherapies because of the multifocal nature of tumor progression in these mice Because the Tag oncogene is expressed in all of the 500 000 pancreatic cells each of 400 islets can be considered an independent pre malignant focus Hence the immunotherapy tested herein would have to destroy all neoplastic foci to affect a complete cure which is perhaps too much to expect our view is that the stringency of this system has advantages as a readout for therapeutic strategies in the observed efficacy may be more predictive of responses in the clinic that those observed with subcutaneous tumors We expect that clarification of the underlying mechanism may provide avenues to improved therapeutic strategies based on the concept of disrupting the evident barriers to effective anti tumor immunity erected by solid tumors We suggest that the combinatorial approach presented here merits consideration in the design of
