while Yousef was undergoing training KSM adds that between 1993 and 1996 he traveled to China the Philippines Pakistan Bosnia a second time Brazil Sudan and Malaysia Most if not all of this travel appears to have been related to his abiding interest in carrying out terrorist operations Although KSM claims that Sheikh Abdallah was not a member financier or supporter of al Qaeda he admits that

to escape to Pakistan but his accomplice Murad whom KSM claims to have sent to Yousef with 3 000 to help fund the operation was arrested and disclosed details of the plot while under interrogation Contrary to Murad s confession in which he described his intended role as one of the five operatives who would plant bombs on board the targeted aircraft KSM has said that Murad s role was limited to carrying the 3 000 from Dubai to Manila Intelligence reports interrogations of KSM Feb 19 2004 two reports Feb 24 2004 Apr 2 2004 This aspect of KSM s account is not credible as it conflicts not just with Murad s confession but also with physical evidence tying Murad to the very core of the plot and with KSM s own statements elsewhere that Murad was involved in planning and executing the operation Intelligence reports interrogations of KSM Aug 18 2003 Jan 9 2004 Feb 24 2004 in which KSM also claims that while he was in Qatar in February 1995 he and Yousef consulted by telephone regarding the

13 Probably inflating his own role KSM says he and a small group of colleagues including Yousef and Wali Khan were among the earliest advocates of attacking the United States KSM asserts that Bin

2 2004 After 9 11 some Philippine government officials claimed that while in Philippine custody in February 1995 KSM s Manila air plot co conspirator Abdul Hakim Murad had confessed having discussed with Yousef the idea of attacking targets including the World Trade Center with hijacked commercial airliners flown by U S trained Middle Eastern pilots See Peter Lance 1000 Years for Revenge International Terrorism and the FBI the Untold Story HarperCollins 2003 pp 278 280 In Murad s initial taped confession he referred to an idea of crashing a plane into CIA headquarters Lance gave us his copy of an apparent 1995 Philippine National Police document on an interrogation of Murad That document reports Murad describing his idea of crashing a plane into CIA headquarters but in this report Murad claims he was thinking of hijacking a commercial aircraft to do it saying the idea had come up in a casual conversation with Yousef with no specific plan for its execution We have seen no pre 9 11 evidence that Murad referred in interrogations to the training of other pilots or referred in this casual conversation to targets other than the CIA According to Lance the Philippine police officer who after 9 11 offered the much more elaborate account of Murad s statements reported in Lance s book claims to have passed this added information to U S officials But Lance states the Philippine officer declined to identify these officials Peter Lance interview Mar 15 2004 If such information was provided to a U S official we have seen no indication that it was written down or

comment Why do you use an axe when you can use a bulldozer Intelligence report interrogation of Abu Zubaydah May 16 2003 The only possible corroboration we have found for Abu Zubaydah s statement is Khallad s suggestion that Bin Ladin may have expanded KSM s original idea for an attack using planes Intelligence report interrogation of Khallad Apr 22 2004 Neither Abu Zubaydah nor Khallad claims to

value without the use of a negotiable instrument or other commonly recognized method for the exchange of money For example a U S resident who wanted to send money to a person in another country such as Pakistan would give her money in dollars to a U S based hawaladar The U S hawaladar would then contact his counterpart in Pakistan giving the Pakistani hawaladar the particulars of the transaction such as the amount of money the code and perhaps the identity of the recipient The ultimate recipient in Pakistan would then go to the Pakistani hawaladar and receive his money in rupees from whatever money the Pakistani hawaladar has on hand As far as the sender and ultimate recipient are concerned the transaction is then complete The two hawaladars would have a variety of mechanisms to settle their debt either through offsetting transactions e g someone in Pakistan sending money to the United States using the same two hawaladars a periodic settling wire transfer from the U S hawaladar s bank to the Pakistani hawaladar s bank or a commercial transaction such as the U S hawaladar paying a debt or an invoice in dollars that the Pakistani hawaladar owes in the United States Hawalas typically do not have a large central control office for settling transactions maintaining instead a loose association with other hawaladars to transfer value generally without any formal or legally

allegations of insider trading in advance of 9 11 generally rest on reports of unusual pre 9 11 trading activity in companies whose stock plummeted after the attacks Some unusual trading did in fact occur but each such trade proved to have an innocuous explanation For example the volume of put options investments that pay off only when a stock drops in price surged in the parent companies of United Airlines on September 6 and American Airlines on September 10 highly suspicious trading on its face Yet further investigation has revealed that the trading had no connection with 9 11 A single U S based institutional investor with no conceivable ties to al Qaeda purchased 95 percent of the UAL puts on September 6 as part of a trading strategy that also included buying 115 000 shares of American on September 10 Similarly much of the seemingly suspicious trading in American on September 10 was traced to a specific U S based options trading newsletter faxed to its subscribers on Sunday September 9 which recommended these trades These examples typify the evidence examined by the investigation The SEC and the FBI aided by other agencies and the securities industry devoted enormous resources to investigating this issue including securing the cooperation of many foreign governments These investigators have found that the apparently suspicious consistently proved innocuous Joseph

Breen interview Apr 23 2004 Ed G interview Feb 3 2004 131 The hijackers spent more than 270 000 in the United States and the costs associated with Moussaoui were at least 50 000 The additional expenses included travel to obtain passports and visas travel to the United States expenses incurred by the plot leaders and facilitators and the expenses incurred by the people selected to be hijackers who ultimately did not participate For many of these expenses we have only fragmentary evidence and or unconfirmed detainee reports and can make only a rough estimate of costs The 400 000 to 500 000 estimate does not include the cost of running training camps in Afghanistan where the hijackers were recruited and trained or the marginal cost of the training itself Finally the architect of the plot KSM put the total cost at approximately 400 000 apparently excluding Moussaoui s expenses Intelligence reports interrogations of KSM June 3 2003 Apr 5 2004 Our investigation has uncovered no evidence that the 9 11 conspirators employed hawala as a means to move the money that funded the operation Indeed the surviving plot participants have either not mentioned hawala or have explicitly

trusted third parties or out of the formal financial system by 1998 Even if OFAC had received better intelligence from the intelligence community it would have been powerless to stop the bulk of the

little quality intelligence was produced Ed G interview Feb 3 2004 Some attributed the problem to the CIA s separation of terrorist financing analysis from other counterterrorism activities Within the Directorate of Intelligence a group was devoted to the analysis of all financial issues including terrorist financing Called the Office of Transnational Issues OTI Illicit Transaction Groups ITG it dealt with an array of issues besides terrorist financing including drug trafficking drug money laundering alien smuggling sanctions and corruption ITG was not part of the CTC although it rotated a single analyst to CTC Moreover OTI analysts were separated from the operational side of terrorist financing at CTC which planned operations against banks and financial facilitators William Wechsler

the CIA as believing that financial tracking had limited utility Treasury memo Mat Burrows to O Neill Your PC on Counterterrorism on 4 September Sept 4 2001 National Security Advisor Rice told us she and her staff had determined by spring 2001 that terrorist financing proposals were a good option so Treasury continued to plan to establish an office for 24 financing analysts Condoleezza Rice meeting Feb 7 2004 In fact as noted above Treasury failed to follow through on the establishment of the FTATC until after 9 11 89 This assessment is based on an extensive review of FBI files and interviews with agents and supervisors at FBI Headquarters and various field offices 90 Although there was an increased focus on money laundering several significant legislative and regulatory initiatives designed to close vulnerabilities in the U S financial system failed to gain traction Some of these such as a move to control foreign banks with accounts in the United States died as a result of banking industry pressure Others such as the regulation of money remitters within the United States were mired in bureaucratic inertia and a general antiregulatory environment In any event it is an open question whether such legislative or regulatory initiatives would have significantly harmed al Qaeda which generally made little use of the U S financial system to move or store its money 91 Treasury report The 2001 National Money Laundering Strategy Sept 2001 92 NSC email Berger s office to executive secretaries Millennium Alert After Action Review Mar 9 2000 93 PDD 62

continued for months On the CIA side see for example CIA briefing materials DDO Update May 22 26 2000 at which the DCI was told that unless funding was identified within the next 10 days the military

reconsider DOJ s denial of the FBI s original counterterrorism budget request in light of the continuing threat It was not uncommon for FBI budget requests to be reduced by the attorney general or by OMB before being submitted to Congress this had occurred during the previous administration 234 In chapter 3 we discuss how this problem arose By 2001 it had become worse During 2000 the FBI had erred in preparing some of its applications for FISA surveillance misstating how much information had been shared with criminal prosecutors and the nature of the walls between the intelligence and law enforcement functions within the FBI In March 2001 Judge Royce Lamberth chief judge of the FISA Court chastised the FBI sending a letter to Ashcroft announcing he was banning an offending supervisory agent from appearing before the court Judge Lamberth also met personally with Ashcroft and his acting deputy Robert Mueller to complain about the performance of the FBI and the Office of Intelligence Policy and Review OIPR Judge Lamberth letter to Ashcroft Mar 9 2001 John Ashcroft interview Dec 17 2003 In May 2001 Ashcroft altered the FISA application process to ensure greater accuracy See DOJ memo Ashcroft to Freeh The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA Process May 18 2001 In July 2001 the General Accounting Office criticized the way the 1995 procedures were being applied and criticized OIPR and FBI for not complying with the information sharing requirements of the 1995 procedures This was the third report in as many years by a government agency indicating that the procedures were not working as planned In October 2000 December 2000 and March 2001 proposals for reform to the 1995 procedures were put forth by senior DOJ officials None resulted in reform One impediment was that the respective DOJ components could not agree on all the proposed reforms A second impediment was a concern that such reforms would require a challenge to the FISA Court s position on the matter This was considered risky because the FISA Court of Review had never convened and one of the judges had previously voiced skepticism regarding the constitutionality of the FISA statute Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson did ask the court to accept the modifications described in the text which were distributed as part of his August 2001 memorandum reaffirming the 1995 procedures

14 2003 4 Intelligence report interrogation of KSM Aug 18 2003 According to Hambali in late 1999 or early 2000 KSM sent an al Qaeda operative named Issa al Britani to visit Hambali in Malaysia At the end of the visit Issa provided Hambali with two addresses one in the United States possibly in California and one in South Africa and told Hambali he could contact people in those locations if he needed help Hambali claims he never contacted anyone at either address or passed either address to anyone else and claims not to remember the addresses Intelligence report interrogation of Hambali Sept 12 2003 In an assessment of KSM s reporting the CIA concluded that protecting operatives in the United States appeared to be a major part of KSM s resistance efforts For example in response to questions about U S zip codes found in his notebooks KSM provided the less than satisfactory explanation that he was planning to use the zip codes to open new email accounts CIA report Intelligence

Cole attack we discussed in chapter 5 This speculation was based on reporting that Khallad was in the United States in June 2000 and was seen in the company of Fahad alThumairy an imam at the mosque FBI electronic communication investigation of Cole bombing interview of witness Mar 19 2003 CIA cable source reporting Mar 18 2003 Neither we nor the FBI have found any travel documentation establishing Khallad s presence in the United States at any time We doubt that the person allegedly seen with Thumairy actually was Khallad 10 Patrick J McDonnell Saudi Envoy in L A Is Deported Los

hear him preach at the King Fahd mosque deny that he promoted extremism Sami A Mekhemar interview Apr 21 2004 Interview Apr 23 2004 Despite the disparate views as to whether Thumairy qualified as an extremist while he was in Los Angeles it does appear that both the Saudi Arabian government and the leadership of the mosque attempted to discipline him in the summer of 2002 and early 2003 for espousing extremist views Thumairy denies incurring any such disciplinary measures Fahad al Thumairy interviews Feb 23 25 2004 FBI letterhead memorandum investigation of Mohammed bin Suleiman al

visited the mosque frequently and was very close to radical followers of Thumairy FBI electronic communication Fahad Althumairy Oct 25 2002 14 We have checked for example the records for apartments where Thumairy is known to have placed Saudi visitors during 2001 The most intriguing lead concerns an Arabic speaking taxicab driver Qualid Benomrane who was arrested on immigration charges in early 2002 When asked to look at a series of photographs that included the 19 hijackers involved in the 9 11 attacks Benomrane responded ambiguously seeming first to pick out the photographs of Hazmi and Mihdhar but then denying that he recognized them Later in the interview Benomrane told the FBI about driving two Saudis around Los Angeles and to San Diego s Sea World after being introduced to them by Thumairy at the King Fahd mosque before 9 11 According to Benomrane someone at the consulate had asked Thumairy to assist the two Saudis who had recently arrived in Los Angeles and had moved to an apartment near the mosque FBI electronic communication Fahad Althumairy Sept 4 2002 Ashour E interview May 20 2004 FBI reports of investigation interviews of Qualid Moncef Benomrane Mar 7 2002 Mar 13 2002 May 23 2002 Working with agencies of the U S government we have attempted to locate and interview Benomrane overseas since he was deported in 2002 After checking many possible avenues of corroboration for this story our investigation has not substantiated the hypothesis that Benomrane s two Saudis were Hazmi and Mihdhar In fact we have established that Benomrane did not obtain a taxi license or even a driver s license until months after he could be supposed to have chauffeured Hazmi and Mihdhar Moreover before his deportation Benomrane described the two Saudis as sons of a sick father who was seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles Ibid We have found evidence corroborating this account 15 FBI document made available to the Commission Caysan Bin Don interview Apr 20 2004

the mosque For Bayoumi s visits to Los Angeles see FBI report of investigation recovery of hotel records Jan 15 2002 Although Bayoumi might deny visiting the mosque on February 1 to conceal some

officially employed by Ercan a subsidiary of a contractor for the Saudi Civil Aviation Administration although a fellow employee described Bayoumi as a ghost employee noting that he was one of many Saudis on the payroll who was not required to work In April 2000 Bayoumi received a promotion and his status was also adjusted from single to married despite the fact that he was already married As a result his salary was raised and his other allowances stipend increased significantly from approximately 465 to 3 925 a month remaining at that level until December 2000 In January 2001 the stipend

Bayoumi interview Oct 16 17 2003 According to Bayoumi he originally intended to hold the party at his own apartment but moved it to the hijackers apartment when one of the guests created an awkward

maintains that a visiting sheikh was the party s principal honoree Ibid Although Bin Don has recalled that the party was intended to welcome Hazmi and Mihdhar to the community this is belied by the
