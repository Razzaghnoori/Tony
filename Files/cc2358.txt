 Introduction Infections with resistant organisms represent a serious menace in critically ill patients As options for effective chemotherapy diminish intensive care unit ICU mortality will increase Mortality rates as high as 60 have been reported for serious infections ventilator associated pneumonia VAP bloodstream infections with inappropriate initial treatment 1 2 3 4 5 6 In a recent study 7 inadequate antimicrobial treatment of infection was an important and independent determinant of mortality in critically ill patients In that series patients receiving inadequate treatment had an in hospital mortality rate of 52 1 as compared with 12 2 in those patients who were adequately treated The increasing prevalence of multiresistant Gram negative strains in ICUs has recently rekindled interest in colistin 8 9 10 11 12 a bactericidal antibiotic that was used in the 1960s for treatment of infections caused by Gram negative bacilli A high incidence of adverse effects nephrotoxicity neurotoxicity along with the development of newer effective drugs with better safety profiles resulted in the practical abandonment of systemic use of colistin although it still remains active in vitro against practically all strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp The presence of multiresistant P aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains in our ICU prompted us to try treatment with colistin as a last resort in patients with serious infections with such strains Here we report 3 years of experience with intravenous colistin in the treatment of Gram negative sepsis Patients and method We studied critically ill patients with sepsis caused by Gram negative bacilli resistant to all antibiotics with the exception of colistin The patients were treated in a six bed ICU in a trauma hospital Diagnosis of infection was based on clinical data and the isolation of bacteria either from a normally sterile site or from quantitative cultures of tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage More specifically the clinical prerequisites for the diagnosis of VAP were as follows presence of at least two of fever 38 3 C leukocytosis or leukopenia and purulent bronchial secretions and a new and persistent infiltrate on chest radiography On isolation of strains of P aeruginosa and A baumannii that were resistant to all antibiotics apart from colistin intravenous colistin sulfomethate sodium Colistin Norma Athens Greece was initiated at the discretion of the attending physician The dosage of colistin administered intravenously was 3 MU three times daily adjusted for creatinine clearance 10 Susceptibility testing was done using an automated broth microdilution test Vitek bioM rieux Durham NC USA The breakpoints for susceptibility were those recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Susceptibility to colistin was tested using the disk diffusion method with a 10 g colistin disk Oxoid Ltd Basingstoke Hants UK Isolated bacilli were considered susceptible if the inhibition zone was 11 mm or greater Results In all 28 patients were treated with colistin In 16 cases colistin was part of the initial empiric regimen based on previous surveillance cultures with subsequent cultures confirming the sensitivity pattern For the remaining patients colistin was introduced when culture results became available in those who had not responded to the initial empiric regimen Four of the 28 patients died within 48 hours of the initiation of colistin these patients were not included in the analysis because they were not considered true therapeutic failures Data on the remaining 24 patients are presented in Table 1 The mean age of the patients was 44 3 years and the mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II score was 20 6 In five patients multiple organ failure was present at the initiation of colistin A total of 26 courses of colistin were given for the following infections VAP 15 cases empyema thoracis one case post traumatic meningitis one case sinusitis one case urinary tract infection one case catheter related sepsis three cases and sepsis of unknown primary origin four cases The offending pathogen was P aeruginosa in 20 cases and A baumannii in six In six cases a co pathogen was isolated Median duration of treatment with colistin was 13 5 days range 4 24 days In all cases a second antibiotic ceftazidime in 16 piperacillin tazobactam in six and a carbapenem in four cases was added to the therapeutic regimen despite documented resistance Clinical response judged as abatement of fever for at least 48 hours with parallel improvement in vital signs was observed for 17 of the 26 treatments In two patients with septic shock one hypothermic and the other with low grade fever it was possible to stop vasopressors in the following 48 hours and this was also considered proof of response Thus clinical response was seen for 19 out of 26 treatments with colistin 73 Survival at 30 days was 57 7 In the subgroup of patients with bacteremia 11 patients an initial clinical response to colistin was observed in seven patients and the ICU mortality was 54 5 Additional blood culture data after initiation of colistin were available in two of the clinical responders and bacterial eradication was confirmed in both In the subgroup of patients with VAP 11 out of 15 patients 73 3 had an initial clinical response to colistin bacterial eradication was observed in eight 53 3 and ICU mortality was 40 Three patients had already developed acute renal failure at the initiation of treatment with colistin and were being treated with continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration CVVHD None of them survived The other patients had a serum creatinine below 2 5 mg dl with one exception a patient with serum creatinine 3 2 mg dl and all had adequate diuresis Only patients 8 17 and 24 14 3 had an increase in serum creatinine of greater than 1 mg dl during treatment with no serious consequences in patients 8 and 17 Only patient 24 developed anuria and serious impairment in renal function requiring CVVHD Table 2 No patient developed clinically apparent neuromuscular transmission blockade Discussion Colistin is a cationic polypeptide antibiotic of the polymyxin family that is rapidly bactericidal to Gram negative bacteria The action of colistin is by a detergent like mechanism interfering with the structure and function of the outer cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria and resulting in bacterial death 11 13 It is administered as colistin sulfomethate sodium and its hydrolysis releases the active drug It is removed by glomerular filtration 10 Colistin remains active in vitro against almost all strains of P aeruginosa Klebsiella pneumoniae Acinetobacter spp and Enterobacter spp On the other hand Proteus spp Providencia spp Serratia spp Burkholderia cepacia and some strains of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia are usually resistant to colistin 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 Cross resistance with other antibiotics has not been reported 10 13 and acquired resistance is rare 11 17 Although lower susceptibility rates for P aeruginosa have been reported in patients with cystic fibrosis undergoing chronic prophylactic treatment with inhaled colistin 18 81 of strains of P aeruginosa from such patients are still susceptible to colistin 14 With regard to clinical efficacy data are limited In the 1960s the drug administered mostly via the intramuscular route was found to be of use in the treatment of infections with Gram negative bacteria resistant to other antibiotics Response was better in patients with bloodstream infections resulting from urinary tract infection Colistin was less effective in patients with osteomyelitis biliary tract disease endocarditis and suppurative infections of the lung probably because of suboptimal concentrations locally and it was ineffective in the treatment of Gram negative infections in neutropenic patients 10 11 13 In recent years intravenous colistin has occasionally been used in acute exacerbations of multiresistant P aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis 19 20 21 With regard to adult patients without cystic fibrosis treated with colistin an observational study 9 reported a clinical response rate of 58 In that study the drug was used in 59 patients with serious infections with A baumannii 65 and P aeruginosa 35 resistant to all other antibiotics Of the patients studied 65 were critically ill and the mean APACHE II score was 13 1 Response was suboptimal 25 in patients with pneumonia Recently Garnacho Montero and coworkers 12 reported the only controlled study of colistin in patients without cystic fibrosis Patients with VAP caused by A baumannii were treated with imipenem 21 patients or in the case of resistance to all other antibiotics with colistin 14 patients APACHE II scores at presentation and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores at the time of diagnosis of VAP were similar between the groups Achieving clinical cure in 57 of cases intravenous colistin was as effective as imipenem No significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of crude mortality VAP attributed mortality microbiologic cure or duration of ICU stay Limitations of that study are the small number of patients included open design and lack of randomization Clinical response in the present study was somewhat better than in the study conducted by Levin and coworkers 9 despite a higher mean APACHE II score The observed 30 day mortality rate of 42 3 in the present study is certainly high but not unexpectedly so for the severity of illness Because mortality rates in the region of 50 60 have been reported in critically ill patients receiving inappropriate treatment 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 the use of colistin may indeed have been of clinical benefit in our patients Both the study by Levin and coworkers 9 and a study of an experimental pneumonia model with Acinetobacter sp in immunocompetent mice 22 suggest that despite good in vitro activity the clinical efficacy of colistin may be suboptimal in Gram negative pneumonia On the other hand Garnacho Montero and coworkers 12 reported that colistin was not inferior to the standard treatment for VAP caused by A baumannii with a clinical cure rate of 57 Results were rather better in our patients with VAP in whom a clinical response was seen in 73 3 and bacterial eradication in 53 3 Perhaps the high doses of colistin used in our study were in part responsible for this The dosage of colistin used in our study was more than double that usually recommended 9 10 12 although much higher doses with a parallel increase in nephrotoxicity have been reported in the past 23 We opted for the higher dose because of the severity of the infections being treated A recent study that reported that colistin methanosulfate is less rapidly bactericidal than is colistin in P aeruginosa 14 offers retrospective justification for the higher dosage used in our ICU It appears that peak concentrations of colistin methanosulfate 16 times the minimum inhibitory concentration or greater are required for complete in vitro killing of P aeruginosa within 24 hours 14 In the present study all patients received a lactam in addition to colistin despite documented resistance In some cases the second drug was added to act against isolated co pathogens but in most patients this addition indicated the attending physician s lack of confidence in monotherapy with colistin Although combinations of colistin with lactams are reported to be of unproven benefit 24 25 a recent study conducted in an in vitro pharmacodynamic model 28 reported synergy with ceftazidime for P aeruginosa sensitive to colistin but resistant to other antibiotics including ceftazidime Synergy with colistin has been reported for trimethoprim sulfamathoxazole co trimoxazole 27 and rifampicin 26 but no patient in our study received these antibiotics A possible drawback of the present study is the use of the disk diffusion method for testing in vitro susceptibility to colistin According to a recent study 15 this approach sometimes yields falsely susceptible results However because errors are observed mainly for S maltophilia and much less often for Acinetobacter spp it appears unlikely that the use of a different method of susceptibility testing would materially influence our findings Toxicity particularly nephrotoxicity is an important concern with colistin In the study conducted by Koch Weser and coworkers 29 impairment in renal function usually reversible with termination of treatment was observed in 20 2 of 288 patients Levin and coworkers 9 also reported a high incidence of nephrotoxicity 37 especially in patients who already had compromised renal function 9 Because most of the patients in both studies were seriously ill it is highly probable that at least part of the reported toxicity was the result not of the drug but of the disease On the other hand experience with the drug in patients with cystic fibrosis has shown only minimal nephrotoxicity 19 20 21 30 Garnacho Montero and coworkers 12 in patients with VAP observed that there was no significant difference in development of renal failure between colistin and imipenem In our study despite a dosage of colistin that was much higher than that usually reported nephrotoxicity was moderate 14 3 and it is unlikely that this had a clinically significant impact in most cases although the drug might have contributed to the poor outcome of patients under CVVHD Neurotoxicity and neuromuscular blockade were also reported with colistin in the 1960s 29 31 but more recent studies did not report clinically evident 9 30 or neurophysiologic 12 abnormalities No clinical neurotoxicity was observed in the present study Conclusion Although our findings with colistin can be considered encouraging in comparison with previous experience the small number of patients the concomitant use of lactams and the absence of a control group in the study do not allow for a clear verdict on the clinical effectiveness of colistin On the other hand the moderate incidence of complications suggests that colistin may be a relatively safe choice in patients with normal renal function at least when administered in an ICU with proper monitoring of variables that affect renal function Pending a randomized controlled trial the use of intravenous colistin should be considered in severe infections with Gram negative bacilli when it remains the only antibiotic to which the causative pathogen is sensitive in vitro Competing interests None declared Key messages Intravenous colistin is not associated with prohibitive complications in critically ill patients even when it is administered at doses higher than are usually reported Pending a definitive randomized controlled trial the use of intravenous colistin should be considered in severe infections with Gram negative bacilli when it remains the only antibiotic to which the causative pathogen is sensitive in vitro Abbreviations APACHE Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
