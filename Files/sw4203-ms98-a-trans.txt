                so John um what things in your life do you find to be invasion of privacy   oh uh lots of things salesman uh keeping records of everything thats sadistic on me i consider that to be an invasion of privacy privacy and i find that its   umhum   i guess not not to the extreme of wanting to to to drop out of society and not have credit cards and not have uh you know cars or credit credit cards or anything uh uh i deal with it but i do considered that it has its uh potential   umhum   negative side with a   um i was thinking about it you know when i was waiting waiting to talk to you and i couldnt think of any any real um anything that really bothered me in everyday life um although the thing you mention probably or probably everything about them probably would be true but um couple of things though that i did think of there where um a friend of you you your live in Georgia also so um  you know how what if you if you if you get pull over to get and you get a ticket   umhum   the um the cop will staple your the ticket to your license so you know when you go to court you will be able to get your license back um  someone point it out to me you know that a lot of cops when they pull you over will seal your um driver license to fill how many how many um staple holes are in it       yeah you know usually you know and and well you know   thats how they give you a ticket or not give you a ticket   yeah they say you know you know how weather weather weather weather you you youve been sited how you know that many time or not you know and someone pointed it out to me that you know yeah that that is really an invasion of privacy in that you know you werent necessarily convicted for any of those offenses you know   umhum well you know that uh for all we know we dont know whats on whats on their data base before all we know when actually call uh call in to check on us uh there may be a little print out says that uh arrested seven times convicted none   umhum umhum umhum   i mean there maybe maybe that kind of detail involved  he may be called upon it may uh the next   yeah thats true   the next move is to have terminals in their in their uh cars   umhum well i think some states actually have them   i know well im just saying uh universal   umhum   i mean that that and and i well i in fact actually i consider radar detection to be sort of an invasion  i think that that uh we have uh entirely to much uh   umhum   regulation i think that if you take the old philosophy of you know when you when you catch him you convict him thats a healthy philosophy then well we know that you are going to do it so were going to watch you all the time   umhum umhum yeah that presume guilt really bothers me   well the thing is that even though  even though i will probably do that even though i am guilty uh if someone uses uh uh human judgement instead of just making the rules they find out that   umhum umhum   i dont put any risk to other people in certainly not any any risk comparable to   umhum   oh lets say granny out on Sunday driving forty five and pulling into my lane when im beside her   umhum umhum   uh i could drive a hundred and ten and be safer than most of Sunday drivers on their   umhum   i mean i mean a hundred and ten relative to everybody driving fifty five thats how thats how bad of drivers are out there now that have license   umhum   its the other  uh problem of privacy i i i think uh i think that uh companys intend uh tend to have to much uh they want to know to much about you and i really think they are only right is weather or not i do my job   yeah um  you know i im im about to graduate and im still trying look for a job and you know it really offends me you know that companys most company are drug testing you know not that i have any thing to worry about but just the actual invasion of my privacy you know and that   umhum   i mean it seam like they dont they dont want want you know hire me they want to own me   that yeah that that has been the present philosophy   i mean   uh i think something that kind of bother me that this is not a privacy i dont think this is a privacy issue but im not sure   umhum   uh i dont like morals uh peoples uh i guess i should call it Southern Baptist morals       that determine whether or not someone can go to a club weather it it not that its legal or not legal anymore now its uh and i i give the the example is news club says that they just regulated by not allowing them
