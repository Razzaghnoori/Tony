 Fanciful Traces The British royal family as everyone knows by now has an image problem What better solution than to export some of their most prestigious but rarely seen images the drawings of Michelangelo for public display in the wide world Tucked away in a ground floor corner of the East Wing of the National Gallery in Washington D C are some of the finest drawings to be seen in the United States just now There are 22 by the master himself as compared with fewer than 10 in all the American collections combined and another 50 drawings by contemporaries and successors that betray his influence Fanned out in six rooms arranged like a beehive with the lights turned low to protect the fragile treasures and lend a mood of reverence to the occasion the enthralling show is called Michelangelo and His Influence Drawings from Windsor Castle Even in his own time Michelangelo 1475 1564 was recognized as having no peer in sculpture drawing or architecture Only the multitalented Leonardo da Vinci with his greater intellectual range rivals the younger Michelangelo among Renaissance artists Anyone who has seen Michelangelo s David has no need to see anything else by any other sculptor living or dead gushed his first biographer his contemporary Giorgio Vasari Vasari s account of Michelangelo s heroic labors in the Sistine Chapel has entered popular lore It s hard not to think of Charlton Heston in The Agony and the Ecstasy Alone on the high scaffold paint dripping into his upturned eyes he pushes forward with his Sisyphean task as Rex Harrison playing Michelangelo s impatient patron Pope Julius II paces angrily below Heroism seriousness monumental grandeur these are all part of the Michelangelo legend But the drawings in the National Gallery invite us to discover another Michelangelo an artist of delicacy and pictorial wit Consider the exquisite airborne Archers who while Cupid sleeps in the foreground send their errant arrows toward the target Few hit their mark and no wonder for those archers we suddenly realize aren t holding bows No one knows the meaning of this enigmatic red chalk drawing while Cupid sleeps love goes awry But the sheer joy of the image is contagious Where Archers suggests the light footed world of dreams the grotesque mask situated among the Ideal Heads in the first room its headdress borrowed it seems from the Statue of Liberty evokes an earthbound world where the human and animal realms are not easily distinguished Is this a man disguised as a lion or a lion turning into a man The bared teeth are clearly human but the feral eyes looking sharply to the side the curling upper lip and the bristling facial hair suggest a cat person ready to pounce Leonine too is Hercules performing three labors in one of the dazzling Presentation Drawings finished drawings that were given to friends and patrons in the next room As he pries open the Vulcanian jaws of the Nemean lion the hero s own lion skin disguise hovers like a halo over his back as though he can t throw off his animal identity so easily Across the same sheet Hercules fumbles with the Hydra We know he s going to lop off those serpentine heads one of which is biting him brazenly in the rear But as Michelangelo conceives him Hercules seems to be dancing with the Hydra as though he s drawing from this encounter some of the writhing erotic energy of the monster A humorless pen and ink drawing of the same subject by Raphael that appears later in the show depicts Hercules staring down the Hydra The awkward crosshatching makes one wonder why Michelangelo was so competitive not to say bitchy about his rival What Raphael had of art he wrote in a 1542 letter he had of me Raphael had been dead for 20 years Michelangelo s metamorphic wit somewhere between the nightmare transformations of his fellow Florentine Dante Alighieri and the baroque fantasies of Lorenzo Bernini is nowhere better displayed than in his famous drawing of Pha thon s fall Pha thon you ll remember wanted to drive his father s car that is Apollo s across the sky He lost control as young drivers will and Jupiter astride his eagle shot him down with a lightning bolt Intertwined with his four magnificent horses Pha thon turns his splendid body toward us one last time An image of the consequences of pride and vanity says the sober wall label Perhaps But Pha thon s fall like the cascading forms in Michelangelo s Sistine Last Judgment has its own headlong ecstasy His three anxious sisters watching from the ground below are beginning to turn into trees their punishment for their brother s hubris Michelangelo gave the drawing of Pha thon to Tommaso de Cavalieri the Roman nobleman to whom he addressed some of his most passionate sonnets Michelangelo was a gifted poet too According to your will he told Cavalieri I m hot in the harshest winter cold in the sun While Michelangelo s homosexuality has long been assumed the Victorian critic Walter Pater wrote of his vague and wayward loves there is no evidence that Cavalieri reciprocated his feelings Another drawing given to Cavalieri takes Michelangelo s transforming wit to a whole new level It depicts the giant Tityus whose punishment for raping the goddess Leto was to have his liver ripped out each day by a vulture only to have it grow back each night Michelangelo s Tityus reclines on his craggy bed of rock from which his muscular body seems to have been sculpted His punishment looks like another rape with the vulture having its way with the bound and lustful and apparently acquiescent giant A tree with an open jawed face one of Dante s damned souls perhaps screams in the background Then as if this weren t masterly enough Michelangelo did something amazing He flipped the sheet of paper over rotated it 90 degrees and traced the now upright form of Tityus The tortured giant became the risen Christ stepping from his tomb The viewer goes around and around the free standing frame to see just how Michelangelo did it And what subversive intent what wicked wit was at work here Did the artist mean to imply an erotic side of Christ a mortification of human desire rewarded by bodily resurrection No wonder Michelangelo s contemporaries were in awe of him and tried to follow his intimidating lead Exhibitions billed as showing a major artist and his influence are sometimes excuses for including inferior art to fill out an occasion While there are a few too many drawings by various accomplished hands after Michelangelo originals this show feels winnowed down and sharply focused Some of these drawings have their own distinctive flavor showing less Michelangelo s influence than his provocation Annibale Carracci s Ignudo 1597 transforms one of the languorous young male nudes of Michelangelo s Sistine ceiling into a wily satyr like character he could be Shakespeare s Mercutio Indeed the grandeur and flashing wit of the surly Florentine and the enigmatic Englishman have much in common There are the towering achievements of both the public buildings the tragedies and the unexpected delights on a smaller scale We expect to be awed by the sheer size and marmoreal magnificence of David the Sistine Chapel the dome of St Peter s in Rome These have a public purpose captured in the Irish poet William Butler Yeats lines about the best known Sistine image That girls at puberty may find The first Adam in their thought There s a different but no less intense pleasure to be derived from these miracles worked up from the meager materials of paper and chalk Never designed for public exhibition these experimental sketches and gifts for intimate friends have a distinctive power like secrets revealed or conversations overheard N B The preceding images are not
